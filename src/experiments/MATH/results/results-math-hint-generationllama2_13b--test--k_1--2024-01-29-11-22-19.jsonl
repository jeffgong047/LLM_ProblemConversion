Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have $\\angle BCA = 180^\\circ - 54^\\circ - 52^\\circ = 82^\\circ$. \nNext, we can use the fact that the altitudes of a triangle intersect at a point to find the measure of $\\angle AHB$. Since $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are the altitudes of $\\triangle ABC$, we know that $\\angle AHB = \\angle BCA$. Therefore, $\\angle AHB = 82^\\circ$. \nFinally, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of $\\angle BAC$. Since $\\angle BAC = 54^\\circ$ and $\\angle AHB = 82^\\circ$, we have $\\angle BAC = 180^\\circ - 82^\\circ = 98^\\circ$. \nTherefore, the solution to the problem is $\\angle AHB = 82^\\circ$.\n", "teacher solution:": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of triangles, particularly the properties of altitudes and angles in a triangle. Here are the steps we need to take:\n\n1. What is the value of \u2220ACB? We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can calculate \u2220ACB by subtracting the given angles \u2220BAC and \u2220ABC from 180.\n\n2. What is the value of \u2220AHB? We know that \u2220AHB is an exterior angle of \u2206HCB. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So, we can calculate \u2220AHB by adding the measures of \u2220ACB and \u2220ABC.\n\n3. What is the value of \u2220AHC? We know that \u2220AHC is an exterior angle of \u2206AHB. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So, we can calculate \u2220AHC by adding the measures of \u2220AHB and \u2220BAC.\n\n4. What is the value of \u2220BHA? We know that \u2220BHA, \u2220AHC, and \u2220AHB form a straight line, and the sum of the angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. So, we can calculate \u2220BHA by subtracting the measures of \u2220AHC and \u2220AHB from 180.\n\n5. Finally, we can conclude that \u2220AHC = \u2220BHA, because they are both equal to the same value.

Understand the sequence: The sequence is defined recursively, meaning each term depends on the previous term. We need to understand how this sequence behaves. \n\n2.

For this, we can start by computing the first few terms of the sequence. We know that $a_{i + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 - a_i}$, so we can use this formula to compute $a_2$, $a_3$, and so on. \n\nNext, we need to identify the pattern. Given that $a_3 = a_1$, we can hypothesize that the sequence repeats every two terms. We can verify this hypothesis by computing more terms of the sequence and checking if they follow this pattern.\n\nOnce we have identified the pattern, we can use it to compute $a_9$. If the sequence repeats every two terms, then $a_9$ should be equal to $a_1$.\n\nFinally, we compute $(a_9)^9$.
