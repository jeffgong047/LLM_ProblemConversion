1985: The Strategic Reserve

Problem

Cobalt, which is not produced in the U.S., is essential to a number of
industries. (Defense accounted for 17% of the cobalt production in 1979.)
Most cobalt comes from central Africa, a politically unstable region. The
Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1946 requires a cobalt
reserve that will carry the U.S. through a three-year war. The government
built up a cobalt stockpile in the 1950s, sold most of it in the early 1970s, and
then decided to build it up again in the late 1970s, with a stockpile goal of
85.4 million pounds. About half of this stockpile been acquired by 1982.

Build a mathematical model for managing a stockpile of the strategic

metal cobalt. You will need to consider such questions as:
• How big should the stockpile be?

• At what rate should it be acquired?

• What is a reasonable price to pay for the metal?

You will also want to consider such questions as:
• At what point would the stockpile be drawn down?

• At what rate should it be drawn down?

• What is a reasonable price at which to sell the metal?

• How should sold metal be allocated?

Below we give more information on the sources, cost, demand, and

recycling aspects of cobalt.

Useful Information on Cobalt

The government has projected a need of 25 million pounds of cobalt in

1985.

The U.S. has about 100 million pounds of proven cobalt deposits. Pro-
duction becomes economically feasible when the price reaches $22/lb (as
occurred in 1981). It takes four years to get operations rolling, and then six
million pounds per year can be produced.

In 1980, 1.2 million pounds of cobalt were recycled, 7% of total consump-

tion.
