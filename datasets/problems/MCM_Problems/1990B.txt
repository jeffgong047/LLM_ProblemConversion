1990: The Snowplow Problem

The solid lines of the map (see Figure 1) represent paved two-lane county
roads in a snow-removal district in Wicomico County, Maryland. The bro-
ken lines are state highways. After a snowfall, two plow-trucks are dis-
patched from a garage that is about 4 miles west of each of the two points (*)
marked on the map. Find an efﬁcient way to use two trucks to sweep snow
from the county roads. The trucks may use the state highways to access the
county roads.

Assume that the trucks neither break down nor get stuck and that the

road intersections require no special plowing techniques.

Comments by the Contest Director

Most of the Outstanding teams characterized the problem as the con-

struction of two Euler circuits with lengths as equal as possible.

The source of the problem was Kirk Banks, Roads Engineer and Head
of Wicomico County Roads Division, Salisbury, MD. He had noticed that
his crews took different times and wondered if there was a method that
was superior to their “turn right” method. The county actually uses three
snowplows, but the MCM problem statement modiﬁed this number to two
because of the greater difﬁculty in solving and judging the problem with
three plows. The MCM results show, however, that the students would have
been able to handle three plows.

The Outstanding papers were by teams from Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology, Southern Oregon State University, U.S. Air Force Academy, and
University of Alaska Fairbanks. Their papers, together with a commentary,
were published in The UMAP Journal 11 (3) (1990): 231–274.
