1988: The Drug Runner

Problem

Two listening posts 5.43 miles apart pick up a brief radio signal. The
sensing devices were oriented at 110◦ and 119◦, respectively, when the signal
was detected (see Figure 1); and they are accurate to within 2◦. The signal
came from a region of active drug exchange, and it is inferred that there is a
powerboat waiting for someone to pick up drugs. It is dusk, the weather is
calm, and there are no currents. A Small helicopter leaves a pad from Post 1
and is able to ﬂy accurately along the 110◦ angle direction. The helicopter’s
speed is three times the speed of the boat. The helicopter will be heard
when it gets within 500 ft of the boat. This helicopter has only one detection
device, a searchlight. At 200 ft, it can just illuminate a circular region with
a radius of 25 ft.

Figure 1. Geometry of the problem.

• Describe the (smallest) region where the pilot can expect to ﬁnd the wait-

ing boat.

• Develop an optimal search method for the helicopter.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by J.A. Ferling (Mathematics Dept., Clare-
mont McKenna College, Claremont, CA). It is a modiﬁed version of a clas-
siﬁed military problem. Neither the original nor the modiﬁed problem has
a known optimal solution.
