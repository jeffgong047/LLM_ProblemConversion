1985: The Animal Population

Problem

Choose a ﬁsh or mammal for which appropriate data are available to
model it accurately. Model the animal’s natural interactions with its envi-
ronment by expressing population levels of different groups in terms of the
signiﬁcant parameters of the environment. Then adjust the model to ac-
count for harvesting in a form consistent with the actual method by which
the animal is harvested. Include any outside constraints imposed by food
or space limitations that are supported by the data. Consider the value of
the various quantities involved, the number harvested, and the population
size itself, in order to devise a numerical quantity that represents the over-
all value of the harvest. Find a harvesting policy in terms of population
size and time that optimizes the value of the harvest over a long period of
time. Check that the policy optimizes this value over a realistic range of
environmental conditions.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Ervin Y. Rodin (Dept. of Systems Sci-
ence and Mathematics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The animals
chosen by the Outstanding teams were North American white-tailed deer
(Harvey Mudd College), grizzly bears in Yellowstone Park (Mt. St. Mary’s
College), salmon (Southern Methodist University), and the Peruvian an-
chovy (Washington University). The Outstanding papers were published
