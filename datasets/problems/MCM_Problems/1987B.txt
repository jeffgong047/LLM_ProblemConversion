1987: The Parking Lot Problem

The owner of a paved, 100-ft-by-200-ft, corner parking lot in a New
England town hires you to design the layout, that is, to design how the
“lines are to be painted.”

You realize that squeezing as many cars into the lot as possible leads to
right-angle parking with the cars aligned side by side. However, inexpe-
rienced drivers have difﬁculty parking their cars this way, which can give
rise to expensive insurance claims. To reduce the likelihood of damage to
parked vehicles, the owner might then have to hire expert drivers for “valet
parking.” On the other hand, most drivers seem to have little difﬁculty in
parking in one attempt if there is a large enough “turning radius” from the
access lane. Of course, the wider the access lane, the fewer cars that can be
accommodated in the lot, leading to less revenue for the parking lot owner.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Maurice D. Weir (Mathematics Dept.,

Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA).

Of the 156 papers entered in the Contest, 125 dealt with this problem.
The Outstanding papers were by teams from Calvin College and Rensse-
laer Polytechnic Institute, both of which concluded that the lot could be
designed to hold more than 75 average-sized cars. Their papers, together
with commentaries, were published as follows:

signing the optimal placement of spaces in a parking lot. The UMAP
Journal 9 (1) (1988): 13–35.

Special Issue: Mathematical Competition in Modeling. 1987. Mathematical
Modeling: An International Journal 9 (10): 765–784. This special issue
contains all four Outstanding papers.
