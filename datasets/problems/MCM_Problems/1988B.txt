1988: The Railroad Flatcar Problem

Two railroad ﬂatcars are to be loaded with seven types of packing crates.
The crates have the same width and height but varying thickness (t, in cm)
and weight (w, in kg). Table 1 gives, for each crate, the thickness, weight, and
number available. Each car has 10.2 meters of length available for packing
the crates (like slices of toast) and can carry up to 40 metric tons. There is a
special constraint on the total number of C5, C6, and C7 crates because of a
subsequent local trucking restriction: The total space (thickness) occupied
by these crates must not exceed 302.7 cm. Load the two ﬂatcars (see Figure 1
so as to minimize the wasted ﬂoor space.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was suggested by John J. Bartholdi III (School of Industrial
and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology). It is a modiﬁ-
cation of an unsolved problem that surfaced at the Ford Motor Company.

The Outstanding papers were by teams from Harvard University, Uni-
versity of California–Berkeley, University of Toronto, and the U.S. Military
Academy. Their papers, together with a commentary by problem author
Bartholdi, were published in The UMAP Journal 9 (4) (1988): 343–403.
