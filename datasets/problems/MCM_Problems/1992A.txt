1992: The Emergency Power-Restoration Problem 163

1992: The Emergency Power-

Restoration Problem

Power companies serving coastal regions must have emergency-response
systems for power outages due to storms. Such systems require the input
of data that allow the time and cost required for restoration to be estimated
and the “value” of the outage judged by objective criteria. In the past, Hy-
pothetical Electric Company (HECO) has been criticized in the media for its
lack of a prioritization scheme.

You are a consultant to HECO power company. HECO possesses a com-
puterized database with real-time access to service calls that currently re-
quire the information:

• time of report,

• type of requestor,

• estimated number of people affected, and

• location (x, y).

Crew sites are located at coordinates (0, 0) and (40, 40), where x and y
are in miles. The region serviced by HECO is within −65 < x < 65 and
−50 < y < 50. The region is largely metropolitan with an excellent road
network. Crews must return to their dispatch site only at the beginning and
end of shift. Company policy requires that no work be initiated until the
storm leaves the area, unless the facility is a commuter railroad or hospital,
which may be processed immediately if crews are available.

HECO has hired you to develop the objective criteria and schedule the
work for the storm restoration requirements listed in Table 1 using the work
force described in Table 2. Note that the ﬁrst call was received at 4:20 A.M.
and that the storm left the area at 6:00 A.M. Also note that many outages
were not reported until much later in the day.

HECO has asked for a technical report for their purposes and an “exec-
utive summary” in laymen’s terms that can be presented to the media. Fur-
ther, they would like recommendations for the future. To determine your
prioritized scheduling system, you will have to make additional assump-
tions. Detail those assumptions. In the future, you may desire additional
data. If so, detail the information desired.

Table 2.

Crew descriptions.

• Dispatch locations at (0, 0) and (40, 40).

• Crews consist of three trained workers.

• Crews report to the dispatch location only at the beginning and end of their shifts.

• One crew is scheduled for duty at all times on jobs assigned to each dispatch
location. These crews would normally be performing routine assignments. Until
the “storm leaves the area,” they can be dispatched for “emergencies” only.

• Crews work 8-hr shifts.

• There are six crew teams available at each location.

• Crews can work only one overtime shift in a work day and receive time-and-a-half

for overtime.
