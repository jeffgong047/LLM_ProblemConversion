1989: The Aircraft Queueing

Problem

A common procedure at airports is to assign aircraft (A/C) to runways
on a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-served basis. That is, as soon as an A/C is ready to
leave the gate (“push back”), the pilot calls ground control and is added to
the queue. Suppose that a control tower has access to a fast online database
with the following information for each A/C:

• the time it is scheduled for pushback;

• the time it actually pushes back;

• the number of passengers on board;

• the number of passengers who are scheduled to make a connection at the

next stop, as well as the time to make that connection; and

• the schedule time of arrival at its next stop.

Assume that there are seven types of A/C with passenger capacities
varying from 100 to 400 in steps of 50. Develop and analyze a mathematical
model that takes into account both the travelers’ and airlines’ satisfaction.

The Outstanding papers were by teams from Drake University, Harvey
Mudd College, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Ohio
State University, and University of Dayton. Their papers, together with
commentaries, were published in The UMAP Journal 10 (4) (1989): 343–415.
