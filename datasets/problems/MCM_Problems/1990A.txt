1990: The Brain-Drug
Problem

Researchers on brain disorders test the effects of the new medical drugs—
for example, dopamine against Parkinson’s disease—with intracerebral in-
jections. To this end, they must estimate the size and the shape of the spatial
distribution of the drug after the injection, in order to estimate accurately
the region of the brain that the drug has affected.

The research data consist of the measurements of the amounts of drug
in each of 50 cylindrical tissue samples (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Each
cylinder has length 0.76 mm and diameter 0.66 mm. The centers of the
parallel cylinders lie on a grid with mesh 1 mm × 0.76 mm × 1 mm, so that
the cylinders touch one another on their circular bases but not along their
sides, as shown in the accompanying ﬁgure. The injection was made near
the center of the cylinder with the highest scintillation count. Naturally, one
expects that there is drug also between the cylinders and outside the region
covered by the samples.

Estimate the distribution in the region affected by the drug.
One unit represents a scintillation count, or 4.753 ×10−13 mole of dopa-
mine. For example, the table shows that the middle rear cylinder contains
28,353 units.

Comments by the Contest Director

This problem was contributed by Yves Nievergelt (Mathematics Dept.,
Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA). His commentary (p. 135) ex-
plains the origin and motivation for the problem. The only adaptation from
the applied situation to the MCM problem statement was a slight simpli-
ﬁcation of the real-world data. The Outstanding papers provided impetus
for another study of the data for Seattle’s Regional Primate Research Center
in the autumn of 1993.
