1991: The Steiner Tree
Problem

The cost for a communication line between two stations is proportional
to the length of the line. The cost for conventional minimal spanning trees
of a set of stations can often be cut by introducing “phantom” stations and
then constructing a new Steiner tree. This device allows costs to be cut by up
to 13.4% (= 1 −
3/2). Moreover, a network with n stations never requires
more than n − 2 points to construct the cheapest Steiner tree. Two simple
cases are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Two simple cases of forming the shortest Steiner tree for a network.

For local networks, it often is necessary to use rectilinear or “checker-
board” distances, instead of straight Euclidean lines. Distances in this metric
are computed as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Comparison of distances using straight Euclidean line distances (ab = 13, bc = 7, ac =
14; cost = 20) vs. using rectilinear distances (cost = 17).

Suppose you wish to design a minimum cost spanning tree for a local

network with 9 stations. Their rectangular coordinates are:

a(0, 15),

b(5, 20),

c(16, 24),

d(20, 20),

e(33, 25),

f (23, 11),

g(35, 7),

h(25, 0),

i(10, 3).

Tools for Teaching 1994

You are restricted to using rectilinear lines. Moreover, all “phantom” sta-
tions must be located at lattice points (i.e., the coordinates must be integers).
The cost for each line is its length.

1. Find a minimal cost tree for the network.

2. Suppose each station has a cost d3/2w, where d = degree of the station. If

w = 1.2, ﬁnd a minimal cost tree.

3. Try to generalize this problem.

Comments by the Contest Director

I (Ben Fusaro) contributed this problem; I got the idea from an article by

Barry Cipra [1991].
