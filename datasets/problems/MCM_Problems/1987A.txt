1987: The Salt Storage
Problem

For approximately 15 years, a Midwestern state has stored salt used on
roads in the winter in circular domes. Figure 1 shows how salt has been
stored in the past. The salt is brought into and removed from the domes by
driving front-end loaders up ramps of salt leading into the domes. The salt
is piled 25 to 30 ft high, using the buckets on the front-end loaders.

Recently, a panel determined that this practice is unsafe. If the front-end
loader gets too close to the edge of the salt pile, the salt might shift, and the
loader could be thrown against the retaining walls that reinforce the dome.
The panel recommended that if the salt is to be piled with the use of loaders,
then the piles should be restricted to a maximum height of 15 ft.

Construct a mathematical model for this situation and ﬁnd a recom-

mended maximum height for salt in the domes.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Maynard Thompson (Mathematics
Dept., University of Indiana, Bloomington, IN), and Indiana is the state re-
ferred to. Only 31 of 156 papers tackled this problem, which is analytically
more difﬁcult than the other 1987 problem. The two Outstanding teams,
from the University of Colorado and Moorhead State University (MN), al-
lowed a safe piling to (at least) 21 ft—a considerable increase over the panel’s
recommendation of 15 ft—resulting in 40% more capacity for salt.
