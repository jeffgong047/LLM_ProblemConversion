1986: The Hydrographic Data

Problem

The table below gives the depth Z of water in feet for surface points
with rectangular coordinates X, Y in yards. The depth measurements were
taken at low tide. Your ship has a draft of ﬁve feet. What region should you
avoid within the rectangle (75, 200) × (−50, 150)?

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Richard Franke (Dept. of Mathematics,
Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA). His paper [1982] compares 34
approaches to this problem.

Two points on the suggested outline for papers received scant attention:
testing and (especially) stability. In particular, none of the papers questioned
how the depth data—all depths were given in exact numbers of feet—were
arrived at: rounding down? truncation? rounding up?

Although the concept of stability (conditioning, robustness, sensitivity,
well-posed, etc.) was introduced by the great Jacques Hadamard in 1923, it
seems to have difﬁculty establishing itself in the undergraduate mathematics
curriculum.
