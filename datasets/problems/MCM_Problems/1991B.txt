1991: The Water Tank Problem

Some state water-right agencies require from communities data on the
rate of water use, in gallons per hour, and the total amount of water used
each day. Many communities do not have equipment to measure the ﬂow of
water in or out of the municipal tank. Instead, they can measure only the level
of water in the tank, within 0.5% accuracy, every hour. More importantly,
whenever the level in the tank drops below some minimum level L, a pump
ﬁlls the tank up to the maximum level, H; however, there is no measurement
of the pump ﬂow, either. Thus, one cannot readily relate the level in the tank
to the amount of water used while the pump is working, which occurs once
or twice per day, for a couple of hours each time.

Estimate the ﬂow out of the tank f (t) at all times, even when the pump
is working, and estimate the total amount of water used during the day.
Table 1 gives real data, from an actual small town, for one day.

The table gives the time, in seconds, since the ﬁrst measurement, and
the level of water in the tank, in hundredths of a foot. For example, after
3316 seconds, the depth of water in the tank reached 31.10 feet. The tank is
a vertical circular cylinder, with a height of 40 feet and a diameter of 57 feet.
Usually, the pump starts ﬁlling the tank when the level drops to about 27.00
feet, and the pump stops when the level rises back to about 35.50 feet.

Water-tank levels over a single day for a small town. Time is in seconds and level is in 0.01 ft.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Yves Nievergelt (Mathematics Dept.,
Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA). It is based on data from a
consulting problem for Union, a town of 11,500 in northeastern Oregon.
The Outstanding papers inspired immediate applications at the consulting
ﬁrm, Equipment Technology and Design.

The Outstanding papers were by teams from Hiram College, Ripon Col-
lege, and University of Alaska Fairbanks. Their papers, together with com-
mentaries, were published in The UMAP Journal 12 (3) (1991): 201–241.
