1993: The Optimal Composting

Problem

An environmentally conscious institutional cafeteria is recycling cus-
tomers’ uneaten food into compost by means of microorganisms. Each day,
the cafeteria blends the leftover food into a slurry, mixes the slurry with crisp
salad wastes from the kitchen and a small amount of shredded newspaper,
and feeds the resulting mixture to a culture of fungi and soil bacteria, which
digest slurry, greens, and paper into usable compost. The crisp greens pro-
vide pockets of oxygen for the fungi culture, and the paper absorbs excess
humidity. At times, however, the fungi culture appears unable or unwill-
ing to digest as much of the leftovers as customers leave; the cafeteria does
not blame the chef for the fungi culture’s lack of appetite. Also, the cafe-
teria has received offers for the purchase of large quantities of its compost.
Therefore, the cafeteria is investigating ways to increase its production of
compost. Since it cannot yet afford to build a new composting facility, the
cafeteria seeks methods to accelerate the fungi culture’s activity, for instance,
by optimizing the fungi culture’s environment (currently held at about 120◦
F and 100% humidity), or by optimizing the composition of the mixture fed
to the fungi culture, or both.

Determine whether any relation exists between the proportions of slurry,
greens, and paper in the mixture fed to the fungi culture, and the rate at
which the fungi culture composts the mixture. If no relation exists, state so.
Otherwise, determine what proportions would accelerate the fungi culture’s
activity.

In addition to the technical report following the format prescribed in the
contest instructions, provide a one-page nontechnical recommendation for
implementation for the cafeteria manager.

Table 1 shows the composition of various mixtures in pounds of each
ingredient kept in separate bins, and the time that it took the fungi culture to
compost the mixtures, from the date fed to the date completely composted.

Comments by the Contest Director

The problem was contributed by Yves Nievergelt (Mathematics Dept.,
Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA), based on a situation and data
at the cafeteria of the Washington State penitentiaries in Medical Lake, WA.
The Outstanding papers were by teams from University of California–
Berkeley Dept. of Statistics and Nazareth College of Rochester. Their papers,
together with commentaries, were published in The UMAP Journal 14 (3)
(1993): 201–228.
