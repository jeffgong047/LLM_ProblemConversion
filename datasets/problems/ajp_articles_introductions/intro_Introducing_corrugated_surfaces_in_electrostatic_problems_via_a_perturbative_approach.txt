In electromagnetism courses, students often solve Poisson’s equation for a point charge in the
presence of an inﬁnitely large perfectly conducting planar surface, usually by the method of
images. However, no surface is perfectly ﬂat; so at some level, corrugations must be introduced
to model the real world. Clinton et al. [ P h y s .R e v .B 31, 7540 (1985)] solved the problem,
including corrugations, using a perturbative calculation of the corresponding Green’s function.
We provide a detailed pedagogical review of this calculation and extend it in order to solve for
the electrostatic potential of a corrugated neutral conducting cylinder in the presence of auniform electric ﬁeld. These calculations can be used as pedagogical examples of this
perturbative approach in electromagnetism courses.

I. INTRODUCTION
At some scale, even smooth surfaces have corrugations
that will affect their interactions. As an example, consider acharge in the vicinity of a surface.1,2The image potential,
which arises from the induced charge distribution, is impor-tant for the formation of image potential states, which arequantum states of electrons localized at the surface of mate-rials with negative electron afﬁnity.
2The behavior of these
electrons can reveal important physical and chemical surfaceproperties.3,4Prior to 1980, the majority of the investigations
of image potential effects assumed that the interfaces
between two media were planar,2but the image potential is
modiﬁed when the surface has deformations.1,4
Perturbative expansions are often employed in electro-
magnetism courses in the context of multipolar expan-sions.5–7In 1985, using a perturbative approach to solve
Poisson’s equation, Clinton et al. calculated the image poten-
tial for a point charge in vacuum in the presence of a per-fectly conducting corrugated surface.8Recently, this
perturbative approach was also used to obtain the electron–electron interaction in a 2D system in the presence of a cor-rugated dielectric medium
9and to investigate the van der
Waals interaction between an anisotropic polarizable particleand a nonplanar surface.10–12
In the present paper, we pedagogically review the calcula-
tions of Clinton et al. , aiming to popularize their results. We
pay special attention to the case of a sinusoidal surface,showing how the potential, electric ﬁeld, and induced surfacecharge density are affected by the corrugated surface. Wealso present an original contribution, extending this perturba-tive approach to solve Laplace’s equation for the electro-static potential of a corrugated neutral conducting cylinder ina uniform electric ﬁeld. (Without corrugation, this is anothervery common exercise in electromagnetism courses.) Thisproblem is considerably simpler than that discussed inRef. 8, making it a useful example to employ when teaching
students about corrugated surfaces in electromagnetismcourses.This paper is organized as follows: In Sec.
