Equipped with a home-made astrolabe and Kepler’s laws, one can arrive at accurate estimates of
the orbits of planets. Over the past three years, I have used an astrolabe to collect sightings ofcelestial bodies visible from my backyard. This paper shows that it is possible to measure one’s
latitude and longitude, the current time, locations of celestial bodies, and the sizes of the orbits of
nearby planets. When the astrolabe is used to collect both daytime and nighttime observationsof Venus, one can also demonstrate that Venus orbits the Sun.

I. INTRODUCTION
Even living in the midst of city lights, you can still see
some of the brightest stars and planets with the naked eye.
Over a span of two or three years, you can watch the planetsmove across the sky against the background stars.Surprisingly, with basic observations of these objects and asimple tool called an astrolabe you can tell the time, ﬁnd
compass directions, determine the season, and determine the
diameter of planetary orbits.
1,2The astrolabe is based on a
stereographic projection of the stars, in which they are pro-jected onto a plane that rotates around the celestial poles.
Astrolabes have been made since antiquity, and you can
make your own.3–6
In the hands of a skilled navigator, an astrolabe was often
the tool of choice, yielding elevation sightings accurate tobetter than a degree.7–10Additionally, the best source of time
until the 20th century had been obtained from the rotation of
the Earth, which can be measured by tracking the movements
of stars. There is also ample evidence that astrolabes wereused for teaching astronomy.11It is, therefore, natural to ask
if one can use an astrolabe to measure the solar system.
Over the past three years, I have used an astrolabe to col-
lect sightings of celestial bodies visible from my backyard,
hoping to learn what could be measured. My astrolabe fol-lows a design popular in medieval England and which isdescribed by the famous poet Geoffrey Chaucer in hisTreatise on the Astrolabe
12in a letter to his son.13As shown
in this article, the level of accuracy obtained by an astrolabe
is sufﬁcient to measure planetary orbits if one uses the mod-ern expedient of statistical analysis. Moreover, one can sup-plement nighttime observations of Venus with daytimeobservations aided by binoculars. Astrolabe measurements
of these combined sightings suggest that Venus orbits the
Sun.
The design of my astrolabe is explored in Sec.
