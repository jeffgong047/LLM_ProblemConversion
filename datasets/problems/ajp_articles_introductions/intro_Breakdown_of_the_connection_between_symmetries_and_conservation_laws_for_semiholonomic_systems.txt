Integrable velocity-dependent constraints are said to be semiholonomic. For good reasons,
holonomic and semiholonomic constraints are thought to be indistinguishable in Lagrangian
mechanics. This well-founded belief notwithstanding, here we show by means of an exampleand a broad analysis that the connection between symmetries and conservation laws, which
holds for holonomic systems, is not valid in general for systems subject to semiholonomic
constraints.

I. INTRODUCTION
The connection between symmetries and conservation
laws is fundamental not only in classical mechanics1but
also in quantum mechanics2and quantum ﬁeld theories.3In
classical mechanics, Noether’s theorem4establishes the
most general correspondence between invariance under con-
tinuous transformations and constants of the motion. The
conservation of linear momentum, angular momentum, andenergy for many-particle systems is associated with invari-ance of the action under translations, rotations, and time
displacements, respectively.
1,5,6This connection generalizes
toholonomically constrained systems as long as the
Lagrangian andthe constraints are invariant under the men-
tioned transformations.7Integrable velocity-dependent con-
straints seem, for all intents and purposes, to be equivalentto holonomic constraints because, in their integrated form,
they impose restrictions on the coordinates alone. The goal
of this note is to show, by means of an example and a gen-eral analysis, that integrable velocity-dependent constraints
are not equivalent to holonomic constraints as far as the con-
nection between symmetries and conservation laws isconcerned.
