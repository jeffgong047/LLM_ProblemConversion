The Clausius–Clapeyron relation and its analogs in other ﬁrst-order phase transitions, such as type-
I superconductors, are derived using very elementary methods without appealing to the more
advanced concepts of entropy or Gibbs free energy. The reasoning is based on Kelvin’sformulation of the second law of thermodynamics and should be accessible to high school students.
After recalling some basic facts about the Carnot cycle, we present two very different systems that
undergo discontinuous phase transitions (ice/water and normal/superconductor) and constructengines that exploit the properties of these systems to produce work. In each case, we show that if
the transition temperature T
trwas independent of other parameters, such as pressure or magnetic
ﬁeld, it would be possible to violate Kelvin’s principle, i.e., to construct a perpetuum mobile of thesecond kind. Since the proposed cyclic processes can be realized reversibly in the limit of
inﬁnitesimal changes in temperature, their efﬁciencies must be equal to that of an ordinary Carnot
cycle. We immediately obtain an equation of the form dT=dX¼fðT;XÞ, which governs how the
transition temperature changes with the parameter X.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1844, Lord Kelvin studied a cyclic process based on the
water–ice phase transition and concluded that a perpetuum
mobile of the second kind would be possible, unless the
melting temperature of ice varied with pressure.1This varia-
tion is described quantitatively by the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation. Usually, it is derived by relying on the continuity
of the Gibbs free energy (or, more precisely, the chemical
potential) between the two phases (see Appendix A ). In this
work, we show how to derive the Clausius–Clapeyron equa-
tion and its analogs in other ﬁrst order phase transitions by
constructing reversible cycles operating between two very
close temperatures.
First, let us brieﬂy recall some basic facts about the second
law of thermodynamics. In Kelvin’s formulation, it reads, “Itis impossible to devise an engine which, working in a cycle,
shall produce no effect other than the extraction of heat from
a reservoir and performance of an equal amount of mechani-
cal work.”2In other words, it is impossible to construct a
heat engine that would have 100% efﬁciency, deﬁned as the
ratio of the work done to the heat absorbed. Furthermore,
this implies that of all possible engines operating betweentwo heat reservoirs at different ﬁxed temperatures, the ones
operating reversibly have the highest efﬁciency. This is
shown by making the reduction ad absurdum argument pre-
sented below: If there were a cycle more efﬁcient than the
reversible one, one could construct a cycle violating the sec-ond law of thermodynamics.

Consider the composite cyclic process shown in Fig. 1,
which consists of two separate cycles (represented by
hatched circles), which we will also call engines; the upper
one is reversible, and the lower one is a hypothetical cycle
that is more efﬁcient than the ﬁrst. Vertical lines marked T1
andT2represent two heat reservoirs at the indicated tempera-
tures, and lines with arrows represent transfers of heat orwork in the directions indicated by the arrows. Both of these
engines extract heat Q1from the left reservoir at temperature
T1. Assume that the upper (reversible) cycle releases heat Q2
to the right reservoir at temperature T2(T2<T1) and per-
forms an amount of work W¼Q1/C0Q2. Since the lower
cycle is more efﬁcient, it releases heat Q2/C0DWand per-
forms work WþDW(DW>0). If this were possible, the
upper (reversible) engine could be run in the opposite direc-
tion to extract the same heat Q2from the reservoir at T2,
using an amount of work Wdrawn from the work WþDW
performed by the lower engine (Fig. 2). The overall result
would then be a net amount of heat DWtaken from the reser-
voir at T2converted entirely into positive work DW, in con-
tradiction to Kelvin’s assertion.
From the reasoning summarized in Figs. 1and2, it also
follows that allreversible cycles working between the same
two reservoirs must have the same efﬁciency, and that theirefﬁciency depends only on the two reservoir temperaturesand nothing else. This efﬁciency is shown in any textbook
2
to be given by the following Carnot formula:
g¼1/C0Qout
Qin¼1/C0T2
T1¼T1/C0T2
T1: (1)
Note that the efﬁciency of a reversible cycle decreases to
zero (no work can be obtained) in the limit T2!T1. This
result will be the main tool in the analyses presented in theremaining part of this paper.
