Footprints provide a way to estimate the relative impact of processes and products on the global
climate. Including footprint analysis in a course on energy simultaneously provides students with
an understanding of this tool and a quantitative guide to approaches that address climate change.College-level classroom activities for (primarily) process-based life cycle carbon footprinting are
discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Whether enrolled in an upper-level statistical mechanics
or an introductory course on energy, students are keen to
learn ways we can address climate change. Footprinting is aquantitative method that can guide reductions of anthropo-
genic greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, I share a
“nugget,” as described in the prompt for the special collec-tions on the physics of the environment, sustainability, and
climate change: A brief description of classroom activities
on footprinting to which the students responded favorably.
