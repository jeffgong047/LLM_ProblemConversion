The canonical equation for self-inductance involving magnetic ﬂux is examined, and a more
general form is presented that can be applied to continuous current distributions. We attempt to
clarify and extend the use of the standard equation by recasting it in its more versatile form. #2023

I. INTRODUCTION
Self-inductance is typically calculated in reference to the
total current Iof some circuital conﬁguration and to the mag-
netic ﬂux Uthrough a relevant surface that the current
bounds

I: (1)
Generally, the current may be ﬁlamentary (i.e., it follows a
singular contour) or distributed over a surface or in a vol-ume. The magnetic ﬂux through an area d~r,
dU¼~B~rðÞ/C1d~r; (2)
involves the magnetic ﬁeld that is created by the current distri-
bution. The simplest, in principle , application of Eq. (1)is that
of a single circular current loop (see Appendix A ). In cases in
which the current is not ﬁlamentary, but rather is distributedacross a surface or within a volume, the surface of integration
associated with the application of Eq. (1)becomes unclear, espe-
cially to students ﬁrst introduced to magnetostatics. The simplestexample of this case is the solenoid, but it is nearly alwaystreated as a ﬁlamentary current bounding an effective area sothat Eq. (1)is readily applicable (see Sec.
