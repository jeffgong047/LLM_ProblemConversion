We solve analytically the differential equations for a skier on a hemispherical hill and for a particle
on a loop-the-loop track when the hill or track is endowed with a coefﬁcient of kinetic friction l.
For each problem, we determine the exact “phase diagram” in the two-dimensional parameter
plane.#2022 All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC

I. INTRODUCTION
Two classic homework exercises in an elementary
mechanics course are the skier on a hemispherical hill(Fig. 1) and the particle on a loop-the-loop track (Fig. 2).1
Both problems illustrate nicely the use of conservation of
energy (to ﬁnd the speed as a function of height) followed by
F¼ma(to ﬁnd the normal force).
It is interesting to consider what happens when the hill or
track is endowed with a coefﬁcient of kinetic friction l.
Somewhat surprisingly, the exact differential equations turnout to be analytically solvable.2–11Our purpose here is to
provide a uniﬁed treatment of the two problems, using onlyelementary methods that are easily accessible to undergradu-ates (e.g., linear ﬁrst-order differential equations). Thoughmost of our results have been obtained previously—as we
shall document in detail—they are somewhat scattered in the
literature. It may thus be of some modest value to have acomplete elementary derivation collected in one place.
The skier and loop-the-loop problems give rise to very
similar differential equations, which differ only by somesign changes. However, these sign changes lead to signiﬁcantdifferences in the qualitative interpretation of the solutions.Since the skier problem turns out to be somewhat simpler,
we treat it ﬁrst and give a complete solution; in particular,
we determine the exact phase diagram in the two-dimensional parameter plane. For the loop-the-loop, wesolve the differential equations only up to the ﬁrst time (ifany) that the particle halts or completes one cycle of theloop, so we obtain only a partial phase diagram. The fullphase diagram will (as we explain later) contain an inﬁnite
sequence of bifurcations, and we leave its computation to a
reader who wishes to take up where we have left off.
