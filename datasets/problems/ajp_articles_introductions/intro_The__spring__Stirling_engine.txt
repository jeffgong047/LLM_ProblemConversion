I. INTRODUCTION
In a previous paper published in this journal, we devel-
oped an alternative approach for the Stirling cycle thatachieved theoretical results, which showed better agreementwith experimental data than the usual textbook approach.
1
Using expressions developed in that work and inspired by atoy Stirling engine known as the “marble” engine, we pro-pose here a new theoretical Stirling engine.
2This engine,
which we call the spring engine, possesses the same essentialphysics as the marble engine but can be analyzed with stan-
dard analytic techniques.
