We demonstrate the ability of a simple algorithm based on the venerable method of images
(MOIs), to accurately model the detailed frequency response of a multidimensional, rectangular,
lossy resonant cavity. The convergence properties of the model’s inﬁnite series solution are shown
to be determined by the cavity’s quality factor Q. A 1D example demonstrates that the MOI series
converges to the exact solution. Next, a comparison to precisely measure 2D cavity data conﬁrms
that a straightforward extension of the 1D algorithm to multiple dimensions provides accurate
results. The algorithm is short, easily understandable by undergraduate students and relativelyundemanding to code. An example using
VRMATHEMATICA is provided. #2023 Published under an exclusive

I. INTRODUCTION
Midway through their sophomore year, our physics majors
are introduced to the rigors and the joys of experimental sci-
ence by a required and quite difﬁcult lab course. Having just
completed a one-term lecture course introducing the analyses
of oscillations, waves, and normal modes (albeit mostly in
one dimension), they now learn how to collect and analyze
frequency and energy spectra generated by a variety of phe-
nomena. These experiences during lab provide students witha useful working knowledge of several subjects later covered
in detail by upper division lecture courses.
One of the lab course’s more popular experiments
involves the determination of the dispersion relation of
sound waves in air by observing and analyzing the normal
mode frequencies of a small acoustic cavity. Figure 1is a
photo of the apparatus, and Fig. 2shows a high-resolution
measurement of the cavity’s frequency response. The
expected normal mode wave numbers are calculated from
the rectangular cavity’s measured dimensions, and these are
matched with the corresponding peaks in its measured fre-quency response. The rectangular cavity has thick acrylic
side walls and a thinner top surface. Its bottom surface is
provided by the sturdy aluminum base plate upon which it
rests. The source sound transducer (speaker) is mounted in a
side wall near the cavity’s bottom right corner in the photo.The response transducer (microphone) is mounted beneath
the center of the base plate. (The small opening for this trans-
ducer is visible in the base plate just to the left of center of
the cavity’s upper side wall.) Moving the cavity around on
the base plate changes the relative position of the responsetransducer within it.
The data plotted in Fig. 2consist of (response transducer)/
(source transducer) signal voltage amplitude ratios (gains)
measured at 2070 frequencies with the transducers posi-
tioned near diagonally opposite corners of the cavity. As
expected, the frequency response peaks correspond to the
cavity’s normal modes. If air is nondispersive, then these fre-
quencies should be proportional to the cavity’s normal modewave numbers. A proportional, least-squares ﬁt of the
observed peaks’ frequencies to their corresponding normalmode wave numbers (calculated from the measured cavitydimensions, assuming that the cavity is rectangular) was per-formed by optimizing its slope, i.e., the average phase veloc-ity of sound in air over the measured frequency range. Theﬁt result was quite consistent with the hypothesis that air isnondispersive over this frequency range. The dashed verticallines in Fig. 2show predicted cavity resonant frequencies
calculated from the mode wave numbers and the best ﬁtslope.

The accuracy and large dynamic range of the experiment’s
data acquisition system enable it to provide a wealth ofdetails in the measured gain and phase responses of the cav-ity. It should come as no surprise that the cavity’s frequencyresponse peaks at nearly every normal mode, because, given

angular acrylic box is approximately 152 mm /C2114 mm /C232 mm. The
metal plate serves as the cavity’s bottom boundary, and the small hole at the
plate’s center marks the position of the sound pressure response transducer
(a microphone). Its ampliﬁed signal is displayed on the computer monitor as
the experimenter moves the box around on the base plate, mapping out the
mode’s nodal line structure. The selected normal mode corresponds the cav-
ity’s third resonance, near 1 :9 kHz.

its construction, the quality factor Qof the cavity’s resonan-
ces should be on the order of 100. What might be surprising,
on the other hand, is the rich structure evident in the response
at intermediate frequencies. Interestingly, between severalpairs of resonant frequencies, the response drops sharply byas much as two orders of magnitude, a seemingly resonant-
like behavior for which the transducer positions correspond
to nodes rather than antinodes. Between other peaks, how-ever, the response gently falls and rises. This variation in
behavior piques the interest of many of our more sophisti-
cated students as well as our TAs, and we devote the remain-der of this text to model the driven response of the cavity asa function of frequency.
