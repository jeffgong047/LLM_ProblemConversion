Search processes are ubiquitous in physical and biological phenomena, often involving the random
motion of molecules. In particular, transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene
expression and need to ﬁnd their DNA targets quickly—which is difﬁcult to achieve with random
motion alone. Nature came up with a remarkable solution known as facilitated diffusion,combining 1D diffusion along the DNA and “excursions” of diffusion in 3D that help the TF to
quickly arrive at distant parts of the DNA. In this paper, we show that this process can be analyzed
naturally using the concept of conditional probability, providing an alternative intuition to theeffectiveness of this mechanism.

I. MOTIVATION
Elchanan Mossel’s Dice paradox1poses a simple probabil-
ity question that gives rise to neat and non-intuitive results.The paradox is phrased as follows:2
You roll a fair six-sided die until you get 6. What
is the expected number of rolls, if we consider
only those series of rolls in which each roll in theseries is an even number?
It is a common mistake to think that the answer is 3 based
on the following logic: if the possible outcomes are either 2,4 or 6 and we wish to get a 6 then the number of rolls followsa geometric distribution with a parameter of 1/3.
Alas, this “solution” overlooks the conditioning present in
the formulation of the paradox that should lead us to makeuse of a fundamental concept in probability theory, condi-
tional probability. All rolls are still possible, but the condi-
tioning on rolling only even numbers makes us eliminate a
series from our statistics as soon as an odd number is rolled.
The basic concept of conditional probability is summarizedby the following equation:
PAjBðÞ ¼
PA\BðÞ
PBðÞ: (1)
In Eq. (1),PðAjBÞmeans the probability that Aoccurs,
given that Bhas occurred, and PðA\BÞis the probability
that both AandBoccur. As mentioned, the answer of 3 is
wrong due to improperly taking into account the condi-tioning. We can perform the correct calculation using Eq.(1).I n s t e a do f Awe’ll have X
iwhich stands for the proba-
bility of getting a 6 on the ith roll, so that PðXiÞ¼1=6.
The event Bwill occur whenever a series has only even
numbers (2s and 4s) before the ﬁrst 6. P(B) will allow us
to calculate the fraction of series that qualify for consider-
ation because they meet the condition. First, we’ll calcu-latePðX

: (2)P(B), the fraction of all possible series that qualify for con-
sideration, is simply the sum of PðXi\BÞover all possible
values of i,

We can now use Eqs. (1)–(3) to calculate the expected num-
ber of rolls

which is quite different than what was naively expected. The
origin for this difference is that once we properly take the
conditioning into account we essentially eliminate all longsequences since they have vanishingly small probability for
not including odd numbers. This difference could be empha-
sized by, for example, a 1,000-sided die. For such a die, thenaive calculation will produce a result of E½N/C138¼500 while
for the correct calculation E½N/C138¼1000 =501/C252. In
Appendix C , we provide some code to help the reader build
intuition for this result.
Next, we will describe an important biological process
known as “facilitated diffusion,” which, intriguingly, is
related to the concept of conditioned probability. In fact, wewill see that this mechanism shares several key properties
with the “paradox” discussed above.
