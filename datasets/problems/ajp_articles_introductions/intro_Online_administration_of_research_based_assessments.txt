I. INTRODUCTION
Research-based assessments (RBAs; e.g., the Force
Concept Inventory) that measure student content knowledge,attitudes, or identities have played a major role in transform-ing physics teaching practices. RBAs offer instructors a stan-dardized method for empirically investigating the efﬁcacy oftheir instructional practices and documenting the impacts ofcourse transformations. Unlike course exams, the commonusage of standardized RBAs across institutions uniquely sup-ports instructors to compare their student outcomes overtime or against multi-institutional data sets. While the num-ber of RBAs and RBA-using instructors has increased overthe last three decades, barriers to administering RBAs keepmany physics instructors from using them.
1,2To mitigate
these barriers, we have created full-service online RBA plat-forms (i.e., the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes[LASSO],
3Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science
Survey for Experimental Physics [E-CLASS],4and Physics
Lab Inventory of Critical thinking [PLIC]5platforms) that
host, administer, score, and analyze RBAs. These web-basedplatforms can make it easier for instructors to use RBAs,
especially as many courses have been forced to transition to
online instruction.
We hope that this editorial can serve as a guide for instruc-
tors considering administering RBAs online. In what fol-
lows, we examine common barriers to using RBAs, how
online administration can remove those barriers, and the
research into online administration of RBAs. In the supple-
mentary material,6we also include a practical how-to for
administering RBAs online and sample student email
wording.
