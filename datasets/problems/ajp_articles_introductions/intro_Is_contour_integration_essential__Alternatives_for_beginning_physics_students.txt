The standard method to evaluate many deﬁnite integrals that are encountered in physics is contour
integration. Here, we show how these can be evaluated by other means, enlarging the toolbox availableto students and enabling the discussion of physical problems where these integrals arise before contour
integration is introduced.

I. INTRODUCTION
Contour integration is the default technique to solve many
deﬁnite integrals for which the range of integration is thereal line or an interval over which the integrand is periodic.Once this technique is taught to students, they are able toapply it without difﬁculty, since the steps are similar for allproblems. Deﬁnite integrals which may otherwise seemimpossible to evaluate can be solved using contour integra-
tion. These deﬁnite integrals are most frequently encountered
in quantum mechanics and electromagnetism.
Here, we show that many integrals that one encounters in
physics, for which contour integration is the standardmethod, can be evaluated using other methods as well. Thisenables topics involving these integrals to be taught beforecontour integration is encountered, providing greater ﬂexibil-ity in the classroom. We focus on those that are relevant forphysics applications, although we show that some other inte-grals and inﬁnite series can also be tackled. The integrals dis-cussed here include all the standard examples worked out intextbooks
1,2when contour integration is taught.
