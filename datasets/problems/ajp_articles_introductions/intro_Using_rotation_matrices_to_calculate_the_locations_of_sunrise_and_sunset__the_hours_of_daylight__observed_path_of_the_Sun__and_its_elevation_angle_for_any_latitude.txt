During the course of one year, I photographed 95 sunrises along the east bank of the Columbia River
from my home on the west bank in Richland, WA (46.3/C14N latitude). I then calculated the seasonal
phenomena listed in the title with the intention of explaining the variation of the photographed sunrises.The calculations use a simpliﬁed model of the Sun-Earth system and employ rotation matrices to
predict the path of the Sun, as observed at any location in the northern hemisphere, throughout the year.
These predictions are in good agreement with those listed by NOAA and also with the photographicdata. The analysis presented here provides a novel way to calculate and understand the seasonal
variations of visible sunlight.

I. INTRODUCTION
Several years ago, I began a retirement project by taking
daily photographs of sunrises visible from my home on theColumbia River in Richland, WA, during an entire year.Figure 1shows a sample of those photographs taken in
September and October 2018. The photos and their analysis
were published in Ref. 1. More recently,
2the changing num-
ber of daylight hours and the elevation of the Sun at noonwere studied using geometric diagrams.
Other authors treat the same phenomena. The text by
Meeus
3discusses corrections to the basic theory due to
small effects, such as the refraction of sunlight in the
Earth’s atmosphere, that affect the number of daylight
hours. References 4and 5are popular texts for amateur
astronomers. Levine6used vector analysis to understand theduration of daylight and the position of the rising and set-
ting Sun.
In contrast to the above treatments, this paper studies the
apparent motion of the Sun by employing rotation matrices .
