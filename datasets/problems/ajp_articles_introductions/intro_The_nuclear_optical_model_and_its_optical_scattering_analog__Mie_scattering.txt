The methods devised by Gustav Mie in 1908 to explain the scattering of electromagnetic waves
have a close analogy with quantum-mechanical models developed many years later to describenuclear scattering. In particular, these models use either a complex index of refraction or a
complex nuclear scattering potential to account for attenuation caused by non-elastic scattering.
We brieﬂy outline the historical development of these models and give examples illustrating theclose analogy between them, their parameters, and the resulting scattering. In both models, the
ratio of the incident wavelength to the object size, k/D, can be determined from the scattering
characteristics, allowing the extraction of microscopic particle dimensions. This close analogyallows students to simulate accelerator-based nuclear scattering experiments with table-top optical-
scattering experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electromagnetic, atomic, and nuclear scattering are major
tools in modern physics research,1–6but they are often only
brieﬂy covered in undergraduate curricula. This paperreveals important similarities between two models of scatter-
ing on very different length scales: the Mie optical-scattering
model and the nuclear optical model. The historical develop-ment of these models is outlined along with some of theirimportant applications. We show the close analogy between
the models and, in particular, that the Mie optical-scattering
model, with only a complex index of refraction togetherwith a suitable choice of the ratio of wavelength to objectsize, k/D, can also model nuclear scattering and enable
extraction of realistic nuclear dimensions. This analogy
provides insight into the nuclear optical model and its param-eters as well as many other scattering processes over a widerange of dimensions.
Gustav Mie’s model was published in 1908 and success-
fully reproduced the scattering of light from gold particlesembedded in a colloidal suspension.
1Such scattering produ-
ces a spectrum of colors depending on the angle of observa-
tion and includes as a special case Rayleigh scattering,
where the size, i.e., diameter D, of the scattering objects ismuch smaller than the incident wavelength, typically by afactor of ten or more.
3,4For example, the Rayleigh scattering
of sunlight from air molecules produces the blue overhead
sky on Earth. In contrast to Earth, scattered sunlight on theplanet Mars is mainly caused by scattering from dust par-ticles in the Martian sky, given that there is little gaseous
atmosphere on Mars and, hence, there is little Rayleigh scat-
tering. In this case, Mie scattering with k/C28Dfavors scat-
tering of the red part of sunlight at large angles, so theoverhead sky appears red, and sunsets appear blue on Mars
(Fig. 1). These planetary examples illustrate the importance
of the ratio k/D in determining important characteristics of
optical scattering, which we show is also true for nuclearscattering.
