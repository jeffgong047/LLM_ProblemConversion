Three-dimensional learning (3DL) is an approach to science instruction that was developed for K-12
science education and that can provide guidance for improving undergraduate physics laboratories. In
this paper, we describe efforts to comprehensively integrate 3DL into a sequence of undergraduate
introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) laboratory courses. This paper is tailored forintroductory physics faculty interested in advancing their course’s learning goals by simultaneously
engaging students in experimental practices, scientiﬁc reasoning, and conceptual knowledge. We ﬁrst
review how several well-known laboratory curricula are already implicitly aligned with 3DL. We
then describe our IPLS course sequence and show how each 3DL dimension—science and
engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts—is integrated throughout
the curriculum. To support implementation, we provide samples of our course documentation, adetailed account of our 3DL integration efforts, a guide to training and supporting teaching and
learning assistants in a 3DL course, and a sample set of activities to guide students in participating in
3DL instruction in the supplementary material.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many undergraduate physics laboratory courses have under-
gone reforms to improve student engagement in scientiﬁc rea-
soning, critical thinking, and scientiﬁc practices.1These
reforms have stemmed from ongoing calls to transition labora-
tory courses away from rote, conﬁrmatory curricula focused onreinforcing lecture content and toward more authentic labora-tory experiences that engage students in experimental practices
and scientiﬁc reasoning (e.g., Ref. 2). While these efforts have
produced valuable results for students and instructors, develop-ing coherence and interconnectedness among the three dimen-
sions of science learning—scientiﬁc concepts, experimental
practices, and reasoning tools
3—is a challenge. Students
should have opportunities to consistently engage with these
three dimensions of scientiﬁc learning in laboratory course set-tings, as they jointly prepare students to “think like a physicist”and develop authentic scientiﬁc expertise.
4Laboratory courses
remain a unique educational environment, where students canconsistently interact with and learn about experimental practi-
ces, scientiﬁc concepts, and reasoning processes in ways not
possible in other learning environments such as lecture halls or
recitation sections. To provide these opportunities to students
in ways that produce tangible change in student learning andengagement, it is important to implement explicit pedagogical
scaffolds into physics laboratory curricula that build intercon-nectedness and coherence among experimental practices, con-ceptual material, and scientiﬁc reasoning.
We present an introductory physics for life sciences
(IPLS) laboratory course sequence integrating the three-dimensional learning (3DL) framework into its existinglaboratory curriculum. The 3DL framework is a conceptual
framework from K-12 science education that is explicitly
designed to coherently support students’ scientiﬁc inquirythrough integration of scientiﬁc practices, concepts, andmodes of reasoning.
3Composed of disciplinary core ideas
(DCIs), science and engineering practices (SEPs), and cross-
cutting concepts (CCCs), 3DL is designed to promote stu-
dents’ active learning of overarching core scientiﬁc ideas
(DCIs) by engaging students with scientiﬁc practices (SEPs)and reasoning tools (CCCs) within interesting or relevantscientiﬁc contexts (see Ref. 5and our supplementary mate-
rial
6for additional references and resources that describe
3DL). A crucial feature of the 3DL framework is emphasis
on student engagement with all 3DL dimensions coherently
to build new knowledge and experience jointly, rather than
focusing on each individually. Tables Iand
