Simple models for Earth’s climate sensitivity (i.e. its temperature response to radiative forcing) are
developed by combining the time-tested idealization of one-dimensional radiative-convectiveequilibrium (RCE) with simple yet quantitatively reasonable models for CO
2forcing and the water
vapor feedback. Along the way, we introduce key paradigms including the emission level
approximation, the forcing-feedback decomposition of climate sensitivity, and “Simpson’s law” forwater vapor thermal emission. We also discuss climate feedbacks unaccounted for in this RCE
framework, as well as differing variants of climate sensitivity, all of which may be ripe for their
own chalkboard treatments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), or the long-
term global-mean surface temperature change due to a dou-
bling of CO 2, is arguably the most central quantity in climate
science. First studied by Arrhenius in 1896,1ECS sets the
overall magnitude and, thus, the severity of global warmingand remains a topic of intense interest to the present day.
2
The consensus value of ECS has remained close to 3 K for
decades, thr oughout many su ccessive generations of model
intercomparisons and literature reviews, most notably theassessment reports from the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC).
3These assessments have been based
largely on calculations with numerical models of increasingcomplexity, along with observations and paleoclimate recon-
structions. However, the ﬁrst credible estimate of ECS, given
by Manabe and Wetherald
4in 1967 as 2–3 K, used a highly
simpliﬁed one-dimensional representation of the climate sys-tem known as radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE; we refer
to this paper hereafter as MW67). This model for Earth’s cli-mate makes some drastic simpliﬁcations, such as representingthe atmosphere in terms of a single, global average column, butthen treats other aspects of the climate system in detail, such asthe frequency-dependent greenhouse gas radiative transfer ofboth water vapor (H
2O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). These
approximations, and insight they facilitated, have proved
remarkably durable, and were recognized with Manabe’s
receipt of part of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics.5
The simplicity of Manabe’s RCE approach and the robust-
ness of the 3 K value for ECS suggest that much of the phys-ics of ECS might actually be understood using a handful ofbasic physical principles, rather than lying hidden behind theintractable complexity of the climate system. Indeed, recentresearch has shown that essential topics, such as CO
2radia-
tive forcing6and the H 2O feedback,7can be described to a
reasonable approximation with simpliﬁed models amenableto analytic description. Taken together, such models allow
for an analytic estimate of ECS, at least within the simpliﬁed
context of RCE. A self-contained formulation of such anestimate is a primary goal of this paper.

The utility of such an estimate and the motivations for
documenting it here are many-fold. The most obvious moti-vation is for classroom teaching. Current texts in climatescience at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate
level, such as the excellent books by Hartmann
9and
Pierrehumbert,10treat the fundamentals extremely well and
use them to build intuition but then tend to jump to empiricalobservations and numerical simulations to describe real-
world phenomena. This is often the best that can be done,
but reasonably quantitative chalkboard estimates (where pos-sible) help ﬁll this gap between fundamental theory and
empirical observation. Such back-of-the-envelope reasoning
is also helpful for everyday practitioners trying to understandand debug the behavior of complex climate models.
11The
analytical approach taken here might also appeal more natu-
rally to physicists, providing them a more suitable entry
point for understanding or perhaps even contributing to cli-mate science.
However, there are also more profound reasons for pursu-
ing a simpliﬁed understanding of ECS and climate science
more broadly.
12Simple models of the kind developed here
embody our understanding of the subject at its most basic
level. This philosophy is well known to physicists in the
guise of Fermi problems and the Feynman lectures. Giventhe societal importance of climate change, as well as linger-ing skepticism about it in some quarters, a chalkboard expla-
nation of ECS, even if only approximate, seems essential for
demonstrating the depth of our understanding.
Given this motivation, we develop an estimate of ECS in
the simpliﬁed framework of RCE pioneered by Manabe. We
begin by establishing the paradigm of radiative-convective
equilibrium as well as the forcing-feedback framework. Wethen turn to simple models of the greenhouse effect for bothCO
2and H 2O, which lead to analytical descriptions of both
CO 2forcing and the water vapor feedback. These ingredients
are then combined, via the forcing-feedback framework, toyield an analytical estimate of ECS. We will ﬁnd that this
estimate is around 2 K, within the range found by MW67 but
somewhat smaller than the consensus value of 3 K. This dis-crepancy is due to the approximations inherent in the RCE
approach, which neglects clouds and changes in absorbed
solar radiation. We then discuss these phenomena and theprospects for capturing their effects via principled estimates.We close by introducing other metrics of climate sensitivity
that account for ocean heat uptake and the carbon cycle, and
for which a chalkboard understanding might also be useful.

For classroom instruction, this material might be consid-
ered a unit of perhaps eight lectures at the advanced under-
graduate or beginning graduate level for either physics
students or students of atmospheric and climate science.Suggestions for exercises are sprinkled throughout the main
text and the endnotes.
