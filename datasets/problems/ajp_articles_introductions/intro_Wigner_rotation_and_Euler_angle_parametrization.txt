Analogous to the famous Euler angle parametrization in three-dimensional Euclidean space, a
reﬂection-free Lorentz transformation in (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski space can be decomposed
into three simple parts. Applying this decomposition to the Wigner rotation problem, we are able to
show that the related mathematics becomes much simpler and the physical meanings more
comprehensible and enlightening. VC2023 Author(s). All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed

I. INTRODUCTION
First discovered by Silberstein, then rediscovered by
Thomas,1,2the phenomenon that two successive non-parallel
boosts (i.e., Lorentz transformations that contain neither
rotation nor reﬂection) lead to a boost and a rotation is gener-
ally called the Wigner rotation.3It has been studied by many
authors for almost a century,4–9yet the conclusion is still
“paradoxical” for most people. “The spatial rotation resulting
from the successive application of two non-parallel Lorentz
transformations has been declared every bit as paradoxical asthe more frequently discussed apparent violations of com-
mon sense, such as the so-called ‘twin paradox’…” said
Goldstein in his classic work Classical Mechanics .10
To explain how the puzzlement arises, we start with the
classical counterpart of a boost transformation, the so-called
Galilean transformation between two inertial frames withrelative velocity ~V¼½V
x;Vy;Vz/C138,
x0¼x/C0Vxt;
y0¼y/C0Vyt;
z0¼z/C0Vzt;
t0¼t: (1)
From a geometrical point of view, the ﬁrst three lines of Eq.
(1)constitute a time-dependent passive translation. It
implies that a Galilean transformation follows the rules of a
three-dimensional translation, e.g., the composition of two
translations leads to another one, and this net translation
does not depend on the order in which the original two areundertaken. Being the relativistic version of Galilean trans-
formation, a boost is often believed to possess this same
property.
As a matter of fact, relativistic boosts do not commute
unless their directions are parallel, i.e., their composition is
order-dependent in general. Moreover, as mentioned earlier,
the composition of two non-parallel boosts is not a single
boost, but a boost along with a rotation. This is quite
counter-intuitive since the rotation seems to emerge out ofnowhere from the three-dimensional point of view. Getting
to the bottom of the matter, it is inappropriate to analogize
boost to translation since the former is essentially a sort ofrotation (or more precisely a pseudo-rotation) in four-
dimensional spacetime. Therefore, the Wigner rotation may
be regarded as a geometric problem that involves both rota-tion and pseudo-rotation, and the mathematical complexity
is enough to cloud those subtle physical meanings.If the mathematics could be substantially simpliﬁed, we
believe the physical meanings of the Wigner rotation would
become clear, and people would ﬁnd this phenomenon is notso counter-intuitive as usually thought. To achieve this goal,we develop a formulation analogous to the Euler angle
parametrization of SO(3), i.e., decomposing a reﬂection-free
Lorentz transformation in (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski
space into a product of two rotations and one pseudo-rotation (Sec.
