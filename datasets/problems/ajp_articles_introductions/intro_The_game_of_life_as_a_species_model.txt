Conway’s classic game of life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton in which each cell is alive
or dead and evolves according to simple rules that depend solely on the number of live cells in its
immediate neighborhood. The emergence of complex multi-cellular objects provides a fascinatingvehicle for exploration. A variant of the classic game of life is presented, the generalized semi-
classical game of life, in which each cell contains a qubit that evolves by repeated application of
birth, death, and survival operators. Species are characterized by just two parameters: a preferredneighborhood liveness representing the tendency to herd and a resilience parameter representing
species’ vulnerability to environmental changes. This generalized model provides the opportunity
to model the fortune of species and to compare to available data. The model is shown to mimicenvironmental catastrophes and is illustrated by the model’s prediction of a return to the pre-
hunting level of the global whale population by 2140. A student-designed predator–prey model is
shown to qualitatively describe the fate of strongly- and weakly coupled predator–prey systems(snowshoe hare/lynx and rabbit/fox, respectively) and sudden and slow predatory impact (dodo and
diprotodon, respectively).

I. INTRODUCTION
Conway’s classic game of life was developed in the late
1960s and became the most popular cellular automaton inhistory.1–3Each cell of a two-dimensional matrix is either 1
(alive) or 0 (dead) and may change value at each time step
according to a set of simple evolutionary rules that depend
solely on the number of live cells in the eight cells of itsimmediate neighborhood, known as the Moore neighbor-hood.
4The rules dictate for each cell whether a birth (0 !1),
death (1 !0), or survival (0 !0;1!1) event takes place.
Conway’s rules are designed to mimic the evolution of a
society of organisms in which fortunes are based on the localenvironment. If the number of live cells in the neighborhoodis too high or too low, the cell dies due to overcrowding or
loneliness, but ﬂourishes if the surrounding liveness is opti-
mum. Repeated application of the evolutionary rules to eachcell at each time step (called a generation) can lead to anextraordinary myriad of complex patterns of live and deadcells.
5,6Flammenkamp has catalogued 100 static and
dynamic objects referred to as “ash,” but which are moreoptimistically referred to as “lifeforms.” These objects sup-ply a fascinating example of the development of complexity
through simple evolutionary rules.
Conway’s original game of life has been the subject of
many studies with most of the works published in prominentphysics journals. Common themes include statistics and statis-tical mechanics,
7,8nonlinear dynamics,9and critical behav-
ior.8,10There have been numerous adaptations of Conway’soriginal game, including the introduction of a thermodynamic
variable,7a three-dimensional version,11extension to Turing
machines,12modiﬁcation to a continuous space,13and proba-
bilistic adaptations.14
Of interest here is the quantization of Conway’s game
introduced and developed by Flitney and Abbott where eachlive-or-dead cell is replaced by a qubit.15–17The underlying
principles of Conway’s original game are retained with amodiﬁed set of evolutionary rules in which qubits evolve via
the application of birth, death, and survival operators. The
game’s creators termed the game “semi-quantum” becausesystems do not evolve time-reversibly. An educational illus-tration of the qubit is provided by L /C19opez-Incera and D €ur.

The quantization of the game of life moves the game
toward biological applications. The emerging discipline ofquantum biology studies the evolution of quantum objectsinﬂuenced by the local environment. General quantumaspects of life are discussed in Ref. 19. The semi-quantum
game of life has a parallel in quantum biology where a qubit
may represent an exciton produced by a photon in a proteincomplex during photosynthesis.
20The exciton interacts with
its environment to inﬂuence the energy transfer dynamics.21
A simpliﬁed version of the semi-quantum game of life has
been introduced in which the cell qubit components arerestricted to real numbers. This classical variant is denotedas the semi-classical game of life (SCGOL) to distinguish it
from the semi-quantum game of life and Conway’s classic
game. Intriguing new phenomena were discovered duringstudent project work, including chaotic effects and new

lifeforms composed of live cells, dead cells and part-live
cells, plus objects that mimic seeds.22
Cellular automata, such as the SCGOL, are ideal for
undergraduate projects that are designed to extend computa-
tional skills to matrix-based programming languages such as
MATLAB .23Moore neighborhood calculations and application
of boundary conditions are nontrivial problems that can beefﬁciently coded. Graphical presentation is well developed
and quickly mastered by students. Once the fundamental
rules are implemented, a wide range of different physicalphenomena can be explored. Mathematical game-based cel-lular automata have been shown to be effective at educatingstudents in the emergence of complexity

In the following, we generalize the SCGOL model to
model the evolution of a species by choosing two ﬂexiblychosen parameters: one representing the tendency of a spe-cies to herd and a resilience parameter representing vulnera-
bility to environmental changes. Section
