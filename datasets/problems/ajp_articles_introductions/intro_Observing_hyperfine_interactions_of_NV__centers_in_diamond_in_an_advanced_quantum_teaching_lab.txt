Articles in this section deal with new ideas and techniques for instructional laboratory experiments, for
demonstrations, and for equipment that can be used in either. Although these facets of instruction alsoappear in regular articles, this section is for papers that primarily focus on equipment, materials, and
how they are used in instruction. Manuscripts should be submitted using the web-based system that can
be accessed via the American Journal of Physics home page, ajp.aapt.org, and will be forwarded to theIL&D editor for consideration.

The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV/C0) center in diamond is a model quantum system for
university teaching labs due to its room-temperature compatibility and cost-effective operation. Based on
the low-cost experimental setup that we have developed and described for the coherent control of the
electronic spin [Sewani et al. , Am. J. Phys. 88, 1156–1169 (2020)], we introduce and explain here a
number of more advanced experiments that probe the electron–nuclear interaction between the NV/C0
electronic and the14Na n d13C nuclear spins. Optically detected magnetic resonance, Rabi oscillations,
Ramsey fringe experiments, and Hahn echo sequences are implemented to demonstrate how the nuclearspins interact with the electron spins. Most experiments only require 15 min of measurement time and,
therefore, can be completed within one teaching lab.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent progress in the ﬁeld of quantum technolo-
gies—quantum computing, quantum communications, and
quantum sensors—has led to considerable commercial inter-
est from entities like the semiconductor industry, softwarecompanies, and consulting ﬁrms. Quantum technologies arepredicted to constitute a /C24$10 billion market within the next
decade,
2and the high demand for quantum-specialists, as
reﬂected by the high number of current job advertisements,3
corroborates this prediction. Universities need to cater to thisneed and provide their graduates with a thorough under-standing of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics,including experimental experience in how to perform quan-tum measurements and interpret results. However, theseskills are difﬁcult to convey in a university teaching lab, due
to the sensitivity of quantum systems to environmental dis-
turbances and the high cost of specialized measurementequipment.
As discussed amply in literature, the nitrogen vacancy
(NV
/C0) center in diamond possesses an electronic spin that
can be initialized and read out optically. It displays micro-second coherence times at room temperature in ambient con-ditions.
4This makes the NV/C0center a model system for
high-school or university teaching labs to perform magne-
tometry5–7and coherent spin control experiments.1,7–10
Based on the same low-cost experimental setup that we have
developed in Ref. 1, in combination with an off-the-shelf,
commercially available, high-quality chemical vapor deposi-tion (CVD) diamond sample from Element Six, we expand
