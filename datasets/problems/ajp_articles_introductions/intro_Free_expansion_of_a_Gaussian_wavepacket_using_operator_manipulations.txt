The free expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket is a problem commonly discussed in undergraduate
quantum classes by directly solving the time-dependent Schr €odinger equation as a differential
equation. In this work, we provide an alternative way to calculate the free expansion byrecognizing that the Gaussian wavepacket can be thought of as the ground state of a harmonic
oscillator with its frequency adjusted to give the initial width of the Gaussian, and the time
evolution, given by the free-particle Hamiltonian, being the same as the application of a time-dependent squeezing operator to the harmonic oscillator ground state. Operator manipulations
alone (including the Hadamard lemma and the exponential disentangling identity) then allow us to
directly solve the problem. As quantum instruction evolves to include more quantum informationscience applications, reworking this well-known problem using a squeezing formalism will help
students develop intuition for how squeezed states are used in quantum sensing.

I. INTRODUCTION
A common example of time evolution taught in quantum
mechanics classes—in fact, in many cases, the ﬁrst examplethat is considered—is the free expansion of a Gaussianwavepacket starting from a state with variance rand zero
average momentum, which is in the following wavepacket att¼0

It is then solved by transforming from position to momentum
space, time evolving in momentum space, and then trans-forming back to position space. These Fourier transformationintegrals are elementary to do, because they are in aGaussian form and Gaussians integrate to Gaussians.
However, the analysis is fairly technical and does not pro-
vide great physical intuition as to what is happening (asidefrom the notion that because we have a spread in momentum,this means that components of the wavepacket move in posi-tion space at different rates and hence the position-spacewavepacket spreads in time).
In this work, we present a different methodology to solve
this problem based on the modern concept of squeezing.Squeezing is a phenomenon whereby a quantum state main-
tains a minimum uncertainty product, but the uncertainties in
position and momentum oscillate in time, with each individ-ual uncertainty becoming very small at some moment oftime and the other uncertainty becoming very small at a latertime. Squeezing is often discussed within the context of asimple harmonic oscillator. Here, the squeezing operatorlooks similar to the exponentiation of the Hamiltonian itself,but with different coefﬁcients in front of the individual
terms. The application to the free-expansion of a Gaussian
comes from the facts that the ground state of a harmonicoscillator is also a Gaussian, and the free time-evolutionoperator is a squeezing operator (for the harmonic oscillatorsystem). Hence, the time evolution of a Gaussian can be
solved by simply applying a squeezing operator to the har-
monic oscillator ground state!
Squeezed states can be difﬁcult to understand. One way to
physically picture them is via a quantum quench. If a systemis in a harmonic oscillator energy eigenstate with an initialfrequency x
i, and then suddenly the frequency changes to
xf, then we would expect the initially steady state to evolve
over time. This subsequent time evolution is one way tothink of the behavior of a squeezed state. Unlike a coherentstate, which preserves its shape as it evolves in time, the
squeezed state changes its shape as it evolves, periodically
changing from a squeezed state, with smaller variance inposition space, to an expanded state, with a larger variancein position space. The period of the shape oscillations is onehalf the period of the new oscillator. If, the quench goes all
the way to x
f¼0, then we will no longer have periodic
motion. Instead, the Gaussian will simply expand forever asa function of time. This is precisely the scenario for the freeexpansion of a Gaussian that we consider here.
We have surveyed 25 different undergraduate textbooks to
see whether they cover the free-expansion of a Gaussian
wavepacket and where this material appears relative to dis-cussions of the operator-based solution of the simple har-monic oscillator. We also looked at whether these textbooksdiscuss coherent states and squeezed states. The results are
summarized in Table I. Clearly, none of these texts are ideal
for using the material presented here—supplemental materialwill be required for all of them.
For undergraduate classes that employ these textbooks,
the methodology we discuss ﬁts in best with a course orga-
nized so that the abstract operator method is used to solve
the harmonic oscillator problem before a discussion of the
spreading Gaussian wavepacket. However, because all ofthese textbooks have inadequate resources for these topics,
extra instruction on squeezed states of the harmonic oscilla-
tor is required. Since quantum mechanics classes are likelyto change the material they cover to be more aligned with

quantum information science, we anticipate many more clas-
ses will provide coverage of coherent and squeezed statesand be well positioned to discuss the material we develophere in the near future. Indeed, we ﬁnd from our textbooksurvey that more recent books are more likely to covercoherent and squeezed states, supporting this trend.
The pedagogical literature has also discussed the free
expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket extensively, but we arenot aware of any physics education research work on thissqueezed states approach. Our discussion of previous peda-
gogical work will not be exhaustive here. Much of the previ-
ous work is interested in the question of whether and howthe wavepacket expands,
1,2how its shape evolves over
time,3–5and whether a power-series expansion to the time-
evolution operator converges.2Some papers discuss alterna-
tive methodologies to compute the evolving wavepacket.6,7
We are aware of three works that discuss this problem in
relationship to squeezed states of the simple harmonic oscil-lator.8–10Unlike this previous work, our work emphasizes
the operator approach to squeezed states.
The ground-state wavefunction of a simple harmonic
oscillator, with mass mand frequency xis given by
wgsðxÞ¼h xj0i¼mx
p/C22h/C18/C19 1

e/C0mxx2=2/C22h: (2)
Here, j0iis the ground state of the simple harmonic oscilla-
tor, and jxiis the position eigenstate at the location x. The
variance r2of the initial Gaussian is set by choosing
x¼/C22h=2mr2. Next, we can use a displacement operator to
displace the Gaussian in both position space and momentumspace. The displacement by x0and p0, respectively, is
given by
^Dðx0;y0Þ¼e/C0i
/C22hðx0^p/C0p0^xÞ; (3)
where ^xand ^pare the operators of position and momentum,
which satisfy the canonical commutation relation ½^x;^p/C138¼i/C22h.
The displaced Gaussian state can then be represented by
jwgs;x0;p0i¼ ^Dðx0;p0Þj0i; (4)
our choice for writing the wavepacket in this fashion ﬁxes its
initial global phase.
The free-particle evolves according to the free
Hamiltonian, given by ^Hfree¼^p2=2m, so the time evolution
of the initial Gaussian state becomes
jwgsðtÞ;x0;p0i¼e/C0i
/C22h^Hfreet^Dðx0;p0Þj0i; (5)
and the spreading Gaussian wavefunction evolves according
to time via
wgsðx;t;x0;p0Þ¼h xje/C0i
/C22h^Hfreet^Dðx0;p0Þj0i: (6)
It turns out that this is in the form of a squeezed and dis-
placed simple harmonic oscillator state, which can be seen
most easily when we express the position and momentumoperators in terms of the ladder operators of the simple har-monic oscillator.
The raising and lowering operators for a simple harmonic
oscillator are given byTable I. Summary of different topics, as presented in 25 undergraduate quantum mechanics textbooks. The X indicates that the topic is covered in the co rre-
sponding textbook.
