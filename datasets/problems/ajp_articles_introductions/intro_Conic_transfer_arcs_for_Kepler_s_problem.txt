A fundamental problem in spacecraft mission design is to ﬁnd free-ﬂight paths from one place to
another that satisfy various design criteria. We explore the geometry of free-ﬂight paths between
departure and arrival points for Kepler’s problem. Newton showed that these paths are conic arcs.
We ﬁnd the parameters for all conic paths between a departure and an arrival point as a function ofone key variable called the inside angle. Once the paths are written in terms of this single
parameter, then it is straightforward to ﬁnd the path that takes a speciﬁed travel time (the Lambert
problem) or to perform other optimizations such as minimizing the fuel costs.https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0080491
I. INTRODUCTION
We aim to solve boundary value problems for Newton’s
inverse square central force gravitational model. We ﬁrst
ﬁnd the conic parameters ðp;e;xÞfor all conic arcs between
departure and arrival points. Finding these parameters is
complicated.
