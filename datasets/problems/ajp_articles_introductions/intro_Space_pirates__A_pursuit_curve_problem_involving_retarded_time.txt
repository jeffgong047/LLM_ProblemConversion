We revisit the classical pursuit curve problem solved by Pierre Bouguer in the 18th century, taking
into account that information propagates at a ﬁnite speed. The discussion of this generalizedproblem of pursuit constitutes an excellent opportunity to introduce the concept of retarded time
without the complications inherent to the study of electromagnetic radiation (where it is usually
seen for the ﬁrst time). We ﬁnd the differential equation, which describes the problem, solve it
numerically, compare the solution to Bouguer’s for different values of the parameters, and deduce
a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the pursuer to catch the pursued.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1732, French mathematician, geophysicist, and hydrog-
rapher Pierre Bouguer posed and solved a problem, which isnowadays regarded as the beginning of modern mathemati-
cal pursuit analysis.1The problem consisted of ﬁnding the
functional form of the curve described by a pirate ship in
pursuit of a merchant vessel, subject to the conditions that
both move at constant speeds and, at any given time, the
velocity vector of the pirate ship points in the direction of
the merchant vessel position at that time. This situation isillustrated in Fig. 1(Sec.
