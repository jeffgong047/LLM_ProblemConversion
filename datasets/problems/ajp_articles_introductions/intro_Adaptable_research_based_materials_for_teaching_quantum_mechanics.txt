We have developed a complete collection of freely available instructional materials to assist
faculty in creating a student-centered quantum mechanics (QM) class that engages students while
supporting them in developing both sense-making and calculational skills. Our materials are
grounded in research on students’ understanding of quantum mechanics and are intended to beadaptable to a variety of instructional settings and faculty styles or preferences. They were
designed for a spins-ﬁrst instructional paradigm and include a set of learning goals, concept
(“clicker”) questions, pre-lecture surveys, and homework and exam questions, along with examplelecture notes from three instructors at three different institutions. In this work, we describe what
active learning can look like in the upper-division as well as describe each of the instructional tools
and provide a few representative examples. We also discuss how these materials are used at eachof our institutions, illustrating how they may be adapted for use at different institutions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum mechanics (QM) stands at the core of much of
modern physics and constitutes an essential foundation for
both the skill set and identity of many physics faculty and stu-dents. A middle-division undergraduate course on the funda-
mentals of quantum mechanics can be a highly sought-after
teaching assignment. At the same time, quantum mechanicshas a reputation amongst many students, supported in part bypopular media, of being an arcane, abstract, unintuitive, and
difﬁcult topic. It is not hard to ﬁnd quotations from famous
physicists that support this reputation: “…Those who are notshocked when they ﬁrst come across quantum theory cannot
possibly have understood it” (N. Bohr) or “I think I can safely
say that nobody understands quantum mechanics” (R.Feynman). As a result, students may enter a quantum classwith a mix of excitement and trepidation.
Given the importance of the topic for students’ develop-
ment, the teaching and learning of undergraduate quantum
has been the subject of a growing amount of physics educa-tion research. (Note: We have compiled a set of additional
references 1for the interested reader in the supplementary
material, including many links to helpful quantum coursematerials.) The bulk of PER research has focused on studentdifﬁculties with individual topics, identifying challenges and
common ideas (including those that may be incorrect and
counterproductive, or correct and useful
2,3), and has pro-
vided curricular materials or other pedagogical tools.4–9
Particular attention has been paid to the transition from clas-sical to quantum ideas, representations,10and mathematical
tools.11,12There are also studies of sociocultural aspects
related to the attitudes and concerns of students13and a vari-
ety of approaches to teaching quantum mechanics.
Our group conducts research in student learning of quantum
mechanics in large and small classes across a diverse set ofinstitutions. We have developed a set of learning goals for
quantum mechanics instruction in collaboration with manyfaculty; we have probed student learning and difﬁculties in
QM in different instructional paradigms; and we have con-
ducted research on student understanding of a variety of topicsrelated to those learning goals.
14,15Part of our intent was to
develop a set of accessible and ﬂexible materials that are easy
for faculty to use and modify in a diverse range of institutions.
The primary goal of this paper is to introduce an assort-
ment of freely available, readily adaptable teaching materialsbased on research ﬁndings. We also provide guidance to helpfaculty determine how to introduce such teaching materialsand practices into their classes. Note that we are not present-
ing a particular course or curriculum, nor do we prescribe
teaching methods. In our experience, the teaching of quan-tum mechanics is personal and highly dependent on theneeds, interest and background of the instructor and students.
Instead of prescribing what and/or how faculty should teach,
our aim is to share a broad and easily modiﬁed set of materi-als to support faculty who want to make research-based mod-iﬁcations to their teaching.
These resources
16were developed based on research into
student learning using an iterative design process. While our
materials have been ﬁeld-tested in our classrooms, many
have not yet been extensively tested for student learninggains. The adaptable and modular design provides ﬂexibilityfor instructors to make minor modiﬁcations or substantial
changes to their teaching. While this allows for different
implementations based on the needs of individual institutionsand instructors, it makes validation of student learning gainsin all environments virtually impossible. However, all ourmaterials promote student engagement with the content, and
we have seen the potential for them to be powerful learning
tools.
