The crane operator’s trick and other shenanigans with a
pendulum
Stephan Schlamminger, Leon Chao, Vincent Lee, David
B. Newell, and Clive C. Speake
90(3), p. 169
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006965Next time you want to control the oscillations of a pendu-
lum, you might want to call a crane operator for help: they
are experts in juggling swinging loads that are being trans-
ferred from one point to another. Using the Laplace trans-form formalism, this paper exposes their trick to damp the
load’s oscillations and shows how it can be applied to
improve metrological measurements of the gravitational con-stant. The paper can be useful in undergraduate mechanics
class or as an example of the use of Laplace transform for
system control, but you’ll also want to read it just to learnabout this example of physics in action. The link above will
also take the reader to the article’s video abstract, which
includes simulations that provide an excellent introduction to
the work.
Gravitational orbits and the Lambert problem
Ian R. Gatland
90(3), p. 177
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0060998The Lambert problem requires ﬁnding an orbit that passes
through two points in a speciﬁed time interval. It was posed
and solved by Lambert in the 18th century (long before it
was needed for spaceﬂight!), but the solution can still bechallenging for undergraduates. This paper presents an
insightful iterative method that could be presented in an
introductory mechanics course.
A new microscopic look into pressure fields and local
buoyancy
S. Meneses Jo ~ao, J. P. Santos Pires, and J. M. Viana
Parente Lopes
90(3), p. 179
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0060479Local pressure ﬁelds are integral to understanding buoy-
ancy, atmospheric phenomena, and other systems, but stan-
dard statistical mechanics approaches only derive the globalthermodynamic pressure from the microscopic description of
the system. In this article, the authors present a way to obtain
the local pressure ﬁeld as a derivative of the system’s parti-tion function using a soft-wall barometer potential. The
approach has both a formal mathematical description as well
as an intuitive physical explanation. Teachers of advancedundergraduate or graduate statistical mechanics may ﬁnd this
inspiring material for projects or problem sets.
Multivalued specific heat
Matheus G. Pacheco, Reinaldo de Melo e Souza, and
Daniela Szilard
90(3), p. 187
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006899Speciﬁc heats are usually assumed to be constant in ther-
modynamic processes for sake of simplicity. But becausethey are actually temperature dependent, they must also be
path dependent, and for processes that are tangent to an iso-
therm this creates difﬁculty because DQ/DT is not deﬁned; itis then necessary to invoke multivalued speciﬁc heat func-tions. This paper explores the conditions any path mustsatisfy in order to possess a single-valued speciﬁc heat. As a
bonus, the authors use thermodynamic concepts to prove a
geometric theorem regarding the areas of triangles and trape-zoids bounded by hyperbolas. Appropriate for undergraduatethermodynamics classes.
General formalism for calculating the thermal efficiency
of thermodynamic cycles defined in a p-Vdiagram
Viktor K €onye and J /C19ozsef Cserti
90(3), p. 194
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064010Calculating the efﬁciency of a thermal engine is often
tricky for students. Plus, it is not usually fun. This papershows that this is not inevitable. Starting from the parametri-zation of the engine’s cycle in the pressure-volume diagram,and knowing the ﬂuid’s equation of state, the authors show
that one can easily (numerically) calculate the amount of
heat given to or released by the system, and hence determinethe corresponding efﬁciency. They showcase their methodon cute-looking cycles, although it can also be applied topractical engines. Appropriate for undergraduate thermody-
namics classes.
Progressive quantum collapse
William J. Mullin, Asaad R. Sakhel, and Robert J. Ragan
90(3), p. 200
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009255Instantaneous collapse of a wave function to one of its
eigenstates upon measurement is one of the distinguishing
features of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics. Most introductory quantum textbooks teach cal-culation techniques that rely upon this assumption of instan-taneous collapse, with unitary time evolution betweenmeasurements. This paper uses these standard techniques
for individual particles, but applies them to a coherent
many-body state that is measured one particle at a time.When calculated in this way, collapse of a many-body state

is a process rather than being instantaneous. But when the
many-body state is coherent, that collapse occurs veryquickly. This relatively simple exercise may help Quantum
