I. INTRODUCTION
In a recent paper,1I derived an inverse series expansion
for the horizontal velocity of a projectile with quadraticdrag. The expression is given by
V
x¼Vx0
c0þc1tþc2t2=2!þc3t3=3!þ/C1/C1/C1; (1)
where Vx0is the initial velocity and the coefﬁcients c0(¼1)
through c6are given in my referenced paper.2The derived
expression converges faster than a traditional Taylor seriesand does provide new insight into the motion. However, I do
not use Eq. (1)to calculate ﬁnal trajectories, because it does
not easily lead to workable solutions using the horizontal andvertical equations of motion directly from Newton’s second
law. Nevertheless, as discussed below, with some further
manipulations, Eq. (1)can lead to trajectory solutions.
Although pursuing this problem may seem unimportant
considering the ubiquitous use of numerical computer
methods, it is still educationally instructive to look at these
solutions to better understand the physical nature of theproblem. See, for example, Ref. 3, where student experi-
mental trajectory results were compared to numerical simu-
lations. Just as experimentation is an integral part of astudent’s education, analytical solutions, even if approxi-
mate, add an extra degree of understanding to any physical
problem.
