Conservation laws are some of the most fundamental prin-
ciples in science. We recognize conserved quantities such asenergy, momentum, and electric charge as much more rareand profound than quantities that are merely constant insome situations. The number of ice cubes in my freezermight be constant for a period of time. That doesn’t meanice cube number is a conserved quantity; their constant num-
ber is a consequence of particular circumstances for my
freezer, not resulting from some profound natural principle.In fact, very few quantities are actually conserved, and allconservation laws that scientists have discovered are basedon fundamental symmetries in nature.
In a national study of Content Knowledge for Teaching
(CKT) energy, we found that a systems-based approach toenergy conservation was among the most challenging areasof energy understanding for both high school physics teach-ers and physics majors.
1These difﬁculties are rooted in the
failure to distinguish a conserved quantity from a quantitythat, like ice cubes, is merely constant for some systems in
some situations. In this paper, we are building on these ﬁnd-
ings to argue that:
I. Mechanical energy, like any other sub-category of
energy, is never a conserved quantity, even though it
might remain constant for some systems during cer-
tain processes.
