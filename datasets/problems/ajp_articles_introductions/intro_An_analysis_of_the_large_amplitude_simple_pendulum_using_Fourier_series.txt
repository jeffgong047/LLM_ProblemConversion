The motion of a pendulum is derived using Fourier series and perturbation analysis at levels
appropriate for undergraduate physics students. Instead of using the elliptic integral of the ﬁrstkind, higher order terms of the Taylor-expanded differential equation are considered, leading to
increasingly accurate corrections to the period in terms of a single expansion parameter. The
relation between the expansion parameter and the initial conditions is not ﬁxed, allowing manysolutions to the motion in terms of the expansion parameter but a unique solution in terms of the
initial conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Pendula are studied in a variety of physics classes because
they provide a simple problem in which to apply Newton’slaws, the Lagrangian formalism, and other techniques. For asimple pendulum of length ‘that is affected by gravity g,
any of these methods will lead to the equation of motion,
€hþðg=‘ÞsinðhÞ¼0: (1)
For small h, the sine term is usually approximated as h,t h e
ﬁrst term in its Taylor expansion, which is well known asthe small-angle approximation. Apply the small-angle
approximation to Eq. (1)and the general solution of Eq.

which is not dependent on the amplitude of the pendulum
due to the small-angle approximation, which makes a pendu-lum useful for timekeeping. But what happens when theangle is not small? How does the period depend on the
amplitude h
0when the motion goes beyond the small angle
regime?
This query has interested many past and present physi-
cists, as demonstrated by the extensive number of publica-tions on the topic in this and similar journals. Daniel
Bernoulli explored this in the late 1740s when he derived the
exact period of motion for a pendulum with arbitrary ampli-tude as an integral. From this, Bernoulli found a remarkablyaccurate and simple approximation,

though there are other ways to achieve this result.2,3Since
Bernoulli published Eq. (4), there have been countless
improvements to the approximation over a wide range of
conditions.4In Eq. (1), the term sin ðhÞcan be approximated
in the form Fðh0Þh, where Fðh0Þis an amplitude-dependent
coefﬁcient. One can guess that Fðh0Þ¼ð sinðh0Þ=h0Þa, andunder the condition that the main corrective term is equal to
the ﬁrst term in the power-series expansion of the integral,

Kidd and Fogg published a subsequent approximation using
the same method of trial-and-error empirical ﬁts.6This
approach, geared more towards undergraduate levels ofmathematical maturity, gave

where it’s noted that the approximation is best for h0/C20p=2.
This solution was compared to Eq. (5)by Hite7to see which
approximation was better and was reworked by Millet8to
yield higher accuracy.
In recent years more mathematically rigorous and innova-
tive practices have been employed to achieve approxima-
tions of the period of a simple pendulum, such as
approximating the large-angle period as motion along the
separatrix of the phase portrait,9which gives

for initial angular displacements around 180/C14. While these
approximations are useful, they do not make optimal use of
the pedagogical possibilities of the problem. In this paper,
we will present an approach to approximating the period of anonlinear pendulum by using Fourier series and the differen-
tial equation, as opposed to using the elliptic integral for the
exact solution. We will solve for the ﬁrst 3 corrective terms
to the period and the time dependence of the angular
displacement. The mathematics will be within the reach of
juniors and seniors, and will provide guided practice with
Fourier series and perturbation expansions. Beyond simply
providing an approximate solution to the nonlinear pendu-
lum, this paper aims to equip physics professors andstudents alike with another avenue of exploring nonlinear
oscillations.
