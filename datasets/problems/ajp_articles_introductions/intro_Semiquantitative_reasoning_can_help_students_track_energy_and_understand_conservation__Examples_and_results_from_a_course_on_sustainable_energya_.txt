The ability to track ﬂows of energy in complex and dissipative contexts is essential to understand
many aspects of sustainable energy and climate change. Traditional physics instruction largely fails
to develop that ability. This work argues that one plausible contributor to this deﬁciency could bean overemphasis on cases that lend themselves to quantitative calculation. Drawing on examples
and data from a small sample of college physics students in a class on sustainable energy, it
proposes that practice in semiquantitative energy tracking, using suitable visual and/or manipulablerepresentations, can help develop students’ skills in using energy reasoning in real-world,
dissipative contexts.

I. INTRODUCTION
Issues of sustainable energy and climate change are inex-
tricably linked to the tracking of energy ﬂows. We’ll want to
understand how climate change happens; why electric cars
are not generally “zero-emissions vehicles” but do use lessenergy per mile than conventional ones; and what changeswill most reduce the energy needed to heat a building. Forall these examples, the starting point is tracing the ﬂow ofenergy through the system. Energy tracking is, of course,
only one aspect of education in sustainability, but it is a vital
one, especially for physics students.
Numerous studies have shown that many high-school and
college students who have experienced conventional physicsinstruction have little understanding of energy conservationand little ability to use it to reason about real-world situa-tions.
1–5In this work, I argue that one plausible contributor
to the ineffectiveness of conventional instruction about
energy is an overemphasis on situations that are amenable toquantitative calculations. I present data and examples from asmall sample of college physics students in a class on thephysics of sustainable energy in which explicit attention was
paid to the semiquantitative tracking of energy ﬂows in real-
world, dissipative contexts. We use a representationalapproach, energy cubes,
6,7previously used primarily with
K–12 students and teachers. In agreement with the studiescited above, many of the students—all of whom had experi-enced conventional college physics instruction—initially
demonstrated misunderstanding of the principle of energy
conservation and little facility in using energy reasoning inreal-world contexts. By the end of the class, the group exhib-ited signiﬁcant gains in their ability to interpret and explainenergy ﬂow in relevant real-world scenarios.
Fundamentally, reasoning about energy is a game of
accounting, governed by the principle of conservation of
energy.
8As Driver and Warrington observed, “It is only
when energy is quantiﬁed, making energy conservation ameaningful notion, that the idea is useful to students as ananalytical tool. This suggests that ways of introducing andreinforcing energy as a quantity need to be considered in
basic science courses”
1(emphasis added). Traditional intro-
ductory physics instruction, however, has perhaps taken thisadvice too far. When energy ideas are taught, we often focuson systems in which the total amount of energy, however
manifested, remains constant. In simple, idealized cases—africtionless pendulum, a mass on a spring, projectile motion,ice melting in an insulated container of water—we can do thequantitative calculations in detail, and so these tend to be thecases emphasized in coursework. Many widely used textbooksdevote far more pages and include far more problems thatfocus on conservation of mechanical energy than on thebroader—and much more fundamental and important—principleof conservation of energy in general. Cases in which the non-conservative work can be calculated from simple models, suchas kinetic friction, are sometimes included, but the analysisoften stops with calculation of the work done by friction withlittle or no attention to where the corresponding energy goes.

Frequently, the question of “where does the energy go when
it’s ‘gone’” is given only passing attention, although this ques-
t i o ni sp e r p l e x i n gt ob o t hc h i l d r e na n da d u l t s .2,7,10–12A clear
resolution is particularly important for reconciling the scientiﬁcidea of energy—as an inherently conserved quantity—withthe model of energy as a consumable resource that prevails indealing with energy “consumption” and “production” in thecontext of sustainability.
In almost all scenarios that are relevant to issues of sus-
tainable energy (such as those mentioned in the ﬁrst para-graph) and indeed in most real-world scenarios where energyreasoning is helpful, the system of interest (a car, for exam-ple, or a building in winter) exchanges energy with the out-side world. In such cases, the conservation principle is morecomplicated: the rate of change in the system’s total energymust be equal to the net rate at which energy ﬂows into thesystem. Dissipation into the environment is a crucial part ofthe energy story, and often we can’t really do the accounting:When a car brakes to a stop, we may know, in principle, thatthe initial kinetic energy must ultimately be converted into
thermal energy, but how much goes into the tires, the road
surface, the brakes, the suspension, the air? Unless you’redesigning one of those things, does it matter?
If we want our students to be able to track energy ﬂows in
real-world contexts, it seems clear that we should providethem with appropriate representational tools and practice inusing them—as, for example, we teach students about free-body diagrams and give them extensive opportunity to usethem.

be highly effective in work with K–12 students and teach-
ers.12–16The present work extends the strategy to the college
level, describing and discussing examples of how it can be
used, presenting selected samples of student work, and provid-ing some preliminary evidence suggesting its effectiveness.
