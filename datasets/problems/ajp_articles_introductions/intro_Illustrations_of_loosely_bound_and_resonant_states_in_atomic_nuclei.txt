Using the one-dimensional potential well with realistic parameters for atomic nuclei, we illustrate the
movement of the poles of the S-matrix and the transmission coefﬁcient when the well supports an
anti-bound state. We calculate the phase shift of the atomic nuclei5He using the three-dimensional
potential well and compare it with the experimental one. The paper gives an introduction to some of the
properties found in realistic loosely bound and resonant nuclear systems, using mathematics accessibleto undergraduate students.

I. INTRODUCTION
Resonance is important in both classical and quantum
mechanics. In classical mechanics, resonance is associated
with an increase in amplitude when the frequency of anexternal force coincides with a natural frequency of the sys-
tem. In quantum mechanics, resonances are often deﬁned as
peaks of the transmission coefﬁcient. They are also deﬁnedas isolated poles of the S-matrix or as rapid variations of the
phase shift. In this article, we explore these deﬁnitions of res-
onances using the analytic solutions of the one and three-
dimensional potential well, and we show how this model canbe used to illustrate some of the properties of atomic nuclei.
We begin by reviewing resonances in the familiar damped
harmonic oscillator (Sec.
