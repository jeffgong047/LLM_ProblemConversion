Localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in metal particles are used in medical, chemical, physical, and
biological sensing applications. In this paper, we revisit the classical description of LSPs. We use the
Drude model and the Quasi-Static approximation to describe the plasmon resonances in terms ofthe material and the size of the particles embedded in a dielectric host. We then incorporate the
Clausius–Mossotti relation to include shape effects in the classical description. Finally, we incorporate
surface damping and retardation effects to arrive at a uniﬁed, classical description providing anintuitive and realistic model of plasmonic resonances in metal particles.

I. INTRODUCTION
Advances in nanotechnology and photonics go hand in
hand, from super-resolution microscopy helping us visualizelife at the nanoscale,1to extreme-UV lithography enabling
the creation of nanoscale chips needed to analyze it.2At the
intersection of photonics and nanotechnology lies the topic
of plasmonics.3Plasmonics involves the creation, study, and
manipulation of signals embedded in optical-frequencyoscillations of surface electrons along metal-dielectric inter-faces. Plasmonics conﬁnes optical-frequency signals tosubwavelength-size volumes, thereby providing the interfacebetween optical electromagnetic ﬁelds and nanoscopic devi-ces and circuitry.
When an electromagnetic ﬁeld interacts with a metal
nanoparticle, it will lead to charge oscillations in the metal.These collective oscillations, known as plasmons, are excitedwhen the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁeld matches the
resonant frequency of the metal nanoparticle. The electrons
are free to move within the boundaries of the particle but areultimately conﬁned to its surface. For these reasons, theeffect is called a localized surface plasmon (LSP). Giventhat the oscillation is at the same frequency as the incomingﬁeld, the effect is interchangeably called plasmonicresonance.
Designing metal nanoparticles to answer questions in
nanophysics, nanochemistry, and nanobiology requiresunderstanding the plasmonic resonance. Due to quantummechanical effects, the properties of nanoscale objects often
cannot be explained intuitively. Fortunately, the most promi-
nent plasmonic effects can be explained within a classicalframework. We will begin with a historical perspective.Then, to model the plasmonic resonance in metal nanopar-ticles, we will need a framework to describe three distinctfeatures: the metallic characteristic, the size (the “nano”),and the shape of the particle. We will introduce the Drudemodel, a reasonable description of electrons in metals. Thequasi-static approximation will then let us take into account
the nanoscale size of the particles. Additionally, the generali-
zation of the Clausius–Mossotti relation will let us considera particle embedded in a dielectric medium and the effect ofits shape. By combining these aspects, we are able to build aclassical model for the plasmonic resonance in metal nano-particles. We will then deal with some of the limitations ofthe quasi-static approximation by introducing ﬁnal correc-
tions to the model, to extend its validity as far as possible.As our assumptions are all based on classical electromagne-tism, the ﬁnal model will be classical too.
