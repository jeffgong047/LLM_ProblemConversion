COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
The Computational Physics Section publishes articles that help students and instructors learn about the com-
putational tools used in contemporary research. Interested authors are encouraged to send a proposal to theeditors of the Section, Jan Tobochnik (jant@kzoo.edu) or Harvey Gould (hgould@clarku.edu). Summarize
the physics and the algorithm you wish to discuss and how the material would be accessible to advanced
undergraduates or beginning graduate students.

Many physical systems can be studied as collections of particles embedded in space, often
evolving in time. Natural questions arise concerning how to characterize these arrangements—are
they ordered or disordered? If they are ordered, how are they ordered and what kinds of defects dothey possess? Voronoi tessellations, originally introduced to study problems in pure mathematics,
have become a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing countless problems in pure and applied
physics. We explain the basics of Voronoi tessellations and the shapes that they produce anddescribe how they can be used to characterize many physical systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Physical systems can often be abstracted as large sets of
point-like objects in space, with each point representing, forexample, the position of an atom, colloidal particle, organ-ism, or celestial body. Fundamental questions arise whenstudying these systems regarding the manner in which theirconstituent particles are organized. Are they ordered or dis-
ordered? If they are ordered, are the particles arranged in a
crystal-like fashion, and if so, what kind? Systems that areprimarily ordered often contain defects of varying dimensionand kind, all of which can impact the macroscopic static anddynamic properties of a system. How can these defects beclassiﬁed? In systems that are nominally disordered, such asliquids, glasses, and granular materials, how can the disorder
be described in a practical and effective manner?
Voronoi tessellations provide a natural tool for converting
questions about the arrangements of particles into ones aboutpolygons and polyhedra, possibly irregular, and about how theyﬁt together to tile space. The analysis of these shapes can tell usmuch about particle-like systems on a wide range of scales.
