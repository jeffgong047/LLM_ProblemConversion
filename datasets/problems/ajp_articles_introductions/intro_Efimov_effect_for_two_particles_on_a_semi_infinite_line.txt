The Eﬁmov effect (in a broad sense) refers to the onset of a geometric sequence of many-body
bound states as a consequence of the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scaleinvariance. While originally discovered in three-body problems in three dimensions, the Eﬁmov
effect has now been known to appear in a wide spectrum of many-body problems in various
dimensions. Here, we introduce a simple, exactly solvable toy model of two identical bosons in one
dimension that exhibits the Eﬁmov effect. We consider the situation where the bosons reside on a
semi-inﬁnite line and interact with each other through a pairwise d-function potential with a
particular position-dependent coupling strength that makes the system scale invariant. We show that,
for sufﬁciently attractive interaction, the bosons are bound together, and a new energy scale emerges.
This energy scale breaks continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance and leads to theonset of a geometric sequence of two-body bound states. We also study the two-body scattering off
the boundary and derive the exact reﬂection amplitude that exhibits discrete scale invariance.

I. INTRODUCTION
In his seminal paper in 1970, Eﬁmov considered three iden-
tical bosons with short-range pairwise interactions.1He
pointed out that, when the two-body scattering lengthdiverges, an inﬁnite number of three-body bound statesappear with energy levels fE
ngn2Zforming a geometric
sequence. This phenomenon—generally known as the Eﬁmov
effect—has attracted much attention because the ratioE
nþ1=En/C251=ð22:7Þ2is independent of the details of the
interactions as well as of the nature of the particles: It is uni-versal. More than 35 years after its prediction, this effect wasﬁnally observed in cold atom experiments,
2–6which has trig-
gered an explosion of research on the Eﬁmov effect. For more
details, see the reviews in Refs. 7–11 (see also Refs. 12–14
for a more elementary exposition).
Aside from its universal eigenvalues ratio, the Eﬁmov
effect takes its place among the greatest theoretical discover-ies in modern physics, because it was the ﬁrst quantummany-body phenomenon to demonstrate discrete scale
invariance —an invariance under enlargement or reduction
in the system size by a single scale factor.
15It is now known
that the emergence of a geometric sequence in the boundstates’ discrete energies is associated with the breakdown ofcontinuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance
16
and can be found in a wide spectrum of quantum many-bodyproblems in various dimensions.17–23The notion of the
Eﬁmov effect has, therefore, now been broadened to include
those generalizations, so that its precise meaning varies inthe literature. In the present paper, we will use the term“Eﬁmov effect” to simply refer to the onset of a geometricsequence in the energies of many-body bound states as aconsequence of the breakdown of continuous scale invari-ance to discrete scale invariance.
To date, there exist several theoretical approaches to study
the Eﬁmov effect. The most common approach is to directly
analyze the many-body Schr €odinger equation, which nor-
mally involves the use of Jacobi coordinates, hypersphericalcoordinates, the adiabatic approximation, and the Faddeevequation.
7Another popular approach is to use secondquantization or quantum ﬁeld theory.8Though the problem
itself is conceptually simple, it is hard for students and non-specialists to master these techniques and to work out thephysics of the Eﬁmov effect. The essential part of this phe-nomenon, however, can be understood from undergraduate-level quantum mechanics without using any fancy techniques.
This paper is aimed at introducing a simple toy model for
a two-body system that exhibits the Eﬁmov effect. We con-
sider two identical bosons on the half-line R
þ¼fx:x/C210g
with a pairwise d-function interaction. The Hamiltonian of
such a system is given by

where mis the mass of each particle and xj2Rþ(j¼1, 2) is
the coordinate of the jth particle. Here, g(x) is a coupling
strength. In this paper, we will focus on the position-dependent coupling strength that satisﬁes the scaling lawgðe
txÞ¼e/C0tgðxÞ, where tis an arbitrary real number. Notice
that, up to an overall constant factor, this scaling law has a
unique solution gðxÞ/1=x. For the following discussion, it
is convenient to choose
gðxÞ¼/C22h2

where g0is a dimensionless real number that can either be pos-
itive or negative. Physically, Eq. (2)models the situation
where the interaction strength becomes stronger as the particles
come closer to the boundary x1¼x2¼0( s e eF i g . 1). This
two-body interaction is essentially equivalent to the so-calledscaling trap introduced in Ref. 19, where the Eﬁmov effect
was discussed in the context of two non-identical particles onthe whole line R. As we will see shortly, our two-identical-
particle problem on R
þenjoys simple solutions and is more
tractable than the corresponding two-non-identical-particle
problem on R.
The rest of this paper is devoted to the detailed analysis of
the eigenvalue problem of H. Before going into details,

however, it is worth summarizing the symmetry properties
of the model. Of particular importance are the following:
•Permutation invariance. Thanks to the relation
gðx1Þdðx1/C0x2Þ¼gðx2Þdðx2/C0x1Þ, the Hamiltonian (1)is
invariant under the permutation of coordinates, ðx1;x2Þ
7!ðx2;x1Þ. Note that this permutation invariance is neces-
sary for Eq. (1)to be a Hamiltonian of indistinguishable
particles, where, for bosons, the two-body wavefunction
should satisfy wðx1;x2Þ¼wðx2;x1Þ. We will see in Sec.
