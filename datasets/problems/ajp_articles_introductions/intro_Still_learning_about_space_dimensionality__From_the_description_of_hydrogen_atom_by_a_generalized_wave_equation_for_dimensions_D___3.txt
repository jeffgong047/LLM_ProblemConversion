A hydrogen atom is supposed to be described by a generalization of the Schr €odinger equation, in
which the Hamiltonian depends on an iterated Laplacian and a Coulomb-like potential r/C0b.
Starting from previously obtained solutions for this equation using the 1 =Nexpansion method, it is
shown that new light can be shed on the problem of understanding the dimensionality of the world
as proposed by Paul Ehrenfest. A surprising new result is obtained. Indeed, for the ﬁrst time, we
can understand that not only the sign of the energy but also the value of the ground state energy of
hydrogen atoms is related to the threefold nature of space. #2023 Published under an exclusive license by

I. INTRODUCTION
The possibility that extra spatial dimensions can play
important role in Physics is not new. It can be traced back tothe pioneering works of Kaluza1and Klein.2Following the
general uniﬁcation idea of Kaluza–Klein,3several higher-
dimensional theories were developed, like string theory andsupersymmetry,4,5based on theoretical ideas that go beyond
the standard model of particle physics and show promise for
unifying all forces.
Indeed, the introduction of extra dimensions in the physics
of fundamental interactions has enabled a remarkable pro-
gress in two major contemporary programs: the quantizationof gravity and the uniﬁcation of the force ﬁelds of nature, for
which the mechanisms of reduction and dimensional com-
pactiﬁcation are of utmost importance.6
Around 1980, string theory was proposed to enlarge the
number of space dimensions, in this instance, as a require-
ment for describing a consistent theory of quantum gravity.
The extra dimensions were supposed to be compactiﬁed at ascale close to the Planck scale and, thus, not testable experi-
mentally in the near future.7
However, in 1998, a new approach was proposed,8where
it was shown that the weakness of gravity could be explained
by postulating two or more extra dimensions in which only
gravity could propagate. In particular, it was argued that thehierarchy problem of the standard model of elementary par-
ticles could be solved within this postulate. It is important to
stress that, in this case, the size of these extra dimensionsshould vary on a scale accessible to experimentation (rang-
ing between roughly 0.001 and 1 :97/C210
/C013m), leading,
therefore, to observable consequences in current and futureexperiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC/CERN).9,10
So, for the ﬁrst time, it was realized that extra dimensions
could also have an important impact on an open problem in
particle physics at energies ’1 TeV. Other applications are
reviewed in Refs. 9and11.
In summary , all these developments emphasize the idea
that the existence of extra dimensions could be one of the
most attractive possibilities for physics beyond the standardmodel, and such an idea may be experimentally tested.
