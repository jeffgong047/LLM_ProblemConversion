The matrix method is used to determine the mass spectrum (energy levels) of quarkonium, a
composite particle comprising a quark and an anti-quark. This two-body system is similar to the
hydrogen atom but at a reduced length scale. The results obtained by solving the Schr €odinger
equation for this system are in agreement with experimental and theoretical results obtained via
other techniques, showing that problems with complicated potentials can be tackled by
undergraduates. #2023 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is well known from elementary quantum mechanics that
for a particle of mass msubject to a central potential V(r),
the solution wðr;h;/Þof the Schr €odinger equation
Hwðr;h;/Þ¼Ewðr;h;/Þ (1)
is the product of a function that depends only on rand a
spherical harmonic: wðr;h;/Þ¼RðrÞYm
lðh;/Þ. As a conse-
quence, the general three-dimensional problem is reduced tosolving the one-dimensional radial equation

UðrÞ¼EUðrÞ; (2)
where UðrÞ¼rRðrÞandlis the orbital angular momentum
quantum number. Solving this equation determines the radialfunction R(r) and the energy levels.
In Ref. 1, it is shown that the matrix mechanics method1,2
produces results for the hydrogen atom problem in good
agreement with known exact results. Similar to theRayleigh–Ritz method,3–5the matrix method is based on the
choice of a discrete set of basis states in the system Hilbert
space. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is a variational method6,7
of approximately solving an eigenvalue problem to compute
eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions; it has theadvantage of being based on minimal and very generalassumptions and produces optimal solutions in the sense ofyielding eigenvalues close to the exact solutions. In the
matrix method, one decides on a ﬁnite number of basis states
denoted by N
max, and a truncated Hamiltonian of dimension
Nmax/C2Nmaxis constructed using this basis. This matrix is
then diagonalized to solve for the Nmaxlowest energy eigen-
values of the original Hamiltonian. One obtains upperbounds for these lowest eigenvalues; increasing N
maxleads
to results closer to the exact values. The matrix mechanics
method allows for the use of a simple set of basis states

This inﬁnite potential well will be familiar to undergraduates
and is used as an embedding potential in order to employ asimple discrete basis in the system Hilbert space. The eigen-
value problem can, thus, be expressed in a matrix form that
is easier to tackle numerically than the differential equationform when using a continuous basis like the position opera-
tor eigenstates j~ri.
After embedding the potential of the system in an inﬁnite
spherical well of radius a, Eq. (2)takes the form
