The dynamics of a swinging payload suspended from a stationary crane, an unwanted phenomenon
on a construction site, can be described as a simple pendulum. However, an experienced crane
operator can deliver a swinging payload and have it stop dead on target in a ﬁnite amount of timeby carefully modulating the speed of the trolley. Generally, a series of precisely timed stop and go
movements of the trolley are implemented to damp out the kinetic energy of the simple harmonic
oscillator. Here, this mysterious crane operator’s trick will be revealed and ultimately generalizedto capture the case where the load is initially swinging. Finally, this modus operandi is applied to a
torsion balance used to measure G, the universal gravitational constant responsible for the
swinging of the crane’s payload in the ﬁrst place.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many engineers have developed robust control algorithms
for the automation of industrial cranes to solve the problem of
damping the swinging motion of a suspended load.1–3Still,
few have analyzed the capabilities of the most classic control-ler—the human crane operator. While the pendulum provides
a simple yet fascinating system to study physics,
4most
articles on damping or excitation achieve their goal by chang-ing the effective lengths of the pendulum.
5–7Moreover, the
papers that describe damping rarely take advantage of the
Laplace transformation, with12being an exception.8–11Here,
we study a pendulum with a suspension point that is allowed
to move horizontally via a trolley. Using the Laplace trans-
form to obtain the pendulum’s motion, we show that damping
can be achieved simply by timing the suspension point’s
motion. In short, the authors combine their experience of driv-ing overhead cranes (SS, LC) with their love for physics (all
authors) to unveil the principles behind one of the tricks used
by crane operators. This trick consists of two stop-and-gomotions of the trolley. These can damp out the undesirable
swinging motion of the pendulum so that it stops dead on tar-
get in a ﬁnite amount of time. These movements will be ana-lyzed and explained in Sec.
