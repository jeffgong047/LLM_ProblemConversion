The nonrelativistic trajectory of a point charge qin the magnetic ﬁeld of a steady line current Iis
characterized by the three components of its initial velocity. The motion is periodic in the
cylindrical coordinates s,_/, and _z, describing, in the generic case, a kind of “double helix,” with
one helix serving as a guide while the other winds around it. A positive charge “drifts” in thedirection of the current (a negative charge goes the other way). The inclusion of a uniform line
charge k(coinciding with the current) does not alter the motion qualitatively, but it does change the
drift velocity, and can even reduce it to zero, collapsing the trajectory to the surface of a toroid.The relativistic treatment modiﬁes and illuminates these results.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we study the motion of a charged particle in
the magnetic ﬁeld of a long straight steady current. The
motion is (perhaps surprisingly) periodic in the radial cylin-drical coordinate and also in the longitudinal and azimuthal
velocities.
