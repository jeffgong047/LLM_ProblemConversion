Fahy and O’Sullivan1raise two different issues: (1) is the
magnetic dipole moment of the electron (say) due to a cur-rent loop (Ampe `re) or to magnetic monopoles (Gilbert)? and
(2) is it intrinsic (localized at a point, and ﬁxed in magni-
tude), as opposed to the point limit of an extended distribu-
tion (of whichever type)? As I understand it, the answer to(1) is that most experiments seem to favor Ampe `re, but there
is some ambiguity in their interpretation. The answer to (2)
is unequivocal: It is intrinsic, and that being the case, (1) is
perhaps not even a meaningful question.
In ordinary Newtonian mechanics, there is no such thing
as intrinsic spin, and in Maxwellian electrodynamics, there
are no intrinsic magnetic moments (and no magnetic monop-
oles). Angular momentum is due to mass in motion, andmagnetic moments are due to electric charge in motion; theirvalues can be changed continuously by the application of tor-
ques. Do these classical theories explain everything? Of
course not. There is no photon in classical electrodynamics,no proper explanation for the Stern-Gerlach experiment, andno adequate account of the behavior of magnetic materials.
Intrinsic spin and its associated magnetic moment lie
“outside the remit of classical” theories, and it is no accidentthat their allowed values carry the quintessentially quantum
ﬁngerprint: Planck’s constant.
Could the classical theories be extended to include point
particles with intrinsic spin and permanent magneticmoments? Interesting question! Semi-classical theories ofspin were introduced in the 1940s (and perhaps earlier) and
are under active consideration to the present day.
2They tendto be awkward and esoteric, but never mind—they are cer-
tainly worth exploring.
This leaves teachers with a delicate pedagogical problem:
How should one treat familiar electromagnetic phenomenasuch as ferromagnetism, knowing that any classical accountis ﬂawed (and perhaps even “misleading, to say, the least”)?Most authors resort to an uncomfortable compromise:Plausible qualitative explanations that endeavor to conveythe essence of the mechanism, coupled with a frank admis-sion of their limitations.
3It’s not perfect, but I do think it is
preferable to pretending that intrinsic spin ﬁts unproblemati-cally into the classical theory.
That being said, Fahy and O’Sullivan make a valid and
important point. The bald assertion that “all magnetic phe-nomena are due to electric charges in motion” should alwaysbe prefaced by “in classical electrodynamics,” and (whererelevant) accompanied by a clear acknowledgment that thequantum story is quite different, incorporating intrinsic spin(for which the naive classical picture of a tiny rotating sphereis fundamentally defective). I thank Fahy and O’Sullivan forthis reminder (the next edition of my textbook will berevised accordingly).
