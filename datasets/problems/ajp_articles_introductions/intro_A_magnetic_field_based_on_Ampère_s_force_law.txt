Ampe `re’s force law for steady currents was not historically associated with a magnetic ﬁeld, but it
could have been. A magnetic ﬁeld, inspired by work of Helmholtz in 1870, can be deﬁned suchthat the double-differential form of Ampe `re’s force law is a function of a double-differential of this
ﬁeld. We call this ﬁeld the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld, B, and show that its divergence is zero
everywhere, as is that of the usual, but different, magnetic ﬁeld Bof Maxwellian electrodynamics.
The curl of the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld is nonzero everywhere in static examples, in contrast to that
of the usual magnetic ﬁeld B. We illustrate the ﬁeld Bfor three examples, which exhibit patterns of
ﬁeld lines quite different from those of the usual magnetic ﬁeld. As the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld is
based on Ampe `re’s force law for steady currents, it does not extrapolate well to the Lorentz force
on a moving charge in a magnetic ﬁeld. That is, the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld B, like Ampe `re’s force
law, is more of a curiosity than a viable alternative to the usual magnetic ﬁeld B. If the
Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld had been invented in the mid-1800s, it would have been a distraction more
than a step toward a generally valid electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.
