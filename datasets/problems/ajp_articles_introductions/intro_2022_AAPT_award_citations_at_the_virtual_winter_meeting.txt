AAPT is presented to members in recognition of their excep-
tional contributions to the association at the national, sec-tional, or local level.
Arlisa Richardson
Regarding her selection to
receive this citation, Richardson
said, “What an honor! I appre-
ciate the opportunities to serveAAPT.” Professor Richardson
obtained her BS in physics
from the Grambling State
University, her ﬁrst MS in
Physics at the University ofTexas at Dallas, and a second
MS in Engineering of
Materials at the Arizona State
University. She worked as an
engineer in the semiconductormanufacturing industry before
returning to graduate school, and in 2008, she completed a
Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction specializing in Science
Education at Arizona State University. In 2011, she accepted a
physics faculty position at Chandler Gilbert CommunityCollege. She has served on the AAPT Board as a Member-at-
Large, and she also served on a number of AAPT committees as
the ex ofﬁcio At-Large Two-Year College Board representative
(e.g., Audit, Venture, and COGS). Additionally, she has pro-
vided valuable service on other AAPT Committees: Committeeon Physics in Two-Year Colleges (2016–2018), Programs
Committee (2019-present), and Lotze Scholarship Committee
(2018-present). She joined The Physics Teacher editorial board
in July 2021 for a three-year term. She is very committed to
reducing the barriers and improving the representation of mar-ginalized students in physics. She represented the US delegation
to the 6th International Conference on Women in Physics
(ICWIP) in Birmingham UK in 2017. She was also part of the
AIP TEAM-UP Task Force (see https://www.aip.org/diversity-
initiatives/team-up-taskforce ), which investigated why the pro-
portion of undergraduate degrees earned by African Americans
remains low. The Task Force prepared a report that was released
in early 2020, which laid the groundwork for the physics com-
munity to increase physics degrees by African Americans. She
writes, “AAPT has provided the extra support, resources, andnetworking needed speciﬁcally for two-year college faculty.
The AAPT Two-Year College group promotes successful peda-
gogical practices that are also beneﬁcial to four-year collegesand universities. The exchange of knowledge and experiences is
invaluable. I welcome the opportunity to be a voice for two-year
college faculty within AAPT.”
Dimitri Dounas-Frazer
Regarding his selection
to receive this citation,
Dounas-Frazer said, “I’mdeeply grateful to the
people who nominated
me for this award.Volunteering for AAPT
and organizing for change
in physics education hasbeen a rewarding—and
often challenging—expe-
rience. Doing so has pro-vided me the opportunity
to work with and learn
from diverse groups ofstudents, staff, faculty,and other stakeholders in
secondary and post-secondary contexts. I hope that the
efforts I’ve been part of ultimately do more good than harm.Sadly, physics education has a long way to go when it comes
to eradicating systemic and interpersonal ableism, racism,
cis-hetero-sexism, and commitments to capitalism and colo-nialism.” Dounas-Frazer earned his Bachelors and Masters
Degrees from the Colorado School of Mines and his Ph.D.
from the University of California, Berkeley. He has been amember of AAPT since 2012 and has served in various lead-
ership positions, including as the AAPT representative to the
AIP Liaison Committee on Under-represented Minoritiesand as the At-large Four-Year College representative of the
AAPT Colorado-Wyoming Section. He has also volunteered
for AAPT as the Vice Chair and then Chair for theCommittee on Diversity in Physics from 2015 to 2017 and
for the Committee on
Laboratories from 2018 to
2020. He currently serveson the AAPT Nominating
Committee.
