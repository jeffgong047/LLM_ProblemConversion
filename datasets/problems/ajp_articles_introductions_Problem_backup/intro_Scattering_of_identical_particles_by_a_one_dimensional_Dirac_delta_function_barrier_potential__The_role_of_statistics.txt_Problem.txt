"In an introductory quantum mechanics course, students often learn about the concepts of spin and statistics. Specifically, they are told that the wave function for a system of identical bosons must be symmetric under the interchange of any two particles, and the wave function for identical fermions must be antisymmetric under the interchange of any two particles."
