Consider a submarine at rest with respect to water, having the same density as water so that it neither sinks nor floats. What happens if the submarine attains a relativistic velocity v in the horizontal direction? In the water’s rest frame, the submarine should become Lorentz contracted, so it should become denser than water and therefore sink. Yet analogously, in the reference frame where the submarine is at rest, it is the water that should become Lorentz contracted and denser, so the submarine should float. However, it is a contradiction; whether the submarine will sink or float cannot depend on the observer. This puzzle, known as the submarine paradox, was first studied by Supplee and then further analyzed from various points of view in Refs. 2–4. They all agreed that the submarine will, in fact, sink.
