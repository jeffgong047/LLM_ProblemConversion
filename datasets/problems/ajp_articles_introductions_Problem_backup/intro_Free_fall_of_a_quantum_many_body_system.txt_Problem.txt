"In classical mechanics, one of the first problems that students encounter is the dynamics of a falling body: an object pulled down to the ground (e.g., from Pisa's tower) by the constant force of Earth's gravity. However, amazingly enough, the same problem is not always discussed in quantum mechanics courses due to the sharp contrast between the physical simplicity of the problem and the difficulty of its mathematical description."
