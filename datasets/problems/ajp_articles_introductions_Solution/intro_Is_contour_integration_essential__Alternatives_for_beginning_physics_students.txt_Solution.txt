The paper proposes to solve the problem of students being limited to using contour integration as the default technique for solving definite integrals in physics. It suggests alternative methods for evaluating these integrals, providing students with a larger toolbox and allowing for the discussion of physical problems where these integrals arise before contour integration is introduced.
