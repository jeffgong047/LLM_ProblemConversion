The paper proposes to solve this problem by introducing a transfer matrix method that allows for the calculation of the average properties of the energy spectrum in a disordered solid. This method replaces the actual atomic random potential with an energy-dependent coherent potential, generating a periodic effective medium with the same average properties as the non-periodic solid.
