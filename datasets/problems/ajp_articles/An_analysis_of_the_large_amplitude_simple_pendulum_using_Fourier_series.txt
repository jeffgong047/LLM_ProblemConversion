The motion of a pendulum is derived using Fourier series and perturbation analysis at levels
appropriate for undergraduate physics students. Instead of using the elliptic integral of the ﬁrstkind, higher order terms of the Taylor-expanded differential equation are considered, leading to
increasingly accurate corrections to the period in terms of a single expansion parameter. The
relation between the expansion parameter and the initial conditions is not ﬁxed, allowing manysolutions to the motion in terms of the expansion parameter but a unique solution in terms of the
initial conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Pendula are studied in a variety of physics classes because
they provide a simple problem in which to apply Newton’slaws, the Lagrangian formalism, and other techniques. For asimple pendulum of length ‘that is affected by gravity g,
any of these methods will lead to the equation of motion,
€hþðg=‘ÞsinðhÞ¼0: (1)
For small h, the sine term is usually approximated as h,t h e
ﬁrst term in its Taylor expansion, which is well known asthe small-angle approximation. Apply the small-angle
approximation to Eq. (1)and the general solution of Eq.
(1)is

g=‘p
tþ//C16/C17
: (2)
This has a period
T0¼2pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
‘=gp
; (3)
which is not dependent on the amplitude of the pendulum
due to the small-angle approximation, which makes a pendu-lum useful for timekeeping. But what happens when theangle is not small? How does the period depend on the
amplitude h
0when the motion goes beyond the small angle
regime?
This query has interested many past and present physi-
cists, as demonstrated by the extensive number of publica-tions on the topic in this and similar journals. Daniel
Bernoulli explored this in the late 1740s when he derived the
exact period of motion for a pendulum with arbitrary ampli-tude as an integral. From this, Bernoulli found a remarkablyaccurate and simple approximation,

though there are other ways to achieve this result.2,3Since
Bernoulli published Eq. (4), there have been countless
improvements to the approximation over a wide range of
conditions.4In Eq. (1), the term sin ðhÞcan be approximated
in the form Fðh0Þh, where Fðh0Þis an amplitude-dependent
coefﬁcient. One can guess that Fðh0Þ¼ð sinðh0Þ=h0Þa, andunder the condition that the main corrective term is equal to
the ﬁrst term in the power-series expansion of the integral,

Kidd and Fogg published a subsequent approximation using
the same method of trial-and-error empirical ﬁts.6This
approach, geared more towards undergraduate levels ofmathematical maturity, gave

where it’s noted that the approximation is best for h0/C20p=2.
This solution was compared to Eq. (5)by Hite7to see which
approximation was better and was reworked by Millet8to
yield higher accuracy.
In recent years more mathematically rigorous and innova-
tive practices have been employed to achieve approxima-
tions of the period of a simple pendulum, such as
approximating the large-angle period as motion along the
separatrix of the phase portrait,9which gives

for initial angular displacements around 180/C14. While these
approximations are useful, they do not make optimal use of
the pedagogical possibilities of the problem. In this paper,
we will present an approach to approximating the period of anonlinear pendulum by using Fourier series and the differen-
tial equation, as opposed to using the elliptic integral for the
exact solution. We will solve for the ﬁrst 3 corrective terms
to the period and the time dependence of the angular
displacement. The mathematics will be within the reach of
juniors and seniors, and will provide guided practice with
Fourier series and perturbation expansions. Beyond simply
providing an approximate solution to the nonlinear pendu-
lum, this paper aims to equip physics professors andstudents alike with another avenue of exploring nonlinear
oscillations.

To derive the exact solution, we start with

Multiply both sides by the time derivative of the angular
displacement,

and recognize the left side as a time derivative via chain
rule,10which gives the usual result for the time-
independence of the pendulum’s mechanical energy

evaluated by using the Arithmetic-geometric mean,12or
through the use of standard software packages. Furthermore,a ﬁnal important approximation can be obtained for the
period by simply calculating the power-series expansion of

III. FOURIER ANALYSIS, PERTURBATION
THEORY, AND ERROR
A. Fourier and perturbation analysis
1. Third-order correction
A pendulum is periodic, so it is natural to question why
we wouldn’t use Fourier analysis, the go-to tool for periodicmotion, to ﬁnd the angular displacement hðtÞ. The answer is
that we need the period of the motion to be able to employ a
Fourier series, which is something that we can’t immediatelypull from the differential equation due to its non-linearity.
However, instead of just scrapping this idea, we explore the
possibility that the period and the angular displacementfunction can be found simultaneously by using perturbation
theory in conjunction with Fourier analysis.
Perturbation theory involves starting from a well-known
solution and adding small corrections whose exact forms are
determined by the constraints on the system. For the non-
linear pendulum, we can start with the solution under the
small-angle approximation,
hðtÞ¼h
0cosðx0tÞ; (15)
where we’ve chosen the initial conditions to be hð0Þ¼h0
and _hð0Þ¼0. This solution is ﬁne under the small-angle
approximation, but what if we were to use more than just theﬁrst term in the Taylor series for the sine function? Eq. (15)
would break down and the differential equation would no
longer be satisﬁed. This is where we use Fourier analysis:
We write the exact solution of motion as a Fourier cosine
series,10,15–19
hðh0;tÞ¼X1
n¼0a2nþ1ðh0Þcosðð2nþ1ÞXtÞ; (16)
where Xis the corrected angular frequency—which we don’t
know yet—and a2nþ1are the amplitude-dependent coefﬁ-
cients. While a Fourier series generally contains both evenand odd harmonics of the sine and cosine functions, the ini-
tial conditions for the system reduce it to a cosine series,
and the anti-symmetry of the angular displacement about the
h¼p=2 position eliminates all the even harmonics of the
cosine function.
At this stage, we should determine the constraints of the
system that we will use in our perturbative analysis. First,
the initial conditions tell us
h
0¼X1
n¼0a2nþ1ðh0Þ: (17)
This isn’t enough to completely determine the solution,
though. Luckily, the use of Fourier series gives us another
constraint: The amplitude-dependent Fourier coefﬁcientsmust satisfy the differential equation. We can see through an
example that these two conditions are enough to completely
determine the exact solution to the differential equation.
Let’s start by just calculating a third-order correction to the
period and angular displacement. We take a truncated ver-sion of our proposed exact solution which takes the form,
hðtÞ¼a
1cosðXtÞþa3cosð3XtÞ; (18)
which gives us just enough free parameters to satisfy the differ-
ential equation. If we were to just use the small-angle approxi-m a t i o no nE q . (8), then we’d ﬁnd the trivial solution with
a
3¼0, which doesn’t help us at all; we want to ﬁnd some non-
zeroa3such that the differential equation is still satisﬁed. To do
this, we can use the ﬁrst two non-zero terms in the Taylor
expansion of the sine function in the differential equation,
sinðhÞ/C25h/C0h3=3!; (19)
meaning the differential equation that we must satisfy is
€hþx2
0h/C0h3
3!/C18/C19
¼0: (20)
777 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 B. Black and V. Vel 777 04 October 2023 22:57:48
This equation is what we need to solve to obtain the third-
order correction. If we insert Eq. (18) into Eq. (20), then we
get
0¼D2ð/C0a1cosðXtÞ/C09a3cosð3XtÞÞ
þa1cosðXtÞþa3cosð3XtÞ
/C0ða1cosðXtÞþa3cosð3XtÞÞ3=3! (21)
where we’ve deﬁned D/C17X=x0for convenience. Here we
can utilize the condition on the Fourier coefﬁcients, but witha slight twist. If we knew the solution to the motion hðtÞ,
then to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcients we would integrateðX=pÞhðtÞcosðXtÞandðX=pÞhðtÞcosð3XtÞwith respect to
Xtfrom/C0ptop. However, we don’t know what the solution
is yet, so this method won’t produce any useful results. What
we can do instead is use Eq. (21) in place of hðtÞ. By using
Eq.(21), we know that each integral must independently
equal zero. We therefore not only obtain information aboutthe Fourier coefﬁcients through the integration process, butwe also guarantee that they satisfy the differential equation.In other words, instead of ﬁnding the Fourier coefﬁcientsdirectly, we are determining a system of equations that theymust satisfy, and then solving that system to determine whatthe Fourier coefﬁcients are, which in turn can be used to
solve for D. Multiplying Eq. (21) by cos ðXtÞand integrating
from/C0ptopyields the relationship
0¼/C08þa
2
1þa1a3þ2a2
3þ8D2(22)
and multiplying by cos ð3XtÞand integrating yields
0¼a3
1þ6a2
1a3þ3a3ð/C08þa2
3þ72D2Þ: (23)
Remember that we are trying to solve for a1,a3andDsimul-
taneously. We currently only have two equations, so this sys-tem is unsolvable. However, the coefﬁcients are all functionsof the amplitude h
0, so we combine Eqs. (22) and(23) with
the appropriately truncated version of Eq. (17),
h0¼a1þa3 (24)
to get a system of equations to solve for the three unknowns
a1;a3andDin terms of h0.
These equations are non-linear and thus there exist multi-
ple solutions, many of them complex and of no physical
interest. Therefore, we must make an ansatz: We recognize
that sine is an odd function, and thus, we guess that our solu-tion to Eq. (20) is going to be odd in h
0. The way we struc-
ture this from a perturbative view is that we guess that a1
will be of order h0,a3of order h3
0, andD/C01 of order h2
0
(here, to be of order hn
0means the lowest degree of h0will be
n). How then might we use this ansatz to help us solve the
equations? We start by making the following observation:The solution to the exact motion is still periodic, whichmeans the magnitude of the corrections should decrease withthe number of terms, and thus it is reasonable to assume thata
1/C29D/C01/C29a3. As well, since a1is of order h0, at the
maximum possible displacement h0¼p,a1is not much
greater than 1, and thus we should have a3/C281 for 0 <h0
/C20p. With these ideas together, it becomes clear that we can
solve for Danda3in terms of a1, which will give a good
approximation to the Fourier coefﬁcients and period.Now we can continue with solving the system of equa-
tions. In Eq. (22), we can easily solve for D2,
D2¼1/C01
8ða2
1þa1a3þa2
3Þ; (25)
and then using a1/C29a3, we ﬁnd
D/C251/C0a2
1=16 (26)
after using a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion to simplify the
square root. We can now solve for the Fourier coefﬁcients.Insert Eq. (26)into Eq. (23)to ﬁnd
a
3¼1
192ð/C0a3
1þ426a2
1a3/C0216a4
1a3/C03a3
3Þ: (27)
We can easily see that a3
1/C29a2
1a3/C29a3
3, but how does a3
1
relate to a4
1a3? This essentially comes down to determining
how the magnitude of a1a3compares to 1. We already
showed a3/C281 and a1is not much greater than 1 ( a1is at
most a bit greater than p), so their product will still be much
less than 1, meaning a3
1/C29a4
1a3. Thus, we ﬁnd
a3/C25/C0a3
1=192: (28)
Finally, we solve Eq. (24) fora1, plug the result into Eq.
(28), and keep only terms proportional to h3
0so that to correct
order,
a3¼/C0h3
0=192; (29)
which we can then use to ﬁnd that
a1¼h0þh3
0=192; (30)
D¼1/C0h2
0=16; (31)
both to appropriate order. We have thus found the ﬁrst cor-
rection to the period and the corresponding Fouriercoefﬁcients.
2. Fifth-order correction
Let’s now take on the task of calculating the second cor-
rection to the period. In principle, we could use the same
approach as in Sec. III A 1 to solve for these higher-order
corrections, but we’d quickly ﬁnd that the algebra gets much
too complex. We’ll still take the approach of solving for
everything in terms of the ﬁrst Fourier coefﬁcient, but tosimplify the calculation, we introduce an expansion parame-ter/C15that we will use to keep track of the relative magnitudes
of coefﬁcients. To illustrate its use, let’s extend the form of
the angular displacement to
h¼a
1cosðXtÞþa3cosð3XtÞþa5cosð5XtÞ: (32)
Each Fourier coefﬁcient will become a polynomial in /C15(a
so-called perturbative expansion), but the exact formsrequire some critical assumptions about D/C01 and each
a
2nþ1. We assume that D/C01 will only contain even powers
ofh0and that each a2nþ1will only contain odd powers of h0.
The constraints on the parity of the powers of h0inD/C01
and each a2nþ1are not immediately clear but can be
deduced by explicit calculations, which are detailed in
778 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 B. Black and V. Vel 778 04 October 2023 22:57:48
Appendices A andB, respectively. We, therefore, write our
Fourier coefﬁcients as
a1¼/C15A1þ/C153A3þ/C155A5; (33)
a3¼/C15B1þ/C153B3þ/C155B5; (34)
and
a5¼/C15C1þ/C153C3þ/C155C5; (35)
and the angular frequency becomes
D¼1þ/C152d2þ/C154d4; (36)
where d2andd4are the second- and fourth-order corrections
to the angular frequency, respectively. We now aim to solvefor the everything in terms of A
1,A3, and A5instead of a1.
At this point, it is necessary to address an important ques-
tion that may come up. That is, it is natural to ask why we
don’t use h0as the expansion parameter in the larger calcula-
tions. By using /C15as the expansion parameter in the perturba-
tive expansion, that must imply that there is some
relationship between /C15andh0; why is it not just /C15¼h0?
When we move to higher-order corrections, we want torefrain from assuming /C15¼h
0because there may be other
relationships which lead to a far simpler system of equations
to solve. For now, we will make this distinction and later
explore the possible relationships between /C15andh0.
We now need to apply the perturbative constraints to get a
system of equations for the Fourier coefﬁcients and the cor-rections to the period. In the third-order correction we used a
two-term Taylor expansion for the sine function; for the
ﬁfth-order correction, we then need to use a three-termapproximation. The differential equation that we work with
now is
€hþx
2
0h/C0h3
3!þh5
5!/C18/C19
¼0: (37)
To determine the constraints on the Fourier coefﬁcients, we
substitute in Eqs. (32)–(36) into Eq. (37), multiply the result
by cos ðnXtÞand integrate with respect to Xtfrom/C0ptop
forn¼1, 3, and 5. The result is three equations, each of
which can be broken into three more equations which con-tain only terms proportional to /C15,/C15
3, and /C155, respectively—
we ignore anything of a higher degree than /C155since we only
care about the next order correction. Our working equationsare then the nine coefﬁcients of these polynomials. To see anin depth derivation of the system of equations using
Mathematica, see the supplementary material.
20Also see the
supplementary material for an explicit calculation of the sol-utions.20It is surprising and very interesting that these equa-
tions do not determine all the possible values of An,Bnand
Cn. That is, we run into the problem that we have more
unknowns than equations, which means the equations areunder-determined. In this case, we have a bit of wiggle room
since we used /C15as the expansion parameter. This allows us
to make a choice for one of the coefﬁcients and use that toconstruct the remaining coefﬁcients in a way that satisﬁes
Eq.(37). This is what’s known as a gauge choice: A choice
regarding the mathematics that doesn’t affect the physics.For simplicity, let’s consider A
3¼A5¼0 and A1¼1.When we solve for the subsequent coefﬁcients and correc-
tion terms, we ﬁnd
B1¼C1¼C3¼0;
B3¼/C01=192;
B5¼/C01=4096 ;
C5¼1=20 480 ;
d2¼/C01=16;
d4¼1=1024 : (38)
From an appropriately truncated version of Eq. (17), we can
solve for h0as a function of /C15,
h0¼/C15/C0/C153=192/C0/C155=5120 : (39)
This would allow us to write hðtÞandXas functions of /C15, but
this isn’t helpful because /C15has no physical signiﬁcance.
Instead, we look to get /C15as a function of h0, but how can we
do this? Here we introduce a useful mathematical tool called
the method of iteration. Notice from Eq. (39) that we can
write
h0¼/C15/C0Fð/C15Þ; (40)
where
FðzÞ¼z3=192þz5=5120 : (41)
We can write Eq. (40)as
/C15¼h0þFð/C15Þ; (42)
and because /C15/C25h0(but not exactly equal!), this means we
can approximate Eq. (42)as
/C15¼h0þFðh0Þ: (43)
We can then substitute Eq. (43) into Eq. (42) to get a better
approximation
/C15¼h0þFðh0þFðh0ÞÞ: (44)
We can continue this improve-and-substitute procedure as
many times as we need to get /C15as a function of h0to the cor-
rect order. To see how this is done using Mathematica, see
the supplementary material.20Up to h5
0, we ﬁnd
/C15¼h0þh3
0=192þ17h5
0=61 440 : (45)
This wasn’t the only choice we could make though. For exam-
ple, what would happen if we instead chose A1¼/C0A3¼1
andA5¼0? For this choice, the Fourier coefﬁcients and cor-
rection terms are
B1¼C1¼C3¼0;
B3¼/C01=192;
B5¼63=4096 ;
C5¼1=20 480 ;
d2¼/C01=16;
d4¼129=1024 : (46)
779 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 B. Black and V. Vel 779 04 October 2023 22:57:48
We can also use the iteration method to calculate /C15as a func-
tion of h0for this gauge choice
/C15¼h0þ193h3
0=192þ185 297 h5
0=61 440 : (47)
To our surprise, we ﬁnd that Eqs. (45) and(47) are not the
same! While this may seem alarming, it does not mean thereare two separate solutions to this well-posed physical prob-lem. When we use either of the solutions above to ﬁnd theFourier coefﬁcients to the indicated degree of h
0, we get
a1ðh0Þ¼h0þh3
0=192þ17h5
0=61 440 ; (48)
a3ðh0Þ¼/C0 h3
0=192/C0h5
0=3072 ; (49)
a5ðh0Þ¼h5
0=20 480 ; (50)
which agrees with the results of various other works.10,17,19
The period up to h6
0(seeAppendix C ) also comes out to be
T¼T0=ð1/C0h2
0=16þh4
0=3072/C023h6
0=737 280 Þ;(51)
where T0¼2p=x0, for both gauge choices. Now we can
return to answer our question of why we don’t use /C15¼h0:a t
higher orders, we can signiﬁcantly simplify the system ofequations by setting certain coefﬁcients equal to zero andallowing /C15to be a polynomial in h
0. In fact, there exist inﬁ-
nitely many results for /C15as a function of h0, which corre-
spond to the inﬁnitely many gauges we could choose. Aninteresting consequence of this is that there is a gauge where
/C15¼h
0is valid, and the exact coefﬁcients can be determined
by ﬁxing /C15¼h0, then requiring that the initial conditions be
satisﬁed and the solution hðtÞbe the same under the new
coefﬁcients.
3. Discussion of methodology
While Secs. III A 1 and2present a novel method to ana-
lyzing the non-linear pendulum, there must be some justiﬁ-cation as to the pertinence of this method considering theextensive research that has already been put into such apopular and applicable system. The idea of solving themotion as a Fourier series could be used as an illustrativeexample in an undergraduate mechanics course, but moreimportantly would ﬁt well in a course in mathematicalmethods at the junior and senior level. Such a course istaught at many institutions, and the mathematicaltechniques used in this paper are widely applicable to many
ﬁelds of physics. After all, our method can be generalizedfor almost any non-linear oscillator, not just the non-linear
pendulum. While they are multi-step, the derivations
detailed in this paper involve only single-variable calculusand algebra. Thus, students and researchers can ﬁnd greatuse of this paper via the detailed calculations, which can
serve as both a supplemental aid to their own research and
as content which provides practice with Fourier and pertur-bative analyses.
B. Approximation error
It is helpful to look at the fractional error of the approxi-
mations to fully understand the extent to which they getclose to the exact solutions. Figure 1shows the fractional
error of a one-term, two-term, and three-term correction of
the period compared to the exact period, along with that ofthe previously mentioned published approximations.
We can brieﬂy analyze this plot in two regimes:
0/C20h
0/C20p=2 and p=2<h0/C20p. In the former regime, we
ﬁnd the expected result that the 3-term approximation pre-
sented in this paper is comparatively the most accurate. This
is likely the regime that an undergraduate lab would work inas it ﬁts a simple string and bob setup. The latter regime iswhere we notice some interesting changes, however. Here,
the error of the 1-term approximation decreases noticeably
and becomes more accurate than the 2-term and 3-termapproximations. This implies some underlying interplaybetween the elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind and the 1-term
approximation, which will not be explored in this paper.
It is important to understand that, though these approxima-
tions are on-par with the works mentioned in the introduc-tion, they are not the best approximations that have beenpublished. For example, the use of the arithmetic-geometric
mean by Carvalhaes and Suppes

as a result, which turns out to be about 1 order of magnitude
more accurate than our 3-term approximation. Belendez

which is two orders of magnitude more accurate. However in
the context of, say, undergraduate labs, the measurement
error is usually about 1 part in 1000, so it sufﬁces to just use
the 1-term approximation for simplicity. In the context oftheoretical study, it is arguable that those who are less famil-
iar with advanced mathematics would ﬁnd the methods out-
lined in this paper more approachable, especially in the case
of self-study.

IV. CONCLUSION
We presented a novel method to derive increasingly accu-
rate expressions for the period of a pendulum using a Fourier
series, then perturbation analysis. Many published
approaches use the elliptic integral, while our approachworks directly with the differential equation which can seemmore approachable to students who have yet to engage in the
study of more advanced integral calculus. The application of
epsilon tags (expansion parameters), Fourier series, and per-turbations are useful for many physics and engineering prob-
lems where exact solutions are unwieldy or have not been
found. This paper is an example of all three and can thusserve as a useful teaching aid. By going through each of the
problem-solving steps explicitly, we provide general physics
students with an effective outlet for self-study, with perhapsmore beneﬁt to those studying mathematical physics. The
methods presented are especially useful in that they can be
applied to a multitude of nonlinear oscillators, not just thenonlinear pendulum.
There are many avenues to expand the modeled system
from a simple pendulum. For example, modeling a pendulum
with damping would add a _hterm
€hþc_h
nþx2
0sinðhÞ¼0; (54)
which has previously been explored using different meth-
ods.22Two-coordinate systems such as a pendulum with a
spring replacing the massless string, or even a double pen-dulum under small displacements could be studied. As
well, the number of terms to keep track of grows very fast
with the number of corrections, so future work shouldinclude ﬁnding a more efﬁcient method for computing
corrections.

Conflict of Interest
The authors have no conﬂicts of interest to disclose.
APPENDIX A: PERTURBATION SERIES
The perturbation series introduced in Sec. III A will only
include even powers of /C15. In this appendix, we will show
why that must be true. For the form of hðtÞ, we can use
hðtÞ¼ð /C15A
1þ/C153A3ÞcosðXtÞþð /C15B1þ/C153B3Þcosð3XtÞ;
(A1)
and for the angular frequency,
X¼x0ð1þ/C15d1þ/C152d2Þ: (A2)
In general, to determine the value of dn, one must eliminate
all terms not proportional to /C15nþ1, multiply the result by
cosðXtÞand integrate with respect to Xtfrom/C0ptop; this
produces an equation that we can use to solve for dn. We spe-
ciﬁcally need /C15nþ1because any larger degree of /C15will
include other contributions from corrective terms which areyet unknown, making the equation unsolvable. We can start,
for example, by solving for d
1. Insert Eqs. (A1) and(A2)
into Eq. (8), eliminate all terms not proportional to /C152, multi-
ply this result by cos ðXtÞand integrate Xtfrom/C0ptopto
ﬁnd
0¼1
pðp
/C0pcosðXtÞ/C2ð /C0 2A1d1cosðXtÞÞdðXtÞ: (A3)
Using the identity cos ðxÞ2¼ð1=2Þð1þcosð2xÞÞ, we see
that the integral does not immediately evaluate to zero.
However, since we know it must be equal to zero by Eq. (8),
and given that A1is not zero, it must be that d1¼0.
Generally, when ﬁnding dn, the collection of terms propor-
tional to /C15nþ1yields /C02A1dncosðXtÞwhen n is odd, which
will always give dn¼0. This is not the case for when n is
even because there are terms proportional to /C15nþ1that don’t
include any corrective terms. That is, because nþ1 will be
odd when nis even, terms proportional to /C15nþ1which don’t
include any dnexist as byproducts of the linearization of
sinðhÞinto a truncated odd-degree power series.
APPENDIX B: FOURIER COEFFICIENTS
Similar to the perturbation series, it is also introduced in
Sec. III A that the Fourier coefﬁcients must have odd powers
of/C15, and here we will show this. First, we will deﬁne a func-
tioncnð/C15Þfor mathematical convenience that will leave only
terms proportional to /C15nwhen evaluating cnð0Þ,
cnð/C15Þ¼1
n!dn
d/C15nð€h=x2
0þh/C0h3=3!þh5=5!Þ: (B1)
Let’s write the ﬁrst coefﬁcient as
a1ðh0Þ¼/C15A1þ/C152A2þ/C153A3þ/C154A4þ/C155A5 (B2)
and do it the same way for a3ðh0Þanda5ðh0Þand their
respective terms. Then, we need to look at any odd harmonicof cosine except for cos ðXtÞ. From the previous work in
Fig. 1. The fractional error of one-, two-, and three-term corrections to the
period as a function of the initial displacement compared to previously men-
tioned works, plotted on a log scale. Any multi-term series is truncated to 3
terms at most unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Sec. III A,B1¼C1¼C3¼0 still holds true. To determine
the coefﬁcients B2andC2, for example, we need to multiply
the harmonics of cosine with c2ð0Þ¼ð 1=2Þð/C016B2cosð3XtÞ
/C048C2cosð5XtÞÞ.T og e t B2,w ee v a l u a t e
0¼1
pðp
/C0pcosð3XtÞc2ð0ÞdðXtÞ: (B3)
Integrating the product of different harmonics over a full
period will always yield zero, but because cos ð3xÞ2
¼ð1=2Þð1þcosð6xÞÞ, we will end up with 0 ¼/C08B2which
clearly means B2¼0. If we multiplied instead by cos ð5XtÞ,
we can see we should also ﬁnd C2¼0. In general, for any
Fourier coefﬁcient deﬁned by anðh0Þ/C17Pk
m¼1/C15mbðnÞ
m, where
n is odd, if m is even then the integral of cos ðnXtÞcmð0Þ
gives the equation
0¼ð1/C0n2ÞbðnÞ
m; (B4)
which is only satisﬁed when bðnÞ
m¼0. To solve for some
bðnÞ
m, we aim to look for equations that don’t contain any cor-
rective terms: We must collect every term with the samedegree of /C15that the desired coefﬁcient is multiplied to, which
also brings along the harmonic it is multiplied to. By multi-plying by that speciﬁc harmonic under the integral, we canfurther determine only the terms that are relevant to the coef-ﬁcient, and in the case of an even power of /C15, it can only be
achieved through the hand €hterms in Eq. (8); any other
term produces an odd power of /C15. When m is odd, there
become other ways to achieve the desired power of /C15which
will inﬂuence the result of the integral.
APPENDIX C: CALCULATION OF D
6
At the end of Sec. III A we introduced the corrected period
up to h6
0, but we didn’t derive the third corrective term; we
will do that here. We are going to extend each Fourier coefﬁ-cient to include a term proportional to /C15
7, and we will
slightly modify the gauge in that A1¼1 but A3¼A5¼A7
¼0. We must rewrite Eq. (8)as
0¼D2€hþh/C0h3=3!þh5=5!/C0h7=7! (C1)
After appropriately extending the representation of hðtÞto
include a cos ð7XtÞterm, we perform the same integration
used to Sec. III A to ﬁnd

Finally, we plug Eqs. (C2) and(C3) into the appropriate deﬁ-
nition of the angular frequency
X¼x0ð1þ/C152d2þ/C154d4þ/C156d6Þ (C4)
