The Young–Laplace (Y–L) equation relates the curvature of the interface between two ﬂuids to the
pressure difference across that interface. The link between the surface curvature and pressurediscontinuity underpins numerous phenomena in hydrostatics, including the proﬁles of sessile
(immobile) drops, pendant drops, capillary bridges, and liquid pearls. In most cases, the application
of the Y–L equation readily yields the governing differential equations of the ﬂuid surface but
often these equations have no analytic solutions; this is the case, for example, with the proﬁle of a
dew drop or a liquid pendant. There are, however, some cases for which the differential equationshave closed form solutions; one is the edge proﬁle of a liquid spill or puddle on a horizontal
surface. Here, we review the Y–L equation and apply it to obtain the governing differential
equations of the edge proﬁle for a liquid spill. The solution of the differential equations results in auniversal function that describes the edge proﬁle of any ﬂuid. One important ﬁnding is that the
proﬁle curve begins its descent very gradually from the ﬂat top of the ﬂuid far away from the edge
and terminates at the point, where the angle between the proﬁle curve and the horizontal matchesthe equilibrium contact angle of the liquid on the substrate.

I. INTRODUCTION
Physics students readily associate certain analytic func-
tions with well-known phenomena: parabolas with projec-
tiles, ellipses with planetary orbits, hyperbolas with atomic
collisions, and the hyperbolic cosine with the catenary.1
However, most students are surprised to learn that no ana-lytic function describes the graceful proﬁle of a dew drop.2,3
In fact, there are many other curves and surfaces in nature
that cannot be described by analytic functions. Among these
are the proﬁles of liquid drops and pendants, liquid pearls,
and capillary bridges, all fascinating and ubiquitous.4In
most of these cases, the governing differential equations of
the surface can be derived easily by applying the
Young–Laplace equation. Due to lacking analytic solutions,
the differential equations must be numerically integrated to
obtain the proﬁle of the surface.5
There are, however, some cases for which the differential
equations have closed-form solutions. Among these are the
proﬁle of a capillary bridge between two parallel plates, the
shape of the meniscus of an air-liquid interface around a ver-
tical ﬁber, and the surface proﬁle of a liquid next to a vertical
plane.6,7A more general version of the latter case gives the
shape of the liquid surface in contact with an inclined plane.8
When a glass of water spills on a horizontal surface, it
spreads into a puddle with a ﬂat top and a curved edge pro-
ﬁle. The analytic solution of the edge proﬁle offers an excel-
lent example of the application of the Young–Laplace
equation in a mathematical physics course. However, to the
best of our knowledge, the solution of the edge proﬁle has
not appeared in the literature.
The Young–Laplace (Y-L) equation relates the curvature
of the interface between two ﬂuids to the pressure difference
across the interface and, thus, provides the most direct route
for obtaining the governing differential equations of a liquidsurface.9Thus, it is somewhat surprising that no current
introductory physics texts cover the Y–L equation or even
mention it in passing. Indeed, with some notable exceptions,
many advanced texts in hydrodynamics do not cover theY–L equation.10,11For the record, we note that Ref. 8devotes
a chapter to the Y–L equation and its applications; the deri-vation of the equation, however, is by the method of virtualwork. The Y–L equation is also sketched brieﬂy under the
heading of “Laplace pressure” in Ref. 4; shorter treatments
appear in several other texts.
10On the other hand, quite a
few well-known texts in hydrodynamics including the classicone by Horace Lamb do not cover the Y–L equation.11
Here, we will ﬁrst consider the mathematical basis of sur-
face curvature and review an important theorem in differen-tial geometry. The theorem states that at any surface point,the directions associated with the local minimum and maxi-mum radii of curvature are orthogonal. These radii character-ize the local surface curvature and enter directly into thederivation of the Y–L equation as we consider the balance offorces acting on an element of the liquid surface. We thenapply the Y–L equation to obtain the parametric equations of
the proﬁle as x(h)andy(h),where his the angle between the
proﬁle curve and the horizontal. The parametric solutionsprovide several ways of characterizing the proﬁle, each witha unique insight. For example, the pair-wise values of x(h)
andy(h)provide an alternative method for obtaining the pro-
ﬁle curve y(x).
Finally, we present the differential equation of the proﬁle in
Cartesian coordinates and integrate it to ﬁnd the analytic pro-ﬁle curve x(y). Comparison of the direct analytic equation of
the proﬁle with the one constructed from the parametric equa-tions provides corroboration and further insight into the differ-ent approaches to the problem. In the Sec. IV, we expand on
three additional insights provided by the analytic solution:
(1) The analytic equation of the edge proﬁle is a universal
function that describes the edge proﬁle of any ﬂuid spillwith just two ﬂuid parameters: density and surfacetension.
(2) The proﬁle curve begins its descent very gradually from
the top of the ﬂuid far away from the edge, so the reachof the proﬁle in the horizontal direction is many timesthe depth of the ﬂuid.

(3) The proﬁle curve terminates at the point, where the angle
between the proﬁle and the horizontal matches the equi-
librium contact angle of the liquid on the substrate. Inother words, the substrate determines the end point of
the proﬁle curve and the depth of the spill.
II. YOUNG–LAPLACE EQUATION
There are several methods of deriving the Young–Laplace
equation. Most textbooks use a variational method based on
virtual work.
8,12A more general approach is to derive the
equation by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy of the
system.13–15However, the Y–L equation is a local relation-
ship as it relates the surface curvature to the pressure differ-ence across the interface at a given point on the surface.
16
Thus, it can also be derived by minimizing the energy of a
volume element at the surface or by considering the mechan-
ical equilibrium of forces acting on a surface element.14,17
Perhaps, the simplest method for deriving the Y–L equa-
tion is to consider the equilibrium condition for a surface ele-
ment of a convex ﬂuid surface.6Students readily appreciate
that the ﬂuid pressure on the surface element is balanced bythe pull of the surface tension forces along the element’s
boundaries. Furthermore, this method casts the Y–L equation
as an elegant restatement of the balance of forces acting on asurface element in equilibrium. However, in our experience,
a short review of the following theorem in differential geom-
etry on surface curvature makes the derivation easier tounderstand.
Referring to Fig. 1, consider an inﬁnitesimal surface ele-
ment located at point Pon a liquid surface and let nbe the
unit normal at P. A plane containing nintersects the surface
in a curve with a well-deﬁned radius of curvature at point P.
As the plane is rotated around the n-axis, at some orientation,
the intersection curve attains its maximum radius ofcurvature.
A well-known theorem in differential geometry states that
the minimum radius of curvature at Pis 90
/C14away from this
orientation.18Indeed, according to this theorem, at every
point on a surface, there are two mutually perpendicular
directions, called the principal directions, along which the
intersection curves attain the maximum and minimum radiiof curvatures, known as the principal radii of curvatures.
In Fig. 1, the two principal directions of the surface at P
are shown by dotted lines, while r
1and r2are the twoprincipal radii of curvature. The area of the surface element
dSis given by
dS¼r1dh1r2dh2: (1)
The pressure difference Dpacross the interface generates a
net force on dSalong the normal ngiven by
Dpd S¼Dpr1dh1r2dh2: (2)
Under equilibrium, this outward force on dSis balanced by
the net inward force resulting from the pull of surface tension
calong its boundaries. The force due to surface tension pull-
ing away along the right boundary is given by cðr1dh1Þ.
Clearly, the surface tension force pulling away on the left
boundary is also cðr1dh1Þ. However, while their magnitudes
are equal, their directions are not quite opposite. Due to the
slight curvature of the surface element from left to right rep-
resented by dh2, their sum produces a net inward force along
–ngiven by cr1dh1dh2 ðÞ . Similarly, the action of surface ten-
sion on the upper and lower sides of the “rectangular” sur-
face element contribute a net inward force given bycr
2dh2dh1 ðÞ :

Equation (4)gives the pressure difference across the liquid
surface at any point in terms of the surface tension and thetwo principal radii of curvatures at that point. The expression

III. EQUATIONS OF THE PROFILE
A. Parametric equations x(h)and y(h)
Referring to Fig. 2, consider a point Pon the edge proﬁle
curve of a large liquid spill with coordinates xandy.W e
note that in the case of a wide ﬂuid spill or highly enlarged
drop, gravity ﬂattens the top surface and extends the liquidfootprint to cover a large area. In such a case, the curvature
of the liquid front is mainly in the vertical plane with essen-
tially negligible curvature along the horizontal. Therefore, ofthe two principal radii of curvature at point P,the minimum
radius r
1is in the vertical plane and the maximum radius
r2/C251 is in the horizontal plane.

For notational convenience, let r1¼r. In light of Eq. (4),

Letc=qg/C17a2, where ais the so-called capillary length, and
rewrite Eq. (5)as
y¼a2=r: (9)
In light of Eq. (6), Eq. (9)may be written as
y¼a2dh=ds: (10)
Substitution of Eq. (7)into Eq. (10) results in
dy=dh¼a2sinh=y: (11)
Similarly, substitution of Eq. (8)into Eq. (10) gives
dx=dh¼a2cosh=y: (12)
Equations (11) and(12) are the two parametric differential
equations of the proﬁle curve. Of these, Eq. (11) can be read-
ily integrated to obtain yhðÞ
y2=2þC¼/C0a2cosh; (13)
where the constant of integration Cdepends on the origin of
the coordinate system. For the coordinate system used inFig. 2, we have y¼0 when h¼0, which results in
C¼/C0a

yhðÞ¼2a21/C0cosh ðÞ/C2/C31=2: (14)
Equation (14) may be used to obtain the height of the liquid
spill on a substrate when the equilibrium contact angle hcis
known

Conversely, Eq. (15) may be recast to give the equilibrium
contact angle in terms of the height hand the capillary length

Equation (16) is known as the Quincke relation.19Figure 3shows the graph of Eq. (14) with the value of the
capillary length a¼c=qgðÞ1=2¼0:271 cm evaluated for
pure water ( c¼72 dyn =cm;q¼1g=cm3;g¼980 cm =s2Þ.
The depth of a water spill depends on the equilibrium
contact angle of water on the substrate. On a perfectly hydro-phobic surface ( h
c¼pÞ, the depth of the water is given in
Eq.(14),ypðÞ¼2a¼0:542 cm. Of course, the depth of the
water would be less than 2 aon typical surfaces for which the
equilibrium contact angle is less than p.
Equation (12) may be decoupled by substituting for y
from Eq. (14), resulting in

Figure 4shows a plot of Eq. (18) with a¼0:271 cm evalu-
ated for pure water. Because Eq. (17) suffers from a singular-
ity at h¼0, the constant in Eq. (18) is chosen to place the
origin of the x-axis at xðp=180). Therefore, the plot in Fig. 4Fig. 3. Graph of yðhÞgiven in Eq. (14) from h¼0t oh¼pfor pure water

Fig. 4. Graph of xhðÞgiven in Eq. (18) shows the x-component of the proﬁle
curve for pure water on a perfectly hydrophobic surface. Note that the maxi-
mum value of xoccurs when h¼p=2. Since xhðÞhas a singularity at h¼0,
the constant of integration was chosen to place the origin of the x-axis at x
(p/180), so the graph of xhðÞbegins at h¼p=180¼1/C14and extends to p.
12 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January 2022 F. Behroozi 12 04 October 2023 22:59:09
begins at h¼p=180 and ends at h¼p. Note that xhðÞattains
its maximum value when ¼p=2.
Equations (14) and(18) completely characterize the edge
proﬁle and may, in turn, be used to construct the proﬁle
curve y(x) from the pair-wise values of ½xðhÞ;yðhÞ/C138. The
result is shown in Fig. 5, where the x-axis is along the free
surface of the liquid. This graph shows the edge proﬁle for
water on a perfectly hydrophobic substrate, which is shownas a dark line. As before, to avoid the singularity at h¼0,
the constant in Eq. (18) is chosen to place the origin of the
x-axis at h¼p=180.
The edge proﬁle in Fig. 5is that of pure water on a per-
fectly hydrophobic surface, where the equilibrium contact
angle is pand the water depth is 0.542 cm. The graph was
constructed by using the ½xðhÞ;yðhÞ/C138pair of values from Eqs.
(14) and(18). For other substrates, the equilibrium contact
angle determines the terminal point of the proﬁle curve and
the depth of the spill.
B. The profile equation in Cartesian coordinates
From Eq. (14), we have
cosh¼1/C0y
2=2a2; (19)
and therefore,
sinh¼y=aðÞ 1/C0y2=4a2/C0/C11=2: (20)
Furthermore, substituting Eq. (20) in Eq. (11) gives
dy
dh¼a2sinh=y¼a1/C0y2=4a2/C0/C11=2; (21)
and hence,
dh¼dy=a1/C0y2=4a2/C0/C11=2: (22)
Substitution of Eqs. (19) and(22) into Eq. (17) results in
xyðÞ¼ða1/C0y2=2a2/C0/C1
dy=a1/C0y2=4a2/C0/C11=2/C16/C17
y=a;(23)
which simpliﬁes toxyðÞ¼ða2/C0y2=2/C0/C1

Figure 6shows the edge proﬁle of pure water on a perfectly
hydrophobic substrate as given in Eq. (25); the substrate is
again shown as a black line along the bottom.
The plot is identical to that in Fig. 5, which was con-
structed by plotting data pairs of ( x(h), y(h)) from h¼1/C14to
h¼p. The constant in Eq. (25) was chosen to place the ori-
gin of the x-axis at h¼1/C14, consistent with other plots and to
avoid the singularity at h¼0/C14. The identity of the graph in
Fig. 5with that in Fig. 6corroborates the consistency of the
two different approaches in ﬁnding the edge proﬁle.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Application of the Young–Laplace equation to the liquid
front results in two parametric differential equations, dy=dh
anddx=dh, Eqs. (11) and(12). Of the two, dy=dhis readily
integrated to give y(h)in Eq. (14). However, care must be
taken in integrating Eq. (12) to obtain x(h)since dx=dhsuf-
fers from a singularity at h¼0. Physically, this is due to the
fact that the proﬁle curve asymptotically approaches the hor-izontal line along the top surface of the ﬂuid as happroaches
zero, resulting in
dx
dh/C18/C19
h!0!1 : (26)
To avoid this problem, we have chosen to plot xðhÞfrom
h¼1/C14toh¼180/C14in Fig. 4. We follow the same strategy in
graphing the front proﬁle in Figs. 5and6. If the proﬁle is
plotted by starting from h¼0:1/C14toh¼180/C14, the resulting
graph has a considerably longer tail along the horizontal, asshown in Fig. 7.
Figure 7clearly demonstrates that the edge proﬁle
descends very gradually from the ﬂat surface of the spill.The proﬁle curve is nearly horizontal at the start of the plot
Fig. 5. The edge proﬁle of water on a perfectly hydrophobic surface. The
plot is constructed by using the ½xðhÞ;yðhÞ/C138pair of values from Eqs. (14)
and(18). To avoid the singularity at h¼0, the plot starts from h¼1/C14and
ends at the substrate at h¼180/C14.Fig. 6. The edge proﬁle of pure water, given in Eq. (25), on a perfectly
hydrophobic substrate, indicated here by a black line. To avoid the singular-
ity at h¼0, the constant in Eq. (25) is chosen so as to begin the proﬁle from
h¼1/C14down to h¼180/C14. Note that this plot is identical to that in Fig. 5.

where h¼0.1/C14, but the rate of descent is much higher for
points closer to the front. The proﬁle curve turns inwardbeyond h¼90
/C14similar to the proﬁle of sessile drops on
hydrophobic surfaces.
We note in passing that when a sessile drop is enlarged by
adding more ﬂuid to it, its footprint expands, its top ﬂattens,and its surface proﬁle approaches that of the liquid spill orpuddle. When the footprint of a sessile drop exceeds itsheight by an order of magnitude, its edge proﬁle approachesthat shown in Fig. 7. Thus, in practice, the height of an
expanded drop may be used in Eq. (16) to ﬁnd a good esti-
mate of the equilibrium contact angle.
19
Finally, we note that although the edge proﬁle for all
liquids is described by the same universal function [Eq.
(25)], the proﬁle for a given liquid depends on surface ten-
sion and density. Furthermore, for a given liquid, the upperpart of the proﬁle curve remains unchanged, but its termina-tion point depends on the substrate properties. Speciﬁcally,the proﬁle curve terminates when the angle hmatches the
equilibrium contact angle of the substrate. For example,the equilibrium contact angle of water on gold is h
c/C2590/C14,
so the proﬁle curve of water on a gold substrate ends ath¼90
/C14. The dashed lines in Fig. 7show the terminal points
of the proﬁle curve for three substrates: Lucite ( hc/C2570/C14),
gold ( hc/C2590/C14), and Teﬂon ( hc/C25130/C14).
