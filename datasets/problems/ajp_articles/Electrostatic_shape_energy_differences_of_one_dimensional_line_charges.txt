We investigate the electrostatic energy of one-dimensional line charges, focusing on the energy
difference between lines of different shapes. The self-energy of a strictly one-dimensional charge is
inﬁnite, but one can quantify the energy by considering geometries that approach a one-dimensionalcurve, for example, thin wires, thin strips, or chains of close point charges. In each model, the energy
diverges logarithmically as the geometry approaches a perfect one-dimensional curve, but the energy
also contains a ﬁnite term depending on the shape of the line—the “shape energy.” The difference inshape energy between a straight line and a circle is checked to be the same using a range of models.
To calculate the shape energy of more complex shapes numerically, we propose a line integral where
the singularity in the integrand is canceled. This integral is used to calculate the shape energy of ahelix.

I. INTRODUCTION
The electrostatic energy associated with a charge distribu-
tion represents the work required to bring the inﬁnitesimal
charges to their positions from inﬁnitely far away. This canbe expressed as an integral over the product of the chargedensity and the potential. If the charge distribution is one-
dimensional, the integral diverges due to the inﬁnite poten-
tial at the charge’s location. This means it takes an inﬁniteamount of energy to compress charges into an inﬁnitely thinline segment. However, given a pre-existing line segment,one may ask what energy is associated with its shape .A
more compact shape should have higher energy, as work is
required to change a charged line’s shape. For example, thisenergy difference affects the process of DNA and microﬁberwrapping.
1–3The electrostatic energy of thin wires can also
be used to determine the equilibrium charge conﬁguration.
While the equilibrium charge density of a perfect one-
dimensional line is understood to be uniform, different waysof approaching the limit of a perfect one-dimensional curveyield more interesting distributions.
4–6Our ﬁrst goal is to
show that a wide range of approaches can be used to describe
the energy of thin line segments using the energy differencebetween a straight line and a circle as a case study. Weinvestigate four physical models that can be used to approxi-mate line segments: a thin conducting wire, a uniformly
charged wire, a thin strip or ribbon, and discrete charges.
Each model involves a regularization parameter, for exam-ple, the small radius of the wire or the discrete charge spac-ing; as this parameter approaches zero, the model becomes aperfect line and its energy diverges logarithmically. For each
model, the energies of a straight line and a circle are found
to differ by the same constant. We also investigate the thinspheroid model of a straight line as used in Ref. 7but ﬁnd
that this model is not viable due to the changing radius along
the length of the line.
For complex curves, we need a method that does not
involve a regularization parameter, since that involves takinga limit that is not suited for numerical treatment. To the bestof our knowledge, such a method is not available in the liter-ature, so here we construct a regularized integral for this pur-
pose. This integral allows us to calculate the energy of any
curve with a given arc length parameterization.II. SHAPE ENERGY

Despite the 1 =xtype singularity, the integrals are ﬁnite if the
volume and density are ﬁnite. For a surface charge, thisreduces to a double surface integral, and the integral stillconverges. If we compress the charge further to one dimen-sion with a linear charge density k, we get

The potential Uis inﬁnite everywhere along the line seg-
ment, and the singularity at r¼r0is non-integrable, giving
an inﬁnite energy. So in order to study the energy of line-likeconﬁgurations, one must instead calculate the energy ofcharge conﬁgurations that approach one-dimensional line
segments in a certain limit. We will call these conﬁgurations
“regularizations”—models that use a dimensionless parameter
/C15such that as /C15decreases, the model approaches a one-
dimensional curve. For example, if the model is a thin con-ducting wire with circular cross section, /C15could be the ratio
of the wire’s thickness to its length.
We assume a uniform charge density along the line. This
is the equilibrium conﬁguration for any smooth curve, whichcan be shown by analyzing the force on each point.

For every model, we ﬁnd that the energy of a regularized

where Bð/C15!0Þ!0. The logarithmic term is the shape-
independent contribution to the energy, while Ais ﬁnite and
depends on the line shape but is not uniquely deﬁned since
one can scale the regularization parameter /C15, which adds a
constant to A. We deﬁne the shape energy ~Eas the difference
between the value of Afor the curve of interest and Afor a
straight line, modeled by the same regularization.
Mathematically, this can be calculated as

where Eis the energy of the line of interest and Ejis the
energy of the straight line. The shape energy does not depend
on the regularization used, and to demonstrate this, we will
calculate the shape energy of a circle using a few differentmodels. Many intermediate results are derived elsewhere so
we simply quote them.
III. THIN CONDUCTING WIRE MODEL
Our ﬁrst regularization is a thin conducting wire of circu-
lar cross section with inﬁnitesimal radius r,c h a r g e Q,a n d
length L, which can be shaped to the curve of interest. The
regularization parameter is /C15¼r=L. The energy of a con-
ductor E
cndis easy to calculate because all the charge lies
on the surface, and the potential Vis constant over the sur-
face. The integral (1)reduces to a surface integral of the
product of the charge and the potential, which is related to
the capacitance C

The straight line in this model becomes a conducting cyl-

Equivalently, because the charge density approaches unifor-
mity, we could use the model of a uniformly charged thinopen cylindrical shell whose energy is derived exactly in
Ref.12, and agrees with (8)up to constant order.
The circle in this model becomes a conducting torus of
ring radius R, length L¼2pR, cross-sectional radius r, and
again /C15¼r=L. The capacitance of the torus may be
expressed as a series of toroidal functions,
13which can then
be expanded in /C15. Equation (7)then gives for the energy

The energy of the conducting ring diverges at the same rate
as the conducting straight line, but the constant terms are dif-ferent. The functions in the order term OðÞare not important
here, as long as they go to zero as /C15!0. Subtracting Eqs.

This provides additional conﬁrmation of the result of Ref. 2.
Two additional models that are similar to this thin-conducting line model are discussed in the appendices and
lead to the same result for the shape energy.
IV. THIN SPHEROID
Not all regularizations allow for the calculation of ~E,
which is illustrated using the following example. It is tempt-
ing to model the straight line as a thin prolate spheroidal con-ductor, since it has an exact solution and can be used to
study the equilibrium charge distribution on a straight line.

We would like to express this in terms of the small parameter
/C15so as to compare to the ring. The problem is that there is no
clear choice for the deﬁnition of /C15since the rod’s radius
varies along its length. Setting /C15¼a=Las in Ref. 7makes it
too large as this chooses the widest point on the rod. An
average radius could be deﬁned somehow, but there are mul-
tiple ways of doing this. Since scaling /C15affects the constant
term, an unambiguous subtraction with Eq. (9)cannot be
made.
We have already seen that a conducting spheroid is not a
viable model because the radius varies; now we show that auniformly charged spheroid presents another problem. The
energy stored in a uniformly charged prolate spheroid of
semi-minor axis a, semi-major axis c¼L=2 is given in
Ref. 22(Eq. (99.16)), which expanded to constant order in
small a/Lreads as

The energy is increased by a factor of 6/5, which intuitively
is due to the mild accumulation of charge near the center of
the line. (For the conducting spheroid, there is no accumula-tion since the charge can move towards the end.) This factor
of 6/5 further prohibits comparison with the circle to deter-
mine ~E
/C14.
V. DISCRETE CHARGE MODEL
We can also model the line segments with a large number
Nof equally spaced point charges with equal charge Q/N.
To avoid the problems associated with the (inﬁnite) self-
energy of each point charge, we adopt the standard practice
of assuming that the point charges already exist; we then cal-
culate the energy needed to assemble the conﬁguration froma set of charges with inﬁnite initial separation.
We assemble the charges one by one, adding the nth
charge at position r
nto the existing collection of n/C01
charges. The energy of this system of point charges is

This is of the form (5)where the regularization parameter is

For a circle, we may place the nth point charge at angle
2pn=N. Each point charge is indistinguishable so the
energy of the system is simply Ntimes the energy of a sin-
gle point charge, say of index N. The distance between

VI. SMALL GAP METHOD
This was the approach of Ref. 2, known as Hadamard reg-
ularization, where the line has no thickness but an inﬁnitesi-
mal gap is taken around each point in the integration. Unlikethe other regularizations, this one does not represent any
physical object. We start with the naive double integral over
the line (4)for constant density Q/L

again ~E/C14¼Q2=L½1/C0logðp=2Þ/C138.
VII. UNPARAMETERIZED REGULARIZATION
FOR ARBITRARY LINE SHAPE
The methods above all involve a small regularization
parameter. The straight line and circle were simple enough
that we could analytically separate the logarithmic diver-
gence, but for more complicated shapes, the energy must becalculated numerically, which is not straightforward when anarbitrarily small parameter is involved. Ideally, we want a
method to calculate the shape energy directly without having
to subtract two arbitrarily large quantities. To achieve this,we ﬁrst express the energies of the curve of interest ( E) and
the straight line ðE
jÞas integrals as in Eq. (18). The individ-
ual integrals for EandEjdiverge due to the 1 =xsingularity,
but the difference of the two gives a ﬁnite result

which is plotted as a function of L/Rfor different values of c
in Fig. 2. For small candL<2pR, the helix approximates a
circular arc, which we roughly see in the energy. For small c,
every time a new winding is completed at L=R¼2p;4p;6p… the energy increases signiﬁcantly due to the close prox-
imity of the ends of the curve.
The integral (22) can even be applied to self-intersecting
curves, for example, it has been tested on the Lemniscate
ð1shape).
VIII. CONCLUSION
We demonstrated that a range of approaches can be used
to calculate the shape energy of one-dimensional curves: tak-
ing the appropriate limit of thin conducting wires, chains ofmany point charges, and truncating a small length from theintegral bounds. (Two more models similar to the thin con-
ducting wire are considered in the Appendix .) With each
method, we calculated the ﬁnite difference between the twodivergent energies. We also found that the spheroid modelfor the straight line could not be compared to the circle due
to the spheroid’s varying radius; the regularizations of each
line segment must be identical in order for us to comparetheir energies. Another possible approach which we did not
cover is dimensional regularization of the Coulomb force.
4
For more complex curves, we constructed the integral (22)
where the energy of a straight line is subtracted inside theintegrand. Unlike the other methods, it doesn’t involve a reg-ularization parameter, so it is straightforward to use for any
curve whose coordinates are known as a function of the arc
length. We used the integral (22) to numerically calculate
the shape energy of a circular arc and a helix, which are new
results to the best of our knowledge and can aid in the study
of wrapping charged ﬁbers. Other energies associated withone dimensional curves are studied in the knot theory
17,18
and the self-inductance/magnetic energy of thin wires,19
where various related mathematical techniques are used.
Regularized integrals similar to (22)could be useful in these
areas, for example, it generalizes straightforwardly to mag-netostatics and self-inductance.

APPENDIX A: THIN SOLID TUBE MODEL
To re-enforce the idea that the shape energy is indepen-
dent of regularization, we will look at two more models.
In this section, we consider a regularization using a uni-
formly charged solid tube of length L, charge Q, and inﬁni-
tesimal circular cross section of radius rwith regularization
parameter /C15¼r=L. Here, the straight line is modeled by a
uniformly charged thin cylinder, whose exact energy is
derived in Ref. 20, which we take as a series in /C15

is that in the conductor model the charges are free to move
into their minimum energy position at the surface, while to
maintain a uniform volume density, the charges must be held
in place by other forces.
The circle is modeled as a uniformly charged solid torus,
whose exact energy is derived in Ref. 21(Eq. (2.70)) as a
series of toroidal functions, which can be expanded in

Here, we use a one-dimensional cross section with width ‘
much shorter than the line length Land regularization param-
etera¼‘=L. The strip has uniform charge density (which
differs from a conducting strip, where the charge distribution
would vary across the width of the strip).

which is of the form (5).
For the circle, there are two basic orientations of the strip
regularization: with the strip width oriented vertically or hor-
izontally. We should expect that these will give the same
results, because locally both orientations look the same if the
radius of the loop is much larger than the strip width, and for
long range interactions, the orientation of the strip doesn’t
change the distance between charges signiﬁcantly.
First, we consider the upright circular strip, which is a
short cylindrical shell of height ‘, radius R¼L=2p, with uni-
form surface charge density r¼Q=ðL‘Þ. Starting from the
