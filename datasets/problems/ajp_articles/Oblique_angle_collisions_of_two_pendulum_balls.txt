Measurements are presented on oblique angle collisions between two identical balls, each
suspended as pendulum bobs. If one ball is at rest and is struck by the other ball incident withoutspin at an oblique angle, then both balls spin in the same direction after the collision. The results
can be explained in terms of friction between the balls. At glancing angles, the balls slide
throughout the collision. At other angles of incidence, the balls initially slide, then grip, and then
slide again when the balls release their grip. The collision can be described in terms of two
different coefﬁcients of restitution: one involving the normal incident and post-collision speeds andthe other involving the tangential speeds of the contact points before and after the collision. The
coefﬁcient of restitution and the collision time vary with the collision speed but remain relatively
constant if the speed changes by a factor less than about two.

I. INTRODUCTION
A head-on collision between two balls is a standard topic
in elementary mechanics courses and has been studied by
researchers since Newton’s time to measure the coefﬁcientof restitution or the collision time or to examine the Hertzmodel of collisions between spheres. If the path of the center
of mass of one ball is not coincident with the center of mass
of the other ball then the collision is called an oblique-angleor off-center collision. Much less attention has been given tooblique angle collisions between two spheres, although sev-
eral studies have been reported on oblique collisions of bil-
liard balls.
1–3In those studies, friction between the balls was
ignored since billiard balls are very smooth and since theauthors were mainly interested in the effects of friction
between the ball and the billiard table. Mungan and
Lipscombe described oblique angle collisions between ballsof different mass and diameter, also ignoring friction.

Oblique collisions between pucks and disks have also been
investigated with similar results.5–9In an ideal, perfectly
elastic, and zero friction world, if one circular object is inci-dent obliquely on an identical object at rest then the twoobjects emerge at right angles to each other after the colli-
sion. Disks and spheres behave in the same manner in that
respect and can be described by the same collision equations.
Experimental measurements of oblique angle collisions
between spheres are rare. Labous et al. presented measure-
ments of the normal and tangential coefﬁcients of restitution
for oblique collisions of nylon spheres.
10A similar experi-
ment was described by Foerster et al. using small glass and
acetate spheres.11Both experiments were undertaken by pro-
jecting two spheres along separate paths so that they collided
with each other, the result being recorded on a video ﬁlm.
That type of experiment is technically difﬁcult and was con-ducted to investigate the basic physics of collisions betweensmall granular particles.
A simpler experimental arrangement is described in the
present paper, suitable for student use, using two pendulum
balls as shown in Fig. 1. Each ball was suspended by identi-
cal lengths of string from two horizontal rods separatedby about one ball diameter. Steel balls were suspended by
passing the string through a small tube welded to the top of
the ball, allowing the balls to rotate freely. A similararrangement, but with a biﬁlar suspension, is commonly
used to support each ball in Newton’s cradle. Other balls
were suspended by passing the string through a vertical hole
drilled through the ball, also allowing for free rotation. Theupper end of the string was tied ﬁrmly to its support rod but
could be pushed by hand along the rod. While one ball
remained at rest, the other ball was pulled aside and allowedto collide with the ball at rest. The angle of incidence was
varied by moving the upper end of one pendulum along its
supporting rod. The collision was ﬁlmed from above at 300frames s
/C01to measure the incident and post-collision speeds
and angles immediately before and after the collision, before
tension in the supporting strings affected the results.
Regardless of the type of ball used, the balls emerge at an
angle less than 90/C14to each other, and both balls spin in the
same direction at about the same rotation speed after the col-
lision. Both effects are due to friction between the balls. The
initial angular momentum of the incident ball is conserved asa result of the collision, which helps us to explain how rota-
tion arises even when neither ball is rotating initially.
6,9
Details of the collision process depend on whether the balls
impact at small glancing angles, in which case sliding fric-
tion controls the dynamics, or whether the balls collide at
larger angles, in which case static friction determines theoutcome. Four different balls were examined using this
method, and the results are presented below, together with a
theoretical model of the collision process.

lision is inelastic then the incident ball emerges with a non-
zero V2ycomponent since the ball retains some of its initial
momentum in the ydirection, so h<90/C14. If the friction force
is not zero then the struck ball emerges with a non-zero vx
component and with b>0. Friction causes both balls to
rotate after the collision, ideally at the same angular velocity,withx¼x
2. In practice, the angular velocities were found
to be slightly different, indicating that Ndoes not necessarily
act along a line through the center of each ball. The contactsurface of colliding balls always has a ﬁnite area and is nevera single point, even when steel balls collide. If Nis slightly
offset from the ball centers, then it will generate a torque
that increases the spin of one ball and decreases the spin ofthe other ball by the same amount. In the following discus-sion, it is assumed that x

For example, if lk¼0:2,ey¼1, and a¼2=5, then Eq. (10)

slide throughout the collision at glancing angles greater than
54.5/C14but will grip at some stage during the collision at
smaller angles of incidence.
B. Grip solutions
If the sliding speed decreases to zero during the collision
then the contact surfaces mutually come to rest and the fric-tion force then arises from static friction. There is then no
simple relation between Fand N, but the collision can be
described by a tangential coefﬁcient of restitution, e
x, deﬁned
in terms of the relative tangential speeds of the contact
points.9–11It is assumed that exis independent of the colli-
sion speed, as observed in previous experimental measure-ments of e
xusing clean, dry balls.10–14Experimental results
using wet balls are described elsewhere.15Students may be
familiar with the fact that wet superballs do not grip as well
as dry superballs. For the collision in Fig. 2, the tangential
velocity of the incident ball is V1xbefore the collision and
V2x/C0Rxafter the collision, while the tangential velocity of
the other ball is zero before the collision and vxþRxafter
the collision. The tangential coefﬁcient of restitution is
deﬁned in the same way that eyis deﬁned and is given by the
ratio

If the balls stop sliding at the end of the collision, or if they

the friction force Fis zero during the whole collision then
vx¼0 and V2x¼V1xsoex¼/C01 from Eq. (12) andx¼0. In
general, ex<0 if the balls slide throughout the collision, and
ex>0 if the balls grip during the collision. However, some
balls can grip during the collision and then bounce with
ex<0, meaning that the ball slides forward rather than back-
ward after it releases its grip.11
If a block of wood remains at rest on an incline, then the
static friction force is larger than the subsequent friction
force if the block starts sliding down the incline. A slidingball is different. If a ball is sliding along a horizontal surface
and then starts rolling, there is a large reduction in the fric-
tion force. Rolling friction is a static friction force since thebottom of the ball is at rest on the horizontal surface. In asimilar way, there is a large reduction in the friction force if
a ball incident on a surface starts sliding and then grips the
surface. For a bouncing ball, the friction force due to static
friction is less than that due to sliding friction, so the hori-zontal impulse on each ball decreases if the balls grip during
the collision. The impulse can be measured from the change
in horizontal speed or from the ratio

which is equal to lkif the balls slide throughout the collision
and is less than lkif the balls grip during the collision. The
static friction force can even reverse direction during the col-lision since the balls vibrate in a tangential direction as well
as in the normal direction.
11,12The duration of the collision
depends mainly on the period of oscillation in the normaldirection.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Oblique collisions between identical balls were investi-
gated for four different types of ball, namely, (a) two small
billiard balls of mass 34.0 g and radius 19.05 mm, (b) two
steel bearing balls of mass 45.3 g and radius 11.15 mm, (c)two golf balls of mass 45.3 g and radius 22.0 mm, and (d)
two hollow rubber balls of mass 46 g and radius 30.0 mm.
Small billiard balls are used in a miniature table top versionof billiards known as bobs. Each ball was suspended as apendulum bob with a pendulum length of about 230 mm
depending on the ball diameter. About 25 collisions of each
ball pair were recorded to cover a range of incident angles(/) from 5
/C14to 70/C14, at incident speeds V1varying from 1.5 to
1.8 m/s. No signiﬁcant variation of any parameter with V1
was detected, apart from the post-collision spin which was
proportional to V1. Consequently, post-collision spin values
were normalized to the incident speed, as plots of Rx=V1vs
/, where xis the average angular velocity of the two balls
measured after each collision.
Each impact was recorded at 300 frames s/C01to measure
the velocity components in the xandydirections, as well as
the angular velocity of each ball, all within 63%. Lines
drawn on the top of each ball were used to determine the
rotation angle from one video frame to the next. Video data
were analyzed with Tracker software using a circle aroundeach ball to accurately locate the ball centers in each video
frame. Raw data results for each collision (i.e., v
x,vy, and x)
were used to calculate values of ex,ey, and COF for every

collision. These values are plotted in Fig. 3and tabulated in
the supplementary material.16
The value of eyis close to 1.0 for both the billiard and
steel balls, except at large values of /. A decrease in eyat
large /was observed for all four balls, for reasons that are
not obvious. The usual observation for balls that impact nor-mally on a horizontal surface is that e
ydecreases as the
impact speed increases due to the increased energy loss forhigh speed impacts. However, the present situation is differ-
ent since the incident ball is incident at a small glancing
angle at large values of /, so tangential deformation of each
ball could interfere with deformation and energy recovery inthe normal direction.
The observed values of e
xare consistent with previous
measurements for balls impacting obliquely on a horizontal
surface.12–14That is, exis usually positive when the ball
grips the surface and is negative if the ball slides throughoutthe collision. A change in sign of e
xcan usually be taken as
marking the transition between slip and grip. A positivevalue of e
xindicates that the ball spins faster than it would if
it bounced in a rolling mode where Rx¼vxandex¼0o na
horizontal surface. If the ball spins faster than that value then
it slides backwards on the surface as it loses its grip andbounces off the surface with e
x>0. However, some balls
(including hollow rubber balls) grip the surface and thenbounce with Rx<v
xwhen the ball loses its grip, so itbounces with ex<0. That is why the hollow rubber ball
bounced with ex<0 at small values of /, while the other
three balls bounced with ex>0 at small values of /.
An alternative measure of the time-average friction force
during each collision is shown by the plot of COF vs /in
Fig.3, where COF is deﬁned in Eq. (16).H o w e v e r ,C O Fr e p -
resents the ratio of the frictional and normal force impulses,
both of which vary as /varies. An increase in COF can,
therefore, represent either an increase inÐFd tor a decrease
inÐNd t or both. An independent measure ofÐNd t can be
obtained from the velocity component vysinceÐ
Nd t¼mvy.
It is clear that the rubber balls gripped for most of the
impact duration at small values of /since the value of COF
was very low in that range. The COF value increased only atlarge values of /, implying that the sliding phase then lasted
for a longer time before the balls gripped, and it increased
well above the value of COF for the other balls. The post-collision angle bfor the rubber ball was, therefore, relatively
large at large values of /where tan b¼COF¼0.7 when

The raw data used to present the results in Fig. 3were also
used to calculate the angles h,band the dimensionless ratio
Rx=V1for each collision and are presented in Fig. 4. Since
the angular velocities of the two balls after the collision dif-
fered by up to about 30% in some collisions, an average ofthe two values was recorded for each collision. In all four

cases, the post-collision angle, h, was close to 90/C14, and the
angle bwas close to zero with small differences due to the
friction force acting on each ball. An exception was the largeincrease in bfor the hollow rubber ball at glancing angles,
where the coefﬁcient of friction was much higher than that
for the other balls.
Experimental results for handbin Fig. 4are compared
with theoretical sliding solutions given by tan b¼l
kand
Eq.(9), and with the grip solutions given in Eqs. (16) and
(17), using constant values of lk,ey, and exin each region.
Actual values of eyandexare shown in Fig. 3for each colli-
sion, indicating that these parameters vary with /but remain
approximately constant in each of the two regions.Experimental values of Rx=V
1in Fig. 4are compared with
the theoretical solutions given in Eqs. (8)and(15). A differ-
ent procedure was used to calculate the theoretical solutionsin Fig. 4(d), as explained in Sec. IV, since good ﬁts could
not be obtained using constant values of e
xandey.
The angular velocity, x, varied with /,w i t ham a x i m u ma t
around /¼40/C14for the ﬁrst three balls, but with no obvious
maximum for the rubber ball. A maximum in Rx=V1arises,
because it is proportional to sin /in the grip region, from Eq.
(15), and proportional to cos /in the sliding region, from Eq.
(8). Since the angular velocity is proportional to the friction
force impulse from Eq. (6), it can be assumed that the friction
force is a maximum when the angular velocity is a maximum,marking a change from sliding to static friction. At glancing
angles where /is large, V1yis small so the normal reaction
force and the sliding friction force are both small. The frictionforce, therefore, increases as /decreases, up to a limit where
sliding throughout the collision ceases and grip commences,
coinciding with a change in the sign of e
x.
IV. MODEL CALCULATIONS
Given that exvaries with impact angle, it is not obvious that it
is a useful parameter to describe oblique angle collisions. The
same problem arises when a ball impacts obliquely on a rigid,
horizontal surface. In that case, glancing angle collisions can beused to measure the coefﬁcient of sliding friction and the normal
coefﬁcient of restitution, but e
xvaries with the angle of inci-
dence at both high and low angles of incidence. Nevertheless, ameasurement of e
xprovides a useful indication of the effects of
tangential deformation for any given ball and surface. For exam-
ple, superballs spin more rapidly than other balls since theyhave a higher value of e
x. In a similar way, polyester tennis
strings generate higher ball spin than other strings since they
have a higher value of ex.
The variation of exwith/can be measured experimentally
for any given ball, in the same way that eyandlkcan be mea-
sured experimentally in order to model the collision accurately.
Even though exis not a constant, experimental data can be ﬁttedFig. 4. Experimental results obtained for the four pairs of balls showing Rx=V1and the post-collision angles handb. Smooth curves are theoretical solutions

sionless ratio Rx=V1is plotted on the right vertical axis.

either by average values of exin the grip and slide regions or by
a smooth polynomial curve to model both regions. The formertechnique was used to model the grip and slide regions sepa-
rately in Figs. 4(a)–4(c) . The latter technique was used to model
the experimental results in Fig. 4(d) since the rubber balls
gripped at all values of /without a clear sliding region. That is,
grip solutions were ﬁtted to the data using the quadratic ﬁt to e

Equation (20) was used to calculate the theoretical solutions
in Fig. 5, thereby bypassing the need to separately model the
sliding phase of the collision. That is, the sliding region wasmodelled with negative values of e
xrather than with a con-
stant value of lk. The theoretical solutions were obtained
from Eqs. (13)–(15) together with Eqs. (4)–(6) , even in the
region where sliding was expected during the whole colli-sion. The theoretical solutions in Fig. 5provide an improved
ﬁt to the steel ball data (compared with the theoretical solu-tions in Fig. 4(b)), as expected, since e

V. CONCLUSION
The collision of one object with another is a common
event that is well known to physicists and that is mentionedbrieﬂy in most introductory courses in mechanics. Oblique
collisions are more complicated than head-on collisionssince static and sliding friction forces are both involved in
general. Nevertheless, billiard players develop an intuitive
understanding of the process and are familiar with the 90
/C14
rule applying to the post-collision angles of two smooth
balls. Similarly, tennis players develop an intuitive under-
standing of the post-collision angle and spin of a ball thatbounces obliquely off a tennis racquet or a tennis court.
Oblique angle collisions are of interest to researchers
involved in the physics of sport, granular matter, molecular
dynamics, etc. but could also be investigated by studentsusing simple apparatus such as that described in the present
paper. Experimental results are easily obtained and highlight
the fact that two separate coefﬁcients of restitution areneeded to describe oblique angle collisions. Approximate
theoretical solutions can be obtained by ignoring friction
between colliding balls. However, the effects of friction areclearly evident in experimental data. When one ball collideswith another at rest, friction acts to decrease the tangential
speed of the incident ball and to increase the tangential speed
of the ball at rest, and it also results in rotation of both balls.At glancing angles, the balls slide throughout the collision.
At other angles, the balls slide initially, then grip, and then
slide again when the balls release their grip.
Analytical solutions describing the post-collision speeds,
spins, and angles can be obtained in terms of the two coefﬁ-
cients of restitution, e
yandex, or in terms of eyand the coef-
ﬁcient of sliding friction, lk, if the balls slide throughout the
collision. eyremains relatively constant for any given pair of
balls, but exvaries with the angle of incidence. An average
value of exin the grip region can be used for calculation pur-
poses, and the results can be compared with other values of
exto determine whether there is any signiﬁcant difference in
the calculated results. Alternatively, if exis measured as a
function of the angle of incidence, then experimental values
ofexand eycan be used as inputs for the theoretical
calculations.
