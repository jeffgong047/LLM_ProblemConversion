(Raymond L. Lee, Jr., Reviewer)
Scholarly books that explore the connections between sci-
ence and art are not uncommon, and some recent titles
include Martin Kemp’s The Science of Art: Optical Themes
in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat (Yale University
Press, 1990, 375 pp.), Barbara Stafford’s Artful Science:
Enlightenment Entertainment and the Eclipse of Visual
Education (MIT Press, 1994, 350 pp.), and Philip Palmedo’s
Deep Afﬁnities: Art and Science (Abbeville Press, 2020, 192
pp.). Historian Lewis Pyenson adds to this distinguished list
his latest book, The Shock of Recognition .
However, Pyenson takes a rather different tack than the
above authors: He applies a method that he calls historical
complementarity to study the intersections of art and science
in the lives or works of particular 20th-century scientists and
artists. Pyenson explains that his “approach examines two
separate domains of intellectual endeavor together, seekingcommon social underpinnings in a particular time and place”(p. 40) with the motifs of the book’s subtitle referring to any
shared themes in art and science (also see Ref. 1).
Incidentally, the book’s title itself has a long interdisciplin-ary history: Literary critic Edmund Wilson’s 1943 Shock of
Recognition collected American writers’ reviews of their lit-
erary colleagues, and this evocative title has since been givento some 30 other books, dissertations, and articles.
Pyenson’s book considers various linkages between non-
Euclidean geometry in physics and a strain of abstractexpressionism in art (p. 55). Some of these include (1) the
education of Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) and Albert Einstein
(1879–1955), (2) interior design and mathematical models,(3) electriﬁcation’s transformative effects on urban life, and
(4) political, artistic, and scientiﬁc currents in 20th-century
Argentina. To illustrate Pyenson’s approach, I examine hisanalysis of the Picasso-Einstein linkage in the book’s Part 2.
As in other book sections, Pyenson synthesizes a vast
array of primary and secondary sources to develop a detailedhistory. In Part 2, this history is of the late 19th-century edu-
cational institutions, theories, and practices in which the
young Picasso and Einstein were immersed. Picasso’s artschool instructors were familiar with the use of descriptive
geometry to model objects (p. 183), and art and science fac-
ulty taught in a shared building intimately familiar to Picasso(p. 158). Yet the scant documentation of Picasso’s time at
these schools does not clearly show the extent of his formal
training in science and mathematics, much less his artisticreaction to these disciplines. Thus, we face a basic limitation
of Pyenson’s approach: If direct evidence does not exist
about artists’ or scientists’ reactions to their education(e.g., written records or ﬁrst-hand recollections), then one
can only suggest what those reactions might be.
In contrast to Picasso, Einstein’s education is amply docu-
mented by many primary sources such as Ref. 2. Pyenson
details how Einstein routinely could have seen reproductionsof ancient sculptures and plaster models of mathematical
functions at both his secondary and undergraduate institu-
tions (pp. 204–216). Such ﬁgures would have provided com-pelling three-dimensional exemplars in Einstein’s studies of
descriptive and projective geometry (p. 210), and they may
underlie his use of Gaussian surfaces to visualize solutions tosome mathematical problems in general relativity (p. 231).
Yet despite the large amount written by Einstein and his
contemporaries, Pyenson’s book can offer only suggested,indirect connections between Einstein and Picasso, who
appear never to have met. However, this limitation does not
diminish the strength of the inferences that Pyenson drawsbetween the two men.
As for the broader issue of linkages between science and
the visual arts, a 19th-century counterexample is useful.American landscapist Frederic Church (1826–1900) was an
enthusiastic advocate for scientiﬁc realism in his massive
trompe l’oeil canvases of spectacular vistas (pp. 92–99 in
Ref. 3). Church avidly consumed the generalist writings of
many of his scientiﬁc contemporaries, including explorer-naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), geologist
and biologist Louis Agassiz (1807–73), physicists John
Tyndall (1820–93) and Ogden Rood (1831–1902), andchemist Michel-Euge `ne Chevreul (1786–1889).
Church sailed in artistic pursuit of icebergs and spent
months in South America studying its then-unfamiliar land-scapes in exacting detail. Several major canvases followed in
1859–1866, such as The Heart of the Andes ,The Iceberg s,
Rainy Season in the Tropics , and Cotopaxi, Ecuador . Public
acclaim for these paintings was as rapid as it was fervent,
and published reviews were equally enthusiastic.
Throughout his career, Church’s work was animated by hissometimes conﬂicting desires to include both current scien-
tiﬁc observations and older visions of the sublime in nature
(i.e., natural features whose greatness inspires awe), asdeﬁned a century earlier by Edmund Burke (1729–97).
However, after years of public acclaim and earnest pursuit of
scientiﬁc exactitude, in 1883 Church could only say resign-
edly “I wish science would take a holiday for ten years so I
could catch up” (p. 99 in Ref. 3). Frederic Church never
would catch up, and many later artists either were uninter-ested in or rejected contemporary science’s worldview. Thus,
we cannot assume that the linkages which Pyenson ﬁnds
between scientiﬁc and artistic expression are necessarilystrong or permanent.
The book’s utility as a reference work is hampered by its
index, which consists almost entirely of persons and institutions.

In contrast, entries for 20th-century political, intellectual,
and artistic movements are usually listed under a person’s
name (e.g., Marxism and cubism appear under Marx and
Picasso, respectively), and so the reader is left to wonder
whether missing topics have been omitted or are merely
listed elsewhere. Although the index is entitled “Index ofNames,” that does not by itself eliminate such uncertainty,
because here “names” also include some movements (e.g.,
both “Bloomsbury circle” and “Oulipo group” are listed) as
well as persons or institutions.
These absent index entries are not trivial, because
Pyenson’s subtitle advertises that he is exploring motifs in
modern art and science. Unfair as it may seem, many readers
ﬁrst consult a nonﬁction book’s index to judge its value as a
reference work. If they do not ﬁnd there the topics or motifsthat interest them most, they may forgo the effort of buying,
reading, and then annotating the entire book in an attempt
to ﬁnd them, a task of some 600 pages here. That would
be a shame for this impressive book, which clearly is theculmination of many years’ research and writing. Despite
some occasional limitations of its approach, it will make aninvaluable addition to any scientist’s library.
