An alternative way to solve the small oscillations problem
Sergio A. Hojman
91(8), p. 579
https://doi.org/10.119/5.0106530An algebraic approach employing new constants of the
motion for dealing with coupled small oscillations is pre-
sented here. It offers new insight into undergraduate mechan-ics and can be most proﬁtably applied in higher dimensional
interacting systems using algebraic manipulation software.
An experimental demonstration of level attraction with
coupled pendulums
Chenyang Lu, Bentley Turner, Yongsheng Gui, Jacob
Burgess, Jiang Xiao, and Can-Ming Hu
91(8), p. 585
https://doi.org/10.119/5.0081906As quantum technologies have developed, it has become
more important to teach students about how the effects of dissi-
pation can be understood, controlled, and even used. When
two pendulums with the same natural frequency are spring cou-pled, the eigenmodes break degeneracy to form an avoided
crossing, also called level repulsion. This creates a beating pat-
tern in the coupled system. But dissipative coupling, in which
energy dissipation is proportional to the relative velocity of the
pendulums, causes level attraction. Pendulums with slightlydifferent natural frequencies oscillate in tandem when dissipa-
tively coupled. This paper shows how to build a dissipative
coupling apparatus and analyzes the system behavior in com-parison to the more commonly used spring coupled system.
Rendezvous revisited: The search for fast-intercept
solutions
Eric M. Edlund
91(8), p. 595
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0095559Imagine you’re on a spacecraft in a circular orbit around a
planet or star. You’d like to catch another object at a differ-
ent point on the same orbit. Your engine thrusters can onlyprovide a brief impulse; in which direction should you aim
your thrust so as to quickly intercept the target? Such ques-tions may show up in science ﬁction as a spacecraft attemptsto catch a rival ship, or when a torpedo needs to be ﬁred to
quickly neutralize an approaching asteroid. However, there
are real-world aerospace engineering applications as well! Asystematic study of this question was initiated by Edlund andpublished in AJP in 2021. In the current paper, the author
concludes the analysis by exploring the “fast-intercept sol-utions” which are mathematically more complicated, butlead to a quicker intercept of the target. Explorations in thisdirection would make excellent projects for undergraduate
students studying advanced mechanics.
Infinite-fold energy degeneracy in 2D square lattices of
magnetic spheres
Kyongwan Kim
91(8), p. 603
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0121937Anyone who has played with magnets knows that when
they are grouped together, their dipole interactions ﬁx theirorientations relative to each other. This strong interactionmakes it difﬁcult to use permanent magnets to study thedipole-dipole interaction. This paper presents a new way to
study this interaction in two dimensions by mounting dipole
magnets inside plastic shells and ﬂoating them on a watersurface to create a compelling demonstration or student labo-ratory. The paper also reveals and explains an unexpectedresult: When dipoles are organized into squares, arrays withodd numbers of dipoles can have their orientation directionrotated continuously, while those with even numbers ofdipoles have a ﬁxed orientation. A video abstract accompa-
nies the online version of this paper.
Helping students apply superposition principle in
problems involving spherical, cylindrical, and planarcharge distributions
Jing Li, Alexandru Maries, and Chandralekha Singh
91(8), p. 613
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0127127As we add complications to physics problems, we often ﬁnd
that students have forgotten concepts that had earlier been mas-tered. This paper demonstrates that students have difﬁcultyapplying the superposition problem in problems that alsorequire the use of Gauss’s law. It provides a set of tested exer-cises that will help students overcome this difﬁculty.

Electromagnetic induction is often demonstrated in class-
room and laboratory settings, but quantitative tests ofFaraday’s law tend to be less frequent. This paper describesan undergraduate-level experiment where the induced volt-age created by dropping a disk magnet through a coilwrapped around a plastic pipe is recorded and compared toan analytic model based on treating the magnet as a dipole.Results are in excellent agreement with the theory; measure-ments are sensitive enough to detect the difference in thepeak voltages induced as the magnet enters and exits the coilas a result of its gravitational acceleration. The paper showshow the experiments can be adapted to make them appropri-ate for students at a variety of levels.
Self-inductance and magnetic flux
Diego J. Casta ~no and Teresa M. Casta ~no
91(8), p. 622
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0098417Did you ever get a headache from wondering what inte-
gration contour or surface you should use when dealing withan E&M exercise? If yes, this paper is for you. It deals withdetermining the inductance L¼U=Iof a circuit. In practical
situations, determining which Ito use (total current? local
current?), or what surface to consider to determine the mag-netic ﬂux U, might take some head-scratching. This paper
solves your troubles by proposing a more tractable way ofcalculating a circuit’s self-inductance, using what is knownas a weighted ﬂux. You can use this article to prepare yourundergraduate E&M classes on induction, or as some readingmaterial for students.
Introducing corrugated surfaces in electrostatic
problems via a perturbative approach
Alexandre P. Costa, Lucas Queiroz, Edson C. M.
Nogueira, and Danilo T. Alves
91(8), p. 629
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0099928Certain electrostatics problems will be familiar to all stu-
dents who have studied electromagnetism. Examples ofthese classic problems include calculating the electric poten-tial from a point charge near an inﬁnite conducting plane orcalculating the resulting electric ﬁeld when an inﬁnitely longconducting cylinder is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld.Physical situations such as these become both more realisticand more challenging if the conducting surface is not sym-metrical, or if it is irregular in some way. In this article,examples of these more difﬁcult problems are analyzed per-turbatively under the assumption that the conducting surfacespossess small corrugations (as any realistic surface would).Readers will enjoy this stimulating article as they gain expo-sure to some challenging electrostatics problems as well asthe mathematical technique of solving differential equationsperturbatively using Green’s functions.
The nuclear optical model and its optical-scattering
analog: Mie scattering
F. D. Becchetti91(8), p. 637
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0152813It’s delightful when what we’ve learned in one ﬁeld of
physics gives insight into an entirely different ﬁeld. This
paper points out parallels between optical Mie scattering and
the nuclear optical model of scattering and may help those
who are familiar with one of these topics to better understand
the other.

To support instructors who wish to teach about cosmologi-
cal horizons, this paper presents a pedagogical treatment of
our understanding of the topic for the case of a ﬂat universe.

Conditional probability as found in nature: Facilitated
diffusion
Ori Hachmo and Ariel Amir
91(8), p. 653
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0123866Diffusion is remarkably slow, but nature ﬁnds fascinating
ways to overcome that speed limit. Transcription factors
regulate gene expression in cells, and to ﬁnd their target,
these proteins must traverse the entire DNA molecule, a pro-
cess that would take thousands of hours if it proceeded
purely by diffusion. Instead, a facilitated diffusion process is
used, in which the protein regularly falls off the DNA and
reattaches in a random location, speeding the search processto the timescale of tens of minutes that is required for cells
to live. This paper would form the basis of an interesting
lecture or problem set in a course on biophysics or mathe-
matical methods.
Perfect and imperfect pitchfork bifurcations
in a V-shaped spring-mass system: Comment on
“Hysteresis in a simple V-shaped spring-mass system”
[Am. J. Phys. 89, 663–665 (2021)]
J. J. Bissell and A. M. Nagaitis
91(8), p. 659
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0079561
Although students already have an intuitive understanding
of common thermodynamic phases, phase transitions can still
be a difﬁcult concept to grasp. This comment on a previous
paper by C. Ong shows how varying a length scale in a simple
mechanical mass-spring system causes a transition from one
equilibrium point to three equilibria (a pitchfork bifurcation)
as the spring forces go from tension to compression. The
authors have also analyzed oscillations, which slow as the sys-
tem approaches the critical point. Though the difﬁculty ofﬁnding springs that work in both compression and tension
likely precludes a laboratory demonstration in which the full
range of behavior can be observed in a single system, a two-
system demonstration could be used.
