We study how a bound notebook page can be folded once so that the page is visible when the notebook
is closed and becomes a bookmark. An add itional practical requirement is that the folded page stays
within the same side of the bind, so that it does not get creased further when one closes the notebook.This simple problem displays a remarkably rich bifurcation behavior, which can be analyzed using
undergraduate calculus. The main ﬁnding is that the optimal way of folding the page depends on the
pages aspect ratio and changes abruptly when the latter exceeds the critical value of 1.207 11.This behavior also resembles a ﬁrst-order phase transition in therm odynamics despite its geometric
origin.

I. INTRODUCTION
Folding, as a general method of transforming geometries,
is found everywhere. Clothes, bi-fold doors, umbrellas, air-
bags, solar panels, and wings of insects and birds1,2are just
some common examples. Folding allows a thin object to bestored compactly while remaining easily deployable, ortransformed into structures with new capabilities (e.g.,
origami).
In mathematics, origami, a slightly constrained form of
folding, has been formalized into an axiomatic system.
3
Analysis and computation aid in the creation of novel ori-gami designs.4Interestingly, folding has a mathematical
capability that outperforms compass-and-straightedge con-
struction and can be used to solve classical problems such as“angle trisection” or “doubling the cube.”5,6
Folding is also common in physical sciences. A prominent
example is the protein folding problem, where one would
like to establish the 3D protein structure from an amino acid
sequence alone. Recently, deep learning allowed for a majorbreakthrough in answering this question.7Interestingly, fold-
ing (together with stretching) is also a useful concept in
mixing of highly viscous ﬂuids. The diverse folding mecha-
nisms, including mechanical, capillary, thermal, and chemi-cal folding, can beneﬁt a wide range of micro-scaleapplications.
8,9Back at the ofﬁce, a violently folded
(or crumpled) piece of paper has remarkable physical insight
buried in its crease network.10,11
Admittedly, the mathematical, physical, or biological
study of folds is full of surprises. This work presents onesimple problem, in which folding a notebook page exhibits
an interesting bifurcation behavior. Given a pocket notebook
of length 1 in the xdirection and lin the ydirection (Fig. 1),
a folded page can extend beyond the side bounds of itsunfolded state, remaining visible when the notebook is
closed and thus serving as a bookmark. Then, what is the
optimal way to fold the page? Although preferences vary, weassume in this paper that the optimal fold maximizes thebookmark length e(Fig. 1), which is the length by which the
page extends beyond its unfolded width along the xaxis. In
addition, the top edge of the page should not be torn offaconstraint similar to the one experienced by birds and insectswhen folding their wings due to the joint between the wings
and body. Aside from this ﬁrst constraint, the folded page
should not extend past the top edge of the notebook, or itwill be creased further when closing the notebook. This is
the second constraint.
We will begin by considering the ﬁrst constraint alone and
then solve the complete problem, using only undergraduate
calculus. This paper concludes by proposing several possible
directions for future explorations.
II. ELEMENTARY CASES
We start our analysis by considering only the ﬁrst con-
straint. Without loss of generality, we assume that the page
is bound at its topedge, and the fold is in the upper-right
direction (as in Fig. 1). Then the objective is to have the
folded page extend rightward as much as possible, while
keeping the top edge ﬁxed.
Using the coordinate system deﬁned in Fig. 1, the fold
maps the original rectangle X¼½0;1/C138/C2½0;l/C138to a new region
X
0. The optimal fold is the one that maximizes the excess
length, which is denoted by ein Fig. 1. One may interpret X0
as one state of the system, and eas the negative of the states
potential energy. Then the optimal fold that maximizes eis
the one that minimizes the systems energy.
Folding the page amounts to choose a straight crease in X
and reﬂect the region below itwhich we will call the “folded
Fig. 1. The notebook and its folded page that motivated this work. The note-
book has a width 1 and a height l. The excess length eis maximized by the
optimal fold (subject to constraints) so that the folded page serves as an
effective bookmark.

region”with respect to this line. For a rectangular page, there
are only two possible cases: either the crease crosses the leftand bottom edges and the folded region is a triangle (Fig. 2,
case 1), or it crosses the left and right edges in which case
the folded region is a trapezoid (Fig. 2, cases 2a and 2b).
Regardless of the crease location, ewill be determined by
the location of a corner point of X(otherwise, there is always
a neighboring point that, once reﬂected, is further to the
right). For this reason, we only need to consider the corners
of the folded region.
In both cases, we will ﬁrst ﬁnd the xcoordinate of the
rightmost point of the folded region, which is denoted by x
e.
xemay correspond to different page corners, depending on
how we fold the page (refer to Fig. 2) and is related to eby
e¼xe/C01.
Case 1 :
The crease line crosses the left edge at a distance afrom
the lower-left corner and the bottom edge at a distance b
from the lower-left corner (Fig. 2, case 1). In this case, the
folded region is triangle DOBA, and the right most point is
O0. We have

(including the square page shown in Fig. 1), substituting
a¼b¼linxegives x/C3

As a result, e/C3¼l/C01/C200. This means that, for a short
page, it is impossible to fold a bookmark using case 1creases.
When l>1, meaning the page is “long and narrow,”
substituting a¼landb¼1 givesx

Because e/C3>0, a bookmark can be folded for a long page.
The optimal crease line then coincides with the page diago-
nal that connects the upper-left and lower-right corners.
However, the limit lim l!þ1 e/C3ðl;1Þ¼1 is the maximum
possible excess length, no matter how long the page is.
Case 2 :
The crease line crosses the left edge at a distance afrom
the lower-left corner and the right edge at a distance bfrom
the lower-right corner (Fig. 2, cases 2a and 2b). In this case,
the folded region is trapezoid OCBA , with a/C21bfor the fold
to be in the upper-right direction. We deﬁne has the angle
between the crease line and the x-axis. Clearly,
tanh¼a/C0b. The rightmost point in X0depends on the
value of h:I ti s C0when h/C2045/C14(Fig. 2, case 2a) and O0
when h>45/C14(Fig. 2, case 2b).

With a/C0b/C201, Eq. (2)increases monotonically with a.

Because e/C3>0, this fold leads to a valid bookmark regard-
less of the value of l. For example, if the page is square
(l¼1), we have e/C31;2/C0ﬃﬃﬃ

whereas, in the same condition, case 1 leads to e/C3¼0 (an
invalid bookmark). One can easily show that, for a given
height l, solution Eq. (3)always outperforms the solution of
case 1.
When lis large, Eq. (3)is approximately

So for a thin paper strip (high aspect ratio), the optimal fold
tends to overlap the left edge with the top edge using a crease
line that passes through the upper-left corner and is at 45/C14
with respect to the x-axis (the gray fold in Fig. 3). Certainly,
in the limit of an inﬁnitely long strip, the page resembles a
line and this fold isoptimal: It simply reorients the page
horizontally.
Case 2b. When h/C2145/C14(i.e., a/C0b/C211),xe¼xO0and
eða;bÞ¼asin 2h/C01¼a2/C0b2/C01
1þða/C0bÞ2: (5)
With a/C0b/C211, Eq. (5)increases monotonically with b.
Setting b¼l/C01 gives a¼l,h¼45/C14, and e/C3¼l/C01.
Because h¼45/C14, this solution is also a special case of case
2a and is always sub-optimal compared with the solution
(Eq.(3)) to case 2a.
All cases considered, the optimal fold is Eq. (3)of case 2a
and resembles the illustration Fig. 2, case 2a.
III. CONSTRAINT BY THE TOP EDGE
We continue our analysis by including the second con-
straint: The folded page should stay within one side of thebind, that is to say, “below” the bindso that it does not get
accidentally creased when one closes the notebook. We start
from case 2a, which gave us the optimal fold consideringonly the ﬁrst constraint, and improve it to satisfy the secondconstraint. One will see that the additional constraint leads to
bifurcation behaviors of the optimal solution.
In case 2a, the optimally folded page does exceed the top
edge (i.e., the bind). This is shown by ﬁnding the maximum y
coordinate of X
0, which is deﬁned at point O0(refer to Fig. 2,
case 2a)

Substituting aandbfrom Eq. (3)gives

The constraint that limits the yextent reads ye/C20l. Together
with Eqs. (2)and(6), we ﬁnally have the complete problem
statement as

0/C20a/C20l;
b/C21a/C01;
2a/C20lð1þða/C0bÞ2Þ: (7)
It is important to keep in mind the physical picture behind
Eq.(7), which is the maximization of the xcoordinate of
point C0subject to the constraint imposed on the ycoordinate
of point O0, being understood that C0andO0result from the
isometric transformation (i.e., shape-preserving) of the page
upon folding along the crease line.
The accessible region of the ( a,b) phase space according to
Eq.(7)i ss h o w ni nF i g . 4(shaded area) for l/C211. Each point inthe accessible region represents one way to fold the page without
violating any of our constraints. At low a, the region is bounded
by the condition b/C20a. At higher values, it is determined by
2a/C20lð1þða/C0bÞ2Þand is, therefore, more complicated. Still,
one can show that @e=@a/C210, so that e/C3occurs on the curve
boundary. One might also notice that e¼0 along the other two
(straight) boundaries of the accessible region.
The equation of the curved boundary is b¼a

(the other solution b¼aþﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2al/C0l2p
=lviolates b/C20aand is
discarded). Points on this boundary correspond to a specialkind of folding: the ones for which the pages lower-left cor-ner overlaps with its top edge. This physical picture explainsthe lower limit l=2 for a. The remaining constraint,
b/C21a/C01, is automatically satisﬁed on this boundary.

The aspect ratio litself becomes a parameter that affects the
optimal solution.
In Fig. 5,e(a,l) as given in Eq. (8)is plotted as a function of
afor ﬁve different values of l. The local and global maxima of
each curve are marked with open and solid circles. When lis
small (1.0 and 1.1), we have a unique local maximum, which is
also the global maximum. The maximum occurs at @e=@a¼0,
which leads to an algebraic equation a4¼ð2a/C0lÞl.T h es o l u -
tion ain¼ainðlÞ(a complex algebraic expression in lthat can
be obtained using any computer algebra system), whensubstituted into Eq. (8), gives the local optimal solution

Because the solutions are such that ainðlÞis within the corre-
sponding range in a(a2½l=2;l/C138), we call them internal solu-
tions. The crease lines intersect with the pages left edge but
do not pass through either of its two end points.

Eq.(7), corresponds to the shaded area.

Aslincreases, the right boundary point of the curve rises
continuously (see Fig. 5). Substituting a¼lin Eq. (8)gives
the excess of those points as
^ebdðlÞ¼l/C01: (10)
In addition, b¼l/C01 and h¼45/C14(refer to hin Fig. 2). We
call those points the boundary solutions. Their crease lines
pass the top-left corner of the page as illustrated in Fig. 3
(gray fold).
The boundary and internal solutions become equal at the
critical value lcr¼1.20711, which can only be found numer-
ically by solving ^einðlÞ¼^ebdðlÞoreðainðlÞ;lÞ¼l/C01. The
solution steps for MATHEMATICA are provided in the Appendix
as an example.
When lis greater than lcr, the optimal solution e/C3jumps
from the internal solution to the boundary solution.
Interestingly, the internal solution ceases to exist beyond a
second critical value lcr2. This is caused by the change of
concavity of the e(a,l) curves in Fig. 5. The critical value
lcr2is obtained by solving
@eða;lÞ
@a¼@2eða;lÞ
@a2¼0; (11)
with e(a,l) from Eq. (8). Numerically, lcr2¼3ﬃﬃﬃ

/C251:29904.
To further understand the disappearance of the internal
solution, Fig. 5plots its trajectory as lis increased (dotted
curve). In addition, Fig. 5plots the trajectory of the local
minima (dashed curve). It is clear that, as lincreases, the two
solutions approach each other. They coincide when l¼lcr2
and, as a pair, spontaneously disappear (Fig. 6will also show
this).
In the top part of Fig. 6, three pages with increasing aspect
ratios are each folded in many different ways, and the trajec-tories of the lower-right page corner ( C
0in Fig. 2) are
recorded by thick black curves. The internal and boundary
solutions are marked in the leftmost example. As lincreases,
the optimal solution clearly changes from the internal to theboundary solution.
Overall, the solution to e
/C3as a function of the page aspect
ratio lhas three distinct behaviors, which is surprising for
such a simple problem. A graphical summary is found at thebottom of Fig. 6, which plots the internal solution ^einðlÞ
and the boundary solution ^ebdðlÞ; the maximum of the two
gives e/C3. The two curves intersect at the critical point
lcr/C251:20711, which signals an abrupt change of the optimal
fold state. Figure 6also plots the excess length given by the
local minima (gray curve). This curve is the dashed curve inFig.5but plotted as a function of linstead of a(l). It inter-
sects with the internal solution at l¼l
cr2, forming a cusp
where the two solutions annihilate. The jump of the optimal
solution from the internal solution branch to the boundary
solution branch as well as the spontaneous disappearance ofextrema in pair are all well-known manifestations of bifurca-tions. Interestingly, the behavior of e
/C3can be loosely likened
to the (negative of) free energy in ﬁrst-order phasetransitions.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we investigated an everyday physics
question, “how to optimally fold a rectangular notebookpage into a bookmark?” so that the folded page remainsmost visible but stays within one side of the notebook
bind. The solution to this problem is unexpectedly rich
given that the problem is governed by a single controlparameter, the pages aspect ratio. In particular, this sys-tem exhibits a bifurcating behavior found in dynamicalsystems.
While related to origami, the problem has a ﬁxed edge and
makes a single fold. To distinguish the two, we may name
ours as the “1-fold bookmark problem.” A few extensions
can be readily proposed for future studies.
(1) Use, for example, circular or even concave pages. For a
circular page, one may ﬁx its topmost point, as there isno straight edge. Regardless of its shape, the page can becontained within a bounding rectangle. Or more intui-tively, it can be glued on top of a larger rectangular“bounding page.” The maximum excess length of the
bounding page is known from the current work and is
always greater than that of the bounded page. Thus, thecurrent work provides useful upper limits even for fold-ing pages of arbitrary shapes.
(2) Extend to higher dimensions. This is challenging to rep-
resent. While the page in our problem is two-dimensional, during folding, it temporarily relies on the
third dimension. Similarly, folding a three-dimensional
shape relies on the fourth dimension.
(3) Allow more than one fold to tackle the n-fold bookmark
problem. Because each fold yields a more complexshape, the geometric complexity increases rapidly.However, a quick look at the “2-fold” problem of asquare page shows that a simple 2-fold solution easily
beats our optimal 1-fold solution: ﬁrst fold the square
along its diagonal to have an isosceles right triangle andthen fold the triangle to align its longer edge with its topedge. This gives e¼ﬃﬃﬃ
