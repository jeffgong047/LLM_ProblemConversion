Previous work treated the problem of a mass sliding over a rough spherical surface in broad
generality, providing both analytic and numerical solutions. This paper examines special cases of2D motion along a surface meridian when the initial speed is precisely chosen so that the sliding
mass nearly stops before speeding up and subsequently leaving the surface. Carrying the solution
for these critical cases into the time domain via both an analytical method and numericalintegration adds richness that might otherwise be missed. The numerical method raises practical
mathematical issues that must be handled carefully to obtain accurate results. Although
conceptually simple, this classical mechanics problem is an excellent vehicle for students to gainproﬁciency with mathematical analysis tools and further their appreciation for how applied
mathematics can bring new insight into situations where intuition may fall short.

I. INTRODUCTION
The motion of a mass msliding on a spherical surface
under the inﬂuence of gravity addresses many concepts inelementary classical mechanics and yet offers surpriseseven for experienced physicists. In the absence of friction,
this problem is accessible to beginning students and
appears in many introductory mechanics texts (see Refs. 1and 2 of Ref. 3). However, when friction is present,
1–6an
unexpected richness in the motion arises that may be hid-
den in a cursory analysis. A close examination of the widerange of possible behaviors can be carried out within aNewtonian framework using mathematics and a numerical
analysis that are familiar to undergraduate physics
students.
In Ref. 2, Mungan treated 2D motion along a meridian,
deriving the speed vhðÞof the sliding mass as a function of
polar angle hand also identifying the condition for the mass
to remain in contact with the spherical surface: v
2/C20rgcosh,
where ris the radius of the surface and gis the gravitational
acceleration. In Ref. 1, the author extended this work by
allowing azimuthal motion on the surface and by describingthe motion in the time domain. The present paper focuses ona fascinating feature of the 2D motion—the “notch” in vhðÞ
where the mass nearly comes to a complete stop before
speeding up again, leading to a wide plateau in the behaviorofh(t). We also extend the friction coefﬁcient range to [1,
100].
In the general case, the availability of analytic solutions
forvhðÞis somewhat limited (as Ref. 2nicely illustrates),
and we are forced to turn to numerical solutions. This allows
us to explore the motion over the full range of variables
h;tðÞ , initial energy, and coefﬁcient of friction l, without
limitation. Thus, the problem presents a conceptually simpleenvironment for application of the mathematical tool set that
undergraduates need to master: calculus, differential equa-
tions, and numerical techniques.
We begin by making a close examination of the non-linear
function vhðÞ;for cases exhibiting the notch behavior, over awide range of l. In Sec. III, we move into the time domain,
utilizing numerical quadrature of v(h)to yield h(t). This
reveals the unusual plateau behavior, which is the central
focus of this paper. Sections IVandVexplore the nature of
the plateau and its mathematical origin, the role of the bal-ance of forces in this behavior, and the sensitivity of thenear-stopping condition of the sliding mass to initial condi-
tions. Section VIemploys the work-energy theorem to check
the accuracy of our numerical solutions.
II. THE BEHAVIOR OF V(h)
Three co-planar forces act on the (point) mass as it slides
over the spherical surface along a meridian (i.e., longitude
line). The weight of the particle mgcan be separated into
tangential (toward the sphere’s equator) and normal (towardthe sphere’s center) components. The surface exerts an out-
ward normal force N, while the retarding force of sliding
friction ( f¼lN) points tangentially in the direction opposite
to the motion (toward the sphere’s north pole). The equationsof motion along the normal and tangential directions arefound from Newton’s second law
NðhÞ/C0mgcosð
hÞ¼/C0 mr_h2; (1a)
mgsinðhÞ/C0lNðhÞ¼mr€h: (1b)
In Eq. (1a), the mass undergoes centripetal acceleration
v2=r¼r_h2toward the sphere’s center under the resultant
force of the outward normal and the inward component ofweight. In Eq. (1b), the mass’s acceleration along the circu-
lar arc results from the difference between the tangentialcomponent of weight and the retarding kinetic friction.
These coupled differential equations can be solved following
the procedures described in Refs. 1and2.

Alternatively, h(t)could be obtained by directly solving the
second-order ordinary differential equation (1b) after
substituting N(h)from Eq. (1a), as was done in Ref. 1, but in
this paper, we choose to solve for h(t)using Eqs. (2)and(3).
The mass mand spherical radius rare free parameters for
this problem. Because the motion involves “falling” due togravity on the spherical surface, the radius sets the length
scale, and an associated characteristic time can be deﬁned as
s/C17ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
r=gp
.
Plots of V(h)were shown in Refs. 1–4. Clearly, a wide
range of behaviors is possible, including the intriguing“notch” behavior wherein V(h)approaches and departs from
zero at angle h
r(using the notation in Ref. 2). As shown in
Ref. 2,hr¼tan/C01l. In Figs. 1(a)and1(b), a family of curves
exhibiting this behavior is shown for coefﬁcients of frictionin the range [1, 100]. For each value of l, the value of V
0to
achieve the notch is calculable from Eq. (2)by setting V¼0
andh¼hr. Hereafter, these special values of V0are denoted
byV0cand are listed in the caption to Fig. 1.
When Fig. 1was initially constructed, the near-zero values
ofV(h)exhibited a kind of “digital noise”; that is, the soft-
ware evaluating Eq. (2)returned seemingly random discrete
values of VhðÞ. More detailed investigation revealed the phe-
nomenon of “catastrophic cancellation,”7which is well
known in the representation of ﬂoating-point numbers on aﬁnite digital computing machine. There are limited strategiesto remedy this. One is to rearrange or re-factor an algebraicexpression that may be causing difﬁculty. This was done toarrive at Eq. (2)from the corresponding Eq. (A3) of Ref. 2.
Inspection of these two equations indicates that the exponen-
tial term e
2lhcan become dominant in magnitude as l
increases. Equation (2)is re-factored to have just a single
exponential appearing. While this is helpful, one discoversthat the co-factor of the exponential in Eq. (2)does increas-
ingly show near-cancellation as lgrows and V
0!1.
Furthermore, because we are concentrating on the regionwhere V!0, the three terms in the numerator under the rad-
ical also must be nearly canceling. All of these numericaltrends combine to produce an uncertain computational result,so Eq. (2)is evidently ill-conditioned for examining the limit
of large l, even though it has been recast.
Because ﬁnite computing machines have hardware-limited
ﬂoating-point precision, a workable solution can often be
found in software. Mathematical and scientiﬁc computingsoftware packages, such as Mathematica , often have built-in
means to set the mathematical precision and/or accuracy ofcomputations. Increasing the number of digits of precisioncan allow successful handling of the problem cited here, andtheMathematica plots of Fig. 1were constructed by tempo-
rarily increasing the operation to thirty digits of precision viaa software instruction, thus overcoming the inherent machine
precision of the computer.
We will return to the topic of the limitations of computer
numerics in Sec. III, when we address the execution of the
integration of Eq. (3). Numerical quadrature admits the
adoption of a wide range of strategic approaches that havebeen developed in numerical analysis for over more than acentury, and especially since the ubiquity of digital comput-ing. Performing accurate numerical quadrature ofteninvolves a level of strategic ﬁnesse beyond merely increasingprecision settings in software, and we turn to this require-ment in our application in Sec. III. (See the supplemental
material
4for more details.)

III. NUMERICAL QUADRATURE TO FIND h(T)
A huge variety of VhðÞbehavior is predicted in Eq. (2).T o
ﬁnd htðÞ, via Eq. (3)and subsequent inversion, will likely
require numerical integration due to the relatively compli-
cated non-linear form of VhðÞ. In this section, we restrict our
consideration of h(t)to the (arguably) most physically
interesting—and as it turns out, computationally challenging—
behaviors that are depicted in Fig. 1: the notch zeroes of V(h)
become singularities in the integrand of Eq. (3)that need to be
treated with care.
In evaluating the right-hand side of Eq. (3), the upper
bound of the integral will need to be varied from h0tohmax,
the maximum allowed value of h,which is the polar angle at
which the normal force goes to zero and the mass leaves thesphere’s surface. This implies that we will need to evaluate
as many deﬁnite integrals (Eq. (3)) as the number of func-
tional samples of t(h)that we require, so obtaining a full
solution will be moderately intensive computationally.
Alternatively, one might iteratively integrate over the short
interval [ h
i,hiþ1] between the current and previous abscissa
sample and add the result to the cumulative result at the priorsample. The usual strategy when performing a one-
dimensional integral across a singularity is to split the inte-
gral into two sub-integrals, one below and one above thedivergence. This is our approach as well, which then raises
the question of how to accurately evaluate an integral with a
divergence at one or both limits. In fact, this is a rather com-mon problem in numerical analysis, with a favored approachbeing the so-called double exponential methods .
8,9Among
these is the tanh-sinh method,10one of the approaches we
have employed for our work. It involves a change in varia-bles, using hyperbolic functions to transform an integral
from /C01/C20x/C201 to one over the entire real line /C01 /C20 x
0
/C201:The divergences at x¼61 then appear at x0¼61,
where their contributions to the integral tend to vanish. Sinceour numerical integration only deals with the diverging inte-
grand for values of hnear the notch, our need to employ
“special” quadrature methods may only involve a minorityof our deﬁnite integral evaluations. Whether we call up a
standard or non-standard method of numerical quadrature,
many of these utilize non-uniform sampling of the abscissawhen carrying out evaluation of the integrand, either directly
or by interpolation techniques (e.g., Gaussian methods).
At this point, we need to draw a clear distinction between
the inherent sampling within a quadrature evaluation (soft-ware may place this beyond the control of the user), and avoluntary sampling choice that we employ in order to obtain
smooth and aesthetically pleasing ﬁnal solution plots of h(t).
The logic of this user-controlled sampling is straightforward(and essentially the same as in numerical quadrature): we
sample the integrand function more densely when its rate of
change is high. Since the integrand in Eq. (3)is proportional
to 1=VhðÞ, integration requires denser sampling as the zero
ofV(h)is approached from either side. In this work, we
explored a variety of abscissa samplings, including logarith-
mic and exponential (both base 10) sampling, as well as arbi-trary base exponential methods.
4
A ﬁnal, important improvement in the efﬁciency of the
numerical integration of Eq. (3)is to replace the exact
expression of Eq. (2)forV(h)with a composite of two
smooth interpolated functions found by ﬁtting computed val-
ues of V(h)evaluated at selected points on either side of hr.
Such interpolated functions are much easier and faster tointegrate accurately than integrating Eq. (2)directly. The inter-
polation can be made as accurate and precise as necessary by
increasing the user-deﬁned abscissa sampling density. This
overall procedure retains a huge advantage in computationalefﬁciency due to the large number of required evaluations of
the integrand. Once again, the chosen computational step of an
accurate numerical interpolation is well-supported by commer-cial software tools, such as Mathematica .

IV. THE PLATEAUS OF h(T)
Figure 2was generated using the numerical integration
techniques discussed above. Since V/v¼rdh=dt, the slope
ofh(t)approaches zero as Vdoes, giving rise to the plateaus
shown in Fig. 2(a). These plateaus are extraordinarily ﬂat,
but become less so (see Sec. VI) and narrower as lincreases
(Fig. 2(b)). This is consistent with the plots of VhðÞas shown
in Fig. 1. From Eq. (3), the integralÐ
dh=VhðÞacross a notch
is proportional to the elapsed time that the sliding massspends with near-zero speed, i.e., the width of the plateau.
The initial slope of the h(t)curves at h
0reﬂects the increase

and approaches toward unity of V0with increasing l,a s
given in the caption of Fig. 1. At the end of each plateau, h(t)
bends upward, indicating the resumption of accelerated
motion. This effect is more pronounced when the frictioncoefﬁcient is small, which simply reﬂects the fact that h
ris
further from hmaxfor small l. Each h(t)curve terminates at
hmax, and as lincreases, hmax!p=2.
It is interesting to inquire about the limiting values of the
plateau duration in Fig. 2(b) asl!0 and l!1 . In the
frictionless case ( l!0), V0¼0, i.e., no stopping is
expected for any non-zero initial speed. Thus, for h0¼0
(the situation we are treating in this paper), the mass remains
at rest at the top of the sphere, so its duration while
“stopped” is inﬁnite, as Fig. 2(b)suggests. Conversely, when
l!1 ,V0!1, and the V(h)path is along theﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
cosðhÞp
“phase boundary” as discussed in Ref. 2and suggested by
our Figs. 1and4. In this instance, there is no notch, and the
mass’s speed only reaches zero at the equator. Thus, theduration while nearly stopped is zero, also as Fig. 2(b)
suggests.
V. BEHAVIOR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF THE V(h)NOTCH
Just how special is the notch state of V(h)?To answer this
question, we explored the behavior of V(h)near the notch as
the initial speed V
0was varied, for l¼1 and l¼10.V0was
varied over a logarithmic range about the critical notch valueV
0c(see Table I). Figures 3(a) and3(b) show plots of V2(h)
forV0eðÞ¼V0c1þe½/C138 , where e¼6f10/C01

and e¼6f10/C08;10/C09;…;10/C015g, for l¼1 and l¼10,
respectively. (We examine V2(h)rather than V(h)to avoid
complex numbers (see Eq. (2)). Note that for l¼10, the
function V(h)is very sensitive to quite small variations in V0,
while for l¼1, the sensitivity is orders of magnitude
smaller. Figure 4clearly illustrates that the notch curves of
Fig. 1represent a dynamical boundary between the mass
having just sufﬁcient or just insufﬁcient initial energy to
leave the surface of the sphere. This boundary is a quasi-
equilibrium state, a very special circumstance whereby themass has just the right energy to almost pause for a ﬁnite
time with near-zero speed and then resume its motion toward
the point of departure as the instantaneous forces come outof near-balance.

2–6 show the normalized initial speed needed to generate the notch behav-
ior; the numerically determined stopping plateau normalized duration (see
Fig.2(b)); the angular location of the notch; the angular location where the
mass departs the sphere; and fractional energy loss due to friction.

VI.h(T)PLATEAUS EXPLAINED
The plateaus in Fig. 2(a)are linked to the “notches” shown
in Fig. 1, where the mass’s speed vapproaches zero. For a
mass moving along a meridian, slowing to a near stop and
subsequently speeding up implies a net negative tangentialforce transitioning to a net positive force at the notch angle
h
r. This is conceptually sensible: as hincreases, the tangen-
tial weight is monotonically increasing while the tangential
frictional retardation (proportional to the normal force) is
steadily decreasing. The net tangential force per unit mass,evaluated using Eqs. (1a)and(1b),i s

As shown in Fig. 4,FtanðhÞpasses smoothly through zero at
hr, just as expected. The slope of Ftanis explored in the sup-
plementary material.4
We can use the behavior of FtanhðÞaround its zero-
crossing at hrto give a physical explanation of the h(t)pla-
teaus. Consider a linear expansion of FtanhðÞabout hr, using
dh/C17h/C0hr. Recall that VhrðÞ/C17Vminﬃ0, and set the time
origin to be zero when dh¼0:Using a Taylor expansion,

Newton’s second law becomes kldhðÞ¼mr€h¼mr€dh. This
is the differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator
with a negative “spring constant.” Thus, we expect a solution
of the form dhðtÞ¼AsinhðctÞþBcoshðctÞ. Substituting this

tial conditions dhðt¼0Þ¼0, and _dhjt¼0¼vmin=r, we ﬁnd

These expressions perfectly replicate the behavior described in

we see that the plateau exhibits an inﬂection point at h¼hr,
since the symmetric cosh function is never zero and is increas-
ingly positive as one moves away from hrin either direction.
VII. APPLICATION OF THE WORK-ENERGY

To estimate the magnitude of error in our numerical
results, we asked how well they satisfy the work-energy
theorem. For each of the curves in Figs. 1and 2,w e

these small values signals a successful computation.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Table Isummarizes parameters and quantitative results
from the ﬁgures and analyses that we have presented. In gen-eral, as friction increases, the notch and stopping condition
behavior is compressed toward the sphere’s equator (Fig.
2(a)), and the plateau shortens and steepens. The last column
is the fraction of the initial energy lost to friction.
This paper builds on the work of Refs. 1and2by closely
examining the near-stopping behavior of a mass sliding on a
rough sphere. The coefﬁcient of sliding friction lhas been
extended greatly, covering a range of 1–100. The plateau inh(t)has been fully quantiﬁed in terms of its duration, its
slope’s magnitude relative to the initial mass speed, and the
sensitivity of initiating its onset. We also identiﬁed the phys-ical source of the plateau using an analytical solution of
Newton’s second law and carried out extensive numerical
calculations to increase the understanding of the somewhatunexpected behavior.
