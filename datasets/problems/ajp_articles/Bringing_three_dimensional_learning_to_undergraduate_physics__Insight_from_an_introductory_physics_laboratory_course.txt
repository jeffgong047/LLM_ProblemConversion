Three-dimensional learning (3DL) is an approach to science instruction that was developed for K-12
science education and that can provide guidance for improving undergraduate physics laboratories. In
this paper, we describe efforts to comprehensively integrate 3DL into a sequence of undergraduate
introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) laboratory courses. This paper is tailored forintroductory physics faculty interested in advancing their course’s learning goals by simultaneously
engaging students in experimental practices, scientiﬁc reasoning, and conceptual knowledge. We ﬁrst
review how several well-known laboratory curricula are already implicitly aligned with 3DL. We
then describe our IPLS course sequence and show how each 3DL dimension—science and
engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts—is integrated throughout
the curriculum. To support implementation, we provide samples of our course documentation, adetailed account of our 3DL integration efforts, a guide to training and supporting teaching and
learning assistants in a 3DL course, and a sample set of activities to guide students in participating in
3DL instruction in the supplementary material.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many undergraduate physics laboratory courses have under-
gone reforms to improve student engagement in scientiﬁc rea-
soning, critical thinking, and scientiﬁc practices.1These
reforms have stemmed from ongoing calls to transition labora-
tory courses away from rote, conﬁrmatory curricula focused onreinforcing lecture content and toward more authentic labora-tory experiences that engage students in experimental practices
and scientiﬁc reasoning (e.g., Ref. 2). While these efforts have
produced valuable results for students and instructors, develop-ing coherence and interconnectedness among the three dimen-
sions of science learning—scientiﬁc concepts, experimental
practices, and reasoning tools
3—is a challenge. Students
should have opportunities to consistently engage with these
three dimensions of scientiﬁc learning in laboratory course set-tings, as they jointly prepare students to “think like a physicist”and develop authentic scientiﬁc expertise.
4Laboratory courses
remain a unique educational environment, where students canconsistently interact with and learn about experimental practi-
ces, scientiﬁc concepts, and reasoning processes in ways not
possible in other learning environments such as lecture halls or
recitation sections. To provide these opportunities to students
in ways that produce tangible change in student learning andengagement, it is important to implement explicit pedagogical
scaffolds into physics laboratory curricula that build intercon-nectedness and coherence among experimental practices, con-ceptual material, and scientiﬁc reasoning.
We present an introductory physics for life sciences
(IPLS) laboratory course sequence integrating the three-dimensional learning (3DL) framework into its existinglaboratory curriculum. The 3DL framework is a conceptual
framework from K-12 science education that is explicitly
designed to coherently support students’ scientiﬁc inquirythrough integration of scientiﬁc practices, concepts, andmodes of reasoning.
3Composed of disciplinary core ideas
(DCIs), science and engineering practices (SEPs), and cross-
cutting concepts (CCCs), 3DL is designed to promote stu-
dents’ active learning of overarching core scientiﬁc ideas
(DCIs) by engaging students with scientiﬁc practices (SEPs)and reasoning tools (CCCs) within interesting or relevantscientiﬁc contexts (see Ref. 5and our supplementary mate-
rial
6for additional references and resources that describe
3DL). A crucial feature of the 3DL framework is emphasis
on student engagement with all 3DL dimensions coherently
to build new knowledge and experience jointly, rather than
focusing on each individually. Tables Iand IIshow each
component of the 3DL framework.

Since its inception, 3DL has been widely adopted in United
States K-12 education as a productive framework for science
learning.7Recently, stakeholders have advocated that under-
graduate curricula adopt aspects of 3DL since it can enhance
students’ deep investigation and use of complex knowledge in
preparation for future academic and professional success.8In
response, 3DL has slowly entered undergraduate STEM curric-
ula in recent years, though its a doption rate in undergraduate
physics se ttings is low (see Ref. 9and our supplementary mate-
rial6for references and additional information about 3DL in
undergraduate STEM). However, many of the ongoing reform
efforts in undergraduate physics instruction implicitly align with
3DL, as discussed in more detail in Sec. II. While a comprehen-
sive review of the beneﬁts of 3DL is beyond the scope of this
paper, the following four beneﬁts are ones that physics instruc-
tors are likely to see as highly aligned with their goals (see the
supplementary material6for a full list of references detailing the
beneﬁts of 3DL described here). First, 3DL has been shown to
develop coherence in multiple settings, which is important as
university STEM instruction becomes more interdisciplinary
(e.g., Ref. 10). Second, 3DL promotes students’ ab ilities to
develop scientiﬁc arguments while engaging in comprehensive
scientiﬁc inquiry (e.g., Ref. 11). Third, 3DL emphasizes devel-
oping and using sophisticated scientiﬁc models to investigate
complex scientiﬁc phenomena (e.g., Ref. 12); modeling has con-
sistently been a primary goal for many undergraduate physics
laboratory courses. Finally, research has shown that students in
3DL environments can construct explanations of scientiﬁc phe-
nomena while accounting for results from inquiry or complex
conceptual information (e.g., Ref. 13).
We begin by brieﬂy reviewing several well-known labora-
tory curricula and their implicit alignment with the 3DLframework, showing that faculty can integrate 3DL into their
courses without a complete overhaul. Next, we describe our
instructional setting, a recently reformed introductory phys-
ics for life sciences (IPLS) laboratory course sequence. Wethen detail how we integrated each dimension of the 3DL
framework into our existing curriculum. We also provide in
the supplementary material6additional information for inter-
ested faculty, including an in-depth guide detailing the pro-
gression of our integration efforts, a description of how we
train and support our teaching and learning assistants (TAsand LAs, respectively) in 3DL instruction, various supple-
mental activities students complete to become familiar with
3DL in the course, and other relevant resources.
II. REVIEW OF REFORMED LABORATORY
COURSES’ ALIGNMENT WITH 3DL
At ﬁrst glance, integrating the 3DL framework into an
existing physics lab course may seem challenging. However,
we ﬁnd that many introductory physics lab curricula alreadycontain aspects of 3DL’s foundational characteristics, even
though they were created before 3DL’s development in
2012. We examined the following laboratory curricula toassess their alignment with 3DL: Investigative Science
Learning Environment (ISLE),
14Scientiﬁc Community Labs
(SCL),15Modeling Framework for Experimental Physics,16
Projects and Practices in Physics ( P3),17NEXUS/Physics,18
and RealTime Physics.19For additional details about the
reviewed curricula, please refer to the supplementary mate-rial.6We also include AAPT’s 2014 laboratory recommen-
dations, which has served as a guiding framework for many
recent physics lab curriculum reforms.4These recommenda-
tions provide learning goals that faculty should implementinto their courses, focusing primarily on practices and skills
rather than content.
To compare these curricula with the 3DL framework, we
ﬁrst reviewed their curriculum (accessed via publicly avail-able resources such as Physport and Living Physics Portal)
and associated journal articles to determine which practices
or skills (SEPs) they incorporated. Because many of thesecurricula were developed before 3DL’s inception, direct
alignment was infeasible. Rather, we searched for key terms
and phrases commonly associated with each SEP to identifycomparable practices or skills.
Some curricula explicitly prioritize a single SEP and use
this as the central scaffold for their laboratory instruction.
For example, a primary instructional goal for the ISLE cur-riculum is to engage students in experimental design (SEP
3). Similarly, the P
3curriculum prioritizes student engage-
ment in data analysis and visualization (SEP 4). Outside ofthe presented list, various PICUP community curricula are
additional examples of having a singular emphasis on a
deﬁned practice, namely, computation. Table IIIshows how
each of these lab curricula implicitly engages students inTable I. List of 3DL SEPs and CCCs.

3DL’s SEPs. Though many of the curricula prioritize a single
SEP, they overall prompt students to engage in many SEPs;this is unsurprising given that many lab courses haverecently shifted to more intentionally prioritize students’engagement with scientiﬁc practices and technical skills.

However, while these curricula align with many SEPs, wedid notice that many curricula did not explicitly engage stu-dents in Asking Questions and Deﬁning Problems and
Engaging in Argument from Evidence ,t w oS E P st h a t
remain foundational in professional physics experimenta-
tion. Finally, we see that the AAPT recommendations alignwith the 3DL goal of integrating all eight SEPs into theircurriculum.
We also reviewed each curriculum to identify if or how
the courses organize their scientiﬁc concepts and topics intooverarching DCIs. We determined that this generally did notoccur. Rather, concepts and topics were often fragmentedinto individual lab experiments with few explicit curricularscaffolds devoted to building connections between them. Forexample, the ISLE lab curriculum engages students withforces and motion, 1D kinematics, Newton’s laws, and circu-lar motion, statics, gases, and thermodynamics, all of whichreside within their own respective experiments. Similarly,RealTime Physics engages students with 1 D motion (labs 1and 2), forces, gravity, and Newton’s laws (labs 3–7), colli-sions and momentum (labs 8 and 9), projectile motion (lab10), and energy (labs 11 and 12) with each topic residingwithin its own subset of lab experiments and no scaffolds
between experiments to support students in building connec-
tions between the concepts. While there are undoubtedlyconnections between these conceptual topics, this uninten-tional conﬁnement of physics concepts into individual labexperiments may implicitly prompt students to view the con-cepts as distinct and fragmented. Conversely, the P
3curricu-
lum is an example curriculum that was explicitly developedto align with course-deﬁned DCIs and SEPs. For example,P
3deﬁnes four physics DCIs and two computation DCIs that
guide students’ conceptual progression throughout thecourse by longitudinally connecting each investigation’s
learning goals and concepts. This is a promising example ofa laboratory curriculum that explicitly uses DCIs to helpstudents build connections between conceptual topicsacross lab investigations. We note again that the AAPT rec-
ommendations do not provide recommendations regarding
laboratory content, in order to maintain generalizabilityacross academic levels, student populations, and depart-
mental needs.
Finally, our review showed that these curricula sometimes
used CCC-related language implicitly in instruction. We sus-pect faculty may not explicitly focus on integrating CCC-based language into their curriculum to engage students inscientiﬁc reasoning and sensemaking during experimentation
and instead expect this to occur organically during instruc-
tion. Thus, we searched for general prompts in the curriculathat may help guide students to engage in reasoning or sense-making during experimentation. Some common trendsemerged across the curricula, including that identifyingPatterns was a common instructional focus. For example,
the ISLE curriculum frequently prompts faculty to guide stu-dents as they “identify patterns in… observations and…develop a qualitative explanation for the patterns that have
been identiﬁed.” Also, the NEXUS/Physics curriculum fre-
quently emphasizes that students utilize their knowledge of abiological specimens’ structure to empirically investigate itsproperties and functions ( Structure and Function ). Finally,
consistent throughout many curricula was an expectationthat students investigate and provide explanations for causalrelationships ( Cause and Effect ). For example, all four of
P
3’s physics DCIs incorporate language that implies a focus
on causal relationships within physical systems (e.g., “F4:
torques external to a system can change the system’s angu-
lar momentum”). The AAPT Recommendations did notinclude speciﬁc recommendations on student reasoning orsensemaking in laboratory courses.
Overall, these curricula contain foundational aspects of
3DL but do not intentionally utilize a coherent instructional

framework to simultaneously use each dimension of 3DL to
engage students in coherent scientiﬁc instruction. Their rela-
tive alignment with many of 3DL’s key principles is unsur-
prising, given that many of these curricula were developedshortly before or after 3DL. We believe that many other cur-
rent physics lab curricula include similar types of implicit
alignment with 3DL that can be built upon and broughttogether to engage students in utilizing scientiﬁc practices
(SEPs) during experimentation to generate a coherent under-
standing of scientiﬁc concepts (DCIs) while using multiplemodes of scientiﬁc reasoning (CCCs).
III. IPLS COURSE DESCRIPTION
In this section, we provide a brief description of our two-
semester introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) labora-
tory course sequence. These courses were previously
reformed to transition from an algebra-based physics curricu-lum loosely based on RealTime Physics
19to an adapted
NEXUS/Physics18IPLS curriculum. The primary learning
goals include: (1) engaging students in complex scientiﬁcpractices within realistic research-like experimental environ-
ments, (2) engaging students with interdisciplinary topics
through relevant biological phenomena, and (3) providingstudents opportunities to collaboratively sense-make about
mechanisms and causal relationships in biological systems
through experimentation. Since piloting the courses duringSpring 2018, they have enrolled roughly 2000 undergraduate
students. Together, both courses enroll roughly 400 students
each semester. Students are mostly pre-medical (roughly70%) students in their ﬁnal two years (roughly 88%) of
undergraduate studies. (At our institution, it is customary for
pre-medical students to defer enrollment in introductoryphysics courses until after they complete their upper-division
medical school course requirements in biology and chemis-
try.) Students are expected to concurrently enroll in the cor-
responding introductory physics lecture courses. However,there is limited connection between the lecture and lab
courses, and the lab course curriculum and apparatus are tai-
lored for the enrolled population; most of whom have signiﬁ-cant academic experience in cellular biology, organic
chemistry, and human anatomy.
Each lab section consists of 24 students working in groups
of four while supported by a physics teaching assistant (TA)and a STEM learning assistant (LA). TAs and LAs receive
pre-course training and weekly instructional support to intro-
duce them to the 3DL integration and guide them in 3DL-aligned instruction (see the supplementary material
6for
resources detailing TA/LA training for 3DL courses).
Weekly lab sessions last three hours, and each investigationis two or three weeks in length, resulting in lab investigations
of six to nine total lab hours. In each investigation, student
groups are given guiding prompts related to complex scien-tiﬁc phenomena. They collaboratively develop experimentalresearch questions, design and conduct their experiments,
engage in argumentation sessions with their peers, and write
lab reports that undergo a double-anonymous peer review,all with scaffolded support from TAs and LAs. The investi-
gation descriptions and an overview of their guiding prompts
are given in Table IV.

A. Science and engineering practices (SEPs): Authentic
scientific experimentation
In the course sequence, engaging students in SEPs is the
primary focus for instruction, as is common in many physicslab courses. Lab activities are modeled after the argument-driven inquiry (ADI) instructional model,
20which has been
shown to align with all eight SEPs.21ADI is a well-known
instructional model that has been integrated into physics,chemistry, and biology curriculum at the K-12 and collegelevels. Table Vpresents the laboratory activities and their
alignment with the SEPs. In addition to our goal of engagingstudents in all eight SEPs, we prioritize a subset of SEPs,SEP 1: Asking Questions and Deﬁning Problems andSEP
7: Engaging in Argument from Evidence . To emphasize
SEP 1, we utilize a question-formulation-technique (QFT)activity prior to experimentation.
22To emphasize SEP 7, we
frame students’ investigations around developing a scientiﬁcargument to answer their research question; the ADI modelsupports this framing.
To illustrate how the curriculum engages students with all
eight SEPs, we provide a brief overview of students’ activi-ties in an example lab investigation: Lab 3: InvestigatingBrownian motion and diffusion. In Lab 3, students begin bycompleting a warm-up activity, which guides them throughintroductory steps of setting up, collecting, and analyzingtranslational motion data from a sample of synthetic micro-spheres suspended in a ﬂuid. This warm-up activity preparesstudents to carry out their investigations using the lab appa-ratus (SEP 3) and analyze collected experimental data usingrelevant computer software (SEPs 4–5).
After completing the warm-up activity, students are pro-
vided a general overview of: (a) the scientiﬁc phenomenaavailable for study, (b) the guiding prompts that help frametheir research questions and design plans, and (c) the avail-able experimental apparatus and analytical methods (see thesupplementary material
6for an example lab 3 introductory
video provided to students to prepare them for their experi-ments). Students develop a research question and design
plan (SEP 1 and 3) by completing a QFT activity. The QFT
activity guides students to: (a) individually brainstorm multi-ple possible research questions, (b) classify questions asopen or closed questions, (c) evaluate the questions’ testabil-ity within the course’s constraints (i.e., available apparatus,timing), (d) identify how various CCCs (e.g., cause andeffect) might be used in their questions and investigations togenerate deeper understandings of their phenomena (e.g.,mechanisms underlying causal relationships), and (e)develop a research question and initial experimental plan asa group. While developing their research question and designplans, students are prompted by TAs, LAs, and lab documen-tation to consider how their laboratory investigation mightserve as a model for relevant complex biophysical phenom-ena (SEP 2). In lab 3, students often use the Brownianmotion of synthetic microspheres in a ﬂuid as a model forintracellular passive diffusion to show that active transportwithin cells is necessary to sustain life.After the QFT activity, students begin their investigation
by preparing samples of synthetic microspheres for videocollection. Students use microscopes and mounted micro-scope cameras to collect videos of microspheres movingwithin ﬂuids (SEP 3), which they then analyze to determinetheir velocities, rates of Brownian motion (diffusion coefﬁ-cient), or other characteristics. Throughout their investiga-tion, students are prompted to search for and utilizeconceptual information from relevant external literature (i.e.,peer-reviewed journal articles) to assess the viability of theirexperiment and conceptually make sense of their ongoingresults (SEP 8). Using a spreadsheet program, students ana-
lyze their data by engaging in several analytical and compu-
tational processes such as tabulating and reducing data sets,deﬁning variables, creating equations to perform calcula-tions, and assessing computational results. In this, studentsuse equations and computational skills to efﬁciently performthousands of calculations on large data sets and generategraphical representations of their work (SEP 4 and 5).
After analyzing data, students generate explanations and
scientiﬁc arguments to present to their peers (SEP 6 and 7).Often, students continue reviewing external resources toidentify relevant information to support their explanationsand arguments (SEP 8). Using the claim-evidence-reasoning(CER) argumentation framework,
23students posit their claim
(answer to their experimental research question in the formof a scientiﬁc explanation), support their claim with evidence(analyzed and interpreted experimental data), and describetheir scientiﬁc reasoning of why the evidence supports theclaim. To prepare for argumentation sessions, students areprompted to consider not only their CER components butalso what critiques they may receive from their peers andhow they will respond to them. They then present their CERarguments to their peers for critical feedback, which theyintegrate into their ﬁnal results and subsequent lab reports(SEP 8).
B. Disciplinary core ideas (DCIs): Building coherence in
scientific concepts
This IPLS course sequence, by using a 3DL framework
approach, builds connections between target physics, biol-ogy, and chemistry concepts by categorizing them into largersets of course-speciﬁc DCIs (see Table VI). Our course-
speciﬁc DCIs are based on documented DCIs in other
undergraduate STEM course environments (refer to our 3DL
integration guide in the supplementary material
6for more
information on how we developed our course-speciﬁcDCIs).24These DCIs guide the progression of lab investiga-
tions throughout the course sequence, as the concepts andsystems under investigation in each laboratory experimentare designed to speciﬁcally build on each other such that stu-dents revisit scientiﬁc concepts across investigations withindifferent experimental contexts. As shown in Table VII, each
lab investigation involves multiple DCIs from different dis-ciplines, offering an interdisciplinary focus on each experi-mental system. Each DCI is also revisited multiple timeseach semester with students engaging with new scientiﬁcconcepts that relate and add to their understanding of a largerDCI. Below, we highlight respective examples of the inter-disciplinary DCI engagement and the longitudinal revisita-tion of DCIs.
Lab 4 is a notable example of students’ interdisciplinary
DCI engagement. In lab 4, students utilize their prior

biological knowledge of cellular systems, composed of cellu-
lar organelles, membranes, and cytoskeleton (BCI 2), toinvestigate the physical properties of molecular motor pro-teins. In their experiments, students investigate how molecu-lar motors utilize ATP as energy sources (CCI 3) to move(PCI 1) through viscous cell cytoplasm (BCI 1 and 3). Theystudy how energy expenditure maintains energy conservationwithin the system (PCI 2) and results in the continuousmotion of a cargo vesicle through a resistive ﬂuid (PCI 1).During the investigation, students are guided as they moveﬂuidly between disciplinary concepts to explain their biolog-ical system’s mechanisms and experimental results, contrib-uting to their interdisciplinary scientiﬁc knowledge.
PCI 1 is a notable example of longitudinal revisitation of a
DCI. Here, we focus on how PCI 1 is integrated throughoutthe ﬁrst-semester course. Students begin in lab 1 by studyingbasic kinematics of zebraﬁsh, collecting and analyzing data
of the ﬁsh’s speed and acceleration. Here, students are intro-duced to physical concepts and properties within a relativelysimple biological system such as speed, acceleration, inertia,momentum, and resistance. In lab 2, students use simple ﬂu-ids and macroscopic objects to build a model of a biologicalsystem that involves objects moving through viscous ﬂuids(e.g., capillary ﬂow, intracellular diffusion). Students moreexplicitly study how resistive forces impact motion andbegin theorizing how various biological systems account forand act against resistive forces to promote constant motion.In lab 3, students study how properties of an object’s exter-nal environment (e.g., temperature, viscosity) affectBrownian motion and diffusion. Here, students use theirexperiments as models to quantify how temperature, viscos-ity, or other physical properties cause changes in stochasticTable VI. IPLS course disciplinary core ideas.
Physics core ideas (PCIs) Description
PCI 1: Interactions can cause changes in motion Changes in an object’s motion are the result of interactions between it and its external environment.
Multiple interactions between an object and its surroundings can result in a predictable change in
motion.
PCI 2: Conservation of physical quantities Various physical quantities (energy, mass, charge, etc.) come in many forms and can be transformed
from one form to another within a given system or transferred between systems within conservatory
constraints.
PCI 3: Interactions are mediated by ﬁelds Fields are generated by charges/masses. Fields affect charges/masses. In circuits, ﬁelds induce currents .
Biology core ideas (BCIs) Description
BCI 1: Cells—Biological building blocks Cells are the fundamental building blocks of all living organisms, the structure upon which
all more complex biological systems are built.
BCI 2: Biological systems Ecosystems, organisms, tissues, and cells act as systems.BCI 3: Biological structure and function The functions and properties of ecosystems, organisms, tissues, cells, and biological molecules are
determined by their structures.
Chemistry core ideas (CCIs) Description
CCI 1: Atomic/molecular interactions Attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces govern noncovalent and bonding (covalent and ionic)
interactions between atoms and molecules. The strength of these forces depends on the magnitude of
the charges involved and the distances between them.
CCI 2: Atomic/molecular structure and properties The macroscopic physical and chemical properties of a substance are determined by the three-
dimensional structure, the distribution of electron density, and the nature and extent of the noncova-
lent interactions between particles.
CCI 3: Energy Energy changes are either the cause or the consequence of change in chemical systems, which can be
considered on different scales and can be accounted for by conserving the total energy of the system
of interest and the surroundings.

motion in cellular living systems. Students also begin consid-
ering how interactions between objects of similar size(sphere–sphere interactions) may result in changes inmomentum and energy, relating this to their Brownianmotion. In lab 4, students conclude by investigating howﬂuid system properties, thermodynamic principles, and cellu-lar structures impact the energetic properties of molecular
motors in living cells. Here, students often focus on biologi-
cal motor proteins’ energy and power outputs as they movevesicle cargo through intracellular ﬂuids, building interdisci-plinary connections between DCIs. By the end of the semes-ter, students experience multiple opportunities to engagewith related physical concepts (speed, acceleration, momen-tum, forces, and energy) as part of a larger physics DCI,rather than through fragmented concepts as are often com-mon in traditional physics curriculum.
Both the curriculum and pedagogy support the integration
of DCIs. First, instructional scaffolds within the laboratorydocumentation prompt students to reﬂect on the developmentof their conceptual knowledge between lab investigations.After each lab investigation, students complete a reﬂection
assignment to self-assess their DCI-based conceptual knowl-
edge from their completed investigations. Second, lab man-uals consistently prompt students to consider how theconcepts and outcomes of prior investigations are related totheir current investigations. Third, TAs and LAs consistentlyengage with students to revisit conceptual discussions fromprior lab investigations to build longitudinal connectionsamong conceptual topics. TAs and LAs are also trained toguide students to consider their ongoing experimental out-comes and discussions from different disciplinary contexts.TAs/LAs guide students to shift between physical, biologi-cal, or chemical explanations for their studied phenomena.This longitudinal and interdisciplinary engagement with
DCIs is a hallmark feature of 3DL and may help students
develop scientiﬁc coherence within single disciplines andacross multiple disciplines (e.g., Ref. 10).
C. Crosscutting concepts (CCCs): Generating
scientific reasoning
When utilized in laboratory settings, CCCs can provide stu-
dents opportunities to use experimentation as a means toengage in scientiﬁc reasoning about their studied phenomenaand underlying concepts. CCCs are integrated into thecourse sequence in two ways. (Table VIII shows how each
CCC is emphasized throughout the courses.) First, coursedocumentation (warm-up activities, lab manuals, technical
documents, introductory slides, etc.) includes CCC languageaimed to prompt students towards enacting CCCs to engage inscientiﬁc reasoning and sensemaking during experimentation.Second, students are prompted by TAs and LAs throughout
experimentation to incorporate CCC-aligned reasoning as they
develop explanations and arguments of their experimentalresults. To illustrate, we provide a brief example of how CCC
2: Cause and Effect is interwoven through course documenta-
tion and TA and LA support. This CCC is prior itized through-
out the curriculum to meet one of the courses’ primary learninggoals: to have students collaboratively reason about mecha-nisms and causal relationships in biological systems through
experimentation.
CCC 2: Cause and Effect is directly integrated throughout
the course documentation provided to students. Several labs’
guiding prompts emphasize focus on CCC 2: Cause and
Effect by including relevant terminology. For example, lab
3’s guiding prompt states:
“… you can create an investigation that studies
Brownian motion that can provide evidence and/orinsight into how diffusion occurs . Some possible
research avenues are below: a) In terms of cellular
motility, why would cells prefer different internal
environments? How does this affect diffusion
inside the cell? ”
Also, the research question and design plan rubric includes
a requirement that: “The group’s Design Plan will shed lighton the mechanism (cause) underlying the behavior (effect)
of the system.” As a result, students’ research questions,developed during the QFT activity, often evoke study of
causal relationships. For example, a student group engaging
in lab 3 asked the following research question:
“How does the internal environment of a human
with a higher body temperature change cellular
motility in comparison to a human with a lowerbody temperature? Why would a higher bodytemperature cause more cellular motility than a
body with a lower temperature?”
Students’ experimentation, thus, frequently continues inte-
grating CCC 2: Cause and Effect to work towards answering
their developed causally focused research questions.
Students are also prompted to utilize CCC 2: Cause and
Effect as a reasoning tool through discussion with TAs and
Table VIII. CCC alignment with IPLS labs.

LAs. Throughout the course, students are prompted by TAs
and LAs to consider cause and effect relationships in their
studied biological phenomena. As students complete the QFT
activity, they are prompted by TAs and LAs to consider how
their investigations might generate new knowledge about the
causal relationships between entities in their phenomena (e.g.,
a TA may ask a student group: “So how might changing X
help you learn about how Y and Z are causally related?”). TAs
and LAs often discuss with students how one of the central
components of generating testable research questions is being
able to determine how changes in one entity might impact
another entity. TAs and LAs also consistently revisit thesepotential causal relationships throughout students’ investiga-
tions, asking students to explain how their preliminary results
might serve as evidence of causal relationships.
While Table VIII denotes how each CCC is emphasized
throughout the course sequence, students are encouraged to
shift between various CCCs to engage in different forms of
reasoning as they complete their experiments.
V. CLOSING REMARKS
In recent years, many in the physics education community
have advocated for shifting lab instruction away from rote pro-
cedural labs that verify known principles and towards inquiry-based labs that engage students in authentic scientiﬁc practices,
critical thinking, and scientiﬁc reasoning. We have described a
sequence of reformed undergraduate introductory physics for
life sciences laboratory courses that utilizes a 3DL framework
to engage students in authentic scientiﬁc practices (SEPs) while
simultaneously using reasoning tools (CCCs) to make sense
about complex interdisciplinary scientiﬁc phenomena related to
larger core scientiﬁc ideas (DCIs). The supplementary material
6
for this paper provides additional details of our 3DL integrationprocess, TA and LA training and support, laboratory documen-
tation, and supporting student activities. Key elements for 3DLhave been explicitly included in course materials, including
those meant for the instructional team, making it relatively
straightforward to continue high-ﬁdelity implementation in the
future. In addition, the department has allocated adequate
instructional resources, including both graduate TAs and under-
graduate LAs, to enable sufﬁcient student support.
This paper provides a unique contribution to the existing
physics laboratory literature by introducing the 3DL frame-
work to the physics laboratory community-at-large and by
providing detailed descriptions of the efforts (presented in
the supplementary material
6) and curricular results of fully
integrating 3DL into an existing reform-based introductoryphysics laboratory course sequence. As described in Sec. II,
many well-known introductory physics laboratory courses
already possess implicit alignment with many aspects of
3DL, allowing for 3DL integration that does not necessarily
require a complete curricular overhaul. We hope that the
example curriculum and the supplementary material pre-
sented in this paper may inspire and guide future reforms
aimed at bringing 3DL into introductory physics laboratory
courses more widely.
