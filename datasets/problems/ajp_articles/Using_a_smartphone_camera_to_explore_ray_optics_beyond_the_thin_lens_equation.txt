Ray optics is a staple of introductory physics classes, but many students do not have the
opportunity to explore optics beyond the thin lens equation. In this paper, we expand upon asuccessful remote experiment using a smartphone camera to explore both the successes and
limitations of the thin lens equation. Application of the thin lens equation reveals a linear
relationship between the object distance and the inverse image height in pixels. Using the open-source image analysis tool ImageJ to measure the image height, we can ﬁnd the effective focal
length of the smartphone camera lens. Our measured focal lengths agree well with the stated
manufacturer values for the effective focal lengths. Further application of the thin lens equation isnot successful, but a modiﬁcation of the analysis leads to an explanation and experimental
determination of the location of the principal planes in the smartphone camera systems. This
experiment can work well at the introductory level, either in person or remote, and can be used asan introduction or motivation to explore more advanced topics in ray optics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the recent decade, the need for high-quality and low-
cost labs that can be conducted remotely has grown consider-
ably. This need, driven originally by “traditional” online
courses and MOOCs,1grew exponentially in 2020 when the
COVID-19 pandemic forced many institutions to suddenly
switch to a remote format for all courses, including for tradi-
tional hands-on labs.
Over roughly the same time period, the smartphone
evolved from a single-use item to a veritable physics lab that
can ﬁt into a pocket. The smartphone has multiple internal
sensors that can be leveraged for remote labs.2,3In particular,
the camera(s) in a smartphone are highly sophisticated and
sensitive. The smartphone camera can be used in a variety of
optical experiments, including studies of polarization,4
astronomy,5,6the lensmaker’s equation,7and the thin lens
equation,8,9as well as experiments that explore the shutter
speed or the CMOS sensor itself.10For students in the life
sciences, the smartphone can be used to study the human
eye11or modiﬁed to act as an optical or ﬂuorescence
microscope.12
In this article, we combine and then build on the work of
Refs. 8,9, and 13to create a comprehensive remote optics
lab. This experiment uses only a smartphone, a ruler, and
open-source software but is scalable and can be customized
for students in introductory courses, intermediate or
advanced lab courses, or optics courses. The article begins
with a straightforward investigation of the thin lens equation.
More advanced students can examine their experimental data
in a different way using a binomial approximation. Students
with a strong interest in optics or at the start of an optics
course can explore how the thin lens equation fails to fully
explain their experimental data. Understanding this failure
leads naturally to an exploration of thick lenses, multiplelens systems, and the principal planes inside any complex
optical system. The introduction of principal planes can
motivate a discussion of the system ray transfer matrix
method of geometrical optics. The system ray transfer matrixand the principal planes are an excellent place to begin a dis-
cussion of epistemology in physics and how to understand
the beneﬁts and limits of any particular model of a system.
II. THIN-LENS EXPERIMENT
In introductory optics, the camera is described as a single
converging lens, which focuses the light from an object onto
a focal plane to create a real image. For the camera, the focal
plane was the photographic ﬁlm, now replaced by the CCDor CMOS sensor inside a digital camera. The relationship
among the object distance, the image distance, and the focal
length of the lens is summarized by the thin lens equation (in
the Gaussian formalism)

f; (1)
where the focus of the lens is characterized by the focal
length f, which is positive for a converging lens and negative
for a diverging lens. The object distance soand image dis-
tance siare positive for real objects (from which light rays
diverge) and images (to which light rays converge); soandsi
are negative for virtual objects (this happens when a lens
would form an image but the rays are interrupted by a second
lens or mirror) and images (from which light rays appear to
diverge).14In a traditional lab setting, students determine the
focal length of a lens by measuring both the object distances
ofrom a lens and the image distance siwith the aid of a
ground glass screen.13
We can conduct a similar lab using the smartphone cam-
era, treating the smartphone optical system as a single thin
converging lens.8,9We take pictures of an object (e.g., a
ruler) while varying the distance of the object from thesmartphone. The difﬁculty arises in measuring the image dis-
tance s
i, which is hidden inside the body of the camera (and
which varies to allow the camera to focus on objects at dif-
ferent distances). We can avoid using the image distance by
employing the magniﬁcation of the lens

Our preferred tool for measuring the image size in pixels
is the open-source software ImageJ,
15which has both desk-
top and browser-based versions. ImageJ, originally devel-oped at the National Institutes for Health, is a standard toolused in microscopy and image analysis.Using Eqs. (2)and(3), Eq. (1)can be rewritten as the fol-
lowing linear equation:

Experimental data were taken with an iPhone 12 mini. The
iPhone 12 mini has three separate cameras: two rear cameras(labeled by the manufacturer as “ /C21w i d e ”a n d“ /C20.5 ultra-
wide”) and a front-facing “selﬁe” camera. Each camera has
its own set of lenses, motors, and CMOS sensors. Our data
from each of the three cameras are presented in Fig. 1.F o r
these data, the smartphone was held rigidly in place on anoptics table, and the object (a ruler) was moved into different
positions on the optics table. Each line represents a different
camera: the two rear cameras and the front selﬁe camera.When plotted as the inverse pixel height 1 =pas a function of
distance s
o, we can see the linear behavior predicted in Eq.
(4). We can use weighted least squares ﬁts to ﬁnd the slopes
and intercepts of these lines, as shown in Table I.
The CMOS pixel size for the sensors inside an iPhone 12
mini can be found using a web search, giving the values for c
listed in Table I.16Using the known object height Hand Eq.
(5), we can ﬁnd the focal lengths of the three cameras and
compare them to the manufacturer’s value for the effectivefocal length. Note that many websites do not list the effective
focal length but rather the 35 mm equivalent focal length
(usually between 10 and 30 mm).
17The true effective focal
length of the camera is stored in the photograph metadataand is on the order of 1 to 5 mm. Our results in Table Ido
not agree with the expected values within uncertainty, but all
have less than 5% discrepancy from the manufacturer’svalue and two are less than 1% discrepant. Moreover, the
data are strongly linear, conﬁrming the functional depen-
dence of the thin lens equation in Eq. (4).
We have also presented data using resources readily avail-
able in a remote setting. The open circles in Fig. 1are taken
with the rear “ /C21 wide” camera of an iPhone 12 mini using a
13.4-cm pen as the object and with distances measured using
a measuring tape. Even with these less precise measurements,Fig. 1. Measurements of a ruler with three different smartphone cameras, plot-
ted as inverse pixel size vs object distance from the lens along with weightedlinear least squares ﬁt lines (see Sec. III). The uncertainties in the measurements
are smaller than the points. From Eq. (5), we ﬁnd the effective focal lengths:
f
r1¼4:2860:01 mm, fr2¼1:63160:002 mm, and ff¼2:73760:003 mm,
which all have less than 5% discrepancy when compared to the manufacturer’s
effective focal lengths. Data from the rear “wide” camera during a typical
remote lab setup using a measuring tape and a pen as the object are presented
as open circles ( fr1¼4:5660:02 mm).
Table I. Results from measurements shown in Fig. 1using Eq. (5)to ﬁnd the focal length. The manufacturer’s values for the effective focal lengths are from
the photo metadata. The ratio of intercept to slope ( b/q) is used to ﬁnd the ﬁrst principal plane (Eq. (12)in Sec. IV), and the second principal plane is located
roughly one effective focal length from the right end of the lens.

using Eq. (5), we ﬁnd a focal length of fr1¼4:5660:02
mm2, a result with less than 10% discrepancy from the manu-
facturer’s value. In short, this experiment makes a useful andinexpensive in person or remote lab experience for introduc-tory students with satisfying results that agree with theirexpectations.
III. THE THIN LENS EQUATION FAILS
The thin lens equation, Eq. (4), predicted linear behavior,
which was borne out in the experimental results (Fig. 1). The
predicted slope, q¼1=ðcHfÞ, returned values for the effective
focal length that were very close to the manufacturer’s values.
We have not made use of the intercept of Eq. (4),
b¼/C01=ðcHÞ. Astute students will note that there is another
way to ﬁnd the focal length f. Because the cHfactor appears
in both the intercept and the slope, the ratio of the two will
eliminate those constants, revealing the focal length
f¼/C0
b
q: (6)
This method allows us to ﬁnd the focal length without
requiring any outside knowledge of the smartphone system .
In our case, this allows us to ﬁnd the camera’s focal lengthwithout needing to know the pixel size of the CCD or CMOSsensor or even the height of the object used, so long as itstays constant throughout our measurements.
Using the results presented in Table I, we can ﬁnd the
focal length using the slope and intercept of the linear ﬁt.
When doing so, we ﬁnd values of 3.8 60.1,/C00:4460:04,
and/C00:160:2 mm. These values are distressingly far from
the expected values of 4.2, 1.55, and 2.71 mm. In addition,one of the focal lengths is consistent with a focal length ofzero, and two of the values have the wrong sign, indicating adiverging (negative) lens for the smartphone camera! Theseresults cannot be correct.
Students will propose experimental improvements in an
attempt to save the thin lens equation in Eq. (4). Multiple
measurements of the image height in pixels ( p) can give the
uncertainty in the mean for each measurement, which canthen be used in a weighted least squares ﬁt. The ﬁts andresults in Fig. 1and Table Icome from a weighted least
squares ﬁt, and the focal lengths found from unweighted ﬁts
are not signiﬁcantly different. Thus, we conclude thatweighted ﬁts will not “ﬁx” the results using Eq. (6)to give
reasonable values for the signs or values of the focal lengths.
Most students will measure the object distance s
ofrom the
smartphone camera body. However, most smartphones have acamera “bump” raised from the smartphone body. Inside thecamera bump, the surface of the lens can be either outside orinside the smartphone camera body. We estimated the dis-tance from the smartphone body to the camera lens to be60.5 to61 mm for the iPhone 12 mini. The ﬁts and results in
Fig.1and Table Ihave been corrected for this small offset,
indicating that these offsets will not save Eq. (4).
Finally, a look at the camera lenses themselves raises fur-
ther questions. Cross-sectional views of the rear camera
lenses from an iPhone 12 mini are shown in Fig. 2.
18The
lenses for the “ /C21 wide” and the “ /C20:5 ultrawide” are 4.6
and 4.4 mm thick, respectively. Light enters these lensesfrom the left and exits to a CMOS sensor on the right (notshown). The CMOS sensor is /C240.5 mm from the last optical
element in the lens.The complexity of the smartphone camera lenses is obvious
from Fig. 2, where the lenses have seven and ﬁve elements
apiece. Considering each camera as a single lens governed by
the thin lens equation seems impossible. Moreover, given thatthe “/C21 wide” and “ /C20:5 ultrawide” cameras have 4.2 and
1.55 mm effective focal lengths, respectively, it would be
impossible to ﬁt these lenses along with an approximately 4 or2 mm distance from the lenses to the focal plane (the CMOS orCCD sensor) and still have all parts ﬁt inside a /C257m mt h i c k
smartphone.
Looking at the lenses, it seems obvious that the thin lens
equation should fail to describe this system. On the otherhand, the very linear experimental data in Fig. 1indicate the
thin lens equation does work, at least to some degree. To rec-oncile the successes and the failures, we must look beyondthe thin lens equation.
IV. MULTIPLE OPTICAL ELEMENTS
Rather than considering all ﬁve or seven optical elements
for a smartphone lens, let us begin by approximating a smart-phone lens as a pair of converging and diverging thin lenses,as shown in Fig. 3: two lenses of focal lengths f
1andf2sepa-
rated by a distance d. Introductory students might choose
this pair, because it is described in introductory textbooks forcamera lenses19and is the simplest approximation of a zoom
lens—and smartphone cameras are often marketed as“optical zoom” lenses (although the smartphone optical ele-
ments do not move relative to each other as they do in a true
zoom lens). Students in an optics course might choose itbecause the pair can form a thin achromatic doublet, the sim-plest combination that can remove some of the chromaticaberrations inherent in a single lens,
20,21though to remove
more aberrations the lenses should be touching ( d¼0).
A two lens system is conceptually simple: you apply the
formalism of the thin lens equation (Eq. (1)) twice, where
the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the ﬁrst and second lens. Themagniﬁcation becomes
m¼si1
so1/C1si2
so2¼/C0hi2
H; (7)
that is, the magniﬁcation is the ratio of the height of the
image generated by the second lens to the original object
Fig. 2. Cross-sectional views of the iPhone 12 mini rear camera “ /C21 wide”
(a) and the “ /C20:5 ultrawide” (b) lenses, showing seven and ﬁve separate
optical elements, respectively. In both panels, light enters the lens from the
left and exits to the CMOS sensor at the right. The CMOS sensor (not
shown) is nearly touching the ﬁnal optical element. For (a), the ﬁrst principal
plane is to the left (red dashed line), and the second principal plane is to the
right (blue dashed line). For (b), only the second principal plane is shown;
the ﬁrst occurs out of the image to the left.

each lens and the knowledge that jso2j¼si1/C0dleads to a
system of four equations and four unknowns ( si1;so2;si2,
and p) and one known (or measurable) quantity ( so1).

where

is the equivalent focal length of the system, which often
appears in optics textbooks.20In order to sketch this achro-
matic doublet, we must pick values for the focal lengths. Thechoices of f
1¼þ3 mm, f2¼/C04 mm, and d¼2 mm will
simplify the diagram and the math and give a reasonablevalue of f
eq¼4 mm, similar to the known effective focal
length of smartphone cameras. (These choices will not nec-
essarily reduce chromatic aberrations.) These choices arereﬂected in Fig. 3.
In this two-lens system, we have retained linear behavior
between 1 =pands
o1, which helps justify our data in Fig. 1.
When we look at the intercept, we see that it has picked up anew term when compared to the intercept in Eq. (4), which
helps explain why the attempt to ﬁnd the focal lengththrough Eq. (6)failed. Although it is clear from Eq. (8)that
the intercept has a new term when compared to Eq. (4), it’s
not clear what the new term is or what it means, or how it
will change if we switch to three, or four, or more lenses.
We can explain this term in the intercept by introducing
the concept of principal planes . The principal planes are two
theoretical planes in any lens system, be it a single lens, athick lens, or multiple thin or thick lenses. In the optical sys-tem, all refraction is considered to occur at the principalplanes. This allows any optical system to be treated similarlyto a single thin lens, where the light enters the ﬁrst principalplane and then exits the second principal plane, ignoring theseparation between the planes. The principal planes for thetwo-lens system in Fig. 3are shown as dotted lines, and two
principal rays are shown. The ray that goes through the
“center” of the thin lens comes out undiverted, as we expect,though the gap between the principal planes shifts the exit ofthe ray laterally from the entrance! The ﬁrst principal planeis measured from the center or left edge (if a thick lens) of
the leftmost optical element, and the second principal plane
is measured from the center or right edge of the rightmostoptical element. Using O1 and O2 as the center of the two
lenses in Fig. 3, the distances to the principal planes become
O1H1 and O2H2. These distances are negative if the plane
is to the left of the element and positive if they are to the
right.
Employing the logic of the principal planes, we can still
use Eq. (4)so long as the object distance is measured from
the principal plane (the distance so1/C0O1H1). Using this
logic, we ﬁnd
1
p¼1
cHfeqso1/C0O1H1/C0/C1

which will yield the correct focal length using Eq. (6).
However, in this experiment, we do not know the location ofthe principal planes, and it makes more sense to measure
from the smartphone body. In that case, we modify the previ-
ous equation to ﬁnd

where the intercept is no longer equal to 1 =cHand the dis-
tance from the lens to the principal plane O1H1 ends up in
the intercept. Using Eq. (10), we now know why we have an
additional term in the intercept—it occurs when the ﬁrst lens
and the ﬁrst principal plane are separated in space.
The distance from the rightmost lens to the second princi-
pal plane ( O2H2) does not appear in Eq. (10). Recall that we
measure the ﬁnal image height in pixels p, which is equiva-
lent (via the magniﬁcation) to a measurement of the image
distance—which we now know is not sibut rather a measure-
ment of the image distance as measured from the secondprincipal plane. Thus, the second principal plane is already
accounted for in Eq. (10).
In this ﬁnal version, we have a slope qand an intercept b

and we can use the ratio of the intercept over the slope to

ing an equivalent focal length of feq¼þ4 mm. The two principal planes (red and blue vertical dashed lines) are labeled with the principal points H1 and H2.
An object 10 mm from the ﬁrst lens produces an image 5.33 mm from the second lens.

q: (12)
For a single thin lens, both principal planes occur at the lens
location ( O1H1 ¼O2H2 ¼0), giving the expected result for
the focal length of a single lens (Eq. (6)).
Thus, for a complex optical system, we cannot use Eq. (6)
to ﬁnd the focal length. Instead, we can use the intercept toexpand our knowledge of the optical system in a different
way. If we ﬁnd the equivalent focal length using the slope
(Eq. (11)), we can use the intercept in Eq. (12) to ﬁnd
the ﬁrst principal plane. The principal planes are listed inTable I. For the rear “ /C21 wide” camera, the ﬁrst principal
plane is in the middle of the optical system, shown in Fig.
2(a) as a red dashed line (
O1H1 ¼0:460:1 mm). For the
other two cameras, the ﬁrst principal plane is outside the
smartphone ( O1H1 ¼/C02:0760:04 mm and /C02:83560:2
mm). For the camera in Fig. 2(b), the ﬁrst principal plane is
roughly 2 mm to the left of the leftmost element.
The distance to the second principal plane does not occur
in Eq. (10), but we can deduce its location nonetheless. Any
object very far from a converging lens will create an image
at a distance very close to the focal length of the lens. Theimaging plane in a smartphone will be the CMOS or CCDsensor. Thus, because object distances in a smartphonecamera system are nearly always much larger than the
effective focal length, the distance from the second princi-
pal plane to the sensor will be very close to the effectivefocal length. The second principal plane will be to the leftof the CMOS sensor, and therefore negative. For the lensesin Fig. 2, we can estimate the location of the second princi-
pal plane knowing that the CMOS sensor is only /C250:5m m
to the right of the rightmost optical element. The second
principal planes are shown as blue dashed lines in Fig. 2.I n
this ﬁgure, the second principal planes occur inside the opti-cal system.
Without knowing more details of the optical elements
used in the smartphone cameras, it is impossible to deter-
mine the precise locations of the principal planes for compar-
ison with the experimental results. If the details of theoptical system are known, it is possible to calculate the loca-tions of the planes, as shown in Fig. 3. A tool for calculating
the principal planes is called the system ray transfer matrix
21
(or system matrix, or transfer matrix, or ray transfer matrix,or ABCD matrix) and can be used to ﬁnd not only the princi-pal planes but also the equivalent focal length (e.g., Eq. (9)).
Thus, the experimental determination of the principal planesinside a smartphone can motivate an introduction to this the-oretical tool. A short introduction to the system ray transfer
matrix is shown in Appendix B .
V. CONCLUSIONS
The need for robust, thought-provoking, yet inexpensive
and logistically simple remote labs will only continue to
increase in the coming years. This work takes a proven inex-
pensive and remote lab to measure the effective focal lengthof a smartphone camera and modiﬁes it to introduce studentsto the powerful image analysis tool ImageJ. These data canbe analyzed using a straightforward analysis (Eq. (4)), and
students can also re-examine the same data using a binomial
expansion (Eq. (A1)). Both methods yield focal lengths with
small discrepancies compared to the effective focal lengthstored in the smartphone image metadata, a result which is
both comforting and satisfying.
Further examination of the data reveals the shortcomings
of treating a smartphone camera as a single thin lens.
These shortcomings become opportun ities to intr oduce
more advanced concepts in ray optics, namely, the exis-
tence of the principal planes. Using the experimental data,
the locations of the principal planes in a smartphone cam-
era are determined. These results can also be used to moti-
vate a discussion of the system ray transfer matrix for an
optical system. This experiment can be useful as an intro-duction to an optics course or as a “taste” of optics beyond
the thin lens equation for students without opportunity to
take such a course. The experiment described here can also
serve as an opportunity to discuss epistemology in physics:
when physicists use which models, and what can be
learned from both the successes and the failures of the
model. Finally, the experiment serves as an opportunity to
engage in discussion about what models mean : what does
it mean when we treat a system of ﬁve or seven lenses as a
single lens with a front plane and a back plane with
“nothing” between the planes? Students might even beneﬁtfrom returning to this experiment at different stages of
their education to see how their understanding of physics
experimentation has grown more sophisticated as they
have progressed through coursework.

APPENDIX A: TAYLOR EXPANSION OF THE THIN
LENS EQUATION FOR A SMARTPHONE
This author has asked students to begin with Eq. (1)and
derive a linear relationship between the height in pixels p
and the object distance s
o. In doing so, not all students cor-
rectly arrive at Eq. (4). Some students incorrectly derive a
linear relationship between the height in pixels pand the
inverse object distance 1 =so, while others “brute force” the
derivation and make plots ﬁrst to test out possible linear
dependencies. A graph of the same data from Fig. 1is shown
in Fig. 4, only this time as height in pixels vs inverse object
distance. Contrary to the prediction from Eq. (4), the graphs
appear linear again!
The explanation for this is straightforward, and for stu-
dents learning about Taylor expansions for the ﬁrst time, this
lab provides experimental proof of the usefulness of these
expansions. Returning to the thin lens equation and using
Eqs. (2)and(3)again, we can show that

Even if we know nothing about the speciﬁcs of the smart-
phone, the thickness of the phone itself (roughly 7 mm) sets
an upper bound on the focal length f. The student sets the
object distance so, usually 10 cm and above, making f=so
reasonably small. If we keep the ﬁrst term of the expansion,
then the height in pixels is now linear with the inverse object
distance , and we expect a positive intercept very close to
zero.
This analysis justiﬁes the results shown in Fig. 4. The
experimental data look linear, and the intercepts are very
small, as predicted. For these data, we expect a slope of
q¼cHf, from which we can ﬁnd the effective focal length f.
The experimental results are shown in Table II, where again
we ﬁnd excellent agreement between the measured focallength and the effective focal length found in the photograph
metadata. The intercepts are indeed small but not positive,
indicating that the model does not work well beyond the ﬁrst
term.
This method provides an excellent opportunity for inter-
mediate students to practice both math skills (in the binomial
expansion) as well as analyze the data from a new perspec-
tive. The ability to expand the thin lens equation as shown in
Fig. 4works for any situation where the object distance is
much greater than the focal length. In a conventional instruc-
tional optics lab setting, this may or may not be true; in a
smartphone, it is essentially always met.APPENDIX B: SYSTEM RAY TRANSFER MATRIX
FOR THIN LENSES
Let us consider a system of nthin lenses, each with focus
f
nand separated by an air gap of width dn. In this case, each
optical element (lens or air gap) can be written as a 2 /C22
matrix.20Each lens is represented by

The equivalent focal length of our two-lens system in
Sec. IV(Eq. (9)) can be derived using the system ray transfer
matrix.
The system ray transfer matrix becomes more complicated
with thick lenses but is described in detail in opticstextbooks.20,21

ear behavior with small positive intercepts. The measured focal lengths
agree well with the manufacturer values.

17The relevant measure for determining how much of a scene a particular
camera lens and sensor can see is actually the camera angle of view.
However, the focal length of a lens used in conjunction with traditional
35 mm photographic negatives is used as an equivalent measure of the
angle of view. Using a known angle of view, the equivalent focal length
with 35 mm ﬁlm negatives can be calculated. As a result, most smartphone
cameras list the 35 mm equivalent focal length for photographers. The dif-ference between the 35 mm equivalent focal length and the effective focal
length is a source of confusion for students, but an excellent opportunity to
discuss how a focal length of 26 mm, for example, would be impossible if
the camera is to ﬁt inside a smartphone whose thickness is usually less
than 7 mm.
18To obtain these photographs, a replacement rear camera set was purchasedfrom https://www.iﬁxit.com . The lens assemblies were removed from the
camera housing and sanded down using 1400-grit sandpaper. The photo-
graphs were taken using a stereo-optical microscope.
