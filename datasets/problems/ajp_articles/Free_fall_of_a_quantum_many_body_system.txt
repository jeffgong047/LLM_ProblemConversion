The quantum version of the free fall problem is a topic often skipped in undergraduate quantum
mechanics courses, because its discussion usually requires wavepackets built on the Airy
functions—a difﬁcult computation. Here, on the contrary, we show that the problem can be nicelysimpliﬁed both for a single particle and for general many-body systems by making use of a gauge
transformation that corresponds to a change of reference frame from the laboratory frame to the
one comoving with the falling system. Using this approach, the quantum mechanics problem of aparticle in an external gravitational potential reduces to a much simpler one where there is no
longer any gravitational potential in the Schr €odinger equation. It is instructive to see that the same
procedure can be used for many-body systems subjected to an external gravitational potential and atwo-body interparticle potential that is a function of the distance between the particles. This topic
provides a helpful and pedagogical example of a quantum many-body system whose dynamics can
be analytically described in simple terms.

I. INTRODUCTION
In classical mechanics, one of the ﬁrst problems that stu-
dents encounter is the dynamics of a falling body: an object
pulled down to the ground (e.g., from Pisa’s tower) by the
constant force of Earth’s gravity. However, amazinglyenough, the same problem is not always discussed in quan-tum mechanics courses due to the sharp contrast between thephysical simplicity of the problem and the difﬁculty of itsmathematical description. Basic quantum mechanics courses
are largely structured around solving the time-dependent
Schr €odinger equation i/C22hð@w=@tÞ¼Hwfor the wavefunction
wðx;tÞin terms of the eigenfunctions W, which solve the
time-independent equation HW¼EW. Indeed, in traditional
approaches to the problem of determining the wavefunctionat time t, it is necessary to involve the Airy functions and the
projection of the falling body’s wavefunction into this set of
eigenfunctions. Resorting to the Eherenfest theorem provides
expressions for position or momentum expectation valuesbut does not provide immediate insight into the simple solu-tion of the system. Solving the problem using a time-dependent variational approach might reveal the solution’ssimple structure, but this technique is not introduced in manyuniversity quantum mechanics courses. Here, we show that
an alternative way to deal with the quantum falling body is
pedagogically simple but also general enough to be applica-ble to the single particle case and to quantum many-bodysystems. This approach exploits the use of a gauge transfor-mation of the wavefunction that corresponds to a change ofreference frame from the inertial laboratory frame to the fall-
ing body’s accelerated frame. By gauge transformation, we
mean the multiplication of the wavefunction by a phase fac-tor. This multiplication will not affect expectation values ofphysical observables like the position of a wavepacket. Inthe new reference frame, there is of course no longer any
gravitational effect, and therefore, the system appears to be“free,” i.e., not subject to gravity. A few comments on termi-nology are in order. Throughout the paper, we sometimesrefer to a system in the absence of gravity as “free.” This isnot to be confused with an alternative meaning of “free” as“non-interacting.” Later, we will discuss interacting systemsof particles; to avoid confusion, we will refer to the interact-ing system in the absence of gravity as the “non-falling” sys-tem. (Of course, a system in “free fall” is not “free” in eithersense of the word discussed above.)
It is worth emphasizing that the method discussed here can
be applied to study the effect of the gravitational force on a
quantum many-body system, where particles with position
vectors r
jandrkinteract via a generic two-body potential of
the form Vðjrj/C0rkjÞ. This leads to some interesting results.
For instance, as we discuss in the following, the time evolution
of observables, such as the variance of the position of a falling
wavepacket, is the same as the time evolution for a free wave-packet. The effect of gravity shows up solely in the behaviorof the expectation values of position (and powers thereof)
which, on the other hand, can be obtained from the classical
Newton’s second law of motion. This last point follows fromthe Ehrenfest theorem (see, e.g., Ref. 1), from which we can
infer that the momentum of the wavepacket varies linearly
with time while its position has a quadratic time dependence.
This last fact is valid for a generic interaction potential in anynumber of dimensions; in this paper, we will focus on one- and
three-dimensional cases as explanatory examples. We will also
show how to easily determine the expressions for the energyand the total momentum of the falling many-body systemusing the basic commutation rules. Finally, we show how to
relate the one-body density matrix of the falling body to the
corresponding density matrix of the “free” (although possibly

interacting) non-falling system and give a simple relationship
between the eigenvalues of the two density matrices.
Employing a gauge transformation to deal with quantum
free fall was already presented in Refs. 2and3for the single
particle case in one dimension only; here, we will show that it
can be extended to the case of interacting many-body quan-tum systems in more than one dimension, broadening theinterest on this topic. In all of these examples, we will work
in the Schr €odinger picture, in such a way that the method
used to tackle the single quantum particle case can then beapplied to the many-body problem, keeping the same formal-
ism and hence giving a ﬂuid extension of applicability.
II. FREE FALL OF A QUANTUM PARTICLE
We are interested in a quantum particle of mass msubject
to a linear gravitational potential (or, in a charged quantum
particle subject to a constant electric ﬁeld) in one dimension
(see, e.g., Refs. 3and4). The case of a charged particle in a
constant electric ﬁeld is a straightforward generalization.The Schr €odinger equation takes the form
i/C22h
@
@twðx;tÞ¼ /C0/C22h2
2m@2
@x2þmgx/C18/C19
wðx;tÞ; (1)
where wðx;tÞis the wave function and gdenotes the gravita-
tional acceleration (for the case of a charged particle in a
constant electric ﬁeld E, one can replace mg!qE). This
equation may describe, for example, Einstein’s famousgedankenexperiment of a rocket in empty space (i.e., veryfar from any other celestial body) and subject to an accelera-
tion equal to g’9:81 m =s
2, as sketched in Fig. 1. Suppose
that inside the rocket there is a single quantum object, e.g.,an Einsteinium atom, for which the relevant Schr €odinger
equation will be indeed, Eq. (1). The equation is also appro-
priate for the case when the rocket is standing still on theEarth’s surface.
This problem can be solved using the Fourier transform to
go to momentum space, as discussed in Ref. 5, while other
methods of solution, related to the Airy functions, were pro-
posed and discussed in Refs. 6–9. For the solution of theproblem involving a time dependent gravitational force, see
the recent paper.

Given the initial wavepacket wðx;t¼0Þsubjected to a
uniform gravitational ﬁeld, what is the wavefunction wðx;tÞ
at a generic time t? As explained in the introduction, the
solution that consists of projecting the initial wavepacket
into the Airy functions is cumbersome, and other tools taught
in basic quantum mechanics courses, such as time-dependent
perturbation theory, may not prove illuminating. An easily
accessible solution can be found by performing a gauge
transformation which we now introduce.
A. Gauge transformation
Let us discuss now the method of solving Eq. (1)by
means of a gauge transformation. This result and approach
is the same as in Refs. 2,3,11,a n d 12, but we review the
derivation here in order to prepare for the presentation of
the general case of a many-body system falling in three
dimensions. First, we pass to the comoving accelerated
frame of reference by changing the spatial variable from x
toq,w h e r e
qðtÞ¼x/C0nðtÞ (2)
andnðtÞis related to the gravitational force acting on the sys-
tem, as we are going to show. After this, we perform a gauge
transformation13via a space-time dependent phase hðx;tÞby
writing the transformed wavefunction as
wðx;tÞ/C17 eihðx;tÞgðqðtÞ;tÞ; (3)
with hðx;tÞbeing a function to be determined in order to
wash out the gravitational potential.
Substituting Eq. (3)into Eq. (1), we see that the external
potential term can be eliminated if we impose
dn

m@h
@x;/C0/C22h@h
@t¼/C22h2
2m@h
@x/C18/C192
þmgx : (4)
Assuming the validity of these equations, it is easy to see
thatgðq;tÞsatisﬁes the Schr €odinger equation with no exter-
nal potential but with xreplaced by the new spatial variable,
q, and wreplaced by g, i.e.,
i/C22h@
@tgðq;tÞ¼/C0/C22h2
2m@2
@q2gðq;tÞ: (5)
We observe that using Eq. (2)and employing the Heisenberg
representation would be an alternative way of solving the
problem. We prefer to stick to the use of the gauge transfor-
mation in the Schr €odinger picture, because we believe that
the method is instructive and useful for other calculations
where gauge transformations are performed.
If we now make the ansatz
hðx;tÞ¼m

and use it in Eq. (4), we arrive at the conditions

equations (7)with the initial conditions nð0Þ¼ _nð0Þ¼0a n d
Cð0Þ¼0, we get the following expression for the gauge phase:
hðx;tÞ¼/C0mgt
/C22hx/C0mg2t3
6/C22h; (8)
while the “translational” parameter nreads
nðtÞ¼/C0gt2
2: (9)
Similar results may be obtained in the case _nð0Þ6¼0. Notice
that the x-dependent term of the gauge phase in Eq. (8)is the
gravitationally induced phase difference that is observed in
interferometers when two beams of particles follow paths
that are at different heights. For a detailed pedagogical dis-
cussion about this, we refer readers to chapter 2.7 of Ref. 14.
Equations (8)and (9), together with Eqs. (3)and (5),
completely solve the Schr €odinger equation (1), since gðq;tÞ
is simply the well-known solution of the Schr €odinger
equation for a free particle, which is often studied in
quantum mechanics courses, for example, in the context of
the spreading of a Gaussian wavepacket. Notice that, with
our choices hðx;0Þ¼0 and qð0Þ¼x, from Eq. (3)we have
wðx;0Þ¼gðx;0Þ. Therefore, we can write the complete solu-
tion of the Schr €odinger equation (1)as
wðx;tÞ¼exp ihðx;tÞ ½/C138 /C1 exp/C0it
/C22h^p2

/C22h^p2
2m/C0inðtÞ
/C22h^p/C20/C21
wðx;0Þ;
(10)
where we used the deﬁnition of the translation operator
wðx/C0nðtÞ;tÞ¼exp/C0inðtÞ
/C22h^p/C20/C21
wðx;tÞ (11)
and the free time evolution operator. In Eqs. (10) and(11),^p
refers to the momentum operator: ^p!/C0 i/C22hð@=@xÞ.
B. Expectation values
Using the results just discussed, we can study the time
evolution of expectation values of different operators such as
position and momentum. The expectation values of powers
of^xare deﬁned as
hxNiðtÞ/C17h wðx;tÞj^xNjwðx;tÞi ¼ð1
/C01jwðx;tÞj2xNdx;
(12)
while the expectation values of powers of the momentum ^p
are
hpNiðtÞ/C17h wðx;tÞj^pNjwðx;tÞi
¼ð /C0 i/C22hÞNð1
/C01w/C3ðx;tÞ@N
@xNwðx;tÞdx; (13)
where the wavefunction wðx;tÞis normalized.Assuming initial values
hxið0Þ¼x0;hpið0Þ¼p0; (14)
we can employ the solution (10) to obtain the time evolved
expectation values. In the following, we focus our atten-
t i o no nt h ec a s e s N¼ 1;2 since these quantities are com-
monly encountered in introductory quantum mechanics
courses.
C. Commutation relations
Before proceeding in that direction, it is useful to study
commutation relations among different operators such as the
position operator with the translation and the time evolution
operators. A similar insightful discussion on operator alge-
bra in the case of gravitational problems can be found in
Ref. 15.
Writing
hð^x;tÞ/C17 ^xAþB;
where in our case

we have
^p;eihð^x;tÞ/C2/C3
¼/C22hAeihð^x;tÞ: (15)
Finally, we need to calculate
^p2;eihð^x;tÞ/C2/C3

¼/C22hAðÞ2eihð^x;tÞþ2/C22hAeihð^x;tÞ^p; (16)
where we used the result (15). Similar results for the commu-
tation relation of the position operator (and its powers) may
be easily found.
D. Time evolution of operators involving ^x
We have all quantities we need to evaluate expectation
values of the state wðx;tÞin(10). Let us start with

where we used the fact that ^xcommutes with eihð^x;tÞ. With

we have deﬁned

hx2ifreeðtÞ/C17h gðx;tÞj^x2jgðx;tÞi; (26)
which are expectation values of x2evaluated on the “free”
Schr €odinger equation solution gðx;tÞ, i.e., with g¼0, pre-
pared in the initial state gðx;0Þ¼wðx;0Þ.
Finally, we get the following expression for the standard
deviation:

As evident from Eq. (27), the variance of the position of the
falling wavepacket behaves the same as in the free (i.e., nogravity) case.
E. Time evolution of ^p’s operators
Similar computations can be done for the expectation val-
ues involving the momentum. Proceeding as before, we gethwðx;tÞj^pjwðx;tÞi ¼ /C0 mgtþp

Finally, let’s compute the standard deviation of ^pusing Eqs.

According to Eq. (30), the variance of the momentum
remains equal to its initial value at t¼0, while Eq. (31)
shows that the evolution of the variance of ^pfor a falling
wavepacket is exactly the same as that of a freely expanding
wavepacket.
We can check the results obtained above in the case of an
initial Gaussian wavepacket subject to a gravitational force,reproducing the results of Ref. 3. We prepare a Gaussian

F. Three-dimensional case
It is simple to extend the analysis which we presented
above to the case of a single particle falling along the

Schr €odinger equation reads

where qðtÞ¼x/C0nðtÞ, and the gauge phase hðx;tÞand the

Analogously to Eq. (10), choosing hðx;tÞto be Eq. (8)and

From Eq. (38), it is straightforward to perform the calcula-
tion of expectation values of different coordinates, andsince operators associated with different coordinate axes
commute (like ^xand ^pyor^pyand ^pzand so on) then the
motion in the yandzdirections is trivially evaluated to be
the free one ( g¼0), while for the xcomponent, one relies
on the results presented previously for the one-dimensional
case.
In summary, the motion of a wavepacket in three-
dimensions under the action of gravity is described by aspreading, which is identical to a free (no gravity) expansionin all directions, while its center of mass accelerates in the
direction of the gravitational force as a classical particle
would.
III. FREE FALL OF TWO INTERACTING
PARTICLES
In Sec. II, we revisited the solution for the quantum
dynamics of a particle falling under the action of a gravita-
tional potential. The formalism was presented in a way thatcan be straightforwardly extended to the case of two or more
particles. Such results may be of interest in advanced courses
and may have other modern applications.
We start by studying a three-dimensional system of two
interacting particles subject to gravity. The Schr €odinger
equation reads

We can now ask the same questions as before: If we start
from a generic wavepacket wðr1;r2;0Þand we let it evolve
under the action of gravity, how do its variances and expec-
tation values of powers of position behave? Let’s deﬁne as

It is actually very simple to show that the same results for
the one-particle case will hold, that is to say, the variances ofpositions of the particles will behave as the free expanding
case, while the expectation values of powers of the xcompo-
nent for positions have the same expressions of the one-bodycase, see Eqs. (22) and(24), with an additional index j¼1, 2
to label the particles. For yandzcomponents, one has the
formulas with g¼0, since the gravitational potential only
affects motion in the xdirection. The simplicity of this result
comes from the fact that the commutators among operators
acting on different particles vanish, therefore

We conclude that this method of gauge transformation can be
used to reduce the initial Schr €odinger equation describing the
dynamics of two falling interacting particles (with potentiallydifferent masses and velocities) to the simpler Schr €odinger
equation where no gravitational potential is present and withthe same interaction potential among the particles. The fun-damental requirement is that the two-body potential dependsonly on the relative distance between the particles.
IV. FREE FALL OF A QUANTUM MANY-BODY
SYSTEM
In the literature, the motion of a “structured,” many-body
quantum system under the action of a gravitational potentialhas been studied in various situations ranging fromBose–Einstein condensates
18–20to one-dimensional integra-
ble systems.21,22The case of a general three-dimensional
many-body system subject to gravity can be explicitlyaddressed using the method described in Secs. IIandIII.
Let’s then focus our attention on the Schr €odinger equation
forNinteracting particles (which are spinless, for simplicity)
subject to a gravitational force along the xdirection

where the second sum is a double summation running over
the two indices jandk, the interaction potential depends on
the relative distances among particles, and the kinetic part is
written in terms of Eq. (42). In this more general case, the

where the kinetic part is expressed in terms of Eq. (45) for
every j. Using Eq. (55), one can prove that all results pre-
sented in Secs. IIandIII, in particular, Eqs. (51)–(53) and
the same expressions for yandzcoordinates but with g¼0,
also hold for the many-body system.
Writing r¼x^iþy^jþz^k,w h e r e ^i;^j,a n d ^kare the
usual unit vectors in the Cartesian coordinate system, then
we can write hriðtÞ¼ ^ihxiðtÞþ^jhyiðtÞþ ^khziðtÞ.U s i n g
this relation (and the analogous relation for the momen-tum vector P), one can derive the time evolution of expec-
tation values of the wavepacket’s position (and
momentum). In particular, given that the system conservesthex,yand z-components of the total momentum, i.e.,

and using the above results, after an elementary but lengthy
calculation, one obtains that the energy is conserved duringthe motion, as expected.
Using the many-body wavefunction in Eq. (55),w ea r e
also able to write the one-body density matrix of the falling
system in terms of the non-falling system. This is interestingbecause the correlation properties of many-body systems are
encoded in one- and many-body density matrices, and
that off-diagonal long-range order can be read out at vanish-
ing and ﬁnite temperature from the one-body density
matrix.

The one-body density matrix is deﬁned as23

/C2wðr0;r2;…;rN;tÞ: (61)

tively. So ﬁnally,

where qfreeð.;.0;tÞis deﬁned in terms of g, the solution of
the Schr €odinger equation without gravitational ﬁeld.
For a translationally invariant system, the above equation
may be further simpliﬁed by writing everything in terms of
the relative coordinate R/C17r/C0r0. In this case, since
R¼./C0.0, then Eq. (63) may be rewritten as
qðR;tÞ¼eimgtX =/C22hqfreeðR;tÞ; (64)
where Eq. (8)h a sb e e nu s e da n d Xis the x-component of the R.
We may further analyze the eigenvalues of the one-body
density matrix for a translationally invariant system. In the
static case, the one-body density matrix satisﬁes the eigen-
value equation23
ð
qðr;r0Þ/iðr0Þdr0¼ki/iðrÞ; (65)
where kiis the occupation number of the i-th natural orbital
eigenvector /iðrÞ. Since for a translationally invariant sys-
tem, the natural orbitals are simply plane waves, we can
839 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022 Colcelli et al. 839 04 October 2023 23:20:40
relate the natural orbitals occupation numbers of the falling
system to those of the non-falling one

where the wavevector ~k¼ðkxþmgt=/C22hÞ/C1exþky/C1eyþkz/C1ez
is the correct quantum number of the system, and we have
deﬁned
kfree
kðtÞ¼ð
qfreeðR;tÞeik/C1RdR: (67)
From the above relations, one may observe that there is only
a time-dependent translation of the x-component of the
momentum wavevector, which identiﬁes the occupationnumbers of the falling system with respect to the non-fallingcase with no gravitational potential.
We emphasize again that the approach of gauge trans-
forming and then performing a translation transformationworks ﬁne even in the case of particles with different massessuch as a free falling atom or molecule.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have revisited the quantum description
of free fall in a gravitational (or electric) ﬁeld and haveshown that it can be nicely simpliﬁed by making use of agauge transformation of the wavefunction. This correspondsto changing from the laboratory reference frame to the onethat moves within the falling body. In this way, we pedagog-ically reviewed the results already presented in Ref. 3and
extended them to the case of a generic three-dimensionalquantum many-body system subject to a gravitationalpotential.
The gauge transformation method appears to be highly
versatile and easily applicable, since the expectation valuesof relevant physical quantities can be related to their counter-
parts in the absence of gravity. In particular, we have shown
that the variances of the initial wavepacket are exactly thesame as if the system does not feel any gravitational force atall. Other physical observables (e.g., the one-body densitymatrix) are also simply related to the corresponding ones in anon-falling system. All calculations we presented requireonly basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and are, there-fore, accessible to undergraduates. Regarding the applicationof the presented method to other systems, it could be peda-gogically interesting to apply it to the Dirac equation in a lin-ear potential.
