LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Letters are selected for their expected interest for our readers. Some letters are sent to reviewers for advice;
some are accepted or declined by the editor without review. Letters must be brief and may be edited, sub-ject to the author s approval of signiﬁcant changes. Although some comments on published articles and
notes may be appropriate as letters, most such comments are reviewed according to a special procedure
and appear, if accepted, in the Notes and Discussions section. (See the Statement of Editorial Policy atajp.aapt.org.) Running controversies among letter writers will not be published.

Authors who publish in the American Journal of Physics
(AJP)o rThe Physics Teacher (TPT) will no doubt be happy
that their article was accepted for publication, and even hap-pier if it is widely read. Since December 2016, both journalshave tracked online views. (In addition to these online views,the journals are read in libraries and by print subscribers.)Presumably, a view might include anything from a quickglance to a thorough study. What do these views tell us aboutthe useful lifetime of an article?
An indication of the fate of an article is given in Fig. 1,
which shows the average number of views from December2016 to April 2022 of articles going back to the ﬁrst issue
(February 1933 for AJP and April 1963 for TPT). One issue
was selected every 10 years, then at shorter intervals inrecent years, and the average number of views of the articlesin that issue is plotted vs the year of publication. Viewsbefore December 2016 are not included in the statistics.Some individual articles had more than 7000 views and wereexcluded from Fig. 1since they were not representative. The
most viewed article in AJP (February 2018) had 60 953
views and the most viewed article in TPT (October 2019)
had 33 027 views.The data show that modern readers are far more likely
to read recent publications than old publications, as onewould expect. In that sense, most publications have a use-ful life of about 20 years in The Physics Teacher and about
40 years in American Journal of Physics ,t h e nf a d ei n t o
relative obscurity. The number of views for papers pub-lished in the February 2021 issue of AJP and the April
2021 issue of TPT is relatively low, since views were
counted only one year after publication. A larger numberof views is indicated for papers published from 2018 to2020 since the views were counted over a greater numberof years. Fewer views are observed for papers published
before 2018 since (a) views before December 2016 were
not counted, (b) readers tend not to read old papers, (c)more readers appear to be accessing the journal in morerecent years, and (d) open access articles were not avail-able before 2018.
A surprising result is that the number of views of most of
my own papers has been increasing at a roughly constantrate since 2016, even if the paper was published around theyear 2000. For example, a paper on bouncing balls publishedin 1999 had 406 views in December 2018, 628 views inFebruary 2020, and 1054 views in April 2022. That resultindicates that the number of readers has increased rapidly inrecent years, in both journals, presumably because the inter-net has made the journals more accessible in many morecountries throughout the world. Other authors may haveobserved a similar result, but progressive views are not pub-lished in the journals.
Additional data on many different journals are available in
theClarivate Journal Citation Reports database, describing
citations rather than views or downloads. An interesting sta-tistic is that the Cited Half-Life for American Journal of
Physics is 22.4 years. That is, in 2021, half of all cited items
in the journal were published in the previous 22.4 years, andthe other half were published before then. That is roughlyconsistent with the half-life of views. By comparison, theCited Half-Life for Physical Review B is 12.1 years, and for
Nature is 10.6 years.
