We have considered the vibration of various types of pinned guitar strings and have investigated
the deviation of the partials from integer multiples of the string’s fundamental vibration frequency.We measured the inharmonicity parameter Band compared it to a direct calculation based on a
model equation. We generally found very good agreement between the two determinations of Bfor
monoﬁlament strings, but perhaps not surprisingly, we ﬁnd rather poor agreement for wound
strings. Furthermore, we show that the methodology used to carry out this experiment can easily
serve as the basis for an upper division physics laboratory on physical acoustics including a morethorough investigation of the classical wave equation in a real-world application.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the fundamental equations one generally learns in
the ﬁrst year of University Physics is the relationship
between the harmonics present in a musical instrument and
the fundamental frequency one hears when the instrumentsounds a particular pitch. For any quasi-one-dimensionalinstrument like strings, horns, and woodwinds, the simplest
analysis yields the relationship
f
n¼nf1: (1)
Here, fnis the frequency of the nth harmonic, f1the fre-
quency of the ﬁrst harmonic or fundamental, and nthe har-
monic number, an integer greater than or equal to 1. Thevariation of the amplitudes of these harmonics goes a long
way to explaining the timbre of any musical instrument.1Of
course, this simple result, which is derived for strings (andopen and closed pipes), completely ignores the role of the
material composition of the string itself.
Equation (1)also follows more formally by solving the
classical wave equation2for a transverse wave on a string,
T@2yðx;tÞ
@x2¼l@2yðx;tÞ
@t2; (2)
where Tis the tension in the string and lthe string’s mass
per unit length. The function y(x,t) represents the vertical
displacement of a horizontal string at position xalong its
length Lat time t. The solutions to this equation yield the
speed of the transverse wave on the string v¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T=lp
, which
can also be obtained from more elementary means, e.g., by
applying Newton’s laws to a small element of the string.
For those who have taken the time to look more carefully
into physical accoustics, it is well known that the harmonicsin an actual string, be it on a guitar or in a piano, are sharp:
they lie higher in frequency compared to what is predicted
by Eq. (1). In fact, the presence of this inharmonicity is cru-
cial to the tuning of pianos as it becomes necessary to stretchthe octaves. For example, the note for C5 will be tuned
higher than the standard pitch to align with the slightly sharp
harmonics of C3.
3Here, C3 refers to the third occurrence of
a C on a piano keyboard, and C5 to the ﬁfth. In the western
musical tradition of 12 notes per octave, there is about a 6%
difference in the ratio of adjacent frequencies, e.g., B to C, Cto C#, etc. Inharmonicities can be 1.5% or more on an
upright piano.2This is easily detected by the human ear,
which can generally detect frequency differences as low as0.5%–0.6%.3Hence, inharmonicity of only a percent or less
can be musically signiﬁcant, whether in a piano or in anotherinstrument.
The origin of this inharmonicity in strings was ﬁrst recog-
nized by Rayleigh,4and discussed fully in Refs. 2,5, and 6.
To account for the inherent stiffness of the vibrating string,an additional term should be added to Eq. (2). This term
appears when considering the string as a thin uniform rigidrod undergoing transverse oscillations.

wave equation,

Here, Yis Young’s modulus of elasticity, Sthe cross-
sectional area of the string, and kits radius of gyration. The
radius of gyration is related to the moment of inertia, I, and
is an alternative way to describe the rotation of an object ofmass maround a particular axis ( k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
I=mp
). A taut string
can be pinned, in which case it is supported in two places by
a “knife edge” (e.g., the guitar bridge and nut), or clamped if
the top and bottom of each end of the string are secured byan additional structure which could encase the string. Theboundary conditions are different in each case. For pinnedstrings ð@

Investigations of Eqs. (4)and(6)lend themselves very nicely
to an upper division undergraduate laboratory, which can be
developed using equipment commonly found in most under-
graduate physics laboratories or purchased for a minimal
cost. In addition, such a lab can be a springboard for a more
detailed theoretical discussion of the classical wave equation(Eq. (2)) and the extent to which the simple formula f
n¼nf1
breaks down in real-world cases. Furthermore, the level of
math needed to solve Eq. (3)is appropriate to both junior
and senior physics majors who have had a general differen-
tial equations course. In summary, this particular experiment
is an ideal pedagogical tool for the undergraduate physics
curriculum.
A robust investigation of the inharmonicities in monoﬁla-
ment and wound piano strings was carried out by Fletcher.6
A monoﬁlament string is composed of a single uniform
material. This is the case for which Eq. (3)is strictly valid.
Wound strings typically have a different material wrapped
around a uniform core. This will decrease the fundamental
frequency of the string by increasing its mass without signiﬁ-
cantly increasing its stiffness. The case of a piano is more
complicated than that of a guitar, as the boundary conditions
imposed on the strings are a mixture of both pinned and
clamped strings. In the case of clamped strings, Eq. (4)is no
longer valid and must be multiplied by an additional termwhich also depends on B.6Fletcher investigated both cases
and found that, for pinned boundary conditions, Bcalculated
using Eq. (5)generally gave better agreement with the mea-
sured values of B(found from Eq. (4)) than did the clamped
case. No rigorous error analysis was carried out in either
case. The agreement was very good for monoﬁlament
strings, which is an inherent assumption leading to the new
term in Eq. (3). For wound strings, for which Eq. (6)is not
strictly valid, he devised an ad hoc model that accounted for
the winding around a monoﬁlament core. He found his
model to give a good approximation to Bfor wound strings,
but not as good as in the case of monoﬁlament strings.
Since the pioneering work of Fletcher, there have been
more recent investigations of inharmonicity in piano strings
and wound strings in general,8–10as well as a detailed investi-
gation of the inharmonicity in bass guitar strings involving
variable density of the strings and the effect of fret pinning.11
Previous research has also focused on the psychoacoustic
effects of inharmonicity in guitar strings. Indeed, the form of
the guitar lends itself to high levels of inharmonicity. Therelatively short length of the strings and their low tension,
relative to an instrument like a piano, results in a level of
inharmonicity great enough to be perceptible to a listener.
J€arvel €ainen and Karjalainen12devised experiments to assess
the perception of inharmonicity for steel and nylon stringed
guitars. Recordings were used to create a parametric model
of the guitar tones, so that the inharmonicity of the tones
could be controlled. A threshold was found for the percepti-
bility of inharmonicity that was close to typical values foundon the guitar. This threshold also depends on whether or not
the attack transients were cropped out of their model. The
relationship between physical and perceived inharmonicityis important for digital sound synthesis, in particular to
assess how realistic a given tone sounds.
Increased inharmonicity has also been invoked to explain
why wound guitar strings “go dead” after some playingtime.
13When a string “goes dead,” it has a dull sound with a
shorter sustain. Houtsma found that this is due to theincreased inharmonicity of a well-used wound guitar string.
Houtsma simulated the stretching and releasing that occurs
each time a guitar string is played and found that this processcaused a mass redistribution due to the windings slippingfrom their original positions. This in turn causes greaterinharmonicity in the partials, which makes it harder to tunethe string exactly and gives it less self-resonance, thus result-ing in a dull, quickly decaying sound.
Clearly, musical string inharmonicity is a phenomenon
that has important consequences in many different areas ofmusical practice, from instrument and sound design to tuningand performance. It is something that musicians and music-
related professionals have grappled with ever since the crea-
tion of stringed instruments whose strings are excited byplucking, striking, or bowing.
Bearing this in mind, and considering the dramatic change
in technology since the measurements of Fletcher in the early1960s, we endeavoured to re-examine the role of inharmo-nicity in pinned strings by examining various sets of steeland nylon guitar strings, both monoﬁlament and wound.Using computers to analyze sound ﬁles makes it easier tocarry out these measurements with greater precision andaccuracy than was possible for Fletcher. These modern tech-niques also easily lend themselves to a rigourous error analy-
sis of B, in particular for the values that were obtained using
Eq.(4).
II. EXPERIMENT
The inharmonicity parameter Bwas determined in two
ways: (1) the strings material properties, Y,r,T, and L, were
measured so that a direct calculation of Bcould be made
using Eq. (6). (2) “Audio” recordings of the string vibrations
were made using microphones, a piezo
14and an electric
guitar pickup15,16so that Bcould be determined from a ﬁt of
the harmonic series (partials) of the audio ﬁles using Eq. (4).
A. Strings’ material properties
The diameter and length of each string were measured
with a micrometer caliper and a meter stick, respectively.Uncertainties were taken from the tolerances of the measure-ment devices.
One of the key parameters needed to determine Bfrom
Eq.(6)is Young’s modulus Y, which is a measure of a
material’s elastic properties under stress. Speciﬁcally, Y
¼ðT=AÞ=ðDL=LÞwhere Tis the tension in the string, Aits
cross-sectional area, Lits length prior to tensioning, and DL
the change in length resulting from the tensioning.
An image of the experimental monocord apparatus used to
obtain Young’s modulus is shown in Fig. 1. The string was
stretched over two “bridges,” U-shaped aluminum pieces
mounted to vertical supports attached to an optics bench.
The string ran across the top of one edge of the “bridge” andwas pinned to it by the tension in the string, analogous to theactual bridge (or nut) of a guitar. The opposite side of thebridge was cut away. This way, the string was pinned in onlyone location on each bridge. One side of the string is

attached to two Vernier force monitors that are mounted in
parallel to measure the tension in the string (two wereneeded so as not to exceed the tension limit of a single force
monitor), while the other side is attached to a micrometer
optics translation stage.
The translation stage was initially moved to put the string
under a tension that would be slightly higher than its vibrat-ing tension: around 80 N for steel strings and around 60 Nfor nylon strings. The tension was then progressively less-
ened to values lower than its vibrating tension by moving the
translation stage.
17The slope of the T/AvsDL=Lgraph then
corresponds to Y. It should be noted that the Vernier force
sensors were calibrated by having precisely measuredweights hanging from a piano wire, itself attached to the
sensors.
For nylon strings, it was necessary to use strings that were
“settled”. Nylon strings have to undergo many cycles of re-tensioning before they reach an equilibrium that allows themto hold a steady pitch for a usable length of time. With thisin mind, the commercial nylon strings used in this study
were installed on a guitar and retuned daily for 2 weeks to
allow them to settle, prior to any study. During this time, thestrings were not played, other than the plucks required topitch them back up to the desired operating tension. Young’smodulus measurements for nylon strings had to be done
rather quickly (10–15 min) to compensate for the settling
behavior. When a change is made in L, the tension immedi-
ately responds as expected, but it will quickly relax towardthe value it had before the change in length. Since thechanges in tension while vibrating occur at rates of around
hundreds of hertz, rapid measurements of Young’s modulus are
required. The values of Ywe obtained are in general agreement
with a study done by Lynch-Aird and Woodhouse,
18in which
the mechanical properties of nylon strings were examined.
Finally, for wound strings, the clamps were only attached
at segments of exposed cores, and the area used for the
Young’s modulus calculation was taken to be the area of thecore.
B. Measurement of the characteristic frequencies
The second method for inferring the inharmonicity parameter
Bwas to measure the characteristic frequencies of the pinned
strings. For this, the string vibrations were recorded from two
sources concurrently for both nylon and steel strings.For steel strings, the string vibrations were recorded using
the setup in Fig. 1. Two types of recording devices were
simultaneously used: a piezoelectric quartz that converted
mechanical stress into an electrical output and an electric
guitar pickup that tracks the string’s vibrational motion via
magnetization. The piezo was attached on the underside of
the bridge of one of the support mounts, while the electric
guitar pickup was placed as close as possible to the oppositebridge to increase its sensitivity to higher harmonics of the
vibrating string (see Fig. 1).
For nylon strings, audio recordings were performed using
a Zoom H4n recorder and a LGV20 microphone, while the
string was installed on the guitar. Note that the electric guitar
pickup method would not work for nylon strings since nyloncannot be magnetized.
With the audio data, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) pro-
vided the discrete frequencies that were present in the audio
sample. These frequencies were then used to perform a chi-
square ﬁt using Eq. (4)to provide an experimental value for
theBparameter that could be compared against the value
obtained from the measured physical properties of the string.
The two different values for Band their associated uncertain-
ties were then compared.
The value of Bobtained using Eq. (6)is only valid for
monoﬁlament strings, while the value of Bobtained from
Eq.(4)should hold for any string construction, as long as it
is pinned. Thus, any signiﬁcant differences between the two
values would indicate that the explicit functional form of Eq.(6)is not a valid description of the string’s inharmonicity.
For all strings, the signal outputs from the microphones,
the piezo, and the electric guitar pickup were input into a
Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 audio interface
19with adjustable signal
gain. This unit converts the input voltage into sound ﬁle
data, which can then be exported to a computer for further
digital processing. We used the popular REAPER20digital
audio workstation software to create *.wav ﬁles that wereanalyzed in the data analysis package Origin21from which
the discrete characteristic frequencies were extracted using a
FFT analysis. We will refer to these recordings as audio.
Audio samples were mono-recordings taken at a sample
rate of 44.1 kHz with a sample length of 4–8 s. Although lon-
ger sample lengths can, in theory, provide more precise out-
puts for discrete frequencies, the higher harmonics on a
musical string die out rather quickly. Since the amplitude fora frequency in the output of a FFT is, loosely speaking, a

measure of its presence in the sample, a long sample length
will cause short-lasting frequencies to get lost in noise.
Strings were each plucked in various locations. The inten-
sities of the different harmonic frequencies present on a
vibrating string are determined largely by the location of thepluck attack.2For example, if a string is plucked near its
end, higher order harmonics will be emphasized. Varying the
location of the pluck provided a more complete picture of
the string behavior.
Audio samples from the different recordings correspond-
ing to the same pluck attack were aligned, and the plucktransients at the beginning of each recording, were clipped
off. For each string, this resulted in multiple samples from
varying sources and varying locations of the pluck attacks.These data were compared to distinguish frequencies origi-
nating from sources other than the string itself.
To determine the characteristic frequencies of the string, a
single recording was chosen, while the others were used toremove spurious frequencies (originating from other sources).
A representative FFT of an audio ﬁle is shown in Fig. 2for an
Ernie Ball 0.011
00steel string. The vertical axis has been arbi-
trarily scaled so that the amplitude of the ﬁrst harmonic is
equal to 100. It is interesting to note that the strongest har-monic is not the fundamental, but rather the n¼4h a r m o n i ci n
this case. The relative amplitude of the harmonics character-
izes the timbre of the string. The inset shows a representativeview of some of the higher harmonics not visible in the full
spectrum and also gives a nice indication of the level of noise
in the experiment. While, in our experiment, the level of noise
was quite small, noise could, in principle, affect the determina-
tion of the relative amplitude of the higher harmonics.However, as we are only concerned with the harmonic fre-
quencies, this level of noise can be ignored. In many spectra, it
was possible to clearly see harmonics of order 50 or higher.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Monofilament strings
After the string frequencies were determined from the
FFTs, they were plotted against their harmonic number, anda ﬁt to Eq. (4)was performed, from which f
0andB(includ-
ing their uncertainties) were extracted. In order to easily seethe deviations of the harmonic frequencies measured by theFFT from the ideal frequencies given by f
n¼nf1, a plot of
the difference is shown in the upper plot of Fig. 3for the
Ernie Ball 0.01100steel string. For this comparison, we have
used the ﬁt value of f0¼398:32ð8ÞHz, which corresponds
tof1when B¼0 in Eq. (4). One can clearly see the increase
in the difference of the measured frequency from its idealvalue as nincreases. For the ﬁrst several harmonics, the dif-
ference is essentially zero, while for the 35th harmonic it isnearly 240 Hz. This corresponds to a frequency change ofabout 1.5%. The lower plot in Fig. 3shows the difference
between the measured harmonic frequencies and f
ngiven by
the ﬁt of the data using Eq. (4), where f0¼398:32ð8ÞHz
andB¼2:789ð48Þ/C210/C05for this particular string. As can
be seen, there is typically less than a 4 Hz difference between
the two, indicating the quality of the model ﬁt. We note thatthe error bars in this ﬁgure arise almost entirely from theuncertainties in the ﬁt parameters f
0andB.
In Fig. 4, the value of Bobtained from a ﬁt to Eq. (4)(B
audio) is compared to the value calculated from the string’sproperties ( B“mechanical”) for monoﬁlament strings, for
which the model leading to Eq. (6)is valid. The strings are
sorted ﬁrst by type (steel or nylon) and then by diameter. Itshould be noted that guitar strings labelled as “nickel” aretypically made out of nickel-plated steel. One can clearly
observe that inharmonicity increases for both the steel and
nylon strings as the string diameter increases. This isexpected (all other parameters: Y,T, and Lbeing nominally
similar from one string to the next), as Bdepends on the
fourth power of the radius of the string (Eq. (6)).
For most of the strings, uncertainties of Bare generally
too small to be seen in the plot. Typically, they were abouttwo orders of magnitude smaller than the measured values ofB. Table Ishows the numerical values obtained for Bfor all
measured monoﬁlament strings. Both methods for obtainingBare in excellent agreement, for both steel and nylon strings,
despite their very different microstructures. The small differ-
ences between the value of Bdetermined via the audio ﬁle

and that derived from the material’s properties can likely be
attributed to the pinned boundary constraint not being fullysatisﬁed, especially for the 22-mil piano wire.
The testing apparatus may not have been capable of
tensioning the string to an amount that would eliminatearcing of the string over the support. It is also possiblethat for thicker strings, the tension was not great enoughto keep the string perfectly stationary over the supportwhen vibrating. This could explain the behavior of thethicker steel strings, those with diameters greater than0.014 in., that can be seen in Fig. 4and Table I.D u r i n g
the research, this was a reminder that string vibration and
inharmonicity are phenomena that are quickly compli-cated by violations of the assumptions that allow for a rig-orous derivation of vibration frequencies from the waveequation.B. Wound strings
The results for the wound strings are displayed in Fig. 5
and Table II, sorted ﬁrst by type (steel hex core, steel round
core, or nylon) and then by diameter. A hex core string has ahexagonal cross section, while a round string has a circularcross section. Although Eq. (6)is not strictly valid for
wound strings, it was nonetheless interesting to test theirinharmonicity.
In most cases, the two testing methods gave similar
results, although the discrepancy between the two valueswas generally much larger than for the monoﬁlament strings.In general, the material measurements provided a lower B
value than did the frequency measurements, suggesting asystematic deviation. Interestingly, this pattern is reversedfor the wound nylon strings. For the steel strings, both values

ofBincrease with core radius, as for the monoﬁlament
strings, while for the nylon strings, this trend holds only for
the values of Bderived from Eq. (6). The core of wound
nylon strings is very different from the one for wound steel
strings. Rather than a single uniform core, it is composed ofmany loose thin nylon ﬁlaments held together by the metal
windings of the string. As such, it was exceedingly difﬁcult
to measure a valid cross-sectional area that could be used in
the determination of the respective Young’s moduli.
As for monoﬁlament strings, thicker wound strings are
more inharmonic than thinner strings. The difference in the
Bvalues between the two testing methods is greater for
thicker strings. Modern guitar string manufacturing techni-ques favor using hex-shaped cores for the wound strings. It
is possible that the sharp edges of the hex shape dig into the
windings and that this interaction creates an extra restoring
force that increases the inharmonicity. This supposition is
supported by the round-core wound strings showing less dif-
ference between their respective Bvalues than the hex-core
wound strings.IV. CONCLUSION
We have carried out a detailed examination of the inharmo-
nicity parameter Bfor a large selection of both steel and nylon
guitar strings, both monoﬁlament and wound, for pinnedboundary conditions. For monoﬁlament strings, the value of B
derived from material properties measurements was in verygood overall agreement with the value derived from audiosamples. Although some of the uncertainty ranges did notoverlap, disagreement was generally minimal, which still givesstrong support for this inharmonicity model. For the woundstrings, the disagreement between the Bvalues is not surpris-
ing. The model we tested does not account for non-monoﬁlament string constructions. It is likely that there is aninteraction between the windings and the core of the string thatfurther complicates the vibrational behavior of the string.
The scope and procedure employed to carry out this exper-
iment demonstrate that it can be readily used in an upperlevel undergraduate physics laboratory. In addition to topicsin physical acoustics and the classical wave equation, this

APPENDIX: SOLUTION OF THE MODIFIED WAVE

In this appendix, we give a more straightforward, but less
general, derivation of f

At ﬁrst glance this differential equation looks intimidating.
ForY¼0, the solutions will be a linear combination of sines
and cosines. However, since the ð@4yðx;tÞ=@x4Þterm is an
even power in the partial derivative, sines and cosines willcontinue to form a basis of solutions. For pinned strings theboundary conditions require ð@
2yðx;tÞ=@x2Þ¼06at each end
of the string of length L. Thus, the equation for a standing
wave on a string,2,22,23

will be a solution to this wave equation and will satisfy the
boundary constraint. Here, n¼1, 2, 3… and fnis the fre-

15An electric guitar pickup works on the principle of magnetic induction. It
consists of a small coil of wire wrapped around a small permanent magnet.
The permanent magnet magnetizes the steel guitar string. As the string
vibrates, it creates a changing magnetic ﬁeld that is picked up by the wire
coil wrapped around the permanent magnet. The strength of the induced
voltage in the coil is directly proportional to the string’s vibrational motion.

17In the work of Fletcher on piano strings (Ref. 6), it was not possible to
determine the tension in the strings directly. Instead, the tension was
inferred via f0¼1=2Lﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T=lp
by measuring its fundamental frequency ( f0)
directly, its length L, and calculating l¼Squsing the density of steel
q¼7:7g=cm3. Likewise, a direct determination of Ywas not carried out,
rather (in the case of monoﬁlament strings) the value of Y¼19.5/C21011
dyne/cm2(195 GPA) for steel was used. Fletcher does not state where he
obtained these particular values for steel or why he chose them.
