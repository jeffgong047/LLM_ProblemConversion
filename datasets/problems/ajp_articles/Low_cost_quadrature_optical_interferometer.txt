interferometer in which quadrature signal detection is achieved by means of polarization control.The device incorporates a generic green laser pointer, home-built photodetectors, 3D-printed

I. INTRODUCTION
Optical interference is a phenomenon in which overlap-
ping beams of light act, by means of the superposition princi-ple of electromagnetism, to modulate the energy density thatwould have otherwise been present in the constituent beamson their own. In turn, the effect results in striking patterns ofirradiance fringes—akin to the nodes and antinodes that canbe observed in the harmonic modes of a vibrating guitarstring—that both verify the wave nature of light and enableprecision measurements. Optical interferometers are devicesengineered to exploit this phenomenon, and due to (1), theconnection between interference fringes and the extremelyshort length scales associated with optical wavelengths(400–700 nm), (2) the abundance of high-quality manipula-tion and detection capabilities at these wavelengths, and (3)the invention of lasers, interferometers have long enjoyed wide-ranging relevance in science and technology. Applicationsinclude testing fundamental physics principles,
1,2measuring
velocities and positions,3–5characterizing material properties,6
and controlling and manipulating both classical and quantumlight sources.7–11Beyond this, optical interferometers enjoy a
prominent position in classroom physics laboratories, and sev-eral different supply companies are currently selling commer-cialized products and activities.
12–14
For the most part, interferometers are designed for delicate
measurements and/or repeated use, and so construction costscan be large, ranging from about $3,000 (for an educationalapparatus available from Thorlabs),
12all the way up to
$1.1 billion [for the laser interferometer gravitational-waveobservatory (LIGO)].15There is a certain utility, however, in
exploring the degree to which these instruments can behome-built and/or scaled down to minimal components and
cost.16–24Such devices expand the growing body of optics
capabilities enabled by the maker movement25–31and could, for
example, be assembled by hobbyists or produced at scale and
shipped out to students in large-enrollment online classes.
Here, we report on the construction of an optical interfer-
ometer that can be assembled on a budget of under $500 and
that exhibits both automated data acquisition and quadrature
detection capabilities. The interferometer utilizes a green
laser pointer, 3D-printed optical mounts, home-built photo-detectors, and microcontroller-based analog-to-digital signal
conversion. Among the unique aspects of the setup, differen-
tiating it from other low-cost interferometers that have been
reported to date, is the fact that quadrature signals are gener-
ated through polarization control with phase delays between
horizontal and vertical polarization components achieved
using a ﬁlter extracted from a pair of circularly polarized 3D
movie glasses. We benchmark interferometer performance
by using it to measure the thermal expansion coefﬁcient of
an aluminum plate on which the interferometer is mounted.
While the results reveal quantitative inaccuracies, qualitative
features are robust. We discuss possible sources of error and
areas for improvement.
The construction of the instrument described in this man-
uscript formed the basis of an independent research project
conducted by undergraduates and a master’s student in our
laboratory, and we found it to be an excellent means of
teaching students about the real-world applications ofinterferometers, quadrature detection, wave plates, Jones
matrices, circuitry, and experimental control protocols.
The device has the potential to be used in the same manner at
other institutions or could perhaps be manufactured at scale

and utilized by students in larger and more structured class-
room settings.
II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Like interferometers more generally, quadrature-detected
interferometers have long been employed as scientiﬁc mea-surement devices, and they can take on a variety of differentgeometrical conﬁgurations.
3,32–38Devices of this sort are
collectively deﬁned by their ability to generate a pair ofoutput signals that have been engineered to be “in quad-rature” with each other, which is to say that there is a p=2-
radian (or quarter wavelength) phase shift between the waythat the two different signals monitor the interference effectsof the overlapping beams.
Among the more common means of obtaining quadra-
tures is through polarization control, in which case the opti-
cal path difference between the interferometer’s arms for
vertically polarized light (for example) is phase-shifted by aquarter of a wavelength relative to the optical path differ-ence for horizontally polarized light. Because of the vectornature of electromagnetism, the interference effects associ-ated with these two different polarization states can be inde-pendently examined (note that horizontal and verticalpolarization states do not interfere with each other, a factcodiﬁed in the Fresnel–Arago laws), and the signals can beﬁltered and mapped onto distinct quadrature-shifted irradi-ance measurements at the point of a pair of detectors. In
turn, polarization control is often achieved by means of
optical retarders, and in the implementation described inthis work, we have followed this approach by inserting aquarter-wave plate retarder and a few judiciously placedlinear polarizers into an otherwise standard Mach–Zehnderconﬁguration.
Figure 1shows an example polarization-based quadrature
optical interferometer setup. Beamsplitters 1 and 2 are non-polarizing beamsplitters. Linear polarizers are labeled withvertical (V), horizontal (H), or þ45
/C14rotated (45) transmis-
sive axes with coordinates speciﬁed in a lab frame whilelooking into the beam (i.e., the x-axis is horizontal, the
y-axis is vertical, and the z-axis runs parallel to the direction
of beam propagation). The quarter wave plate (labeled ask=4) is oriented such that its fast axis is rotated /C045
/C14down-
ward from the horizontal lab frame axis while looking intothe beam. Incoming light is vertically polarized.If we assume, for simplicity’s sake, that the light passing
through the interferometer is a harmonic traveling plane
wave of angular frequency x, then the dynamics of this setup
can be characterized in terms of a Jones matrix analysis,39–42
where the electromagnetic ﬁeld vector,

The x-direction, or upper entry, within this representation
corresponds to the electromagnetic ﬁeld’s horizontal (or p-
polarized) component with positive xpointing to the right
while staring into the beam. The y-direction, or lower entry,
corresponds to the ﬁeld’s vertical (or s-polarized) compo-
nent with positive yalways pointing upward in the lab
frame. These conventions are consistent with those of text-
books by Pedrotti40and Hecht.41The variable ‘/C17ÐnðzÞdz
corresponds to optical path length with n(z) being the
position-dependent refractive index, and the vacuum wave-
number is k0/C172p=k0¼x=cwith c¼299;792;458m =s.
Symbols with tildes on top explicitly indicate complex-valuedquantities.
Having described the electromagnetic ﬁeld amplitude in
terms of a two-component vector of this sort, the actions of
different sorts of optical elements can be described in termsof multiplication operations by different kinds of matrices,
termed Jones matrices . For example, the action of wave
plates oriented such that their fast and slow axes are alignedto the Jones vector coordinate axes can be represented by
e
i/x0
0 ei/y"#
; (4)
where /xand/yare the phase lags induced by the wave
plate along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. For a quarter
wave plate, /y/C0/x¼p=2. Thus, the matrix for a quarter
wave-plate with its fast axis oriented along the x-direction
can be represented as
10
0i"#
; (5)
where a factor of ei/xhas been pulled out of the expression
and dropped because global phase shifts have no effect on
the polarization state and can, moreover, be erased by shift-ing the origin of the position or time axis in Eq. (1).
The Jones matrix for a linear polarizer with its transmis-
sive axis oriented along the x-direction is

where a minus sign between the x- and y-directions has been

frame oriented as if looking back toward the source.
Beamsplitters have somewhat more complicated Jones
matrix representations than the representations of other types
of optical elements because of their doubled input and output
ports, but descriptions remain well established.43,44We
employ in this work a description in which the reﬂectionmatrix is given by

tively, and the beamsplitter is assumed to be lossless. Energy

Finally, birefringent optical elements with axes rotated
into orientations other than those of the Jones vector coordi-
nates can be described by means of combining matrices like
Eqs. (4)–(6) with rotation matrices of the form

Having laid out these various deﬁnitions, we seek to
examine the interference properties of signals measured at
photodetectors A and B in Fig. 1as a function of varied opti-
cal path differences between beam paths 1 and 2. The physi-cally measurable quantity of interest in these cases is theirradiance Ið‘;tÞ, which is related to the total electric ﬁeld
Eð‘;tÞaccording to the equation
Ið‘;tÞ¼n/C15

where /C150is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum and the
angle brackets indicate a time average of the expression overseveral optical oscillation periods. In the case at hand, the
total electric ﬁeld Eð‘;tÞcorresponds to the vector sum of
the two different component vector ﬁelds E1andE2propa-
gating through the interferometer along optical paths ‘1and
‘2. We can rewrite the equation as

where the terms in Eq. (16) can be separately labeled as I1,I2,
andI12. The quantities I1andI2have no dependence on the rel-
ative values of ‘1and‘2whereas I12does, and so we see that
I12(often explicitly identiﬁed as the expression’s interference
term40) is the main quantity of interest. We can write it as

By comparing Eqs. (24) and (30), we see that the signals
extracted at photodetectors A and B are 90/C14out of phase
with each other, thereby enabling quadrature detection and
analysis.
Returning back to generalized features, we can see that
quadrature detection is useful as a tool for tracking optical pathlength ﬂuctuations because it helps one to remove directional
ambiguities. Consider the traces plotted out in Fig. 2(a), show-
ing the dependence of signals IðAÞ
12andIðBÞ
12on the optical path
difference ‘2/C0‘0
1i nt h ec a s ew h e r e rp¼rs¼tp¼ts¼1=ﬃﬃ ﬃ
2p
.
ForIðAÞ
12orIðBÞ
12considered in isolation, there is an unambiguous
mapping from path length difference to irradiance (that is, if
we know ‘2/C0‘0
1, then we know exactly what value to expect
forIðAÞ
12). However, the inverse problem is not so well deﬁned,
and indeed there are an inﬁnite number of quantities ‘2/C0‘0
1
possible if the value of IðAÞ
12is taken as an input. To lift the
ambiguity, an optical path difference initial condition can be
either independently ascertained or set to zero, and the value of
IðAÞ
12can be subsequently tracked as a function of time. There is,
however, a remaining problem: When the interference signal
comes to an extremum—for example, a maximum, ashighlighted in Fig. 2(a) by the vertical gray bar at /¼0—it
will in all cases trend back toward equilibrium at times follow-
ing this, and there is no way to know if that changing signalrepresents an increase or decrease in the optical path difference.
Quadrature detection plugs this hole by monitoring a pair of
interference fringes in tandem instead of just a single interfer-
ence fringe, and when one of the two fringes (e.g., I
ðAÞ
12)c o m e s
to an extremum, the other ( IðBÞ
12) is planted at zero with maximal
slope.Figure 2(b) shows an illustration of the IðAÞ
12andIðBÞ
12signals
plotted against each other on an xycoordinate scheme (a
form of Lissajous ﬁgure) and illustrates a convenient graphi-cal means of converting interference fringes back into phase,and by extension, optical path difference. Notice that Eqs.(24) and(30) can be written as

: (32)
Thus, plotting IðBÞ
12on the y-axis against IðAÞ
12on the x-axis
generates values in the xyplane that can be interpreted as
forming an angle /¼k0ð‘2/C0‘0

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Having established a theoretical summary of operative
principles, we proceed to a description of the physically real-ized setup. Figure 3shows a 3D CAD rendering and sum-
mary photograph of the device, which we constructedaccording to the Fig. 1schematic using a 12
00/C2600sheet of
1/4-inch thick aluminum as a base plate. As can be seen inFig. 3(a), the system’s ﬁnite optical path difference between
its two interferometer arms gives it the potential of beingused to measure the thermal expansion coefﬁcient of the alu-minum plate, or alternatively (if the thermal expansion coef-ﬁcient of aluminum is known) as a high-resolutiontemperature sensor.
Because the goal of this manuscript is to report on the lim-
its of how inexpensively a polarization-based optical quadra-ture interferometer can be constructed, it is important to layout a detailed analysis of components and costs. Table Isum-
marizes this information in the form of a parts list. The indi-
vidualized merits of each of these different components arediscussed in turn below.A. Light source
The typical light source used in commercialized interfero-
metric devices is a helium-neon gas laser, available, for
example, from Edmund Optics (stock no. 61-338) for$1,270. While such lasers offer excellent stability and coher-ence lengths on the order of 20 cm, this laser cost is far more
expensive than the budget we were hoping to achieve. Diode
lasers that emit typically in the red spectral range are aninexpensive and ubiquitous alternative, but we chose to
avoid these due to concerns about coherence length. Instead,
we chose to incorporate a diode-pumped solid-state laseremitting green light at a wavelength of 532 nm for our device(based on frequency-doubling the 1064 nm emission line of
Nd
3þions embedded within a host matrix like YAG or
YVO 4), which combines low cost with long coherence
length. Lasers of this sort can be purchased on Amazon for
prices ranging from $20 to $30. We selected the green-light
version of a Dinoﬁre presentation remote for our experiment,purchased online for $24.99 and pictured on the left side ofFig. 3(b). Although manufacturer speciﬁcations neglected to
include information on coherence length, we found the
coherence of this item to be nevertheless adequate for ourexperiment, as demonstrated by the fact that interference
fringes between the two arms of the interferometer could be
observed at all times when the interferometer was well-aligned. The laser exhibited a signiﬁcant drop-off in outputirradiance over the course of the ﬁrst several minutes after
being turned on, possibly due to a dependence on the battery
charge level, and so we found it best to wait a minimum of25 min before beginning to collect data.
Not all 532-nm green laser pointers work for the applica-
tion we had in mind. Aside from the laser used in the demon-
strated device, we attempted to use a Pinty 532-nm greenlaser in the setup. Interference fringes could not be observed,possibly due to the fact that the Pinty laser was designed in
such a way that it blinked with a cycling time of about
190 Hz as veriﬁed using an oscilloscope.

(excluding mirrors) costing between $20 and $150. One of the
simpliﬁcations that we made to our own interferometer was to
make 3D printed optical mounts from polylactic acid (PLA)
plastic ﬁlament as illustrated in Fig. 4. The mirror mounts
were printed to position the optics at ﬁxed 45/C14angles with
respect to the mirror-mount bases for ease of alignment. The
azimuthal rotating mount was printed to be freely adjustable
and allowed a linear polarizer to be rotated in place to clean upthe laser pointer’s initial polarization and direct it to verticalorientation. Each of these mounts costs around $0.10 to make.
We have included links to the OBJ ﬁles for all 3D printed
optical components in a Github link at the end of the paper.
Mounts were secured to optical elements and the alumi-
num base plate using a combination of hot glue and 5-minuteepoxy. Although we found 3D-printed parts to be sufﬁcient
for ﬁxed-mount components of the system, a pair of kine-
matic mirror mounts are still required in order to align thetwo interferometer arms. We used Thorlabs KM100 kine-matic mirror mounts to achieve this.
In terms of actual interferometer optical elements, a sig-
niﬁcant portion of the cost in a traditional polarization-basedquadrature interferometer system comes from the polariza-tion optics, speciﬁcally linear polarizers (typically ranging
from tens to hundreds of dollars per item) and—more
critically—wave plate retarders (often priced higher than$250 per item). In our setup, we procured low-cost versionsof linear polarizers by purchasing a sheet of polarizing
plastic from the company Izgut (model no. 4335030066). A
low-cost quarter wave plate was obtained by installing thelens of a circular polarizer from a pair of 3D movie glasses(RealD) into the setup backwards. Circular polarizers of this
type consist of linear polarizers and quarter wave plates
stacked on top of each other. If the optic is arranged suchthat linearly polarized light impinges upon the polarizerbefore seeing the wave plate, then the polarizer’s only
impact is to (possibly) reduce the output beam’s irradiance,
and the light that emerges will be otherwise circularly polar-ized. Alternate wave plate solutions exist apart from theimplementation we have incorporated into this work (see, for
example, Edmond Optics k=4 Retarder Film, stock no.
14-723), and indeed, it has been reported that quarter waveplates can be constructed by means as simple as folding asheet of clear plastic wrap around a microscope slide.

We opted against this ﬁnal option because of concerns aboutwave fronts and scattering.The mirrors we used are manufactured by Thorlabs
(model PF10–03-P01) and cost $53 each. We attempted to
buy cheaper mirrors for a cost of about $0.05 each. (Such
mirrors can be purchased, for example, as craft supplies.)However, we found that cheaper mirrors yielded imperfectreﬂections and corrupted the beam wave fronts. Similarly,
we attempted to construct low-cost beamsplitters by attach-
ing one-way window ﬁlm to microscope slides, but we wereunsuccessful in this attempt. The beamsplitters that we ulti-
mately incorporated into the setup were plate beamsplitters
purchased from Edmund Optics (stock no. 43-736).
C. Photodetectors and data acquisition elements
Automated data acquisition capabilities form a critical
aspect of nearly all modern optical applications, yet this capa-bility is often found absent in low-cost interferometer reports.
In order to facilitate such automated data acquisition, it is nec-
essary to incorporate photodetectors into the setup.Commercially available units are often priced in the range of
hundreds of dollars, but we found that a detector consisting of
a Hamamatsu S5971 photodiode wired up to a resistor and acapacitor arranged in parallel as illustrated in Fig. 5was
enough to suit our purposes. We chose a resistance value of
10 MXand a capacitance value of 10 nF in our detector design
so as to optimize gain and ﬁlter out high-frequency noise.
Because the S5971 is a small-area photodiode, we found it
helpful to focus down the light emerging from the interfer-
ometer onto the diode active areas using some converging
lenses (18-mm focal length) that we had on hand in our labo-ratory. Such lenses could have alternatively been purchasedfrom a company like Surplus Shed for $4.50 apiece. Aside
from these two focusing lenses used after the beams are com-
bined, there are no other lenses involved in the setup, and sowavefronts are ﬂat at the point where beams are combined,
leading to an absence of transverse fringes when the experi-
ment is well-aligned. Because of this, we experienced noloss of precision due to the presence or absence of focusingbefore the detector.

Photodetectors were held in place by means of alligator
clips and soldering stands, which was a design choice dictated
by time constraints of the graduation dates of the undergradu-
ate and master’s student authors spearheading the project. Infuture iterations of the device, it would make sense for thesemounts to be replaced by 3D-printed mounts afﬁxed to the
aluminum plate itself. Because interferometer beams are
recombined at the point of the second beam splitter, the dis-tance between this beam splitter and the detectors, and also
the materials over which the beams travel while traversing
this distance, are irrelevant to interferometer performance.
Although not technically part of the interferometer function-
ality, we needed an independent measurement of temperaturein order to conduct the interferometer functionality tests
described later on in Sec. IV. To achieve this measurement, we
incorporated an LM35 temperature sensor manufactured byTexas Instruments as pictured in the center of Fig. 3(b).T h e
sensor generates a voltage proportional to the ambient temper-
ature in Celsius with a conversion factor of 1
/C14C/10 mV.
Finally, a low-cost analog-to-digital conversion protocol
was achieved by means of the Trinket M0 microcontrollerpurchased from Adafruit, pictured in Fig. 6. This microcon-
troller can be coded using CircuitPython, a
PYTHON variation
that has been speciﬁcally designed for microcontroller devi-ces. We programmed the Trinket to have three analog volt-age outputs ( þ3.3 V) to power the two photodetectors and
the temperature sensor, as well as three analog voltage inputs
(0–3.3 V) to receive voltage signals from each component.The analog signals are converted into digital signals with 12-
bit digital resolution, which—distributed across the input
voltage acceptance range—gives a voltage conversion reso-lution of 0.81 mV. The signal was transmitted to a computerby means of a micro-USB to USB cable. Once the computer
intercepted the data from the Trinket, the information was
logged into a CSV ﬁle by a
PYTHON script running on this
computer. Details of this protocol and the associated PYTHON
script are provided in the github link at the end of this paper.
Preliminary quadrature signal analysis was performed in
real-time by the Trinket by examining the signals from pho-
todetectors A and B (refer back to Fig. 1) as they were
acquired and periodically recomputing the solution to Eq.
(34) in response to the changing photodetector input signals.
To accommodate laser intensity variations as well as varia-tions in beam overlap, the microcontroller was additionallytasked with offsetting the raw data sets by their respective
center values, as these center values were found to vary.
IV. RESULTS
To characterize our device functionality, we adjusted the
air conditioner settings in the room where the interferometerwas housed, while the interferometer was left running on top
of a set of books sitting on a rigid lab desk. Then, we corre-lated real-time interferometer readings against the LM35temperature sensor reading to extract the coefﬁcient of ther-mal expansion of the aluminum plate on which the device
was mounted. We compared our results to thermal expansion
coefﬁcient values that have been reported in the literature.
In general, the thermal expansion properties of materials
can be somewhat complicated functions; aluminum expandsmore rapidly with temperature at room temperature than itdoes near absolute zero, and water actually contracts whenincreasing in temperature from solid to liquid state. For smalltemperature ﬂuctuations and in the absence of phase transi-tions, however, these functional dependences can be linear-ized using Taylor series approximations. The standard
equation used to deﬁne the expansion coefﬁcient under such
circumstances is
DL
L¼aDT; (35)
where DLis the change in the object length, Lis the overall
object length, DTis the change in the temperature, and ais
the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion. Solving for agives
a¼DL
DT1
L: (36)
The quantity DL=Lis essentially the same as the change in
the optical path difference divided by the overall optical pathdifference between the interferometer’s two arms, and so wecan see from Eq. (36) that the thermal expansion coefﬁcient
can be extracted by ascertaining the slope of a graph plottingthis change in the optical path difference as a function of the
temperature change, and then dividing the result by the over-
all path length difference, which we measure in our device tobe 24.060.4 cm.
Figure 7illustrates the data ﬂow of one of our experimen-
tal runs. Figure 7(a) shows the raw data outputs of photode-
tectors A and B as a function of time. Figure 7(b) shows a
zoomed-in version of this, corresponding to the ﬁrst75 seconds worth of data acquisition, and Fig. 7(c) shows a
Lissajous ﬁgure of the output of photodetector B vs photode-
tector A over this same 75-second time frame. As can be
seen, particularly in Fig. 7(c), the signals from the two differ-
ent photodetectors are close to being in quadrature, but notquite perfectly so as evidenced by the fact that the Lissajousﬁgure ellipse exhibits a slight diagonal elongation. This islikely due to a combination of imperfections in the 3D movieglass quarter wave plate (optical retardance is generallyspeaking expected to be different for different wavelengthsand, therefore, not likely optimized perfectly at 532 nm) and
laser beam alignment and wavefront imperfections.

(right axis) over the entire trial, calculated by applying Eq.
(34) to the data from Fig. 7(a) after subtracting off the center
value and normalizing the signal deviations away from thiscenter value to unity. Minimum, maximum, and center val-ues were in their own right calculated in post-processingusing a script similar to (but not quite identical with) thereal-time phase calculation reported in Sec. III. Following
the phase extraction in the 2 p-modulo form, the phase was
computationally unwrapped, leading to the data that havebeen ultimately presented.

Figure 7(e)shows temperature vs time for the full duration
of the trial as measured using the LM35. Discretely spaced
vertical temperature readings in the panel originate from theﬁnite-granularity of the microcontroller’s 12-bit analog-to-
digital converter (0.81 mV voltage granularity translates over
into a temperature-reading granularity of 0.081
/C14C). These
can be averaged away by means of a smoothing spline inter-
polation as illustrated by the panel’s solid black line.
Figure 7(f) shows the optical path difference shift from
Fig. 7(d) plotted against the smoothing spline interpolation
of the temperature data shown in Fig. 7(e). Interestingly, the
plot shows that it is generally true that temperature and the
interferometer’s thermal expansion properties are correlated,which is a fact that is also apparent by examining Figs. 7(d)
and7(e) directly. However, the relationship is actually not a
strictly linear one as would have been predicted in Eq. (35).
There are times when the slope of the plot is gentler (for
example, between 75 and 125 s as in the graph’s upper right
portion), leading to an extracted thermal expansion coefﬁ-cient of a¼ð24:460:7Þ/C210
/C06=/C14C. More often, however,
the slope is steeper. Between 200 and 400 s, for example
(middle of the graph), the extracted thermal expansion coef-ﬁcient turns out to be a¼ð79:461:4Þ/C210
/C06=/C14C. While
the ﬁrst of these two values is in reasonable agreement with
thermal expansion coefﬁcients reported in the literature foraluminum (typically quoted near 23 :6/C210
/C06=/C14C),45the
second is clearly not. The results indicate that although the
interferometer serves as a useful demonstration piece illus-trating the basic functionality of a polarization-based quadra-
ture interferometer, it falls short of being able to be used for
more quantitative measurements. Discrepancy origins mayinclude laser Poynting vector stability issues over long peri-
ods of time, different parts of the interferometer changing
temperature at different rates (although this may ultimatelybe unlikely given the close proximity of the LM35 to the
interferometer base plate), and/or thermally contracting or
twisting 3D-printed mounts. We note that the temperature-dependent refractive index of air will have an effect on the
interferometer output signal in addition to the aluminum
baseplate’s physical contraction. For a temperature drop of0.7
/C14C near a starting temperature of 21.7/C14C as displayed in
Fig. 7(e), the overall expected air-induced phase shift is
merely 1.90 radians,46far below the 120-radian phase shift
that is experimentally observed in Fig. 7(d).
V. CONCLUSIONS
The interferometer presented in this paper represents a
working device capable of illustrating the qualitative func-tionality of polarization-based quadrature interferometry
basics at a fraction of the cost of the cheapest commercially
available alternatives. Components leading to the biggestreduction in these overall costs include a generic green laser
pointer, 3D-printed optics mounts, low-cost commercially
available polarization optics, home-built photodetectors, andlow-cost microcontroller-based analog-to-digital signal
conversion.
Looking toward the future, we envision design tweaks that
may improve device accuracy with only a marginal increasein cost, potentially leading to quantitatively accurate mea-
surements. Temperature measurements may be able to be
improved, for example, by means of better thermal contactestablished between the temperature sensor and aluminum
baseplate and possibly a preampliﬁer inserted between the
sensor output and microcontroller analog-to-digital input.Alternatively, the setup may be modiﬁed to utilize an infra-
red temperature sensor to measure the exact temperature of
the aluminum. Stronger adhesives might be applied to the

optical mounts in order to better secure them in place.
Interferometer application goals could be reoriented to focuson phenomena occurring on faster time scales than tempera-ture ﬂuctuations like vibrational phenomena or turbulence in
gasses.
Applications of the interferometer in present and future
forms may include use as a classroom demonstration modeland deployment of many devices or device kits in tandem togroups of students taking laboratory optics classes. Beyondthis, our hope is that the summary of design elementsreported in this work will inspire independent device con-
struction, development, and improvements by readers both
inside of academia and beyond.
