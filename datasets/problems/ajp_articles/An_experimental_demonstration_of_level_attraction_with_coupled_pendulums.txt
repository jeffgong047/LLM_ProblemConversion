We have experimentally demonstrated dissipative coupling in a double pendulum system through
observation, which shows three distinctly different patterns of motion over the accessible
parameter space. The described dissipative coupling apparatus is easy to manufacture and budget-friendly. The theoretical calculations are also suitable for the undergraduate level. Our experiment
can serve as a novel demonstration for ubiquitous dynamic coupling effects encountered in many
disparate physical systems. Unlike the well-known spring-coupled pendulums, our experimentemploys Lenz’s effect to couple the pendulums through electromagnetic damping, which, to the
best of our knowledge, has not been demonstrated in the classroom. Our pendulums exhibit level
attraction behaviour between two modes, induced by the dissipative coupling. This stands incontrast to the traditionally taught concept of level repulsion (avoided crossing) with spring-
coupled pendulums. This experiment showcases distinctly different time domain dynamics of the
dissipatively coupled pendulums over the parameter space, characterized by different oscillationpatterns, damping rates, and relative phase between the two pendulums, which is a valuable lesson
elucidating the dynamics of synchronization in linear systems for undergraduate students.

I. INTRODUCTION
Laboratory demonstrations are considered essential in
high school, university, and graduate education. With the
modernization of demonstration equipment, both in terms offunctionality and complexity due to technological advance-
ments, conducting experimental demonstrations has become
easier than ever before. More importantly, the reduced costsof laboratory apparatus have made it more accessible to awider range of students from different backgrounds. It pro-
vides an environment that fosters research and professional
exploration and plays a role in the triggering and dissemi-nating of new ideas. Demonstrations of coupling effectsoffer some of the best material to immediately capture the
attention of students. Generally, coupling between oscilla-
tors can be classiﬁed into two broad categories. The tradi-tionally taught and demonstrated type is named coherentcoupling,
1–6where energy circulates between oscillators.
Coherent coupling is typically demonstrated by spring-
coupled cars or a spring-coupled pendulum system in thesmall angle approximation as shown in Fig. 1(a). The cou-
pling effect in these systems is dependent on the relative dis-
placement between the objects due to Hooke’s law. Under
this case, two oscillators tend to break their degeneracy andfeature eigenmode splitting in an avoided crossing (level
repulsion) as shown in Fig. 1(b).
2The distinct eigenmodes
of coherent coupled systems manifest as a beating oscilla-tion pattern in the time domain, as shown in Fig. 1(c).T h e
other coupling category is dissipative coupling;
6–10such
coupling is achieved by introducing energy dissipation
channels into the system. It is generally modeled as aviscous damper as shown in Fig. 1(d), in which the coupling
effect is proportional with the relative velocity of two
pendulums.11Dissipative coupled pendulums tend to re-
establish the system’s degeneracy, which causes itseigenmodes to coincide; it features level attraction as shownin Fig. 1(e). In the time domain, dissipative coupling leads
to rapid synchronization of oscillators, as shown in Fig. 1(f).
Notably, synchronization can also be achieved through non-linear effects in mutual coupled systems,
12–14which require
non-linear frequency pulling effects, but in this paper, we
focus on the linear effect.
Both coupling types can be observed in various physical
systems such as electric circuits,8advanced cavity-magnon-
polariton systems,6,7,9and laser systems.10Application
examples include stabilizing skyscrapers,15modeling Earth’s
nutation and precession,16quantum computing,4,17and even
musical instrument making.18Coherent coupled systems
have been well studied, but the detailed exploration of dissi-
pative coupling is still under development. Although the
majority of studies into dissipative coupling have focused onadvanced systems, this phenomenon has also been predicted
and modeled in purely classical systems.19Here, we experi-
mentally demonstrate a dissipative coupled pendulum sys-tem. In this demonstration, the dissipative coupling isachieved through electromagnetic damping. Due to the sys-
tem’s low frequency characteristic (Hz), the system’s time-
evolution can be directly observed. This experiment offers alovely opportunity for students to perform inquiry-driven
and open-ended investigation, as well as independent critical
thinking. It also provides students with the complete experi-ence of the process of scientiﬁc discovery.

II. EXPERIMENT
A. Method
The dissipative coupled pendulum is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).
This pendulum system contains two major parts: the pendulumarms (brass) and the coupling mechanism. Both pendulumarms are mounted on a rigid frame through a pair of rod endsthat contain low friction ceramic ball bearings to achieve thesystem’s low intrinsic damping.
Dissipative coupling between the pendulums is achieved
by introducing a Lenz’s effect induced electromagneticdamping that allows energy to dissipate through Joule heat-ing, with detailed mechanism design depicted in Fig. 2(b).
The coupling mechanism contains two components, one is aconductor coil, and the other is a pair of magnets that create
a magnetic ﬁeld that goes through the coil. Each component
is directly fastened to one of the pendulum arms. The leftpendulum contains a round-shape 3D printed polylactic acid(PLA) bracket with a radius of 25.4 60.1 mm. It contains
100 turns of a thin conducting wire. The right pendulum con-tains two strong magnets that provide a nearly uniformedmagnetic ﬁeld of 0.183 60.003 T measured by a gauss
meter. Its uncertainty may come from the slight misalign-ment between the probe and the surface of the magnet. Tomaintain the system’s linearity, proper alignment of the coilsand magnets is important to prevent pendulum collision andmaintain consistent coupling between them throughout theexperiment, as demonstrated in Fig. 2(c), as we limit theoscillation angle of both pendulums to be within 61:5
/C14.
During the oscillation, the overlapping area between cou-
pling mechanism components (coil and the magnetic ﬁeld
induced by parallel magnets) changes, causing a variation inthe enclosed magnetic ﬂux. This induces an emfon the coil
that generates a damping-like force, opposing the change ofmotion. Its reaction force also drives the pendulum due to
Newton’s third law.
In order to study the system’s behaviour under different
mismatches of the pendulums’ natural frequencies, a mecha-nism to adjust the natural frequency of one pendulum isincluded. The left pendulum’s natural frequency is adjust-able, through two counterweights placed at different loca-tions along its length, thereby shifting the pendulum’s center
of mass and effectively tuning its length. Experimentally
speaking, the center of mass/effective length can be deter-mined by hanging the pendulums at different point or deter-mined by their natural frequencies. However, this methodhas a drawback: the difference in effective length between
the pendulums results in a non-equivalent coupling effect,
which manifests as a torque applied to each pendulum. Dueto this circumstance, we deﬁne coupling strength parametersC
1;2to describe the inﬂuence of the coupling on individual
pendulums. We also introduce intrinsic damping parameters
c1;2to characterize the non-coupling related damping such as
frictions at the pendulum hanging pivots and air resistanceon each pendulum. Both coupling strength parameters C
1;2
and intrinsic damping parameters c1;2are inversely
Fig. 1. (Color online) (a) Coherent coupling is often modeled as a pair of spring-coupled pendulums. (b) When sweeping through the natural frequency d iffer-
ence between two oscillators, two hybridized eigenmode frequencies break their degeneracy and exhibit an avoided crossing, also known as level
repulsion. Dashed lines correspond to uncoupled mode frequencies. (c) In the time domain, this system shows the beating oscillation pattern as known as
Rabi-oscillation. (d) Dissipative coupling modeled as damper-coupled pendulums. (e) In the frequency domain, dissipative coupling causes two hyb ridized
eigenmodes to reestablish their degeneracy; it features level attraction. (f) In the time domain, the system trends towards synchronization. Note t hat the initial
conditions of both (c) and (f) are that one pendulum starts with a displacement of zero and the other starts out with non-zero displacement.

proportional to each pendulum’s effective length. This effect
will be discussed further in the theoretical model section.
A pair of laser displacement sensors are used to capture
the motion of the two pendulums, which is then processed by
software developed in-house to extract position-trajectoryinformation from the raw data. Although the target for laser
tracing is relatively large (8 /C210 cm2), the pendulum angu-
lar velocity is small. Therefore, the intrinsic damping param-eters, c
1;2, are generally one order smaller than the coupling
strength parameter C1;2, which will be shown in Table I. One
may further reduce the air resistance by using smaller targetsor using a different data logging approach to eliminate the
use of the targets. We have also tested a budget approach by
video recording the pendulum dynamics using a camera,
then performing data analysis using an image processing
software. Although this process can be time-intensive, theaccuracy is very comparable with the previous.
Finally, the experiments proposed in this work share the
same initial condition: the left pendulum is released from a
small non-zero amplitude and the right pendulum starts byhanging at its rest position.
B. Results
By varying the natural frequency mismatch between pen-
dulums, the aim of this experiment is to explore theevolution of the hybridized eigenmode frequencies of the
system due to dissipative coupling. During the experiment,the natural frequency x
1of the right pendulum was held con-
stant, while the natural frequency x2of the left pendulum
was swept through a range of values using the effectivelength adjustment method previously discussed. The naturalfrequencies x
1;2=2pof the pendulums were predetermined
by performing Fourier transformation on the raw data oftheir uncoupled free oscillations for each effective length set-ting. Similarly, the intrinsic damping parameters c
1;2are
measured by ﬁtting the previous uncoupled free oscillation
data to the damped oscillation function. The coupling param-etersC
1;2can be determined by either analytical or numeri-
cal methods, which will be discussed with greater details inSec. III C. Experimental parameters are shown in Table I.
Three distinct oscillation patterns were observed at differ-
ent levels of natural frequency mismatches, which we refer
to use the detuning D¼x
2/C0x1, as shown in Fig. 3(a) with
circled lines.
Fourier transformation allows us to convert the measured
time-domain data to the frequency domain as shown in Fig.
3(b), which reveals the corresponding features of the sys-
tem’s hybridized eigenmode frequencies, which is differentfrom the pendulums uncoupled natural frequency. In order to
further understand these features, theoretical calculations are
Fig. 2. (Color online) (a) An image of the experimental apparatus. Two coupling devices are mounted on the copper pendulum rods that are fastened at the top
pivot points through low friction ceramic bearings. By adjusting the position of the counterweights on the left-pendulum, the center of mass locatio n of the
pendulum is shifted, thereby tuning the pendulum’s effective length and its natural frequency. This allows for frequency sweeping to be performed in the sub-
sequent experiment. Two laser displacement sensors are used to capture the live displacement of the pendulums. (b) A detailed view of the coupling dev ices.
The left pendulum’s mechanism contains 100 turns of copper wire and the right pendulum contains two strong magnets with a 0.183 T magnetic ﬁeld between
them. Viscous damping proportional to relative velocity is provided using a Lenz’s effect induced electromagnetic damper, in which the induced curr ent and
the resulting coupling force increase as the coil cuts through the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux at a faster rate, leading to larger dissipation through Joule heat ing. (c)
During the experiment, the relative motion of the pendulums was constrained to within 61:5/C14, ensuring that there was always some overlap between the coil
and magnets and preventing the pendulums from collision. As a result, the pendulums were constantly coupled throughout the experiment.

shown next, followed by a detailed discussion about the
observed features.
Additional features can be extracted including frequency
dispersion, energy evolution, and oscillator relative phase
evolution, which will be demonstrated by comparing theanalysed data with the theoretical model in Sec. III C .
III. ANALYTICAL MODEL
We model a general coupled pendulum system with both
coherent and dissipative coupling. Although this experimentis only focused on dissipative coupling, it is still a great
opportunity for students to compare the similarity and differ-
ence between the two types of coupling mathematically.Both pendulums have identical mass m. Each pendulum has

occurs. (d) A calculation of the total energy from the experimental parameters in log-scale. When D¼0, the system quickly dissipates about half of its total

The dissipation of this system contains two terms, includ-
ing intrinsic damping and dissipative coupling. In the pro-posed experiment, the dissipative coupling is induced byLenz’s effect, which describes the generation of emfwhen

becomes purely imaginary. In this range, the two
eigenmodes’ frequencies merge into one value (same real

parts) with mismatched damping (different imaginary parts).
Beyond this range, the modes’ frequencies break their degen-
eracy (different real parts) and become distinguishable with
matched damping (same imaginary parts). At the special sin-gularity points ?;D¼62C, the two eigenmodes remain in
the degenerate region while the damping is also matched,
serving as two branch points in the dispersion relation. This
implies that dissipative coupling will establish eigenmodedegeneracy rather than causing splitting within the detuningrange of 4 Cand degeneracy breaking outside of that range,
as is usually observed for mutual coupling.
B. Time domain
In the frequency domain, we demonstrated the mathemati-
cal structure of level-attraction. However, the oscillation pat-
tern features were not directly presented. This requires atime-domain calculation. Additionally, phase is another criti-
cal feature. The relative phase evolution is directly responsi-
ble for energy dissipation in dissipative coupled systems.When the pendulums are swinging in phase, there is no rela-tive velocity between them, so the dissipation from the cou-
pling is not triggered and energy loss from the pendulums is
minimized. When the pendulums swing in anti-phasemotion, they experience the maximum relative velocity sothe energy dissipation is also maximized. The high energy
anti-phase mode often experiences higher damping than the
lower energy in-phase mode. This makes it possible for theﬁnal energy of both modes to be equal, which leads to the
mode degeneracy as earlier demonstrated in the frequency
domain. To perform time-domain analysis, we ﬁrst rewritethe equations of motion into the form of a fast referenceframe oscillation with frequency x
ref¼ðx1þx2Þ=2 (which
has also been demonstrated in the frequency domain solu-
tions in Appendix B ) and a slower oscillating perturbation
due to the coupling effect and intrinsic damping. The equa-tions of motion are shown as

If we consider a general case, C16¼C2andc16¼c2since
both factors are dependent upon the effective length of each
pendulum as the earlier expression of C1;2in Eq. (9)showed,
the equations of motion can be solved numerically. At D¼0,
the two pendulums appear to synchronize but the amplitude
decays relatively quickly due to the mismatched damping.
Again, consider a stationary solution with C1¼C2¼C
andc1¼c2¼c, in which the phase difference d/is time
independent( d_/¼0). The amplitude evolution can be fur-
ther reduced to

The phase difference can also be solved as
d/¼arcsinD
2C/C18/C19
: (31)
This equation reveals that the magnitude of the phase dif-
ference is directly indicated by the competition between fre-quency detuning and dissipative coupling strength. As the
frequency detuning tends to split the eigenfrequencies, the
dissipative coupling force has the tendency to unify them.
Overall, the time domain solution for the dissipatively
coupled system is

This reveals the nonequivalent damping factor applied on
individual eigenmodes in the D/C204Crange. When d/¼0,
the in-phase mode only experiences intrinsic damping c.
However, the anti-phase mode experiences a combined
damping of cþ2C, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the in-
phase mode, and causes it to damp out quicker. Although

both modes coexist in the coupled system, the anti-phase
motion decays rapidly, leading to in-phase synchronizationof the two pendulums at late times.
C. Result analysis
From the experiment, three oscillation patterns are
observed. Parameters, such as pendulums’ uncoupled naturefrequencies x
1;2and intrinsic damping c1;2, have been
directly determined by the experimental data without theproposed theoretical model for each pendulum setting. Thecoupling strength parameter C
1;2is left undetermined in the
above derivation. The coupling parameter C1;2can be deter-
mined either analytically or numerically. If an analyticalapproach is preferred, a calculation according to Eq. (9)can
be performed with measurable parameters. However, thecenter of mass/effective length of the pendulums might behard to measure but can be calculated from the uncoupled natu-ral frequencies. If a numerical approach is chosen, one may treatC
1;2as constant ﬁtting parameters and estimating them accord-
i n gt oE q s . (15)and(16). In this work, both methods are tested
with similar results with C1;2shown in one. The three different
oscillation patterns are successfully predicted with solid linesin Fig. 3(a). Additionally, the dispersion patterns calculated
using Eq. (17) with maximum damping mismatching ( C
1=2p
¼0:0255 Hz, C2=2p¼0:0286 Hz, c1=2p¼0:00318 Hz,
c2=2p¼0:00815 Hz) are shown in Fig. 3(c) and compared
with the Fourier transformed results (circled line) calculatedfrom the time-domain measurements, with uncertainty deter-mined by the full linewidth of the Fourier transformation peakat half of the maximum value (FWHM).
When the detuning Dbetween two pendulums falls out-
side the 4 Crange, shown in Fig. 3(a-I) , the right pendulum
shows a beating pattern, while the left pendulum shows ansimple decay pattern. This case corresponds to two distinctfrequencies (two peaks) in the Fourier transformed results inthe top panel of Fig. 3(b), which shows that the system is in
an off-degenerate state as shown in the calculated dispersionshown in Fig. 3(c)with purple arrows.
When the detuning Dbetween two pendulums falls within
the range of 4 C, but with a slight natural frequency mis-
match, shown in Fig. 3(a-II) , the Fourier transformed result
shows a broad peak, which indicates the two eigenfrequen-cies are merging. In the time domain, the system experiencedrelatively large damping with its amplitude appearing to dieout in about 60 s. However, the calculated dispersion shownin Fig. 3(c) (yellow arrow) shows there is still a slight differ-
ence between two eigenfrequencies.
When both pendulums share an identical natural fre-
quency ( D¼0), shown in Fig. 3(a-III) , they show a unique
oscillation pattern: damping in the system is minimized,leading to a long, stable oscillation. The Fourier transformedresult for this case appears to show a single sharp peak. Thissituation lies at the symmetrical center in the calculated dis-persion. We identify it as a perfectly degenerate state sincethe two oscillators are nearly identical and the oscillationpattern has no relative phase difference.
In order to gain a direct picture of the dissipation, the total
energy in the system was calculated by summing up thepotential and kinetic energy with the experimental systemparameters shown in Table Iand is presented in Fig. 3(d).
When the system has D¼0, the two pendulums are fully
synchronized, and in this case, the system quickly dissipatesabout half of its original energy to reach the stable in-phasesynchronization state. In this case, the system only experien-
ces intrinsic damping. When D6¼0, the system will always
experience a combined damping from the coupling dissipa-
tion and intrinsic damping.
Furthermore, the other important feature is the relative
phase between the pendulums as the theoretical model pre-dicted in Eq. (31). Although mismatch between C
1;2andc1;2
is rooted in the experimental apparatus, the difference is
insigniﬁcant, especially near D=2p/C250, where L1/C25L2.S o
at near zero detuning, the mismatched damping effect can beneglected. Thus, at parameters of C
1=2p¼C2=2p¼C=2p
¼0:0255 Hz, and c1=2p¼c2=2p¼c=2p¼0:00318 Hz, the
theoretical dispersion is calculated without mismatched
damping effect as shown in Fig. 4(a). For values of fre-
quency detuning between the pendulums within the 4 C1;2
range, we chose three sets of featured sample time-domain
measurements present in the left panel of Fig. 4(b).
The absolute phases of the pendulums were determined by
ﬁtting the time-domain experimental data to a damped oscil-lation function after the synchronization process, then weextract the relative phase information as demonstrated in the
right panel of Fig. 4(b), which is a zoomed-in view of the
featured time domain measurements shown in the left panel.These plots show that the direction of the phase difference isrelated to the sign of detuning—a positive (negative) detun-
ing leads to a positive (negative) phase shift as pendulum 2
lags (leads) pendulum 1. The uncertainty of the phase infor-mation came from the ﬁtting. Although the slightly mis-matched damping has a small impact on the overall
dispersion shapes, the results still follow the trend of the the-
oretical prediction of Eq. (18) as shown in Fig. 4(c).
IV. CONCLUSION
In this experiment, an electro-dynamic friction coupled
pendulum system was constructed to demonstrate dissipative
coupling. Prominent and distinct features were observed
apart from the coherent coupling case. The system’s timeevolution is studied: when detuning is more than four timesthe coupling strength, the oscillation shows a beating pattern.
When detuning is within four times of the coupling strength,
the system shows a semi-synchronous pattern, which isdamped out relatively quickly. When at zero detuning, thesystem shows a long-lasting full synchronization pattern
with minimized damping. In the frequency domain, the sys-
tem’s two eigenmodes degenerate into a single value withineither the range of four times the coupling strength (matcheddamping) or a single point at D¼0 (mismatched damping).
Phase analysis is also performed and follows the trend of the
calculation. This work presents a dynamic synchronizationin the linear regime, which can provide a foundation forfuture work on advanced systems. The spring coupled pen-
dulum has been a very successful gateway example to study
coherent coupled systems. This work may similarly providean excellent example to further the study of dissipative cou-pling using similar mathematical tools, which has a high
potential to beneﬁt undergraduate education, in particular.
Based on this inquiry-based experimental apparatus, many
further experiments can be performed. Students may exam-ine the system dynamics under different initial conditions.By setting different initial displacements or velocities,
students would develop a deep understanding of the
eigenmodes, which are generally initial condition indepen-dent. One may also calculate the system dynamic’s energy/

momentum, explore the energy evolution, and quantitatively
identify the dissipation. Furthermore, with slight modiﬁca-tions to the current system, it can be used to explore the non-linear effect of the system under dissipative coupling, whichhas not been demonstrated and leaves some new avenues forthe students to discover, which is also closely related toundergraduate classical mechanics course material.
