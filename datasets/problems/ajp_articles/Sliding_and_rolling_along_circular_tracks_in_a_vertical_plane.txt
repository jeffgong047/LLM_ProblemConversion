Objects that slide or roll along curved tracks in a vertical plane are investigated in two separate
experiments. One concerns a smooth metal nut that slides along a semicircular track made fromcoat hanger wire. The other concerns a billiard ball that slides and rolls along a curved track. A
simple theoretical model is provided to account for the results and to extend the discussion to
consider shortest descent times down circular tracks.

I. INTRODUCTION
The motion of an object restricted to slide or roll along a
curved track or surface in a vertical plane is a common prob-lem in undergraduate physics. The problem is usually solved
analytically by ignoring friction, since analytical solutions
including friction are generally complicated. For example,the path of quickest descent from point A to lower point B is
the well-known brachistochrone curve, a problem ﬁrst solved
by Newton in 1696 who showed that the quickest path isalong a section of a cycloid. However, Ashby et al.
1found
that different paths are required if sliding friction is involved.
Similarly, the motion of a ball in a loop-the-loop experiment
is a standard problem in elementary mechanics and is easilysolved from conservation equations if friction is ignored. In
fact, it has been shown theoretically that the ball will slip in
a loop-the loop experiment2–4and recent experiments by
Mamola and Dittrich5show that the ball can lose up to half
its initial energy in traversing the loop.
Experiments on the effects of sliding friction in these sit-
uations are rare. Most experiments on the brachistochrone
problem are deliberately designed to minimise friction inorder to demonstrate that the path of quickest descent is a
cycloid.6,7To examine the effects of friction, the author set
up two simple experiments. One used coat hanger wire toguide a metal nut around a circular arc in a vertical plane.The other combined rolling and sliding motion of a billiard
ball along a curved track. Results were obtained by ﬁlming
the motion at 300 fps and were compared with numericalcalculations. The experiments provided further insight into
the effects of friction along a curved path, of direct relevance
to both the quickest descent and loop-the-loop problems. Ofparticular relevance is the fact that a transition from astraight to curved path results in a rapid increase in both the
normal reaction force and the friction force and a corre-
sponding decrease in the linear speed along the path.
II. SLIDING AND ROLLING MODELS
Suppose that a bead of mass mslides from A to B along a
circular track of radius Rat velocity vin a vertical plane, as
shown in Fig. 1. If the bead is located at an angle hor a
distance s¼Rhfrom the lowest point on the circle then v
¼ds=dtand the equations of motion are

andN/C0mgcosh¼mv2

where gis the acceleration due to gravity, Nis the normal
reaction force on the bead, F¼lNis the sliding friction
force opposing the motion, lis the coefﬁcient of sliding fric-
tion, and h<0 in Fig. 1. Equations (1)and(2)can be com-
bined to show that
dv
dt¼/C0gsinh/C0lgcoshþv2

: (3)
Equation (3)can be solved numerically, together with the
relation v¼Rdh=dt, to calculate vandhvstfor any given
starting point A and any given initial velocity, v0. The sign
oflneeds to change if v<0. A typical result is shown in
Fig.2assuming that R¼0:0475 m (to correspond with the
experiment described below), l¼0:3,hð0Þ¼/C0 90/C14, and
v0¼2:0 m/s at t¼0.
For the above parameters, and in the absence of friction,
the bead has sufﬁcient initial energy to completely orbit thecircular loop indeﬁnitely. The velocity increases to a maxi-
mum at the bottom of the loop and decreases to a minimum
at the top of the loop. However, friction reduces the energyrapidly with the result that the bead comes to a stop in Fig. 2
when h¼þ83
/C14and then reverses direction. The bead comes
to a stop a second time when h¼/C028/C14and then suffers an
obvious discontinuous change in acceleration. There is also a
small discontinuous change when vreverses the ﬁrst time. In
both cases, the friction force reverses direction when v
reverses direction, but there is no change in the magnitude or
sign of mgsinhat that time.
The velocity of the bead decreases rapidly after t¼0
since Nand, hence, Fare largest at t¼0. For the above con-
ditions, v2=R¼8:6gatt¼0, much larger than gsince Ris
relatively small. Consequently, if a bead or a ball is injected
along a straight path tangentially into a vertical or horizontalcircular track, the sudden decrease in radius of curvature
gives rise to a sudden increase in the normal reaction force
and a consequent increase in the friction force. For that rea-son, a gradual change in the radius of curvature is commonly
used to allow cars, trains, and roller coasters to negotiate a
circular path with greater comfort for the passengers.

path, then Eqs. (1)and(2)remain valid if Fis a static rather

than a sliding friction force. When a ball rolls without sliding
up or down an inclined surface, the point on the ball in con-tact with the surface remains at rest on the surface, and staticfriction at that point opposes the component of the gravita-tional force on the ball parallel to the incline.

In order to roll without slipping, the ratio F=Nmust remain
less than the coefﬁcient of sliding friction. Near the top of a
circular loop, Ncan approach zero. Therefore, a ball rolling
around the loop is likely to slide as it nears the top of theloop.2,4B. Looping the loop
A typical loop-the-loop arrangement is shown in Fig. 3,
where a ball rolls or slides down a straight, inclined track then
enters a circular extension of the track. If the ball is released
from a sufﬁcient height, H, then it can roll or slide all the way
around the loop, up to the top and down the other side.
The usual theoretical explanation given to students is that
the ball arrives at the bottom of the loop at speed v1¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ2gHp
and will arrive at the top of the loop at speed v2given by

2¼mgH/C02mgR ; (5)
where Ris the radius of the loop. At the top of the loop, the
normal reaction force on the ball is given by
Nþmg¼mv2
2=R. The minimum value of Nfor the ball to
remain in contact with the loop is zero, in which case
mv2
2¼mgR, so the minimum value of Hfor the ball to reach
the top of the loop is H¼2:5R. In practice, a larger value of
His needed.2–5
Suppose that the ball enters the loop at speed v0and with
angular velocity x0. If the inclined track is relatively steep
and if the ball is relatively smooth, then it is likely that the
ball will slide down the track, in which case x0<v0=rR,
where rRis the rolling radius of the ball, shown in Fig. 3.I f
the ball continues to slide after it enters the loop, then it will
behave like the bead in Fig. 1and its velocity will be given
in Eq. (3). The sliding friction force on the ball will act to
increase its angular velocity at a rate given by
FrR/C0ND¼Icmdx=dt; (6)
where Dis the offset distance in the normal reaction force,
shown in the side view of Fig. 3.T h e Dterm is needed to
explain rolling on a horizontal surface, otherwise xwould
increase as vdecreases.9,10The Dterm is often omitted from
descriptions of rolling down an incline, since the static friction
force is typically much larger than the rolling friction force,
and since xincreases as vincreases. However, in loop-the-
loop apparatus, Nincreases rapidly as soon as the ball enters
the loop and the effect of any small shift in the line of action
ofNis more pronounced. The magnitude of Dcan be mea-
sured from changes in vandxwhen the ball enters the loop,
using Eqs. (1)and(2)to eliminate FandNin Eq. (6).
Calculations of vandxare presented in Fig. 4for conditions
relevant to the second experiment, shown in Fig. 5(b).I nt h a t
experiment, a billiard ball was released from rest on a straight
inclined track, slid down the track, and entered the curved sec-
tion of the track, with R¼80 mm, at v0¼1:65 m/s and x0¼
30 rad/s. The change in vwas calculated from Eq. (3),a n dt h e

change in xwas calculated from Eq. (6), assuming that l¼

sonable ﬁt to the experimental data. The results in Fig. 4dem-
onstrate that the large increase in NandFwhen a ball enters a
curved track can have a large effect on both vandx.T h eb a l l
speed decreased, despite the fact that the height of the balldecreased as it fell to the bottom of the curved track, and x
increased rapidly by a factor of two. By the time the ball
arrived at the bottom of the curved track, it had stopped slidingand began to roll with v¼r
Rx.
III. EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS
The arrangements used in the two experiments are shown
in Fig. 5and in videos of Figs. 6and7. For the ﬁrst experi-
ment, a coat hanger wire was bent by hand into a vertical
U-shape track and mounted on a vertical board. A metal nutwas released from rest near the top of the track and allowedto fall freely at ﬁrst, then around the R¼47:5 mm semi-
circular section until it came to a stop, typically near the farend of the semicircle. The nut then fell back at low speedalong the semicircle, but the resulting oscillation was of no
particular interest in this experiment. Rather, the primary
interest was the effect of the friction force in bringing the nutto a relatively rapid initial stop.
In the second experiment, a billiard ball was allowed to
roll down a 60
/C14incline onto a circular section and then up a
30/C14incline. The track was constructed using two parallel6 mm diameter aluminum rods spaced 20 mm apart, sup-
ported in a wood frame. The experiment was designed to
simulate the entry of a ball in loop-the-loop apparatus, spe-
ciﬁcally to examine the loss of energy when the ball ﬁrst
enters the loop, as previously reported.5
In both experiments, motion was recorded with a video cam-
era at 300 fps, and the results were analysed using Tracker
motion analysis software.11The x and y coordinates of each
object were digitized every frame in curved sections of the
tracks, and every third frame in straight sections of the tracks,
using the circle tool in Tracker to locate the center of the billiard
ball. The coordinates were curve ﬁt with quadratic functions in
the straight sections of track or with cubic functions in curved
sections to calculate velocity and acceleration as a function of
time. The angular velocity of the billiard ball was measured
from the change in the rotation angle of an equator line drawn
on the ball. The estimated maximum error in the measured lin-
ear and angular velocities was 63%.
Mamola and Dittrich5examined a loop-the-loop device of
radius 0.2 m using a steel ball inserted tangentially into the loop

surprised to ﬁnd that the ball speed decreased rapidly as soon as
the ball entered the loop, implying that there was a sudden
increase in the friction force on the ball. The result was
explained partly by the fact that the ball was sliding down the
linear portion of the track as it entered the loop and did not
begin to roll without sliding until it reached the bottom of the
loop. Vibrations of the track were also assumed to contribute
signiﬁcantly to the overall energy losses. To examine the transi-
tion region in more detail and to allow for both sliding and roll-
ing without slipping approaches down the straight track, the
author constructed the track as shown in Fig. 5(b). Energy loss
was determined from the initial height of the ball and the height
reached by the ball on the opposite incline.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. The first experiment
A typical result from the ﬁrst experiment is shown in Fig.
8and in the video of Fig. 6. Time t¼0 corresponds to the
time when the nut ﬁrst appeared in the zoomed-in ﬁeld of
view. The nut accelerated at a constant rate down the vertical
part of the track, reaching a maximum speed of 2.3 m/s when
it arrived at the curved section. In the absence of friction, the
nut would continue to accelerate to the bottom of the curve
and then rise up the second vertical section to its initial drop
height. Instead, the nut decelerated rapidly along the wholeFig. 4. A loop-the-loop calculation for a 25.4 mm radius billiard ball enter-

rolling when v¼rRx, near the bottom of the loop.

curved section until it came to a stop near the bottom end of
the other vertical section. The velocity of the nut along the
curved section of the track indicates that l¼0:3360:01, as
indicated by the experimental result in Fig. 8(a)and the best
ﬁt solution of Eq. (3). The value of lis consistent with a sep-
arate measurement of the acceleration of the nut down astraight length of the wire inclined at an angle to the
horizontal.
The potential, kinetic, and total energy of the nut, each
divided by the nut mass, are shown in Fig. 8(b) with the
potential energy set to zero at the bottom of the curve. Thetotal energy remained constant within experimental error as
the nut fell vertically, decreased rapidly along the curve, and
then remained constant as it rose a small distance up theother vertical section. The energy loss due to friction variesalong the curved track since the friction force is proportionalto the normal reaction force, which decreases with time as
the velocity decreases to zero.
B. The second experiment
Results from the second experiment are shown in Fig. 9
and in the video of Fig. 7. The ball was released from rest at
the top of the 60
/C14track and accelerated at a constant rate
until it arrived at the curved section. In theory, the accelera-
tion of a solid ball that rolls without sliding down an inclined
track is a¼gsinh=ð1þ2r2=5r2
RÞ, where his the inclineangle and rRis the rolling radius of the ball on the track
shown in Fig. 3. The velocity of the center of mass is
v¼rRx, where xis the angular velocity. In this experiment,
h¼60/C14,r¼25:4 mm, and rR¼23:0 mm. The expected
value of ais, therefore, 5.70 m/s2. The measured acceleration
wasa¼6:6160:01 m/s2, implying that the ball was sliding.
The measured v=xratio decreased from 0.10 to 0.05 m dur-
ing the fall, indicating that the ball did indeed slide down thetrack. However, it then rolled up the 30
/C14track and back
down again without sliding. If a ball slides down an inclinethen the acceleration is given by a¼gðsinh/C0lcoshÞ, giv-
ing a value l¼0:38 for the billiard ball on the 60
/C14incline.
The ball reached the curved section of the track at t
¼0:26 s in Fig. 9and reached the 30/C14incline at t¼0:35 s.
Between those two times, there was a sudden decrease in
ball speed, a sudden increase in the angular velocity, and a
sudden decrease in the total energy of the ball. These effectsimply that the ball made a glancing collision with the curvedsection of the track since the ball was deﬂected in anupwards direction from its initial path, resulting in a largeincrease in the normal reaction force and a large increase inthe friction force. The collision was not with a horizontal sur-face, in the usual sense, but with the curved surface. Theenergy loss on the curved section of the track was about 16%,
similar to the result reported in Ref. 5. The overall energy
loss, from the top of the 60
/C14incline (at y¼0:20 m) to the
highest point on the 30/C14incline ( y¼0:15 m) was 25%.
A theoretical calculation of the ﬁrst sudden decrease in
ball speed, from t¼0:26 s to t¼0:304 s, is shown in Fig. 4.
That calculation indicates that the ball will stop sliding justbefore it arrives at the bottom of the curved section, consis-tent with the measured values of vandxin Fig. 9(a)and the
v=xratio in Fig. 9(b). From then on, the ball rolls up the
curved section and up the 30
/C14incline. Given the number of
parameters that can be varied to ﬁt the data, including the
values of l,D, and the transition point from sliding to roll-
ing, an exact ﬁt was not attempted. Nevertheless, the calcula-tion in Fig. 4provides a reasonably good ﬁt to the
experimental data in Fig. 9(a)and a plausible explanation of
the main results.
After the ball rolled back down the 30
/C14incline, it entered
the curved track in a rolling mode and continued to roll

without any sudden change in vorx. Instead, the magni-
tudes of vandxincreased in the expected manner while the
ball rolled down the curve then decreased in the expectedmanner as the ball rolled up the curve towards the 60
/C14
incline. The ball then started sliding up the incline and wasstill spinning when it came to a stop part way up the incline.A similar result was observed when the ball was releasedfrom the top of the 30
/C14incline, at y¼0:238 m. In that case,
the ball rose to a height y¼0:185 m on the 60/C14incline. The
total energy loss in that case was 22%, despite the fact that
the initial energy loss when the ball ﬁrst entered the curvedtrack was much reduced.
The three contributions to the total ball energy in the sec-
ond experiment are shown in Fig. 10together with the total
ball energy, each divided by the ball mass. The results areshown for three sequential crossing of the curved part of thetrack: First when the ball slides down the 60
/C14incline
(t<0:35 s) then when the ball rolls down the 30/C14incline
(0:70<t<1:13 s), and then when the ball slides down the
60/C14incline a second time (1 :32<t<1:60 s). The largest
loss in energy occurs when the ball slides down or up the 60/C14incline and when the ball slides to the bottom of the curved
section of the track, as it does when it enters the curved sec-tion after sliding down the 60
/C14incline. In contrast, very little
energy is lost when the ball rolls up and down the 30/C14incline
or when the ball enters the curved section after rolling downthe 30
/C14incline. Since commercial loop-the-loop apparatus
usually feeds the ball into the loop down a steep incline to
save space, the ball is likely to lose a signiﬁcant fraction ofits initial energy in both the straight and curved sections, as
observed in Ref. 5.
V. QUICKEST DESCENT CURVES
The quickest descent of an object sliding from a point A
to a point B below it is a well-known problem in physics and
mathematics. If friction is ignored, as it usually is, the quick-est path is along a cycloidal track. The effect of friction is
easiest to determine by examining the motion on linear seg-
ments or circular tracks. Analytical solutions can beobtained, even for tracks of arbitrary shape,
3,12but circular
paths are easier to describe and numerical solutions are eas-
ier to implement. Three different circular arcs are shown inFig. 11, all connecting a point A at coordinates (0,0) to a
point B with coordinates x¼0:3 m and y¼/C00:1 m. For
comparison, a cycloid path is also shown, deﬁned by therelations x¼Rðt/C0sintÞandy¼Rð1/C0costÞ. The cycloidFig. 9. Experimental results with the billiard ball showing (a) the magnitudes of vandxvs time and (b) the v=xratio for successive crossings of the curved
track (left to right then right to left).
Fig. 10. The three contributions to the total energy in the second experiment
and the total ball energy, each divided by the ball mass. The potential energy
term, gh, is taken as zero at the bottom of the curved section of the track.
The rotational energy is shown by the dotted curve. Energy loss in the
curved track is largest if the ball is sliding when it enters the curved section,
att¼0:26 s and t¼1:5s .Fig. 11. Sliding from A to B along three circular arcs of different radii, com-
pared with the dashed cycloid path from A to B.

path is quite similar in shape to the R¼0:224 path, so the
descent times along these paths should be similar.
The velocity along each circular arc and the transit time
from A to B are easily calculated using Eq. (3). Calculated
results are shown in Fig. 12for an object that starts from
rest at point A. When l¼0, the quickest descent, by a small
margin, is along the R¼0:224 m arc since that arc is closest
to a cycloid. If l>0:16 the object comes to a stop along the
R¼0:167 m arc before it reaches point B, so that arc is then
the slowest. The object comes to a stop along the R¼0:224
ma r ci f l>0:23, in which case the quickest path is along
theR¼0:354 m arc. However, if l>0:29, the object stops
before reaching point B on all three arcs. The quickest path,therefore, depends on land is not necessarily a cycloid.
Measurements of a nut sliding along straight, circular, andcycloid paths are described in Ref. 13.
VI. CONCLUSION
Two simple experiments described in this paper help illu-
minate the effects of friction when an object slides along acurved track in a vertical plane. Both sets of results wereadequately described by a simple theoretical model incorpo-rating sliding friction, highlighting the fact that signiﬁcantenergy losses can arise when friction is involved, as onemight expect. One of the consequences is that the usual theo-retical explanation of loop-the-loop experiments, ignoringfriction, will underestimate the minimum initial height of aball needed for the ball to reach the top of the loop. Anotherconsequence is that “better” results can be expected if theball is allowed to roll rather than slide into the loop, eitherby decreasing the incline angle of the incident ramp or byusing a higher friction ramp and/or a higher friction ball suchas a rubber rather than the usual steel ball. Larger balls alsohelp since the center of mass of the ball rotates in a smallerradius path, meaning that the limiting condition at the top ofthe loop, v
2=R¼g, arises at a smaller ball speed.5Similarly, estimates of descent times in a vertical plane,
along tracks of varying shape, can be misleading if slidingfriction is ignored. The problem can be largely avoided by
rolling an object down a curved track to minimise the fric-
tion force, but not if the object slides down the track. In thatcase, each track needs to be considered on its merits when
comparing the descent times along tracks of different shapes.
