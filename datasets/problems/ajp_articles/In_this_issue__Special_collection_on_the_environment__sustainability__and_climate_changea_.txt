Physics plays a vital role in understanding the environ-
ment in general and climate change in particular. As NASA
physicist and climatologist Drew Shindell remarked in the
American Physical Society’s APSNews 16 (5), “Climate
change is all about energy, a subject familiar to any phys-
icist.” However, there is no standardized syllabus for envi-
ronmental physics, and most physics instructors have no
formal training in the subject. In this special issue, we’ve
collected 12 papers to help ﬁll that gap. They describe new
physics courses on climate and the environment, suggestions
for integrating these topics into existing courses, and presen-tations that will make you better prepared to teach these
topics. The supplemental materials for many of these papers
are rich with further ideas.
We hope that this special issue, along with papers in the
same collection in The Physics Teacher , will enable physics
instructors to include these topics in their courses at all lev-els, from special introductory classes to advanced physics
courses. These are important topics, and physics has much to
contribute to their understanding and solution. In addition,
students are concerned about these issues and appreciate the
opportunity to learn more about them. Teachers can designnew courses to speciﬁcally address issues of the environ-
ment, sustainability, and climate change. They can introduce
new units into their existing physics courses at all levels.
They can design new assignments, laboratory exercises, and
ﬁeld trips to address these topics.
We also hope this collection will inspire physics instruc-
tors to develop additional ideas for teaching students about
the environment, sustainability, and climate change that canbe shared in future issues of AJP.
Several of the papers in this issue describe entire courses
focused on these topics:
Claire Akiko Marrache-Kikuchi, Guillaume Roux, Jean-
Marie Fischbach, and Bertrand Pilette in “A course on cli-
mate change and sustainable building design” describe a
novel course for intermediate-level undergraduate physicsmajors that combines a study of human-caused climate
change with practical aspects of building design. Students
are introduced to global climate issues and, for half of the
course, are asked to work on group projects involving litera-
ture reviews, modeling tasks, and/or laboratory experimentsrelated to practical aspects of decreasing the human impact
on climate. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0137570
Stefano Toffaletti, Marco di Mauro, Massimiliano
Malgieri, Tommaso Rosi, Eugenio Tuﬁno, Pasquale
Onorato, and Stefano Oss in “A teaching-learning sequence
about climate change: From theory to practice” havedesigned and tested an entire undergraduate course taught
through a series of experiments involving the interactions of
light and matter. The sequence of activities is designed to
introduce the students to key phenomena and concepts
required to understand the greenhouse effect, such as thermalemission of infrared radiation, wavelength-dependent
absorption of radiation, and the establishment of a steady-state temperature by the balance between incoming and out-
going energy. The course culminates in the construction of
simple models of the Earth’s energy balance with and with-out an atmosphere. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0137089
In “Teaching physics in the woods,” Fr /C19ed/C19eric Bouquet,
Julien Bobroff, Lou-Andreas Etienne, and Clara Vardon
describe an unusual class that introduces students to a nearbyforest and asks them to explore a range of topics in physics
in the natural world. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0143470
Other contributions describe topics, units, or questions
that could be implemented in existing or new courses:
Lane H. Seeley in “Tutorials on climate modeling” reports
on using a set of tutorials for teaching about human-caused
climate change in an undergraduate physics course open to
students from across the campus at Seattle PaciﬁcUniversity. The tutorials lead students through the construc-
tion of simple algebraic models and simulations of global cli-
mate. Students in this class learn some of the core scientiﬁcarguments on which the scientiﬁc arguments for human-
caused climate change are based. https://doi.org/10.1119/
5.0134144
Mikkel Herholdt Jensen, Eliza J. Morris, and Michael W.
Ray have written in “Implementing a course-based authentic
learning experience with upper- and lower-division physics
classes” about the interactions between students in two physicscourses at California State University, Sacramento. In one
upper-level advanced electronics course, students design instru-
ments and a user interface for measuring pollution in a local
river. Students in a lower-level course use the instruments and
act as testers, giving feedback to the upper-level course. Bothgroups of students come out of their respective courses with a
better understanding of how physics can be used to solve real-
world problems. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0137141
Abigail Daane and Jesse Noffsinger in “Essential climate
change conversations for introductory physics courses” take
a broader perspective, laying out a set of general questions
about climate change and the greenhouse effect that, theyargue, all students should learn about in college-level intro-
ductory physics courses. Their focus is less on the underlying
physics and more on what we know about the causes andeffects of climate change, what can and should be done about
them, and how we can take actions to help bring about those
changes. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0137210

In “Footprinting in a course on energy,” Seth Major pro-
vides an introduction to energy footprinting, a method of cal-culating the amount of carbon emitted in the production, useand disposal of an object or in the completion of a process.He then explains how he uses footprinting in his courses atdifferent levels. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0136958
Two separate papers provide detailed understandings of the
greenhouse effect, its role in global warming, and the impor-tance of feedback effects in establishing climate sensitivity toincreasing atmospheric CO
2. “Effects of greenhouse gases on
Earth, Venus, and Mars: Beyond the one-blanket model,” byPhilip Nelson explains the basic physics of the greenhouse effectbeyond simple models often used in classes by including some
less appreciated aspects of fundamental atmospheric physics at
a level appropriate to advanced undergraduate classes, and alsocompares Earth with other planets, especially Venus. “Climatesensitivity from radiative-convective equilibrium: A chalkboardapproach” by Nadir Jeevanjee goes still deeper into the mathe-matics of the greenhouse effect and provides quan titative esti-
mates of important feedbacks including that of water vapor.Both authors stress the importance of convection in establishingEarth’s energy budget, consider the role played by the absorp-tion spectra of greenhouse gases, and recognize the signiﬁcanceof the emission level high in the atmosphere, which deﬁnes theplanet’s effective radiating temperature as seen from space andwhose rise with increasing CO
2concentration results in a higher
surface temperature. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0125523 ,https://

Roger Tobin, in “Semiquantitative reasoning can help stu-
dents track energy and understand conservation: Examplesand results from a course on sustainable energy” argues thatthe focus in typical physics courses on energy problemsamenable to exact calculation could interfere with students’ability to track energy in complex real-world contexts.He describes using Energy Cubes, a semiquantitative, manip-
ulable physical representation scheme, to teach about energyﬂows in environmental situations. https://doi.org/10.1119/

This issue also includes a thoughtful review by Nadir
Jeevanjee of Steven Koonin’s skeptical book Unsettled:
What climate tells us, what it doesn’t, and why it matters .
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0154687
Taken together, these papers provide a wealth of ideas and
resources for instructors interested in bringing environmen-tal, sustainability and, especially, climate topics into theirphysics courses. We hope you ﬁnd them interesting anduseful.
