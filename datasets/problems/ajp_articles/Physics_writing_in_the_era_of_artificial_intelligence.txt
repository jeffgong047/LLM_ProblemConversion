In November of 2022, the company OpenAI made avail-
able for free public use a research release of one of theirlarge language models called chat generative pre-trainedtransformer (ChatGPT).
1ChatGPT enables users to interact
with the GPT artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) model in a way thatis intended to be comfortable and safe. At the same time, thewidespread availability of such an AI platform permanentlychanged the education landscape. It suddenly became possi-ble for students to recruit the assistance of a sophisticated AIlanguage model with only a computer and an internet con-nection. During the spring 2023 semester, many students atour institution did just that, prompting questions about aca-
demic integrity and the use of AI in the classroom.
The potential uses of an AI of the caliber of ChatGPT by
physics students and educators cover an enormous range,including the automated generation of writing, backgroundresearch on basic physics topics, detailed feedback on thecontent and clarity of human-written text, writing computercode, solving physics problems, and answering conceptualphysics questions, to name a few.
2The challenges that the
widespread use of AI brings are equally numerous, includingthe risk of spreading misinformation, the presence and effectof biases in the model, concerns about academic and profes-sional integrity, ethical questions about the proper use of AImodels, and questions of equity and access. To compare theadoption of AI tools to the introduction of the pocket calcu-lator drastically underestimates the impact AI will have oneducation.
As a result, physics educators need to be familiar with the
capabilities and limitations of AI models. AI models like theone behind ChatGPT are already developing quickly withincreased use, and their presence in academia will onlybecome more common.
3In our opinion, physics educators
need to take the widespread use of AI by students seriouslyand study how the use of such models impacts physicseducation.
In addition to solving physics problems and answering
conceptual questions,
2physics educators should pay particu-
lar attention to the area of physics writing. Previous workhas pointed to the learning opportunities present when stu-
dents write about physics concepts and experiments.4–6The
untrained use of AI tools like ChatGPT by students can eas-
ily undermine physics writing instruction by allowing themto avoid the work of engaging physics concepts, clarifying
their thought, and expressing themselves in writing.
We as physics educators are in an excellent position to
help students responsibly navigate this new terrain and beprepared for the quickly evolving professional landscape.
However, we can only be effective educators if we under-
stand clearly the impact of AI tools on student learning.Physics educators should collaborate to study the impact of
AI tools on student writing and learning and the best way to
manage its use for the beneﬁt of education. For example,journals like the American Journal of Physics ,The Physics
Teacher, andPhysical Review Physics Education Research
should consider dedicating one issue each year to the topicof AI and physics education. Similarly, the American
Association of Physics Teachers could host a regular panel
discussion on AI and physics education, especially at thenational meetings.
Physics educators must take seriously the use of AI by stu-
dents and work to understand its impact on physics writing and
physics education as a whole. If we as physics educators donot decide if and how AI should be used by physics students in
the educational setting, then we leave AI to decide for us.

Sanjoy Mahajan’s Back of the Envelope column included
the 2019 paper “Fleeing the Quadratic Formula,”1which
argued that students gain more insight by approximating sol-utions than by direct application of an exact formula. Heillustrated the use of this technique to estimate the depth of awell, given the time required to hear the splash after a stoneis dropped into it. Since the result is dominated by the timefor the stone to fall, an approximation is clearly useful.
For instructors who would like to teach this approximation
method in modern physics courses, the following problem issuggested.
2
An atom with rest mass mis in the excited electronic state
of an energy gap equal to Dunits. The atom, initially at rest,
emits a photon and comes to the ground electronic state.Estimate the energy of the photon. Assume that the motion
of the atom can be treated non-relativistically.
The photon is emitted with momentum pand energy
E
ph¼pc. Since the initial momentum of the atom was zero,
the atom must recoil with momentum pand kinetic energy
E¼p2=2m¼E2
ph=2mc2. From conservation of energy,
EþEph¼D, we obtain a quadratic equation in Eph, with a
solution

where the above Taylor series expansion holds as we work
in the non-relativistic limit ( D=mc2/C281). The above prob-
lem is well mapped to the stone-in-the-well problem, so wemay alternately apply the same method to estimate theenergy of the photon. In the ﬁrst approximation, we assumethe recoil energy to be negligible and assign the wholeexcitation energy to the photon ( E
ph¼D). Thus, a ﬁrst-order
estimate of the photon momentum is p¼D=c. Respecting
conservation of momentum, we infer that the atom carriesthe momentum pand so an improved estimate of its recoil
energy is E¼D2=2mc2. Using energy conservation again,
we revise our estimate of the photon energy as
Eph¼D/C0D2
2mc2: (2)
The method may be continued to obtain more accurate
approximations by iterating the algorithm

where Eð0Þ
ph¼0 may be regarded as the state with no emitted
photon. These successive iterations agree (as they must)with the Taylor series approximation carried out to thesame order, but with the beneﬁt of helping students developan intuition into the form of the solution, and also teachingan estimation method that will serve them well in othersituations.
