A simple and low-cost experimental method to determine
the thermal diffusivity of various types of foods
Lisa R. Wang, Yifei “Jenny” Jin, and Jian Jim Wang
90(8), p. 568
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087135If you’re looking to create an engaging discovery laboratory,
you should read this paper! After using a vegetable peeler to
carve foods such as potatoes or radishes into spheres, students
can insert a thermocouple sensor and suspend the vegetable inboiling water. By measuring the center’s temperature as a func-
tion of time for different size spheres, students discover how
the time constant depends on radius and can also ﬁt their data
to a model to measure the thermal diffusivity of the food.
Skier and loop-the-loop with friction
Dominik Kufel and Alan D. Sokal
90(8), p. 573
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0095150When particles slide with friction along a circular track, the
sign change in the differential equation that results from the
direction of the curvature has signiﬁcant effects on the behaviorof the solutions. The differential equations are solved analyti-
cally for these two problems and their behaviors are explored at
a level appropriate for an undergraduate mechanics course.
Perihelion precession in power-law potentials: Henon’s
theorem
V. Dmitra /C20sinovic ´ and Marija R. Jankovic ´
90(8), p. 580
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0080691While many physicists might believe that orbits have been
fully understood since Newton’s time, there are still new
insights to be gained. In 1977, Michel H /C19enon presented a
remarkable theorem for N-body orbits relating the preces-
sion, energy, angular momentum, and the power law of the
potential. This paper presents this theorem in a simpliﬁed
form for two-body interactions and is appropriate for under-graduate mechanics courses.
Exam problems that link physical concepts with
electrical phenomena in living cells
Vadim Shlyonsky, Bertrand de Prelle, Florian Bodranghien,
Don Patrick Bischop, and David Gall

Every year, thousands of students intending on careers in
the health sciences take physics classes. Problems thatillustrate applications of physical concepts to living systems
reinforce the power and relevance of physics for these stu-dents. This paper presents a collection of 15 examinationproblems given to undergraduate life-sciences students at the
Faculty of Medicine of the Universit /C19e libre de Bruxelles in
Belgium. The problems cover physical/electrical principlesunderlying membrane phenomena in living cells such as elec-
trodiffusion, modeling cells as RC circuits, ion currents, and
the Hodgkin-Huxley model of cell voltage excitability. Whilethe students for whom these problems are intended havealready had a year of introductory physics, they may be of
interest to instructors in introductory-level courses who wish
to include problems involving cellular phenomena. Completesolutions are provided in the online supplemental material.
Nonlinear coupling in an asymmetric pendulum
Qiuhan Jia, Yao Luo, Huijun Zhou, Yinlong Wang,
Jianguo Wan, and Sihui Wang
90(8), p. 594
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0010391A two-dimensional pendulum suspended from a ﬂexible
rod can trace out a visually appealing stationary pattern. Thenonlinearity induced by the supporting rod can be treated as a
perturbation if the rod is sufﬁciently stiff, allowing for a con-
trollable analytical approximation. The analytical resultsdeveloped in this article are compared to numerical simula-
tions and experimental results. Mechanics instructors will ﬁnd
this setup provides both an instructive class demonstration andfertile ground for student exploration of nonlinearity.
On the nonlinearity of a tuning fork
Lintao Xiao, Chenyu Bao, Qiuhan Jia, Haoyang Wu,
Huijun Zhou, Jianguo Wan, and Sihui Wang
90(8), p. 604
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0011387The technique of double-grating Doppler interferometry is
introduced to measure the oscillation amplitude of a tuningfork. Due to a non-linear restoring force, the resonance fre-
quencies shift as the amplitude changes, and these resonant
frequencies exhibit hysteresis as the amplitude is cycled.These experiments could be implemented in an optics oracoustics lab or in a more general advanced laboratory course.
Using a smartphone camera to explore ray optics beyond
the thin lens equation
M. C. Sullivan
90(8), p. 610
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0090854Have you ever wondered how a camera ﬁts inside a smart-
phone? The thickness of the camera limits the focal length to
a few millimeters, and there are design challenges due to theneed to minimize aberrations, focus on objects at a large

range of distances, and allow a wide image collection angle.
It turns out that a simple analysis assuming thin lenses canexplain much of the imaging system, and this analysis couldbe performed by introductory optics students. However,there are many interesting complications of the compoundlens system that can be studied by more advanced students.This paper shows how to use a smartphone camera as anoptics lab at a wide range of levels.
Painting in polarization
Aaron D. Slepkov
90(8), p. 617
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087800Birefringence is not only an interesting physics phenome-
non with important practical applications such as identifyingsamples in mineralogy. It can also be used for art. This arti-cle encourages you to explore the colors that can be createdwhen everyday birefringent materials (such as adhesive tape,ﬁlm wrap, or transparent cutlery) are placed in between apolarizer and an analyzer. This art technique can become anice student project or can be inserted into an inexpensiveundergraduate optics lab. And, who knows, maybe one ofyour students (or yourself!) will be the next Michelangelo ofpolage (polarization painting).
Quantitative measurement of birefringence in
transparent films across the visible spectrum
Aaron D. Slepkov
90(8), p. 625https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087798
An affordable experimental setup to measure the wave-
length-dependent birefringence of thin polymer ﬁlms is pre-
sented. The setup includes an incoherent incandescent light
source and portable spectrometer, allowing ﬁlm characteriza-tion across the visible and near-infrared regions. Acquisition
and analysis of data from this setup are demonstrated on six
common household polymer ﬁlms, including kitchen wrap,cellophane, and adhesive tape. In addition, the optical thick-
ness is obtained on ﬁlms that exhibit concomitant thin-ﬁlm
interference effects. The work described here offers anaccessible project on polarization optics for the undergradu-
ate instructional laboratory.
A simple setup for the determination of the cosmic muon
magnetic moment
Damir Bosnar, Mihael Makek, and Zoran Matic ´
90(8), p. 635
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0077280
A low-cost experimental setup to measure the magnetic
moment of cosmic muons is presented. Two signiﬁcant mod-iﬁcations to previous such experiments are introduced in thisapproach: Reduction of the detection system to just a single
scintillation detector and simpliﬁed electronics for signal
processing and data acquisition. Experimental results areanalyzed based on the provided theory, yielding an accurate
value for the muon’s gyromagnetic ratio. The work described
here offers an accessible particle physics project for theundergraduate instructional laboratory.
