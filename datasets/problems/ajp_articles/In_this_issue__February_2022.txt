Making digital aquatint with the Ising model
Yannick Meurice
90(2), p. 87
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006525Calling all art-lovers! The mathematical machinery of the
Ising model, familiar as a theoretical description of ferro-magnetism, is employed to add interesting “texture” to anexisting work of art, such as a painting or photograph, mim-
icking the chemically-based “aquatint” technique developed
by Francisco Goya ( The Disasters of War ), Pablo Picasso,
and others. Best of all, the materials described herein havebeen successfully used by the author in ﬁrst year seminar
classes, spurring interest in physics and computer science
among artistically-inclined students.
Band formation and defects in a finite periodic
quantum potential
Todd K. Timberlake and Neilson Woodﬁeld
90(2), p. 93
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006391Periodic quantum systems, such as regularly spaced atoms
in a solid, are characterized by energy spectra with well-
deﬁned bands of energy levels separated by gaps. The forma-
tion of band structures is usually analyzed with Bloch’stheorem, but this can be abstract for beginning students. Thispaper examines the energy states of a one-dimensional sys-
tem comprising Dirac delta-function wells embedded in an
inﬁnite square well. The spacing and strength of the Diracwells can be varied to show how bands and gaps respond and
to simulate the presence of defects in an otherwise periodic
structure. In the following companion paper by Carr et al. ,a
similar topic is dealt with in a very different way: an experi-mental demonstration of defects and band formation using a
classical analog system with coupled harmonic oscillators.
Both papers are appropriate for intermediate and upper-levelstudents.
A classical analog for defects in quantum band formation
Paolo Francisco, Tadan Cobb, Shawn A. Hilbert, and
Scott Carr
90(2), p. 103
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009053The collective mechanical behavior of a linear system of
masses and springs can mimic that of a one-dimensionalcrystal. In particular, the resonance frequencies of the
mechanical system are analogous to the crystal’s electronic
energies, and there is a frequency gap akin to a bandgap in asemiconductor. In this paper, the authors examine the effectof changing the mass or the spring constant in one of the
mechanical oscillators and thus simulate the introduction of
a defect in the crystal. The defect’s resonance frequency canbe theoretically calculated and compared with experiment.
This work shows how a macroscopic mechanical system can
serve as proxy for a microscopic quantum system. It couldbe used in an undergraduate advanced mechanics class,
building a connection with condensed matter physics.
Investigating and improving student understanding
of the basics for a system of identical particles
Christof Keebaugh, Emily Marshman, and
Chandralekha Singh
90(2), p. 110
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006910Systems of identical particles are notoriously difﬁcult for
students to understand. This paper describes student difﬁcul-ties and presents a series of reﬂective exercises, a QuILT,
that guide students to a greatly increased understanding, both
at the undergraduate and graduate level.
Illustrations of loosely bound and resonant states
in atomic nuclei
A. C. Dassie, F. Gerdau, F. J. Gonzalez, M. Moyano, and
R. M. Id Betan
90(2), p. 118
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0007045The use of S-matrices is essential in analyzing nuclear
physics experiments, but their meanings can be opaque. Thispaper seeks to help physicists develop a better understanding
of these matrices by applying them to classical and quantum
mechanical scattering problems.
Velocity reciprocity and the relativity principle
Patrick Moylan
90(2), p. 126
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009219Velocity reciprocity is the property that pairs of inertial
reference frames will measure each other to have equal andopposite relative velocities. While this is true for the
Galilean and Lorentz transformations, it need not be true in
general. This paper analyses the group-theoretic foundationsof relativity theory to explore what additional assumptions
must be made for velocity reciprocity to hold, and also
explores the misconception that velocity reciprocity followsfrom the relativity of motion principle. In particular, the
underappreciated importance of Henri Poincar /C19e’s demand
that the principle of relativity be accorded universal validityis emphasized. Appropriate for students of modern physics
and mathematics familiar with the rudiments of group
theory.

Subtle features in projectile motion with quadratic drag
found through Taylor series expansions
Antonio Corvo
90(2), p. 135
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009227The problem of projectile motion with air drag is notori-
ously difﬁcult to approximate. The author presents aninsightful trick: Expand the horizonal velocity in powers ofinverse velocity. The result provides useful theoretical com-parisons for data collected in the teaching lab and also a les-son in applications of the Taylor expansion.
Exploring complex pattern formation with convolutional
neural networks
Christian Scholz and Sandy Scholz
90(2), p. 141
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0065458Machine learning is becoming more and more important
in the analysis of data in many ﬁelds including physics. Inthis paper, the authors provide a pedagogical introduction tohow a convolutional neural network can be used to classifythe complex patterns created by simulations of a coupledreaction-diffusion system.Theoretical and experimental examination of simple
coaxial photonic crystals for undergraduate teaching
Xubo Guo, Yingying Liu, Ying Chang, Meihong Zhu, and
Liuwan Zhang
90(2), p. 152
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0059320A coaxial photonic crystal, composed of a single type of
coaxial cable, is used to study fundamental properties of
photonic crystals. Using only a function generator and oscil-
loscope, photonic crystal effects, including photonic
bandgap, highly superluminal group velocity, and the inﬂu-
ence of defects, are investigated. Experimental results arecompared to a theory based on transfer matrices. The work
described here offers an affordable addition to the under-
graduate instructional laboratory.
