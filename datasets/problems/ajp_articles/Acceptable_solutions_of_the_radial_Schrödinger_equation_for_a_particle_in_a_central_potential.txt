Acceptable solutions of the radial Schr €odinger equation for a particle

We revisit the discussion about the boundary condition at the origin in the Schr €odinger radial
equation for central potentials. We give a transparent and convincing reason for demanding theradial part R(r) of the wave function to be ﬁnite at r¼0, showing that if R(0) diverges the complete
wave function wdoes not satisfy the full Schr €odinger equation. If R(r) is singular, we show that the
corresponding wfollows an equation similar to Schr €odinger’s, but with an additional term
involving the Dirac delta function or its derivatives at the origin. Although, in general,
understanding some of our arguments requires certain knowledge of the theory of distributions, the
important case of a behavior R/1/rnear r¼0, which gives rise to a normalizable w, is especially
simple: The origin of the Dirac delta term is clearly demonstrated by using a slight modiﬁcation of
the usual spherical coordinates. The argument can be easily followed by undergraduate physics
students.

I. INTRODUCTION
The stationary states of central potentials V(r) are usually
represented by a product of an angular part (spherical har-
monic Ym
l) and a radial part R(r). The latter is calculated as
a solution of the radial equation,
/C0/C22h2

2lr2"#
uðrÞ¼EuðrÞ; (1)
where u(r)¼R(r)r,Eis the energy, lis the mass of the parti-
cle, and lis the azimuthal quantum number. Equation (1)is
solved with the supplementary condition,
uð0Þ¼0: (2)
Although this boundary condition is used virtually in all text-
books on quantum mechanics, there are many different justiﬁ-
cations. In fact, this question is discussed differently indifferent textbooks. For example, Schiff1and Landau and
Lifshitz2use the argument that the wave function must be
ﬁnite at the origin, whereas Powell and Crasemann3suggest
that it is the normalization of the wave function that leads to
Eq.(2). However, the wave function can be normalized even if
it is singular at the origin, i.e., if u(0)6¼0. Grifﬁths4recognizes
the subtlety of this issue and avoids a direct consideration of
the problem. Messiah5deﬁnes the Hermitian radial momen-
tum, and its Hermitian property requires this boundary condi-tion. Another explanation is given by Fl €ugge.6He indicates
thatu(0)6¼0 would lead to a divergent energy integral.
A few years ago, Khelashvili and Nadareishvili7gave a
succinct reason for Eq. (2), making explicit an argument
already outlined by Dirac in his classical book.8According
to these authors, a Dirac delta function term appears in the
radial Schrodinger equation when the Laplace operator iswritten in spherical coordinates,

r; (3)which is valid for r/C210. A similar idea was also presented in
Ref. 9.
This additional term had been previously unnoticed in the
literature. It gives a clear explanation for the necessity of
imposing the supplementary condition (2)for solving the
usual radial equation (1).
In this paper, we will see that Eq. (3)is, indeed, correct,
provided that u(0) is ﬁnite , and we will give a very simple
justiﬁcation for it. If u(0) is inﬁnite , the situation is even
more complicated as will be shown at the end of the paper,
and the radial equation contains additional terms involving
derivatives of the Dirac delta. Anyway, we will show that
solutions of Eq. (1)with a ﬁnite u(0)6¼0 do not give rise to
true solutions of the complete Schr €odinger equation. The
argument can be easily understood by physics undergraduate
students. This will be the purpose of Sec. II. In addition, in
Sec. III, we will show that the appearance of terms contain-
ing the Dirac delta in the radial equation is not restricted tothe speciﬁc form (3), but there exist more complicated
dependences for the case of radial functions with singulari-
ties of higher degree. The calculations in this part of the arti-
cle use quite elaborate mathematical arguments derived from
the theory of distributions. Such calculations are given in the
online supplementary material and can be omitted on a ﬁrst
reading because they are not essential for the understanding
of the paper. Finally, in Sec. IV, we will draw our
conclusions.
II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE DIRAC DELTA TERM
We will restrict ourselves to the study of potentials, for
which lim r
2VðrÞ! 0 for r!0. In this case, the asymptotic
behavior at the origin of the solutions of Eq. (1)isu(r)/rs,
with s¼lþ1o r s¼/C0l. These exponents are well known
and are obtained by substituting the dependence rsin Eq. (1)
and setting the coefﬁcient of the dominant term equal tozero.10
The solutions with s¼lþ1 automatically satisfy condi-
tion(2). The solutions with s¼/C0ldo not satisfy (2)ifl6¼0,
but they should be discarded since they are not physically
acceptable: They give rise to non-normalizable wave

functions. However, the case l¼0 is exceptional since the
resulting wave function with s¼0 is normalizable.
Obviously, condition (2)excludes this solution, but this con-
dition has not yet been justiﬁed.
Let us then consider the case s¼0 with l¼0, where the
complete wave function is w¼RðrÞY0
0, and the function R
can be expressed in a power series of the form
RðrÞ¼a0=rþa1þa2rþa3r2þ/C1/C1/C1 ; (4)
with a06¼0. The calculation of r2winvolves only the vari-
able r, so that we have

is the part of the Laplacian dependent on r.
Now, care should be taken with Eq. (6)since problems may
arise at r¼0. To deal with this issue, we will use slightly mod-
iﬁed spherical coordinates. Usually, rranges from 0 to 1,a n d
the polar angle hranges from 0 to p. However, in order to ana-
lyze the derivatives at the origin, it is convenient to take a newcoordinate ~rthat ranges from /C01 toþ1 and a new ~hthat
ranges from 0 to p/2. This choice unambiguously describes the
position of an arbitrary point. The position vectors of the
Northern hemisphere have coordinates ~r>0, and those of
the Southern hemisphere ~r<0. This choice has been shown to
be useful to avoid “losing” dfunctions on calculating ﬁelds of
point charges and dipoles.11
The relationship between the usual spherical coordinates
(r,h,u) and the modiﬁed coordinates ð~r;~h;uÞis
~r¼rifh<p=2
¼/C0rifh>p=2;
~h¼hifh<p=2
¼p/C0hifh>p=2: (7)
Using the new coordinates, the Laplace operator r2
rcan be
written as
r2

~rd2

since, as can be seen in Eq. (6),r2
ris an operator invariant
upon the substitution r$/C0 r.
A wave function with only radial dependence is described by
an even function of the new coordinate ~r,i . e . , Rð~rÞ¼Rð/C0~rÞ
¼RðrÞ(see an example in Fig. 1(a)). The central potential is
a l s og i v e nb ya ne v e nf u n c t i o n Vð~rÞ¼Vð/C0~rÞ¼VðrÞ.I nc o n -
trast, uð~rÞ¼~rRð~rÞis odd.
Now, when computing r2
rRusing (8), it is convenient to
notice the following points in the different steps of the
calculation:
(i) The function ~rRð~rÞis odd and has a discontinuity at
the origin (Fig. 1(b)) equal to 2 a0since its limits on
the right and left hand sides around r¼0 are different
(þa0and/C0a0, respectively).(ii) d½~rRð~rÞ/C138=d~ris even and has a d-type discontinuity at
the origin, whose strength is given by the magnitudeof the discontinuity of ~rRð~rÞat the origin. In other
words, there appears a term 2 a
0dð~rÞ. This is the key
point of the argument.
(iii) d2½~rRð~rÞ/C138=d~r2is odd and has a contribution
2a0ddð~rÞ=d~r¼/C02a0dð~rÞ=~rat the origin.
This equality results from integration by parts of the
product of a well-behaved function fð~rÞand
~r½ddð~rÞ=d~r/C138, i.e.,

ingu(~r)¼~rR(~r)function, showing a discontinuity at the origin. The deriva-
tive of u(~r) has a Dirac delta term dð~rÞat the origin. The example
corresponds to a radial function expressed as a power series in the form (4)
with coefﬁcients a0¼3,a1¼1, and ak¼0 for k/C212.

(iv) Finally, r2
rRis even and contains an extra term
/C02a0dð~rÞ=~r2.
Thedð~rÞterm can be expressed using a three-dimensional
delta d(r) since, when the latter is multiplied by a function
with only radial dependence, its effect is the same than themultiplication by dð~rÞ=ð2p~r
2Þ. In other words, we have
dðrÞ¼dð~rÞ=ð2p~r2Þ: (9)
This identity is shown by explicit integration of the product
ofdð~rÞwith a test function fð~rÞ,

Therefore, there is a contribution equal to /C04pa0d(r) at the
origin in the calculation of r2
rR.12The Schr €odinger equation

which coincides with Eq. (3)forl¼0i fu(0)¼a0.
In other words, for wavefunctions with l¼0 that behave
like R/1/rat the origin, the usual radial Eq. (1)is not
exactly derived from the Schr €odinger equation Hw¼Ew, but
from another equation with an additional term, i.e.,Hw¼EwþQ, where

Only if Ris ﬁnite at r¼0(a0¼0), the extra contribution Qis
null, and the Schr €odinger equation fulﬁlled. This is the rea-
son for demanding condition (2)when solving (1).
To end this section, we would like to point out that a ﬁnite
a06¼0 necessarily implies l¼0, so Eq. (3)proposed in Ref.
7only makes sense if l¼0. The situation for l6¼0 is more
complicated as will be seen below.
III. THE CASE OF SINGULAR SOLUTIONS
WITH l6¼0
Though we have seen that functions Ym
lRðrÞwith l6¼0
that behave like 1 =rlþ1at the origin are not physically
acceptable simply on the basis that they are not normaliz-able, we want to show now that they are not true solutions ofthe complete Schr €odinger equation either. Speciﬁcally, we
will show that these functions satisfy an equation of the
aforementioned type instead of the Schr €odinger equation,
Hw¼EwþQ, where Qcontains terms that involve the
derivatives of the dfunction. The mathematics required to
perform the calculations in this part of the paper are moreadvanced and assume some knowledge of the distribution
theory.
13The difﬁculties appear because the expression for
the Laplacian of rs,r2rs¼sðsþ1Þrs/C02, is not valid for
r¼0 and has an extra term when sis a negative odd inte-
ger.14,15See the supplementary material for the explanation
of the details.16Below, we will simply give the ﬁnal results
without proof and will make some comments about them.
Table Igathers the extra terms Qto the Schr €odinger equa-
tion for the ﬁrst values of ( l,m) in the case of a wave function
w¼RYm

the origin like 1 =rlþ1, in such a way that we have

; (12)
where akare appropriate coefﬁcients and a06¼0.
From the ﬁrst entry of Table I, it can be easily seen that
the case l¼0 gives rise to Eq. (11) of Sec. II. The cases with
l6¼0 are more complicated. For example, if l¼1,m¼1,
the Schr €odinger equation for w¼ðY1
1=r2Þða0þa1rþa2r2
þ/C1/C1/C1Þ is modiﬁed in the form
Hw¼Ewþð/C22h2=2lÞﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
6pp
a0@xþi@y/C0/C1d; (13)
where now a0¼lim½r2RðrÞ/C138 ¼ lim½ruðrÞ/C138when r!0. Note
that the presence of a coefﬁcient a06¼0 gives rise to a function
R(r) with a larger degree of singularity at r¼0a sw ei n c r e a s e l.
In general, all the solutions of Eq. (1)that at the origin
behave like u/1/rlgive rise to a wave function Ym
lRðrÞthat
does not obey the Schr €odinger equation and, therefore, should
be discarded. Only the solutions with asymptotic behavioru/r
lþ1are acceptable. Therefore, Eq. (2)is a necessary condi-
tion to obtain a genuine solution of the Schr €odinger equation.
This point is independent of whether the stationary states con-
sidered are bound states or scattering states.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
A rigorous treatment of the calculation of the Laplacian of
Ym
lRðrÞusing the distribution theory has allowed us to dem-
onstrate that there are singular contributions at r¼0 in those
solutions of the radial Eq. (1)in which ubehaves like 1 =rlat
the origin. Such contributions involve the Dirac delta and itsderivatives. This means that these solutions u(r) do not give
rise to wave functions Y
m
luðrÞ=rthat actually satisfy the
Schr€odinger equation. While if l6¼0, those functions can be

tions wof the form (12) whose radial parts satisfy the usual radial equation

ruled out from the beginning since they are not normalizable,
the case l¼0 is special. For this case, we have seen using
simple mathematics that the wave function Y0
0uðrÞ=rsatisﬁes
a Schr €odinger equation with an additional contribution pro-
portional to u(0) and a Dirac delta. Therefore, only if
u(0)¼0, can a true solution of the Schr €odinger equation be
obtained. In other words, since u(0) must vanish for a solu-
tion to be valid, the leading a0term of u(r) must be zero and,
thus, must behave like a1rat the origin.
