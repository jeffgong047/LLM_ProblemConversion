The edge profile of liquid spills
F. Behroozi
90(1), p. 10
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0058674Who has not admired the shape of a liquid drop, be it an ele-
gant dewdrop on a summer morning or a puddle of spilt coffee?
What physics dictates the shapes of these phenomena?
Surprisingly, the edge proﬁle of drops is not a common topic in
ﬂuid dynamics texts. This paper derives the relevant proﬁle-
shape differential equations as a function of the density and sur-face tension of the ﬂuid and examines proﬁle shapes for drops
of water resting on various horizontal substrates. Appropriate
for an advanced mechanics or ﬂuid dynamics class.
Using the Carnot cycle to determine changes of the phase
transition temperature
Oskar Grocholski, Kornel Howil, Stanisław Rakowski,
and Piotr Maksymiuk
90(1), p. 15
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006455The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually derived using
the Gibbs free energy, so it is not discussed in introductory
classes. This short article derives the equation by appealing to
Kelvin’s statement of the second law of thermodynamics: No
heat engine can be 100% efﬁcient, or more efﬁcient than a
Carnot engine. This approach couples nicely to concepts typi-
cally included in the introductory physics sequence, makingthe Clausius-Clapeyron equation accessible to beginning stu-
dents. The authors use the water liquid/ice transition and the
normal/superconducting transition to illustrate the strategy.
Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect demonstrated for
sound waves from a waterfall: an experimental,numerical, and analytical study
Arnt Inge Vistnes and Joakim Bergli
90(1), p. 20
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006613In 1956, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) successfully
determined the angular extent of the star Sirius by measuring
the cross-correlation in its intensity ﬂuctuations detected at
two nearby telescopes. In this article, the authors use the
same approach with sound waves emitted by a waterfall to
measure its angular extent. The HBT effect is often treated
as a quantum phenomenon, but the authors use a conceptu-
ally simpler classical wave approach. The effect is derivedmathematically, and also explored using numerical simula-
tion, all of which renders the topic suitable for theundergraduate curriculum. If you are curious about the HBT
effect, or wish to add it to your curriculum, this article would
be an excellent source of information.
Yet another approach to solutions of one-dimensional
wave equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions
Qiong-Gui Lin
90(1), p. 31
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0058957Solving the wave equation or the diffusion equation (in one
or more dimensions) with appropriate boundary and in itial con-
ditions is one of the basic problems in mathematical physics.
This paper revisits the one-dimensional wave equation in a
ﬁnite space domain, which describes the transversal vibration
of a stretched string or the longitudinal vibration of a ﬂexible
rod. In this case, there exists yet another approach for dealing
with inhomogeneous boundary cond itions with a clear physical
picture that appears to have previously gone unnoticed.
The Vaidya metric: Expected and unexpected traits of
evaporating black holes
Julius Piesnack and Klaus Kassner
90(1), p. 37
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006367In this article, a model of an evaporating black hole is con-
structed. The model can be used to answer fascinating ques-
tions, such as: “what type of motion would you undergo if
you fell into a black hole that is about to disappear from
Hawking radiation?” As is often the case with black hole
physics, the answers can be delightfully surprising.
Gravitational lens effect revisited through membrane
waves
Stefan Catheline, Victor Delattre, Gabrielle Laloy-
Borgna, Fr /C19ederic Faure, and Mathias Fink
90(1), p. 47
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006612A ball rolling over a warped elastic membrane is a famil-
iar classroom demonstration of motion in a curved spacetime
metric. In this article, the authors show that a plane wavepropagating on a similar landscape bends in an analogous
way to the gravitational lensing of light. They demonstrate
this experimentally and also through a numerical simulationbased on the wave equation in a Schwarzschild metric. Both
experiment and simulation capture the salient features of
Eddington’s famous 1919 experiment that provided an
important test of general relativity.
Gamma camera imaging in an undergraduate physics
course
Mary Lowe, Alex Spiro, and Peter Kutt
5 Am. J. Phys. 90(1), January 2022 http://aapt.org/ajp #2022 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 5 04 October 2023 22:58:48
90(1), p. 51
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006168Radioactive substances are used in diagnostic medical
imaging for purposes such as diagnosing disease or detectinga tumor. In gamma camera imaging, the patient is injectedwith a gamma-ray emitting pharmaceutical that preferen-tially collects in a speciﬁc location. The camera used toimage the tracer consists of a collimator, a scintillator, and a2-D array of photomultiplier tubes in conjunction withsophisticated software for optimizing the camera’s resolu-tion. The authors ﬁrst explain the function of each cameracomponent and then describe visible-light replicas for teach-ing gamma camera imaging to undergraduates. The presenta-tion is suitable for STEM students at all levels, and theteaching apparatus is inexpensive and easy to duplicate.
Vertical quasistatic Poiseuille flow: Theory and
experiment
Don S. Lemons, Trevor C. Lipsombe, and Rickey J. Faehl
90(1), p. 59
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006245An easy and inexpensive ﬂuid-mechanics experiment: a
viscous ﬂuid (glycerin) drains from a container through ametal straw. Measuring the rate at which the ﬂuid drainsshows good agreement with Poiseuille ﬂow. This experi-ment could easily be performed by introductory students,and even a full understanding of the derivation requires onlyvery simple differential equations.
Measuring the viscosity of air with soapy water, a
smartphone, a funnel, and a hose: An experiment for
undergraduate physics students
Alexandre Delvert, Pascal Panizza, and Laurent Courbin90(1), p. 64
https://10.1119/10.0006881Because the viscosity of air is so small, it is quite difﬁcult
to measure. The viscosity affects the rate at which air ﬂowsthrough a tube (Poiseuille ﬂow), but both the applied pres-sure and the ﬂow rate must be accurately measured. Thisclever experiment measures both parameters simultaneouslyby observing the motion of a soap bubble at the mouth of afunnel. Suitable for an introductory course on ﬂuid mechan-ics, the experiment can easily be performed with minimalequipment.
Determination of the density profile by using the
refractive index in a linearly salt-stratified fluid: An
experiment for an advanced undergraduate laboratory
R. C. Cruz-G /C19omez, F. A. Vel /C19azquez-Mu ~noz, and J.
Salcedo-Castro
90(1), p. 71
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006353A low-cost laser refractography instructional laboratory
experiment designed to study stratiﬁcation in ﬂuids isdescribed. Video analysis of acquired data yields quantitativemeasurements of the refractive index and density proﬁles ina linearly stratiﬁed salt water column. Quantifying densitygradients in stratiﬁed ﬂuids is a topic of interest in ﬁeldssuch as oceanography, geophysics, and industrial processing.
