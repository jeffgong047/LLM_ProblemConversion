Search processes are ubiquitous in physical and biological phenomena, often involving the random
motion of molecules. In particular, transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene
expression and need to ﬁnd their DNA targets quickly—which is difﬁcult to achieve with random
motion alone. Nature came up with a remarkable solution known as facilitated diffusion,combining 1D diffusion along the DNA and “excursions” of diffusion in 3D that help the TF to
quickly arrive at distant parts of the DNA. In this paper, we show that this process can be analyzed
naturally using the concept of conditional probability, providing an alternative intuition to theeffectiveness of this mechanism.

I. MOTIVATION
Elchanan Mossel’s Dice paradox1poses a simple probabil-
ity question that gives rise to neat and non-intuitive results.The paradox is phrased as follows:2
You roll a fair six-sided die until you get 6. What
is the expected number of rolls, if we consider
only those series of rolls in which each roll in theseries is an even number?
It is a common mistake to think that the answer is 3 based
on the following logic: if the possible outcomes are either 2,4 or 6 and we wish to get a 6 then the number of rolls followsa geometric distribution with a parameter of 1/3.
Alas, this “solution” overlooks the conditioning present in
the formulation of the paradox that should lead us to makeuse of a fundamental concept in probability theory, condi-
tional probability. All rolls are still possible, but the condi-
tioning on rolling only even numbers makes us eliminate a
series from our statistics as soon as an odd number is rolled.
The basic concept of conditional probability is summarizedby the following equation:
PAjBðÞ ¼
PA\BðÞ
PBðÞ: (1)
In Eq. (1),PðAjBÞmeans the probability that Aoccurs,
given that Bhas occurred, and PðA\BÞis the probability
that both AandBoccur. As mentioned, the answer of 3 is
wrong due to improperly taking into account the condi-tioning. We can perform the correct calculation using Eq.(1).I n s t e a do f Awe’ll have X
iwhich stands for the proba-
bility of getting a 6 on the ith roll, so that PðXiÞ¼1=6.
The event Bwill occur whenever a series has only even
numbers (2s and 4s) before the ﬁrst 6. P(B) will allow us
to calculate the fraction of series that qualify for consider-
ation because they meet the condition. First, we’ll calcu-latePðX

sideration, is simply the sum of PðXi\BÞover all possible
values of i,

which is quite different than what was naively expected. The
origin for this difference is that once we properly take the
conditioning into account we essentially eliminate all longsequences since they have vanishingly small probability for
not including odd numbers. This difference could be empha-
sized by, for example, a 1,000-sided die. For such a die, thenaive calculation will produce a result of E½N/C138¼500 while
for the correct calculation E½N/C138¼1000 =501/C252. In
Appendix C , we provide some code to help the reader build
intuition for this result.
Next, we will describe an important biological process
known as “facilitated diffusion,” which, intriguingly, is
related to the concept of conditioned probability. In fact, wewill see that this mechanism shares several key properties
with the “paradox” discussed above.
II. FACILITATED DIFFUSION
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins designated to regu-
late gene expression in cells. In order for the regulation to be
effective, the TF has to ﬁnd its target, a segment located some-where along the DNA that is extremely short compared with
the entire length of the DNA, in tens of seconds or less. The
root of this requirement is related to typical time scales of otherprocesses taking place within the cell—notably, the cell’s dou-
bling time, which is often on the order of tens of minutes. The
motion of TFs is via diffusion. An order-of-magnitude estimate

for the search time via either 1D or 3D diffusion is given, for
example, in Ref. 3. The estimate for 1D diffusion is obtained
using 1D diffusion constant and the total length of the DNA
tsearch/C24L2
D1D; (5)
with Lbeing the DNA total length and D1Dthe 1D diffusion
coefﬁcient. For typical values relevant for bacteria,L¼10
6nm;D1D¼104–105nm2=s—taken from Refs. 3
and4, this results in a search time of thousands of hours. The
estimate for 3D diffusion is as follows:
tsearch/C24V
D3Dr; (6)
with Vbeing the volume restricting the TF and its target, D3D
the 3D diffusion coefﬁcient, and rthe typical spatial size of
the target. It could be obtained by dimensional analysis
assuming that the mean search time has to be inversely pro-portional to the concentration of searchers (forcing the meansearch time to be proportional to the search volume) or, morerigorously, by solving a ﬁrst-passage-time problem of a ran-
dom walker hitting a target in a restricted volume, as found in
Refs. 5and 6. For typical values relevant for bacteria,
V¼10
9nm3;D3D¼107nm2=s;r¼0:34 nm—taken from
Refs. 3and4, this results in a search time of hundreds of sec-
onds. This result is much better than the 1D case, but in reality
it is likely that the protein would spend a ﬁnite length of time
bound to a non-target site, which would further increase thevalue of t
search, making this estimate optimistic.7
In principle, the TF search could have been executed by
ﬁrst attaching to the DNA at some point, followed by proces-
sive motion until the target is found. For velocities large
enough, this could have led to a superior search mechanism.However, such motion inevitably consumes energy (since itbreaks detailed balance). For this or other reasons, this solu-tion was not chosen by Nature. Note that other biological
scenarios do involve the processive motion of proteins in
1D, see, e.g., Ref. 8.
Facilitated diffusion is a mechanism where the TF performs
1D diffusion along the DNA and at any given moment canfall off and perform 3D diffusion until reattaching to the DNA(a 3D excursion) at some random point along it; this is a key
assumption that allows signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations of the math-
ematical description of the mechanism. The 1D diffusionalong the DNA and the 3D excursions alternate until the TFhits its target. This model is well studied, see Refs. 3,4,a n d 9for reviews, and empirical evidence supporting it was found
in bacteria.
10Figure 1shows a cartoon illustrating this mecha-
nism. As we shall see, the dependence of the search time on
the underlying microscopic parameters (diffusion constants
and dimensions) is fundamentally different than the 1D and
3D models discussed above. For a broad parameter regime, itcan lead to a signiﬁcant speed-up of the search time.
We will now show a mathematical description of this
model that allows signiﬁcant speed-up compared with the
results of Eqs. (5)and(6). Namely, we’ll arrive at a search
time that scales like Linstead of L2. The key principle for
the success of this mechanism is analogous to what we
described earlier discussing the dice “paradox”—the falling-
off during a 1D search attempt and re-trying at a random
point along the DNA resembles the “throwing away” of longdie rolling sequences. Namely, the probability to fall-off is
analogous to the probability of getting an odd number. Note
that in the dice problem once we get an odd number we“reset” the counter, while in the case of facilitated diffusion
failed attempts do contribute to the total time. However, in
both cases, the “resetting” allows us to avoid lengthy runs
and, thus, shortens the mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT).
Furthermore, in both cases, we see the dramatic effects ofthea priori benign conditioning process: In the dice prob-
lem, this leads to a MFPT always smaller than 2 (for any
number of facets of the die). In the facilitated diffusion prob-lem, conditioning on a successful search leads to a MFPT
linear in the distance from the target, rather than quadrati-
cally as we might expect intuitively.
III. MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION
We now present the mathematical description of the facili-
tated diffusion mechanism. We start from a microscopicpoint of view, then move on to a continuum description and
by properly taking the conditional probability into account
we arrive at a description of the full search process. Our
results are closely related to the extensive analytical results
obtained in Ref. 11, even though our derivation is more ele-
mentary and focuses on different aspects of the mathematical
description of the mechanism.
We start by solving the one dimensional problem of a TF
hitting the target while being bound to the DNA. Afterwards
we’ll take the 3D excursions into account.
A. The 1D problem
As a “warm-up” we’ll start with a time-independent prob-
lem of the probability of a TF hitting a target before fallingoff starting at distance xfrom the target, ~pðxÞ—hereinafter,
we mark a quantity with a tilde when it describes a discrete
function; we use the same notation for its continuous coun-
terpart albeit with the tilde omitted. We can write the recur-
sion relation for ~pðxÞas follows:
~pxðÞ¼1/C0cðÞ
~pxþdx ðÞ þ~px/C0dx ðÞ
2; (7)
where cis the probability to fall at any step and dxis the step
size. This recursion relation holds since at each step the TF
falls off with probability c, and otherwise has a probability
of 1/2 of moving to either of the neighboring sites. In Eq.(7), we neglect the effect of having ﬁnite boundaries – given
that the DNA is long compared with the size of the TF we
Fig. 1. Cartoon illustrating the facilitated diffusion search mechanism. The
TF (circle) performs 1 D diffusion along the DNA (solid line). It then falls
off, performs 3D diffusion, and lands somewhere else along the DNA (3D
diffusion excursion)—which could get it closer to its target (square) or fur-
ther away from it. This process repeats itself until the TF ﬁnds the target.

may, without signiﬁcantly affecting the results, solve the
problem on an inﬁnite domain, x2ð /C0 1 ;1Þ, while assum-
ing the target is at x¼0.
Subtracting ~pðxÞfrom both sides of Eq. (7)and multiply-
ing by 2 =ðdxÞ2, we arrive at the following:
0¼~pxþdx ðÞ /C02~pxðÞþ~px/C0dx ðÞ
dxðÞ2
/C0c
dt2dt
dxðÞ2~pxþdx ðÞ þ~px/C0dx ðÞ
2; (8)
where we also multiplied the second term by 1 ¼2dt=2dt,dt
being the time step, taking continuum limit: dx!0;dt!0
andc!0, while deﬁning D/C17ðdxÞ2=2dtandC/C17c=dt. This
brings us to the following ordinary differential equation:

Equation (9) has another solution, expﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
C=Dp

.
However, this solution is unphysical since it predicts that theprobability for hitting the target prior to falling off is greater
for more distant starting points.
This result will be useful later on. For now, we wish to
solve a time-dependent problem that will allow us to calcu-late the time “spent” on 1D search attempts—the ﬁrst pas-sage time (FPT) problem. Analogously to what we did for
~pðxÞ, we can write a recursion relation for ~gðx;tÞ, which can
stand for either one of the following two: the probability dis-
tribution for a TF to be at xat time tor the probability that
the TF would hit the target by time tgiven that it started at
position x, see Ref. 12for additional explanation
~gx;tðÞ¼1/C0cðÞ
~gxþdx;t/C0dt ðÞ þ~gx/C0dx;t/C0dt ðÞ

(11)
Similar to what that was done in Eqs. (8)and(9), we can
take the continuum limit and arrive at the following PDE:
@gx;tðÞ
@t¼D@2gx;tðÞ
@x2/C0Cgx;tðÞ : (12)
Depending on which of the two interpretations listed above
is used, Eq. (12) is either a Fokker-Planck equation (also
known as the Kolmogorov Forward equation) or theKolmogorov Backward equation; see Refs. 13–16 . This is a
special case where both the forward problem and the back-
ward problem are described by the same equation, which isnot generally the case.
Equation (12) is analytically solvable. Even so, this solu-
tion is of little signiﬁcance given that the search mechanismis not “measured” at the level of a single search attempt
but—as we shall see later – on the level of numerous search
attempts. In other words, what we will be interested in is theMFPT associated with Eq. (12) (not to be confused with
the MFPT of the entire facilitated diffusion process—which wecalculate in Sec. III B). We present the calculation of the FPT
distribution for the sake of completeness in Appendix A .
The MFPT of Eq. (12), which we shall denote as TðxÞ, can
be derived directly from Eq. (12) as shown in Appendix B .
Here, we shall present a different derivation which is verysimilar to how Eqs. (9)and(12) were derived. We write the
following recursion relation for TðxÞ:
~TxðÞ¼dt~pxðÞþ1/C0cðÞ
~Txþdx ðÞ þ~Tx/C0dx ðÞ
2;(13)
where the dt~pðxÞterm is a bit subtle: Since TðxÞincludes the
average time of hitting the target over all the trajectories thateventually get there, when advancing a time step dt, the time con-
tributed to TðxÞis the product of dtand the probability of actu-
ally hitting the target. Taking the continuum limit of Eq. (13)in a
s i m i l a rm a n n e rt ow h a tt h a tw a sd o n ei nE q s . (8)and(9)gives
Dd2TxðÞ
dx2/C0CTxðÞþpxðÞ¼0: (14)
We arrived at a linear ordinary differential equation. The
boundary conditions for Eq. (14)areTð0Þ¼Tðx!1 Þ¼ 0.
The former is a direct result of the deﬁnition of TðxÞas a mean
ﬁrst passage time problem. For the latter, we reiterate that thereis a non-zero possibility that the TF will fall off before reach-ing the target, as well as that TðxÞis only contributed by suc-
cessful trajectories, which become exceedingly rare as x!1
since, as shown in Eq. (10), the probability for having a suc-
cessful trajectory initiated at xdecays exponentially with jxj.
Solving Eq. (14)is possible using a well-known method called
variation of parameters (or variation of constants) leading to

For further reading on the variation of parameters, we rec-
ommend to advise Ref. 17. Finally, we introduce the condi-
tioning whereby we disregard any runs which resulted in theTF falling off the DNA before it found the target. Referringto Eq. (1), we understand that in order to properly include
the conditioning we should divide the result of Eq. (15) by
the probability of success itself, pðxÞ. We arrive at

This result provides another example for the “power” of the
conditioning; while time is usually related to distance
squared in diffusion processes, we get a linear relation. Thisis a key property of this mechanism that ultimately allowsthe linear relation in the ﬁnal result.
B. Taking 3D excursions into account
Up to this point we’ve only considered a single 1D search
attempt. Taking the 3D excursions into account, we are ableto model the whole process. We will do so by assuming aﬁnite DNA of length 2 Lwith the TF target at its center and
that the reattachment point after a 3D excursion is distributeduniformly on the DNA. Moreover, we assume that the searchstarts with the TF bound to the DNA at some random pointalong it; relaxing the assumption is inconsequential.

In order to write down the term for the overall search time,
we use the following deﬁnitions (some were mentioned earlier):
pðxiÞis the probability to hit the target in the ith 1D search
attempt, t1DðxiÞis the time spent on the ith attempt assuming it
was successful while tf

wasn’t, all conditioned on starting from position xi,a n d ti

the time spent on 3D diffusion assuming the ði/C01Þth1D search

We see that the search time now scales linearly with Linstead

the dice “paradox”—we do not “keep” long and unsuccessful

at an overall search time of the order of tens of seconds.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we revisited a well-known and well-studied
mechanism for how TFs search for their target genes. We
showed how the mathematical description of the mechanism
naturally utilizes the basic concept of conditional probability.The facilitated diffusion problem we discussed here is mathe-
matically related to the class of problems of ﬁrst passage time
under restart. For these problems, one is interested in the ﬁrst
passage time of a random walker, with a rate to “reset” the parti-cle, typically to a particular site (in contrast to the random reset-ting encountered in the facilitated diffusion problem).
Intriguingly, for these problems, there is an optimal restart rate
that can speed up the search dramatically. Reference 18studies
the statistical properties of a searcher absorption by a static targetunder constant rate resetting of the searcher position. A generic
treatment of ﬁrst passage under resetting is given in Ref. 19,a n d
a review thoroughly studying different cases and generalizationsof the resetting time is found in Ref. 20. Such processes are
deeply related to the inspection paradox of probability theory,
where a sampling bias may distort the statistics in counter-intuitive ways. For instance, in a famous example of this para-dox, the average waiting time for a bus a person measures when
they arrive at the bus station at some random, uniformly distrib-
uted, time is greater than the average time between consecutivebuses. In the case of heavy-tailed distributions, in fact, the formercan be inﬁnite even when the latter is ﬁnite! Resetting overcomes
this sampling bias and in some cases may even shorten the wait-
ing time compared with the distribution’s mean. A review study-ing the relations between stochastic processes under resetting
and the inspection paradox is found in Ref. 21.T h i ss t u d ya l s o
characterize the processes where resetting will enable a speed-upcompared with a simple mean of the distribution.
While the facilitated diffusion mechanism is a powerful
mechanism for shortening the search time, there are both
extensions to this mechanism and other, completely different,
mechanisms worth mentioning. Still within the framework offacilitated diffusion, one may take into account the dynamicsof the DNA molecule itself, as discussed in Ref. 22,o rt h e
energy landscape the TF experiences while moving along the
DNA, as discussed in the reviews.
3,4,23Recently, Ref. 24
related diffusion on such a disordered landscape to the phe-
nomenon of Anderson localization and discussed its implica-
tions for facilitated diffusion. Another intriguing workdirectly related to facilitated diffusion is given in Ref. 25
where the authors use a facilitated diffusion-based model to
study the architecture of bacteria genome.
Although facilitated diffusion is ﬁt to describe the search
mechanism of some TFs in bacteria, other types of TFs (andproteins in general) could have a signiﬁcantly different struc-ture leading to inherently different dynamics. Reference 26
discusses a protein extended in one dimension in a manner
that enables it to interact with many sequences along theDNA in parallel, which effectively reduces the dimensionality
of the search (from three to two dimensions) causing a
remarkable speed-up of the search process—distinct from themechanism we explored here. The concept of dimensionalityreduction in biological search processes dates to the seminal
work of Delbr €uck and Adam in 1968, Ref. 27. This work was
recently revisited and extended.
28Another distinct example is
given in Refs. 29–31 , which discuss the search mechanism
TFs use in eukaryotic cells. In this case, the TFs often have a
long polymeric tail called the Intrinsic Disordered Region that
plays a major role in the search, though the theoretical frame-work for this scenario has yet to be developed.

MFPT calculated in the main text.

APPENDIX B: DERIVING THE MFPT EQUATION
DIRECTLY FROM THE EQUATION FOR THE FPT
In the main text, we derived the equation for the MFPT
using the appropriate recursion relation following fundamen-
tal principles. In the following, we shall present an alterna-tive derivation starting from the equation for the FPT,namely, Eq. (12) (also presented in the previous appendix as
Eq.(A1)).
Since gðx;tÞcorresponds to the probability to hit the target
until time tgiven that we start at x, the MFPT is obtainable
from gðx;tÞas

@tdt: (B1)
Note that we expect this time to be ﬁnite even on an inﬁ-
nite domain, since the ﬁnite fall-off rate would prevent themean time from diverging—in contrast, for example, to thediverging MFPT associated with normal random walks in1D (we have also shown this directly from the FPT distribu-tion in the previous appendix).
If we act on Eq. (A1) withÐ

APPENDIX C: DICE PARADOX CODE
The following Python script demonstrates the result of the
dice paradox. It could be used to help the reader to develop
intuition towards the paradox’s result. There are two input
parameters: “sides” refers to the number of sides the die hasand “runs” refers to the number of runs included in the esti-mation of the expected value.

print(’Number of rolls when accounting for’

For each run the script “rolls” the die until it lands on
“sides” while keeping track of the number of rolls and thenumber of rolls without landing on an odd value, the latter isreset if an odd value is rolled. The script ends with printingthe number of rolls without taking the conditioning intoaccount (which we expect to be about the same as the inputof “sides”) and the number of rolls when taking the condi-tioning into account.

12The interpretation as an equation for the probability distribution to be at x
at time tis straightforward by looking at Eq. (11), the probability to be at xat
time tis the probability that at t/C0dtwe were at either x/C0dxor at xþdx
times 1 =2 and times the probability the TF did not fall off. The interpretations
as an equation for the probability that the TF would either hit the target by
time t orat time t given that it started at position xfollow the same reasoning:
The probability that the TF started at xand took t=dtsteps to hit the target
should be the same as starting at x6dxand arriving after ðt=dtÞ/C01s t e p s
times the probability of taking one more step (and taking into account thechance of falling off).
