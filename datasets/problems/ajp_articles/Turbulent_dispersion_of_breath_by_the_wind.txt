The pioneering work of Taylor on the turbulent dispersion of aerosols is one century old and
provides an interesting way to introduce both diffusive processes and turbulence at an
undergraduate level. Low mass particles transported by a turbulent ﬂow exhibit a Brownian-likemotion over time scales larger than the velocity correlation time. Aerosols and gases are, therefore,
subjected to an effective turbulent diffusion at large length scales. However, the case of a source of
pollutant much smaller than the integral scale is not completely understood. Here, we presentexperimental results obtained by undergraduate students in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. The dispersion of a fog of oil droplets by a turbulent ﬂow is studied in a wind tunnel
designed for pedagogical purposes. It shows a ballistic-like regime at short distance, followed byTaylor’s diffusive-like regime, suggesting that scale-free diffusion by the turbulent cascade process
is bypassed. Measurements show that the dispersion of CO
2emitted when breathing in a natural,
indoor air ﬂow is not isotropic but rather along the ﬂow axis. The transverse spread is ballistic-like,leading to the concentration decaying as the inverse-squared distance to the mouth. The experiment
helps students understand the role of ﬂuctuations in diffusive processes and in turbulence. A
Langevin equation governing aerosol dispersion based on a single correlation time allows us tomodel the airborne transmission risk of pathogens, indoors and outdoors. The results obtained in
this study have been used to provide public health policy recommendations to prevent transmission
in shopping malls.

I. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of offering experimental physics courses
online during the COVID-19 pandemic motivated the fol-
lowing question: can students learn experimental techniques
during lockdowns while simultaneously working to reduce
viral transmission risk indoors? A group of students studying
experimental physics at our university worked on several
projects to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-
CoV-2, including the ﬁltration efﬁciency of face masks, thecalibration of CO
2sensors using candles or dry ice in a
closed transparent box, and the analysis of epidemic data.
We report here the work on a project to understand the dis-
persion of viral particles both indoors and outdoors. This
project has required a detailed understanding of both diffu-
sion processes and turbulent ﬂows.
However, turbulence is not an easy subject to teach. At the
undergraduate level, topics in ﬂuid mechanics mainly
include hydrostatics, potential laminar ﬂows, and viscous
ﬂows. The concept of turbulence appears when teaching thedrag force exerted on a moving spherical solid as a function
of the Reynolds number (see, e.g., Ref. 1). In this approach,
one of the fundamental aspects of turbulence, namely, space
and time ﬂuctuations, is bypassed. Here, we show that turbu-
lence can be taught by considering the dispersion of particles
in a regime where concentration is low enough that it acts as
a passive scalar ﬁeld; that is, the concentration has no
dynamical effect on the ﬂow. We treat this dispersion theo-
retically in Sec. IIand also present very simple experiments.
In Sec. III, we make use of controlled experiments per-
formed both in a small wind tunnel used for pedagogical pur-poses, using a fog of oil droplets, and in the large corridors
of two shopping malls under various ventilation conditionsusing CO
2. We show that the concentration decays faster
than expected by the turbulent dispersion theory of Taylor,2
following instead a ballistic law. Indeed, introducing a single
velocity decorrelation time provides a perfect ﬁt to the data.
This suggests, as shown previously by Villermaux et al. ,3,4
that concentration ﬂuctuations bypass the turbulent cascade:
diffusion does not follow a continuous process starting from
the injection scale and down to the dissipation scale.5The
Kolmogorov scaling law is not observed. The work pre-sented here can be used to introduce students to the turbulent
dispersion not only of pollutant molecules but also of aero-
sols. We ﬁnally discuss the relevance of the results to the air-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has motivatedthis research. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through
the airborne route:
6infection happens when a susceptible
person inhales viral particles emitted by another infected per-son. In between their respective respiratory tracts, the air car-
rying viral particles is gradually diluted by turbulent
dispersion. Near an emitter, the concentration of viral par-ticles is, therefore, higher than far away, which has implica-
tions on the airborne transmission risk.
II. TURBULENT DISPERSION OF PARTICLES
A. Brownian motion
We ﬁrst consider the one-dimensional diffusive transport of a
particle of diameter d,m a s s m, and density q
pin a gas of viscos-
itygwithout turbulence. The force exerted by the gas on the
particle can be decomposed into two parts: the average hydrody-namic Stokes
1force/C03pgdvand a noise7CðtÞ, which describes
the thermal ﬂuctuations around this average. The particle
dynamics is described by the Langevin equation

sSvþCðtÞwith sS¼qpd2=18g; (1)
where the damping term is the Stokes force, rewritten after
introducing the Stokes time sS, which is the particle velocity
response time to a force. CðtÞis only known statistically as it
results from the random collisions of gas molecules with the
particle, which are uncorrelated. Therefore, we deﬁne theensemble average
/C1as the average over many realizations of
the motion with different values of the noise. The noise is
Gaussian, has zero mean, and is d-correlated in time7
CðtÞ¼0;CðtÞCðt0Þ¼qdðt/C0t0Þ; (2)
where dstands for the Dirac delta function.
Equation (1)is a linear relaxation equation: the homoge-
neous solution decays to zero at times much longer than therelaxation time s
S. Particle inertia, which drives the homoge-
neous solution, can, therefore, be neglected in the t/C29sS
limit. In this overdamped case, the particle velocity is
directly proportional to the noise force: vðtÞ¼sSCðtÞ=m.
The noise does not induce any average motion: vðtÞ¼0.
However, as the velocities are d-correlated in time, the parti-
cle diffuses around its initial position xðt¼0Þ¼0 with a
mean squared displacement r2

B. Turbulent diffusion
We focus here on the motion of particles transported by a
turbulent air ﬂow of mean velocity /C22ualong the xaxis in
cylindrical coordinates ðr;h;xÞ.Ldenotes the typical large-
scale length, which is in our case set by the transverse
dimensions of the space. The Reynolds number Re compares
inertia with viscous effects

/C23; (5)
with /C23being the kinematic viscosity of air. When Re is large
enough, typically above 103, the ﬂuid motion given by the
Eulerian velocity ﬁeld uðr;tÞbecomes unsteady, chaotic,
and irregular. We, therefore, treat this ﬁeld statistically byusing the Reynolds decomposition: we split uinto its ensem-
ble average /C22u, which is a drift velocity, and its ﬂuctuating
part with zero mean u
0, i.e., u¼/C22uþu0.10Likewise, we
decompose the particle velocities vinto /C22vandv0. The typical
particle ﬂuctuating velocity rVis the root mean squared ﬂuc-
tuating velocity r2
V/C17v02.It has been argued in a pioneering article by Taylor2pub-
lished one century ago that turbulent dispersion, induced bythe random velocity ﬂuctuations, is diffusive. The particledynamical equation reads
m_v¼/C0
m
sSv/C0uðrÞ ðÞ : (6)
The thermal noise Cof Eq. (1)is negligible compared to tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations. Likewise, we neglect particle inertia fortimescales longer than s
S, which is the case if the particles
are light enough. Particles, therefore, move with the ﬂuid:
/C22v¼/C22uandv0¼u0so that their velocity correlation functions
are the same: v0ðtÞv0ðtþsÞ¼u0ðtÞu0ðtþsÞ. As the ﬂuctuat-
ing velocity u0acts as a noise, Taylor’s picture of turbulent
diffusion is a Brownian-like motion analogous to moleculardiffusion. The turbulent kinetic energy plays the role oftemperature.
We assume that longitudinal diffusion along the direction
of the average air ﬂow is negligible compared to advectivetransport, and we inject many particles at the origin withmass rate _m. Turbulent dispersion, therefore, only creates a
transverse mean squared displacement r
Rwith zero mean.
As the individual particle probability distributions are identi-
cally distributed, the probability of ﬁnding a particle at trans-verse radial position rwill be Gaussian, according to the
central limit theorem, i.e., proportional to exp ð/C0r

In the turbulent regime, the velocity uof an elementary
volume of ﬂuid, followed along its Lagrangian path, remains
correlated at short times.5,11,12The velocity of a transported
particle is, therefore, correlated as well, which leads to ananomalous diffusion at short distances. Because the particleshave negligible inertia, their velocities are the ﬂuid veloci-ties: velocity correlation results from the underlying ﬂowstructure driving their motion rather than from the particledynamics. On a phenomenological ground, the simplest
hypothesis would be to assume that the velocity ﬂuctuation
is a low-pass ﬁltered noise associated with a typical relaxa-tion time T. We assume that an elementary volume of ﬂuid
follows a Langevin equation of the type of Eq. (1)driven by
a white noise with a linear friction term and including inertia.The particle velocity correlation, which is equal to the ﬂuidvelocity correlation, is not a Dirac das previously but decays
exponentially

III. EXPERIMENTS
A. Field experimental setup
We performed “ﬁeld” experiments in the large corridors
of two commercial malls and of our university during lock-down, while they were empty. The experimental setup is
schematized in Fig. 1. A controlled CO
2source of constant
mass rate _mwas obtained by sublimating dry ice sticks in an
open cylindrical container of diameter 20 cm heated by a
power controlled hot plate. The source was positioned at
height 1.1 m above the ground. The imposed sublimationrate, measured using a scale, was equal to _m¼1:5g=s. This
rate was chosen to measure CO
2concentrations with high
relative accuracy without saturating the sensors.Our initial motivation was to characterize the dispersion
of breath in public spaces. The source used generated CO 2at
about 150 times the exhalation rate of an adult at rest. Thisincreased generation rate does not change the dispersionequations as the measured CO
2concentration is still very
small in the 10/C05/C010/C04volume fraction range. The experi-
ment had been designed believing that the turbulent disper-sion would be statistically isotropic, as expected for aneffective diffusion caused by large scale incoherent turbulentmotion.
14Instead, our preliminary observations using a
source of micron-sized glycerol/water droplets showed thatin most large public spaces, there are air drafts causing bulk
horizontal transport and biased dispersion. After identiﬁca-
tion of the mean air ﬂow direction, non-dispersive infrared(NDIR) CO
2sensors were placed downstream from the
source. They recorded the CO 2concentration /C22Cover the
duration of each experiment around 30 min. The initial andﬁnal values of /C22Cwere used to determine the background
CO
2level Ce.
After an initial short transient time, a concentration ﬁeld
in a statistically steady state was established. CO 2concentra-
tion in excess was measured in eight different locations. Thedraft wind velocity was measured using a hot-wire anemom-eter. It ranged from 0.1 to 2 m =s depending on the location.
The ﬂow Reynolds number Re ¼/C22uL=/C23was between 10
5and
106with L’1 m, the typical corridor scale. Measurements
were done with different ventilation ﬂow rates and recycledair fractions; the use of ﬁre safety ventilation, namely,mechanical smoke extractors and smoke vents, was testedwhen available. Measurements were performed withentrance doors both open and closed as open doors createlarge drafts in some locations. Control sensors (not shown inFig. 1) placed immediately upstream to the left and to the
right of the source showed no concentration increase: con-vection dominated over turbulent diffusion.
B. Field results
The concentration measured by each sensor ﬂuctuates
over time during the experiment. The sensor response time,around a minute, is much longer than typical turbulent timescales. Noise in the concentration signal only comes fromsmall ﬂuctuations in the wind direction, which tilt around thedispersion cone. To remove these ﬂuctuations, concentrationsignals for each sensor are averaged over the fraction of time
during which the air ﬂow is reasonably aligned with the sen-
sor axis. We consider the two to be aligned when the concen-tration stays close to its maximum value for that particularsensor for a few minutes. This is the case for about 40% ofthe duration of each sensor signal. Figure 2shows that /C22C
decays spatially typically as x
/C02. The mass conservation
equation provides the scaling law
qCO2ð/C22C/C0CeÞ/C22vr2
R/C24_m; (13)
where qCO2¼1:83 kg =m3is the density of sublimated CO 2.
In Fig. 2, the CO 2concentration is rescaled by _m=qCO2/C22vand
plotted as a function of space x. The reasonable collapse
between data shows that the CO 2concentration is propor-
tional to the inverse wind velocity /C22v. The fraction of fresh air
injected in the ventilation system had no effect on the mea-sured concentrations: in practice, only the local airﬂow dis-perses CO
2. In other words, the airﬂow induced to renew air
is negligible in comparison to natural air drafts.Fig. 1. Schematic of the experimental setup used to measure the turbulent
dispersion of contaminants. Dry ice sticks stored in an open cylindrical con-
tainer are sublimated using a hot plate. The gas produced is convected down-
stream by the small draft blowing in the corridor where the CO 2
concentration is recorded. The scale measures the mass injection rate _m. (a)

The decay of /C22C/C0Ceis consistent with the overall conical
shape of the dispersion zone in the ballistic regime given inEq.(12). We can parametrize the dilution by

lent ﬂuctuation rate rV=/C22v.W eﬁ n d a¼0:35 m, which is close

We have also included in Fig. 2the CO 2concentration in the
wake of a volunteer breathing through the mouth in a fan-induced wind of velocity /C22v¼0:3m=s. We ﬁnd a/C250:27 m
and a slightly higher ﬂuctuation rate a¼0:14 in that case.
The ﬂuctuation rate depends on the processes creating the
mean ﬂow (fans, natural indoor air drafts, wind outdoors) andthe geometry, as obstacles upstream destabilize the ﬂow andcreate larger ﬂuctuations.
C. Wind tunnel setup
In order to better characterize the turbulent transport at
play, we studied after lockdown the dispersion of a fog com-
posed of micrometer-sized oil droplets in a small wind tunnel
used for experimental physics student projects, schematizedin Fig. 3. The 120 /C223/C223 cm
3test section is illuminated
from above by a LED array with a diffuser. A turbulencegenerating grid (3 /C23 grid of 7 /C27c m
2separated by 1 cm
wide bars) is inserted immediately after the air inlet contrac-
tion section. /C22uis measured with a hot-wire anemometer
(testo 405i). We estimate the ﬂow Reynolds number /C22uL=/C23
with Lbeing the grid mesh size to be between 105and 106—
as in the ﬁeld experiments. Oil vapor is injected at a con-trolled rate through a 6 mm nozzle heated by a resistor at acontrolled power. A fog of droplets nucleates at few milli-meters downstream. The fog is made dilute enough so that
double scattering is negligible, and the light intensity scat-
tered is proportional to the local drop concentration. Wequalitatively check the dilution by putting the light behindthe tunnel rather than above. High resolution pictures with a
1 or 2 s exposure time are taken with a Digital Single-LensReﬂex camera (Nikon D800). A series of ten pictures underthe same conditions is averaged to achieve a satisfying statis-tical convergence. The mean green channel from the pictures
in raw format is used to measure the light intensity. The
image of the tunnel without fog is subtracted to removeresidual background light. The light intensity proﬁle I
0ðxÞis
then calibrated by placing a diffusive black sheet inside thetunnel. I
0ðxÞis ﬂat along the tunnel axis, except at the start
and the end of the tunnel where it falls off due to greater dis-
tance to the illumination source.
The intensity Iðx;yÞof a particular pixel is an integral over
the z-axis of the scattered intensity. The concentration
proﬁle is expected to depend on the distance to the central axisin a Gaussian way: /C24expð/C0ðð y/C0y

D. Wind tunnel results
Transverse intensity proﬁles at regularly spaced distances
from the fog injection nozzle are shown in Fig. 4. As the
droplets are formed by vaporizing oil, the fog is hot and
slightly buoyant so the centerline y0ðxÞgets slightly shifted
upwards. The centerline slope, which is the transverse-to-longitudinal mean particle velocity ratio, is at most 10
/C02,
allowing any additional effects of this heating to be ignored.The proﬁles are nicely ﬁtted by a Gaussian, which leads to
the measurement of the three parameters of Eq. (15): the
concentration on the axis, C, the radius r
R, and the centerline
y0ðxÞ. Assuming that /C22vis constant along the ﬂow axis, mass
conservation imposes that CðxÞr2
RðxÞ/C22vmust be constant pro-
portional to the rate of emission by the source. Figure 5
shows typical proﬁles CðxÞr2
RðxÞ, which are indeed ﬂat out-
side the injection zone. It means that the droplets, once
nucleated, do not change much and keep the same light scat-tering properties; this validates the use of this measurementtechnique.Fig. 2. Time-averaged concentration excess proﬁles as a function of distance

ments were done at two different locations at the same mall. Red circles and

Figure 6shows various proﬁles of the dispersion radius
rRðxÞ. The dispersion of aerosols is signiﬁcantly larger with
a grid generating turbulence than without. In all cases, Eq.(10)provides an excellent ﬁt to the data within the scatter. It
constitutes a very striking result: a model based on a singlecorrelation timescale is sufﬁcient to adequately represent allthe data. At short distance x</C22vTfrom the source, the dis-
persion takes place in a cone: r
Ris linear in x. This contro-
versial regime has been explored in a series of recentpapers.3,4,15–20At large distance x>/C22vT, conversely, the dif-
fusion regime predicted by Taylor with a constant diffusivityis recovered, in which the radius increases as the square rootof time, i.e., xhere.
From each proﬁle r
RðxÞ, two quantities are, therefore,
extracted: the turbulent ﬂuctuation rate rV=/C22vand the cross-over length /C22vT, which is the cross-over distance between the
ballistic and diffusive regimes. These quantities are plottedin Fig. 7as a function of the mean ﬂow velocity /C22u. The ﬂuc-
tuation rate r
V=/C22vis independent of the wind velocity /C22u,a s
expected, and equals to /C247:5%. The cross-over length /C22vTis
very small when no grid is introduced at the entrance of thewind tunnel. It is much larger with a turbulence generatinggrid. It tends to a nonzero value as /C22u!0 and increases with
the ﬂuid velocity /C22u. The Lagrangian correlation length r
VT
increases from 0 :7t o2 :5 cm in the range of velocities
explored, which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the grid meshsize: correlations come from intermediate scale ﬂow struc-tures. The slope of the curve gives a characteristic timearound 9 ms, which is much larger than the Stokes time ofoil droplets, around 0 :3 ms. As shown in the discussion of
Eq.(6), this is consistent with the dynamics of particles with
negligible inertia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
simple mechanistic explanation to the observed dependence
ofTwith /C22u. This dependence is a near-ﬁeld effect of the
grid, which is why we have used a single decorrelation time,independent of /C22u, to ﬁt the ﬁeld data of Fig. 2.Fig. 4. Transverse intensity proﬁles Iat various distances from the injection
nozzle. Iis rescaled by the maximal intensity for x¼8 cm. The best ﬁt by a

the axis, the radius rRðxÞ, and the centerline position y0ðxÞ.

are slightly shifted vertically around 1 for readability. The two proﬁles col-
lapse on the same curve except near the injection nozzle, where oil drops
nucleate from their vapor. The nearly constant proﬁle shows that the droplets
do not change much in size during convection and dispersion. The varia-
tions, equal on both curves, are due to residual heterogeneities of light. This
validates the measurement of the concentration ﬁeld within a multiplicative
constant from experimental data.Fig. 6. Radius rRðxÞproﬁles as a function of distance downstream x. The
best ﬁt in Eq. (10)is superimposed, which provides measurements of the ﬁt
parameters rV=/C22vand /C22vT. The ﬁt by a model based on a single correlation

IV. RELEVANCE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE
AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION RISK OF SARS-COV-2
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the airborne route by respi-
ratory aerosols: droplets of mucus, ranging between 200 nm
and 200 lm, which can contain viral particles.6,21,22These
droplets are produced in the respiratory tract during normalrespiratory activity by various ﬂuid instabilities.23–25The air
exhaled by an infected person contains active SARS-CoV-2viral particles, which may start an infection when one of thevirions is deposited on an ACE2 receptor of the epitheliumand successfully bypasses the immune response. Infectionmay also start if virions deposit on the eyes. The probabilityof infection increases with the intake viral dose, deﬁned asthe amount of virus particles inhaled by a person, cumulatedover time. It, therefore, increases with the exposure time andwith the concentration of viral particles in the air.
26,27
The viral transmission risk by a given infected patient is,
therefore, determined by the concentration in viral particlesin the air inhaled by another susceptible person. This concen-tration is given by the rate of emission of viral particles inexhaled air and by the dilution of the air between exhalationand inhalation. In closed rooms, viral particles accumulate,and their concentration eventually reaches a steady statebetween exhalation and ventilation, which is the replacementof contaminated air by fresh air. This explains the largetransmission clusters in poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
6
The average transmission risk, uniform in space, can bedetermined by assuming that viral particles are well-mixedby turbulence. In that case, dilution is due to the natural orforced air exchanges with outside air.
26,27Near an infected
person, however, the concentration is much higher anddecays with distance, and the dilution from the exhalationconcentration of viral particles to the average concentrationof viral particles is controlled by the local airﬂow. The totaltransmission risk is, therefore, the sum of an average risk,controlled by ventilation, and an additional risk in the disper-sion cone of exhalations. Outdoors, in the absence of homog-enizing ﬂow, this short-range risk is the only transmission
risk. Respiratory activity, such as unmasked coughs and
sneezes, can create large airﬂows that dominate over thepre-existing ﬂow patterns. In that case, air is exhaled in abuoyant jet that gets gradually mixed at its boundaries as ittravels.
23,25Face masks strongly alter the airﬂow by blocking
the jet; small jets can remain along the nose and the cheeksif the mask is not properly ﬁtted.28,29The stopping distance
of a masked respiratory puff is around2920 cm; the more ﬁl-
tering masks make the puff stop earlier. Beyond this verynear ﬁeld distance, dilution is fully controlled by the ambientairﬂow, which is what we have extensively developed here.
Our analysis applies to any public space where either face
mask wearing is mandatory and there is a horizontal air draftor the air velocity is much larger than the exhalation veloc-ity. We have found that in large indoor corridors, the airﬂowis a horizontal draft with /C22u¼0:1/C01m=s. Outdoors, the wind
is also horizontal with larger velocities. Understanding thedilution in these public spaces allows us to assess their trans-mission risk, given biological data on pathogen contagious-ness.
26,27This is needed to ground infection prevention
policies on a solid physical basis, as some (such as the “6 ftrule”) are not (see Refs. 22and30for a historical perspective
and critical discussion). Exhaled CO
2is a commonly used
risk proxy in well-mixed rooms;26,27its spatial decay allows
for a simple translation of the short-range risk into anequivalent long-range risk. For the gentle draft of shopping
mall corridors /C22u’0:2m=s, the increase in risk at 6 ft corre-
sponds to a CO 2concentration excess of 50 ppm.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have investigated experimentally and
theoretically the dispersion of a passive scalar (the concen-tration of particles) by a turbulent ﬂow. This constitutes anaccessible problem to teach turbulence at an undergraduatelevel, combining possible experiments and theory. Using anysource of fog, a fan and a camera, the Reynolds decomposi-tion between average and ﬂuctuating quantities can be illus-trated qualitatively and quantitatively. The derivations basedon physical reasoning and dimensional analysis remain lin-ear and much simpler than attempting to solve theNavier–Stokes equation. While the Reynolds number depen-dence of the drag force exerted on a solid is useful to intro-duce dimensionless numbers, asymptotic regimes, viscosity,and inertial effects, as it is usually done in ﬂuid dynamicstextbooks (see, e.g., Ref. 1), the diffusion of a passive scalar
provides a way to understand the role of ﬂuctuations toenhance turbulent mixing. The applications to the dispersionof odors and animal olfactory search,
31the dispersion of pol-
lutants, or airborne viral transmission are immediatelyappealing to students.
