This note advocates for a pedagogical approach that illustrates
by a simple example how what appear to be classical mixtures
arise in a quantum subsystem of a purely quantum state. I show
below how measuring one particle of two entangled spin-1/2
particles yields an expectation value that takes the form of a
population average, hinting at the general principle that what
appear to be classical probabilities emerge from pure quantum
states. In contrast, the standard textbook approach uses the pos-
sibility that a quantum system is in an apparent mixture of clas-
sical states to motivate the density matrix without explaining
how classical mixtures may arise. Through a simple example
like the one discussed here, one may explain that entanglement
with the environment results in such mixtures.
The fact that mixtures are a general consequence of a
quantum subsystem is stressed by Landau and Lifshitz1“…it
would be quite incorrect to suppose that the description by
means of the density operator signiﬁes that the subsystem
can be in various Wstates with various probabilities and that
averaging is over these probabilities. Such a treatment would
be in conﬂict with the basic principles of quantum mechan-
ics.” This interaction of a quantum system with its environ-
ment is the basis of quantum noise2and decoherence,3,4
which are important modern topics for students to
understand.
This emphasis is lacking in the most-often used quantum
mechanics textbooks.5–12The simple two-spin-1/2 system I
use here can be found in the Afterward of the textbook by
Grifﬁths and Schroeter,13but the authors otherwise use the
standard approach. Only at the very end do they come back
to the state vector but do not show how the density matrix
emerges from it as a purely quantum phenomena. The
approach introduced in this Note avoids the density matrixaltogether, illustrating how the mixed state results directly
from the state vector. Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, and Lalo €e pre-
sent an abstract derivation of a quantum subsystem with no
simple example and do so only after developing the density
operator.9My suggested approach establishes the intuitive
foundations from the quantum perspective to motivate the
density matrix.
Textbooks start by introducing single-particle eigenstates.
Then, superposition states such as
jwi¼aj"i þ bj#i (1)
are introduced, where jaj2þjbj2¼1 and j"iandj#iare spin
states with spins 61=2, respectively. For the state given in
Eq.(1), the probability of detecting a spin up electron is
given by the Born rule,
P"¼ jh"j wij2¼jaj2: (2)Next, the expectation value is deﬁned. For the state given
in Eq. (1), the expectation value of operator Ais
hwjAjwi¼jaj2h"jAj"i þ j bj2h#jAj#i
þa/C3bh"jAj#i þ b/C3ah#jAj"i: (3)
The ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (3)include the coefﬁcients jaj2—
the probability of ﬁnding spin up electrons; and jbj2—the
probability of spin down electrons, consistent with the classi-cal notion of weighted averages. The last two terms come
from quantum interference, which can cause destructive (or
constructive) interference leading to an expectation valuethat is smaller (or larger) than the sum over the contributions
from each state alone. Alternatively, the cross terms that are
responsible for interference can be the only ones that contrib-ute when the “classical” terms vanish. The operator A¼S
x
is such an example, where Sx¼ð/C22h=2Þðj"ih#j þ j#ih"jÞ .
Equation (3)then has only nonzero off-diagonal elements and
yields
hwjSxjwi¼/C22h
2ab/C3þa/C3b ðÞ : (4)
Thus, quantum interference originates in the off-diagonal
elements of an observable and can be nonzero even when
both states individually do not contribute.
Textbooks then solve the single-particle Schr €odinger
equation for one-dimensional potentials and central poten-
tials, develop angular momentum and spin, and solve
the hydrogen atom. Subsequently, the density operator isintroduced. I propose that the two-particle state vector be
introduced ﬁrst to show how the density operator and mix-
tures naturally emerge for a one-particle subsystem.
The reader should keep in mind that, throughout this letter,
we are interested in the spin of one electron , be it the single
electron described in Eq. (1)or one electron that is entangled
with another one (or many others) acting as its environment,
as I describe below.
We introduce the two-electron spin state j"ij#i to mean
that the leftmost ket corresponds to electron #1, which has
spin 1 =2 and electron #2’s ket is to the right with spin
/C01=2.
The state vector j"ij#i cannot represent two indistinguish-
able particles because it uniquely labels each particle by its
eigenvalue: Electron #1 has spin 1 =2 and electron #2 has
spin/C01=2. However, the linear combination

makes the electrons indistinguishable (each electron is in
both spin states so cannot be uniquely identiﬁed by an eigen-value),15and expectation values are unchanged when the
electrons are interchanged. Though redundant, subscriptsthat label particle number are added for emphasis.
Interestingly, each term in Eq. (5)distinguishes between
the two electrons, yet when added together, the state j";#i
does not. At this point, the student learns that Eq. (5)deﬁnes
an entangled state, which cannot be expressed as a productof two single-electron state vectors jwi
1j/i2.
For the state given in Eq. (5), the probability that electron
#1 is in the up spin state Pð1Þ
"is again given by the Born rule,

where the bra h"j1acts only on the ﬁrst electron and the iden-
tity12leaves the state of electron #2 unchanged. So, when
operating on j"ij#i /C17 j"i1j#i2yields the ket j#i2. This is the
same probability as given in Eq. (2)when a¼b¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
—
the case where the superposition contains equal parts of upand down spin states.
Next we calculate the expectation value of a single parti-
cle operator that lives in the space of electron #1. This opera-tor takes the form A
1/C17A112, where the identity 12acts on
electron #2. With the two-electron state vector jWi¼j " ;#i,
the operator A1acts on the ﬁrst electron (leftmost ket in each
term) while leaving the state of the second one unchanged,leading to the expectation value

Note that indistinguishability requires hWjA1jWi
¼hWjA2jWi. Equation (7)with A1¼Sx1gives
hWjSxjWi¼0; (8)
which is different than the single-particle result of Eq. (4).
The parallel derivations leading from Eq. (1)to Eq. (4)
and the one leading from Eq. (5)to Eq. (8)tells the whole
story , as follows. Assume that a5b51=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
from here on .
Equation (1)describes a single electron in a superposition of
two states with equal parts of spin up and spin down.Equation (5)describes two entangled electrons, each having
equal parts of spin up and spin down. For both systems, weseek the properties of one of the electrons. In the two-electron case, the one being measured can be viewed as thesubsystem of the two-electron state with the other one as theenvironment.
According to Eqs. (2)and(6), a measurement of the spin
of one electron in both cases yields spin up half the time. Incontrast, the expectation value of the spin given in Eqs. (4)
and(8)is different even though in both cases, spin up and
spin down are found in equal proportions. This may appearpuzzling given that the particles are assumed to not interact.So how does the presence of the second electron affect theproperties of the ﬁrst one? The answer is through entangle-ment. All identical spin-1/2 particles, such as electrons, mustbe entangled,
16and for two particles when there are no otherdegrees of freedom, the spin part of state vector must take
the form of Eq. (5). The presence of the second particle
removes the interference contribution to the expectation
value, giving what one expects for a classical mixture. Thestudent should focus on these two parallel developments togain insights into how entanglement and superposition differ
with regard to the behavior of a single particle and how these
manifest in what is measured for that single particle.
Such simple calculations can be used as a learning aid to
appreciate the consequences of entanglement, to understandthe difference between superposition and entanglement and
to stress the futility of separating a system from its environ-
ment in the classical way with distinct and obviousboundaries.
Equation (7), though fully quantum in nature, hints at a
classical interpretation with half of the electrons in the spin-
up state contributing

to the expectation value and the other half of the electrons in
the spin down state contributing

Indeed, the introduction of the density operator typically
starts with the expectation value of the operator A,
hAi¼X
iwihijAjii; (9)
where wiis interpreted as the fraction of particles in single-
particle state jiiandhijAjiiis the quantum expectation value
of observable Afor a particle in state jii.
Prior to the formal introduction of mixtures, we are taught
that the state vector contains all the physics. Subsequently,
many textbooks motivate density matrices as a means fortreating classical mixtures using Eq. (9)as the starting point,
which throughout the narrative implies the need for auxiliary
information outside of quantum probabilities contained in
the “classical population fractions” w
i. This implies a hybrid
classical/quantum theory. Imagine Eq. (9)being the ﬁrst
introduction to mixtures.
The quantum origins of withrough entanglement with the
environment would be unapparent, and the student would beprimed for the population fraction interpretation. A smallnumber of textbooks, such as Grifﬁths and Schroeter
13men-
tion the two-particle example after introducing mixtures
with the density matrix, but do not follow through with thecalculations presented here, which is critical to getting thepoint. Use of the one-particle subsystem of a two-particle
quantum state prior to introducing mixtures, as done here,
clearly shows that the 1 =2 coefﬁcients originate from the
1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
factor in Eq. (5), which carries through to Eq. (7)
when evaluating the expectation value of one of the particles
in the two-particle system. Orthogonality between the statesin the environment as seen in the second line of Eq. (7)
removes the quantum interference terms to make a mixed
state.
This simple two-particle example instills the kind of
understanding held by experienced physicists, empowers the

novice to grasp the centrality of quantum mechanics, and
engenders an appreciation of how the density operatoremerges from a fully quantum system when we measure theproperties of a part of that system.
