We treat a horizontal oscillator damped by constant-magnitude sliding friction by extending the
analogy between the simple harmonic motion of a mass on a spring and the uniform circularmotion of a mass attached to the end of a string. In the presence of sliding friction, the motion of
the mass on a spring becomes the horizontal projection of the path of a mass attached to a string
winding around two nails separated by a well-deﬁned distance; this path is a spiral consisting ofconnected semi-circles of diminishing radii. This graphical analysis is very simple and
pedagogically useful. It can also be generalized to any oscillation affected by other forces of
constant magnitude but not necessarily constant direction.

I. INTRODUCTION
The standard presentation of harmonic motion in an intro-
ductory physics course begins with a mass moving on a
horizontal surface whilst attached to a spring. Under idealno-friction conditions, the mass performs simple harmonicmotion (SHM). The next natural step should be relaxing the
idealization of the system by adding sliding friction, but this
is nearly never done. Instead one usually adds drag, avelocity-dependent force representing the resistance of aﬂuid (possibly air). The resulting behavior is damped har-monic motion (DHM).
Up to this point, however, drag is routinely ignored in the
introductory course, even where it would be natural, as in
projectile motion. One common way to motivate its intro-duction in harmonic motion is to ﬁrst treat the vertical springsystem in which a block is hung from the ceiling by a spring
and oscillates vertically. When solid surfaces are absent,
sliding friction is irrelevant and drag becomes a natural con-sideration. However, the vertical spring system requires a bitof care because gravitation shifts the system’s equilibrium
position.
Some (admittedly a minority) of our more curious students
wonder why we do not also treat the apparently natural caseof solid-on-solid friction. Furthermore, once exposed toDHM, they sometimes ask whether a horizontal spring with
sliding friction also settles eventually at its relaxed length,
whether it requires an inﬁnite time to stop, whether its periodis affected, and whether it has a constant period at all. Thismotivated us to look for a simple approach to the horizontal
spring with sliding friction.
The oscillator with solid-on-solid friction has been treated
several times before.
1–7Unfortunately, most teachers seem
to feel that the problem is either conceptually challenging,mathematically tedious, or both. Indeed, previous treatmentsuse either work-energy considerations, in which every semi-
cycle must be treated independently and anew, or differential
equations that produce a split-function, and are possibly a lit-tle advanced for introductory courses.
In this paper, we offer an elementary treatment of the
problem based on an intuitive visualization of the solution
and analogies with SHM. Qualitative properties become
transparent, and many quantitative results can also beobtained easily. One important pedagogical advantage of
this treatment is in teaching the power of analogies. The ideaof using simple systems as analogies of more complex ones
is an important tool for any student of science. The present
approach is a very good example of how to analyze a muchmore complex problem (oscillations with solid-on-solid fric-
tion) by using only the solution of simple harmonic motion,
which is far better known and more accessible. We considerthis pedagogical aspect to be one of the important advantages
of our treatment.
We begin in Sec. IIby recalling the fundamental relation
between SHM and circular motion. Section IIIthen extends
this analogy to the case of an oscillator with solid-on-solid
friction and presents the fundamental visualization we apply
throughout the paper. Sections IVandVuse this visualiza-
tion to obtain quantitative results, including the number of
cycles the system performs before stopping and the time-
dependence of the motion. Section VIextends the treatment
to arbitrary initial conditions, which is much easier to do in
the present approach than in previous ones. Section VIIsum-
marizes the main advantages of our treatment.
II. HARMONIC OSCILLATIONS AS PROJECTIONS
OF CIRCULAR MOTION
It is well known that SHM can be viewed as the projection
of the circular motion of a “virtual” mass mattached to a
string of length A, and rotating (counterclockwise, by con-
vention) at a constant angular velocity x(see Fig. 1), hence
the angle of the radius-vector of the virtual mass to the posi-tivex-axis is /ðtÞ¼xt.
The horizontal component of the centripetal force is
F
x¼mx2Acos/ðtÞ¼mx2xðtÞ, which is identical to the
force of a horizontal spring, hence the horizontal projectionof the circular motion is a SHM, i.e.,
xðtÞ¼Acos/ðtÞ¼AcosxtðÞ: (1)
We will make an important analogy with the vertical
spring, where gravity is an additional constant force. Theeffect is to shift the equilibrium point from the spring’s
relaxation point (the point at which the spring’s length is at
its unstretched value), by an amount

The visualization of the system is the same as before,
except that the virtual string is now attached to the equilib-
rium point, a distance Dfrom the spring’s relaxation point.
Note that the system’s period is unchanged

and the system’s motion is symmetrical with respect to the
equilibrium position D.
III. APPLICATION TO A SYSTEM WITH SLIDING
FRICTION
We now consider a mass mattached to a horizontal spring
of stiffness k. The mass is constrained to move along a
straight line on a horizontal surface with static and kinetic
coefﬁcients of friction lsandlk, respectively. We have as
usual lk<ls. For simplicity, we assume here that the mass
is initially at rest and the spring is stretched in the positive
direction by some amount x0(see Sec. VIfor the general
case).
We must distinguish two cases, as in all motions contain-
ing sliding friction:
Case 1 . Static friction overcomes the elastic force.
This happens if
kjx0j<lsmg: (4)
Deﬁning
Ds¼lsmg
k; (5)
we see that if jx0j<Ds, the system remains at rest and no
oscillations occur.
Case 2 . Elastic force overcomes static friction.
Ifjx0j>Ds, the mass begins to move and friction
becomes kinetic. Under our assumption of an initial stretch,the motion begins in the negative direction and the total
force is
F¼/C0kxþl
kmg: (6)This has the form of the force in a vertical spring system.
By analogy, the resulting motion is simply harmonic around
a new “equilibrium” point
x¼Dk¼lkmg
k: (7)
It is non-trivial but clear that, as in the case of the vertical
spring, the time between extremal positions (local maximaand minima of the position) remains unchanged from thefrictionless case, Eq. (3). This is not the case, for example, in
DHM, where that time, although constant, is different from
the undamped case.
From the analysis of the vertical spring system, the initial
motion of the spring with sliding friction is the x-projection
of a uniform circular motion centered on the point x¼D
k,
with radius A0¼x0/C0Dk. To visualize this easily, we imag-
ine a virtual string, stretched along the positive x-axis, and
ﬁxed with a nail at the point x¼Dk. (Alternatively, one can
also imagine the string to be ﬁxed at the origin and merelypassing under the nail at x¼D
k.) The string rotates counter-
clockwise at a constant speed and traces a circular arc until
it is horizontal again, and the mass is at the pointx
1¼Dk/C0A0. As long as jx1j>Ds, the block will move
again, this time in the positive direction. Friction reversesdirection, and the total force is now
F¼/C0kx/C0l
kmg: (8)
This force describes a SHM, but the “equilibrium” point is
shifted to x¼/C0Dk, as seen in Fig. 2.
It is at this point that usual treatments become disjointed,
treating the next leg of the motion as a separate problemfrom the ﬁrst. The graphical analogy of a winding string thatwe present here offers, by contrast, an appealing alternativein which the motion is seen to be one continuous process. To
see how, imagine that we have a second nail driven at the
point x¼/C0D
k. When the mass reaches point x1, the string is
horizontal and touches that nail. As the string continues torotate, the second nail now serves as a new pivot aroundwhich the string starts winding. The next phase of the motion
is, thus, clear: it is another semi-circle, centered on x¼/C0D
k.
At the same time, the string is shortened, and the new radiusof motion is A
1¼A0/C02Dk.
The entire motion can, thus, be visualized as the projection
of a spiral described by a string wrapping itself around twonails hammered at x¼6D
k, as seen in Fig. 3. This is
Fig. 1. SHM as a projection on the x-axis of a uniform circular motion in the
x-y plane. The angular velocity of the circular motion is the same as the
angular frequency of the SHM. The equilibrium position of the SHM coin-
cides with the center of the circular rotation.

the corresponding SHM is centered on x¼/C0Dk. In both cases, ~xis the dis-
placement of the mass, and the magnitude of which is equal to the string’s
extension or compression relative to its relaxed state.

relatively easy to visualize, and all the motion’s properties
can be deduced from this picture with minimal calculations.
It may seem surprising that the radius of motion remains
constant during each half-cycle despite the presence of fric-
tion. In the string visualization, the radius of motion changes
abruptly and instantaneously at every turning point when themass comes to momentary rest. However, this is true only
with respect to the current center of motion. With respect to
the spring’s unstretched state (its relaxation point), the maxi-mum stretch and contraction in each half cycle are not equal.
Each turning point is closer to the relaxation point than the
last, in accordance with intuition.
IV. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Let us denote by x
0;x1;x2;… fg the series of positions
where the mass is instantaneously at rest, x0being the initial
position. All other xifg fori/C211 are the turning points at
which the mass changes directions and the virtual string
touches one of the nails and switches its winding center.
Next, let A0;A1;A2;… fg be the series of consecutive radii
of the semi-circles described by the virtual string. The ﬁrst
semi-circle extends from the position x0tox1. It is centered
atx¼Dk, and its radius is, thus,
A0¼x0/C0Dk: (9)
Thereafter, the string is shortened by 2 Dk, the distance
between the two nails, every semi-revolution. Thus,
Apþ1¼Ap/C02Dk;p/C210: (10)
Since the string’s length is ﬁnite (in fact equal to A0), there is
some deﬁnite pfor which Apbecomes negative, which is
impossible. Thus, the number of windings must be ﬁnite,
which means that the block will stop after a ﬁnite number of
semi-cycles, unlike the case of DHM where the number ofcycles is theoretically inﬁnite. Combining Eqs. (9)and(10),
we have that
A
p¼A0/C02pDk¼x0/C02pþ1 ðÞ Dk: (11)
Letpmaxbe the index of the ﬁnal turning point, i.e., the index
for which Apmax/C200 and the motion cannot continue. This
condition implies thatpmax/C21A0
2Dk¼x0
2Dk/C01
2(12)
or equivalently,
pmax¼ceilA0
2Dk/C20/C21
; (13)
where ceil ½/C138, the ceiling function, denotes the smallest integer
equal to or larger than the function’s argument.
However, although this sets an upper limit on the number
of windings, the motion may stop earlier. The reason is thatonce jx
pj/C20Ds, the elastic force cannot overcome the static
friction and the block will not start another revolution, even
if there is enough leftover string to apparently allow it. Theinstantaneous center of rotation shifts between D
kand/C0Dk
every semi-cycle. Since the turning points are measured with
respect to the origin, i.e., the string’s relaxation point, they
verify the relation
jxpj¼j xp/C01j/C02Dk¼x0/C02pDk: (14)
If the motion ceases at the N-th turning point, then the stop-
ping criterion jxNj/C20Dsimplies that
N/C21x0/C0Ds
2Dk: (15)
Since ls/C21lk, Eq. (15) is more restrictive than Eq. (12).
Based on the deﬁnitions of DsandDk, from Eqs. (5)and(7),
the motion stops at the N-th turning point, i.e., after Nhalf-
cycles, where Nis
N¼ceilx0
2Dk/C0Ds
2Dk/C20/C21
¼ceilx0
2Dk/C0ls
2lk/C20/C21

or

2Dk/C20/C21
¼ceilA0
2Dk/C0ls/C0lk
2lk/C20/C21
: (16b)
The last form of the relation is obtained from Eq. (9).
We can easily calculate the total distance traveled by the
mass attached to the spring, since every half cycle it goesover a distance of two amplitudes, i.e.,
L¼2X
N/C01
p¼0Ap¼2XN/C01
p¼0A0/C02pDk ½/C138 : (17)
This is an arithmetic series, so that
L¼2NA 0/C0N/C01 ðÞ Dk ½/C138 : (18)
In the last two equations, Nis given in Eq. (16).
V. DESCRIPTION OF THE MOTION IN TIME
The winding string visualization allows us to write down
with relative ease the time evolution of the block’s position
without the need for differential equations.
During each semi-cycle, the block performs a SHM cen-
tered on alternating pivots. The centers and amplitudeschange at every turning point. At t
0¼0, the block is at x0,
Fig. 3. The spiral-like trajectory of the virtual string is composed of semi-
circles with amplitudes Ap, each centered alternately on the “kinetic equi-
librium” positions 6Dk.
891 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 12, December 2022 V. Roitberg and A. Drory 891 04 October 2023 23:22:00
the ﬁrst point where the velocity vanishes. Hereafter, it
comes to momentary rest every half cycle. Since the periodremains constant throughout the motion, the p-th turningpoint occurs at
t
p¼pT1=2; (19)
where
T1=2¼T
2¼pﬃﬃﬃﬃm
kr
: (20)
We now write the rotating radius-vector of the endpoint of
the virtual string, around its instantaneous center
rðtÞ¼ Apcosxt;Apsinxt ðÞ p¼0;1;2;…; (21)
where the amplitude from Eq. (11)is
Ap¼x0/C02pþ1 ðÞ Dkfor pT1=2/C20t/C20ðpþ1ÞT1=2:
(22)
To obtain the actual harmonic motion of the block, we
project this vector on the horizontal axis and add the dis-placement of the center of rotation. Since this center alter-nates between D
kand/C0Dkevery half-cycle, we have that
during the p-th cycle,
xcenter ;p¼/C0 1ðÞpDk: (23)
Thus, the ﬁnal result is
xðtÞ¼ /C0 1ðÞpDkþx0/C02pþ1 ðÞ Dk ½/C138 cosðxtÞ
for pT1=2/C20t/C20ðpþ1ÞT1=2: (24)
This solution holds for p/C20N, where Nis given in Eq.
(16). For larger times, the mass remains stationary at its
stopping point. Our solution agrees with that appearing inRefs. 1,2, and 6but without the need to solve differential
equations.
The function x(t) is drawn in Fig. 4. The two dotted inner
lines represent the alternating instantaneous centers of themotion, x¼6D
k. Each extremum of the function (either a
crest or a trough) represents a turning point. The two dashedouter lines represent the positions x¼6D
s. When a turning
point falls between these lines, the systems stops.
From Eq. (19), the times of the turning points verify the
relation xtp¼pp, so that their positions are (from Eq. (24))
xp¼ð /C0 1Þpx0/C02xDk
ptp/C20/C21
: (25)
These are the crests (even p) and troughs (odd p) of the
graph. Notice that the envelope following these turningpoints decays linearly in time, not exponentially as found indamped harmonic motion.
We immediately see that the oscillator stops after a
ﬁnite number of periods, because when the envelopecrosses the horizontal axis, the amplitude of the motionvanishes. In contrast, the envelope of the damped oscilla-tor only tends asymptotically to zero but never actuallyreaches it, thus accommodating (in theory) an inﬁnitenumber of oscillations.Note that the distance from crest [trough] to the origin dif-
fers from the distance from the origin to trough [crest], thus
showing that with respect to the spring’s relaxed state, the
motion of the block is asymmetrical when it is to the right ofthe origin compared to when it is to its left. When measuredwith respect to the appropriate red inner dashed line, how-ever, the distances are identical. These are the amplitudes ofthe SHM with respect to alternating instantaneous centers,and this motion is indeed symmetric with respect to these
centers during each half-cycle. The changes in amplitudes
with respect to the instantaneous centers of motion occuronly from one half-cycle to the next, each time the frictionforce ﬂips direction.
VI. GENERAL INITIAL CONDITIONS
The winding string visualization allows a simple treat-
ment of general initial conditions. We can represent the ini-
tial position x
0and velocity v0by shifting the initial
position of the virtual string along its circular path. Insteadof imagining that the virtual mass at the end of the stringstarts on the x-axis, we position it along an initial angle /
0,
as seen in Fig. 5.
As before, we assume by convention that the virtual mass
rotates counterclockwise along its circular path. Choosing
0/C20/0<2p, the relevant ranges depend on the signs of the
initial position and velocity
/0¼0i f v0¼0 and x0>0;
0</0<p ifv0<0;
/0¼p ifv0¼0 and x0<0;
p</0<2pifv0>0: (26)
For convenience, deﬁne the parameter

Fig. 4. The block’s position as a function of time. The pair of outer dashed
lines are the stopping borders at x¼6Ds. When the blocks comes to rest
between these two lines, the motion ends. The pair of inner dotted lines are
the positions of the alternating instantaneous centers of motions, x¼6Dk.
The envelope of the position as a function of time decays linearly and is
determined by the extremal points of the graph. In this graph, we took
m¼1k g;k¼10 N=m;A0¼1:75 m;ls¼0:3;andlk¼0:1.

where int ðÞis the ﬂoor function, i.e., the largest integer that
is smaller than or equal to the function’s argument. We now
have that
x0¼/C0 1ðÞgDkþA0cos/0;
v0¼/C0A0xsin/0: (28)
From this, we obtain the relations

Figure 5shows the spiral drawn by the virtual string under
general initial conditions. The string does not complete a full
half-cycle before reaching the ﬁrst turning point x1(the ﬁrst
point of instantaneous rest), which occurs at the time t1.
Since the string rotates at a constant angular speed x, how-
ever, the time at which it is horizontal again is easily found
to be

or equivalently,

T1=2: (31)
One of our visualization’s advantages is that a look at
Fig.5sufﬁces to see that from x1onwards, the spiral behaves
exactly as in the case treated previously. This means that the
next turning points t2;t3;… fg , all occur T1=2after one
another, so thattp¼t1þðp/C01ÞT1=2 p/C212 ðÞ ; (32)
and the amplitude of each semi-cycle is
Ap¼A0/C02pDkfor tp/C01/C20t/C20tp: (33)
In the p–thsemi-cycle, the radius-vector of the endpoint
of the virtual string is centered on xcenter ;p¼ð /C0 1ÞgþpDk,a s
seen in Eq. (28), and its value is rðtÞ¼ð Apcosðxtþ/0Þ;
Apsinðxtþ/0ÞÞ. The motion of the mass on the spring is
the projection of this vector on the horizontal axis with thedisplacement of the center of rotation added. The ﬁnal resultis
xðtÞ¼ /C0 1ðÞ
gþpDkþA0/C02pDk ½/C138 cosðxtþ/0Þ
for tp/C01/C20t/C20tp: (34)
This solution reduces to Eq. (24) when /0¼0, which
implies that g¼0,v0¼0, and A0¼x0/C0Dk.
As before, this solution holds for p/C20N, and the maximal
turning point index Nis still given in Eq. (16b) , i.e.,
N¼ceilA0
2Dk/C0ls/C0lk
2lk/C20/C21
: (35)
The value of A0from Eq. (29a) differs from the above treated
case, which is why Eq. (16a) no longer holds. For times
larger than tN, the mass remains stationary at its stopping
point.
Although the solution looks fairly elaborate, the virtual
string visualization makes its derivation quite simple, andthe meaning of each term is geometrically clear. This is agreat advantage over alternative methods of solution. Indeedthe general case has not been treated previously and to thebest of our knowledge, its solution is obtained here for theﬁrst time.
One can also reduce the general case to the above treated
special one by introducing negative times. Some studentsﬁnd this approach helpful (others do not, so it is a matter ofpreference). Instead of the actual start of the motion, t¼0i s
now considered the start of observation, which occurs whilstthe block is already moving. The “true” initial condition isagain taken to be v
0¼0 and x0¼A0þDk, as before.
However, this occurs at the time
t0¼/C0/0

in accordance with the visualization of the “virtual block”
moving at a constant angular speed x. The virtual block’s
radius-vector becomes a generalization of Eq. (21)

p¼0;1;2;…; (37)
which is of course identical to the above solution with a dif-
ferent notation.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the motion of a harmonic oscillator with slid-
ing friction is seen as the projection of a two dimensionalspiral motion created by a string winding itself around two

determines the initial position x0and velocity v0. The ﬁrst sequence of the

nails. This visualization permits a simple geometric analysis
of the oscillator’s motion, using only elementary algebra andbasic trigonometry, with no reliance on differential equa-tions. Furthermore, the treatment of general initial conditionsis incorporated with minimal changes, and a very minorincrease in mathematical complexity, which is a signiﬁcant
advantage over previous approaches. All simulations of the
motion presented here were made using the
MATLAB software,
which is an added pedagogical advantage, as it can be givenas a project for students to perform themselves.8
Furthermore, the whole visualization is extremely concrete.One of us (V.R.) built a physical model using only a board,two nails and an string, to show the behavior of the system.Students who actually hold the “visualization” tool in theirhands are inclined to play with it and try to extract moreinformation from it.
The visualization presented here allows the treatment of
any oscillator with added constant-magnitude force. Forexample, one can treat easily the case of an oscillator on an
incline plane. The added component of the gravitational
force represents a single shift of the center of the windingstring to a “gravitational equilibrium” position. The additionof friction to this case can now be easily accommodated byhaving two winding pivots placed symmetrically withrespect to the gravitational equilibrium position. Other gen-eralizations are possible, all using basically the same visuali-zation. This represents an important pedagogical message onthe power of analogies and their usefulness, which tran-
scends the speciﬁc system analyzed here to exemplify it.
