Toast always lands butter-side down. But before trying to
explain why, I should check whether : Is this old saying, often
cited as the canonical example of Murphy’s Law, even true?
King Charles II once called together the Fellows of the
Royal Society and asked them, “My Lords and Gentlemen.Why is it that if I place the same amount of water into eachof two pails, and then put a four-pound ﬁsh into one of them,this pail will not weigh more than the other?” After hearingseveral learned explanations, he told them that his claim was
false and that he was testing whether they followed facts or
blindly followed authority.
1
So, it is prudent to check claims from authority. In my
experience, toast usually does land butter-side down. A fewhome experiments that I tried just now also support the oldsaying.
2
Turning now to why the saying is true: The standard rea-
son is that the butter side is heavier, a reason that I hadaccepted for years. But having become paranoid about non-Newtonian thinking, especially my own, I worry. For thestandard reason subtly uses the F¼mvmisconception about
motion: that the slightly heavier, buttered side (more F)
wants to fall slightly faster (more v), so it eventually orients
itself downward.
A Newtonian analysis—one respecting F¼ma—would
be preferable. Thus, let’s look at the forces. While the toast,which I assume to be frictionless,
3slides off the corner of
the table, it experiences a gravitational and a normal force
(Fig. 1). The normal force’s direction is known: perpendicu-
lar to the toast. However, because this force is a constraintforce, its magnitude is hard to determine.
To avoid this problem, we could analyze the system using
torques and place the origin at the table corner. Then, nomatter the magnitude of the normal force, this force would
exert no torque and would disappear from the analysis.
Alternatively, we can use the Lagrangian. A convenient
coordinate system is polar (Fig. 2):hgives the rotation of the
toast relative to horizontal, and rgives the distance of the
center of mass from the table corner (how far the toast has
slid).
Then, with mas the toast’s mass and Ias its moment of
inertia (about its center of mass), the Lagrangian is

/C0V:(1)
In the kinetic energy ( T), the term with the I/mfactor is the
energy of the toast’s rotation about its center of mass. The
other kinetic-energy terms constitute the toast’s translational
energy. The resulting Euler–Lagrange equations are
€r¼r_h2þgsinh; (2)
€h¼rðgcosh/C02_r_hÞ
r2þI=m: (3)
Alas, these differential equations are coupled and nonlinear.
Terrible as they are, they apply only until the toast leaves the
table, which happens when the normal force is zero. But how dowe ﬁnd the normal force? In a Lagrangian analysis, constraintforces like the normal force can be hard to resurrect.
Fortunately, here there’s a trick. In the center-of-mass frame—
the nonrotating frame with origin at the toast’s center of mass—only the normal force produces a torque (the gravitational force
Fig. 1. Freebody diagram of the toast as it slides off the table (ignoring fric-
tion). It experiences the gravitational force at its center of mass and a normal
force where it touches the table. The normal force is perpendicular to the
toast and to the table. The table corner is drawn with exaggerated roundness
to show how the normal force can be perpendicular to both toast and table.

ner: rmeasures how far the toast has slid past the corner, and hmeasures
how much the toast has rotated (clockwise) about its center of mass.

acts at the origin). This torque, TCM, produces the toast’s angular
acceleration ( €h) according to
TCM¼I€h: (4)
(This equation holds even though the frame is noninertial!)
So, TCMand, therefore, the normal force are zero when
€h¼0. Using the differential equation for €h, Eq. (3), the con-
dition for the toast leaving the table is then
gcosh¼2_r_h: (5)
Once the toast leaves the table, the only torque about the
center of mass has vanished, so the toast rotates with con-stant angular velocity ( €h¼0) until one of its ends hits the
ground.
The while-in-contact differential equations, Eqs. (2)and
(3), cannot be solved, at least not by me. So, I simulated
them using a simple energy-preserving numerical integra-tor and treating the toast as a thin, uniform ruler (thetoast is 15 cm long, and the table is a standard 75 cm high).During the toast’s fall, it ﬂips onto its back, meaning thatit lands butter-side down (Fig. 3). Thus, the sad truth of
landing butter-side down is due only to the dynamics of athin, symmetric ruler and is independent of buttering thetoast.
However, Murphy’s law can be violated in the right cir-
cumstances. Based on the preceding dynamics, roughly howhigh should a table be so that toast lands butter-side up:1:5m;3 m, or 6 m? For the most enjoyment, write down
your educated guess and reasoning before reading on.A back-of-the-envelope answer begins with the idea that
the toast needs to rotate twice as much as it does when fall-
ing from standard table height (0 :75 m). While falling, it
rotates at constant angular speed, so rotating twice as muchmeans falling twice as long. In free fall, twice as long
means four times as far. So, the table should be roughly 4
/C20:75 m¼3 m high. This uncomfortable table height indeed
solves the butter-side-down problem (Fig. 4).
Returning to the regular-height simulation (Fig. 3): A
drawback of any simulation, as compared to a closed-form
analysis, is the difﬁculty of extracting meaning from the
results. The simulation shows us that neither butter nor F
¼mvis needed to explain the old saying, so we have extracted
some meaning. But the results still seem random. For example,
when the toast leaves the table,
_h
2/C2545:3928 s/C02; (6)
r2/C250:0014066 m2: (7)
These results become less random when we use dimension-
less equations, using a unit system in which I¼m¼g¼1.
This choice is equivalent to measuring lengths in units of thetoast’s radius of gyration

Fig. 3. Simulated fall of the toast showing the roughly 180/C14rotation. The
simulated toast, shown every 10 ms, is 15 cm long (with zero thickness) and
falls from standard table height. It starts at rest with its center of mass a hair
beyond the table. To make its orientation clear, I have drawn it with the
(original) left half in gray and the right half in black. When it has reached
the ground, the gray half is on the right, meaning that the toast lands butter-
side down.

/C14), as shown by the gray half being on the left side, as it was when rest-
ing on the table at the start of its fall. (To save space, this ﬁgure has been
shrunk vertically by factor of 4 relative to the true, 1:1 aspect ratio of Fig. 3,
but the toast is 15 cm long in both simulations.)

Theh02value has several zeros after the 0.2. Perhaps the tiny
nonzero piece that follows the zeros is an artifact of simulat-ing the solution approximately, and—as a conjecture—thetrue value are h
02¼1=5 and /C22r2¼3=4. I haven’t been able to
solve the differential equations in closed form to know for
sure (and salve my ego by blaming their nonlinearity). Butperhaps a sharp-eyed and sharp-thinking reader will spot aninvariant that decides this conjecture (without needing tosolve the equations)?

2The saying also gets overall, although not dispositive, support from theextensive home experiments organized by Robert A. J. Matthews, winnerof the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his paper “Tumbling toast,
Murphy’s law and the fundamental constants,” Eur. J. Phys. 16, 172–176
(1995). Matthews pressed into service 1000 schoolchildren doing 21,000
drops, of which 62% landed butter-side down with “[s]ome experiments
show[ing] an even higher rate of buttered ﬂoor[.]” See Esther Inglis–Arkell,

keep toast from landing buttered-side down,” Gizmodo (December 13,2011) <https://gizmodo.com/an-experiment-that-solves-the-worlds-most-

3The analysis in Darryl Steinert, “It’s not Murphy’s law, it’s Newton’s,”
Phys. Teach. 34, 288–289 (1996), assumes nonzero static friction and
(more questionably) that, once the toast begins sliding, it also leaves the
table. But the resulting equations can be solved in closed form. Meanwhile,
in my home experiments, oiled pens and rulers also landed butter-sidedown. So, an analysis assuming zero friction still seems valuable, even
though it leads to difﬁcult equations.

momentum and energy conservation to eliminate the time variable, getting
(nonlinear) differential equations for the trajectory itself.
