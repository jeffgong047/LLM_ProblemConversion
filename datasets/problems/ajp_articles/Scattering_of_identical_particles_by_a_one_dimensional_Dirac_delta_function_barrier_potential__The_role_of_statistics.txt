Scattering of non-interacting, identical bosons or fermions by a one-dimensional Dirac delta
function barrier potential underlines the importance of the role of statistics (that is, whether the
particles obey Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein statistics) in the scattering. We consider an initialwave function for the system that corresponds to one particle incident from the left and one from
the right of the potential barrier. For bosons, both particles are scattered either to the left or to the
right if the intensity reﬂection coefﬁcient is 1/2, provided the left and right propagating wavepackets fully overlap in the scattering region. For fermions, the particles “pass through” one
another, provided the left and right propagating wave packets fully overlap in the scattering region,
with zero probability that both particles are scattered to the left or right, consistent with the Pauliexclusion principle.

I. INTRODUCTION
In an introductory quantum mechanics course, students
often learn about the concepts of spin and statistics.Speciﬁcally, they are told that the wave function for a system
of identical bosons must be symmetric under the interchange
of any two particles, and the wave function for identical fer-mions must be antisymmetric under the interchange of any
two particles. Feynman et al.
1provided an elementary dis-
cussion of how the scattering cross section of two indistin-guishable particles by one another depends on whether they
are bosons or fermions. For non-interacting particles, exam-
ples are sometimes given in which the energy levels arecalculated for identical bosons or fermions placed in a one-
dimensional, inﬁnite potential well.
2On the other hand,
introductory courses do not usually include examples involv-ing the scattering of a pair of bosons or fermions by a one-
dimensional potential. This is unfortunate, since the results
clearly demonstrate the importance of the scattering ampli-tudes on the nature (bosonic or fermionic) of the particles.
Moreover, the resulting physics is qualitatively different
from that encountered in particle–particle scattering.
In this paper, we consider scattering of two non-
interacting identical bosons or fermions by a delta function
barrier potential. Instead of using a time-independent
approach from which the reﬂection and transmission ampli-
tudes could be obtained, we prefer to use a time-dependent
approach in which an initial wave packet is incident uponand scattered by the potential. This approach allows us to
explore the dynamics of the scattering. In effect, the delta
function potential acts as a “beam-splitter.” The particles areincident from opposite sides of the barrier. If the particle
wave packets do not overlap as they are scattered by the bar-
rier, the scattering is the same as it would be had the particlesbeen distinguishable—there is no difference for bosons and
fermions. In other words, although, in principle, it is
always necessary to symmetrize or anti-symmetrize thewave functions for identical particles, as long as the wave
packets of the particles never overlap, they can be treated as
distinguishable. On the other hand, the scattering differsdramatically for fermions and bosons when the wave packets
of the two particles dooverlap in the potential region. For a
50–50 beam splitter and perfect overlap, both bosons arescattered to either the right or the left, while the fermions arescattered one to each side of the potential. These results con-stitute another of the amazing predictions of quantummechanics. Even if the particles are separated initially by a
distance much larger than the extent of their wave packets, it
is still necessary to symmetrize or anti-symmetrize the com-posite wave function if the wave packets are destined tomeet in the scattering region.
The results of this calculation for bosons are fully analo-
gous to those involving Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interfer-ence
3of photons in an interferometric scheme involving a
beam splitter. In HOM interference, two single-photonpulses are sent into the two input channels of a 50–50 beamsplitter and overlap at the beam splitter. It is observed thatthe photons emerge in one or the other output arms of the
beam splitter—the probability to observe one photon in each
of the output arms is identically equal to zero, an effectattributed to the bosonic nature of photons. Analogous calcu-lations for particles, both bosons and fermions, were carriedout by Loudon.
4In his calculation, Loudon uses an input-
output theory of the beam-splitter involving creation andannihilation operators for the various modes, an approachwhich is used commonly in the quantum optics community.In contrast, our calculation is formulated in terms of
quantum-mechanical, one-dimensional scattering by a poten-
tial barrier. As such, it should be accessible to upper-levelundergraduate or beginning graduate students.
II. QUALITATIVE PICTURE OF THE ROLE
OF STATISTICS ON THE SCATTERING
Before launching into a formal calculation of scattering by
a delta function potential barrier, we consider ﬁrst the scatter-ing of two distinguishable particles (1 and 2) by a localized
potential barrier centered at the origin whose intensity reﬂec-tion and transmission coefﬁcients are equal (50–50 beamsplitter). This will allow us to understand the role of statistics

(that is, whether the particles obey Fermi–Dirac or Bose–
Einstein statistics) in the scattering process. In this section,we take the initial wave function for our two particles as
wðx
1;x2;t¼0Þ¼eik0x1fðx1þx0Þ/C2e/C0ik0x2fðx2/C0x0Þ;
(1)
with f(x) being a real, symmetric envelope function centered
atx¼0,x0>0, and propagation constant k0>0. One com-
ponent of the initial wave function is localized to the left of
the potential barrier, centered at x1¼/C0x0and moves
towards the barrier with average speed v0¼/C22hk0=m, while
the other component is localized to the right of the potential,
centered at x2¼x0and moves towards the barrier with the
same average speed. The function f(x) has been taken to be
an even function of xto ensure that the two components of
the wave packet would fully overlap at time t¼x0=v0if the
barrier were not present. We assume that each wave packet
component has a width that is much smaller than the initial
distance to the potential barrier and neglect wave packetspreading (see Fig. 1for the geometry). None of these
restrictions are critical to the calculations, but they simplifythe discussion in this section.
We will show formally in Sec. IIIthat, apart from an over-
all phase factor and neglecting any time delays, the wavefunction w

To go over into scattering by identical bosons or fermions,
we must symmetrize or anti-symmetrize the wave function.

For scattering corresponding to one particle incident from
the left and one from the right, this implies that the total scat-tered wave functions are

To arrive at this result, we used the fact that, for our speciﬁc
choice of initial wave packet and for fðxÞ¼fð/C0xÞ, the com-
bination wLLðx1;x2;tÞþwRRðx1;x2;tÞis symmetric under
particle exchange ( x1$x2), whereas wRLðx1;x2;tÞ
þwLRðx2;x1;tÞis anti-symmetric. This means that for bosons
only the LLþRRterm survives when we symmetrize the
wave function, and the particles “bunch” on each side of the
potential after scattering. For fermions, on the other hand,
the particles exclude themselves as a result of the anti-symmetrization and are scattered one to each side of thepotential. The results are represented schematically in Fig. 1.
We now carry out a speciﬁc calculation for a delta-
function potential barrier. We do not limit the calculation totimes t/H114072x
0=v0, enabling us to map out the time evolution
of the scattering process.
III. SINGLE-PARTICLE SCATTERING
Although the calculation can be carried out for arbitrary
1D localized potential barriers, we restrict our discussion toa 1D delta function barrier at the origin,
VxðÞ¼GdxðÞ; (8)
where G>0 is a constant that has units of energy /C2length.
The use of a delta function barrier simpliﬁes the calculationwhile still illustrating the relevant physics.
A. Eigenfunctions
For a particle having mass mand energy EðkÞ¼ /C22h
2k2=2m
with k>0, the two degenerate eigenfunctions can be taken
as5

, and the barrier acts as
a 50–50 beam splitter; moreover, in this limit, RðkÞ

the delta function potential centered at the origin considered
in this work, the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcientssatisfy6

At a given energy, the delta function barrier acts as a beam-
splitter, with the characteristic phase difference of p=2
between the reﬂection and amplitude coefﬁcients.
In some sense, wLðk;xÞcorresponds to a wave incident
from the left and wRðk;xÞcorresponds to a wave incident
from the right. If a convergence factor of e/C15x=2is introduced
into the wave functions for x<0 and e/C0/C15x=2forx>0, with
/C15>0, one can show that the wave functions are both orthog-
onal and (delta-function) normalized; that is,

B. Scattering
One-dimensional scattering of wave packets is a topic
covered in some introductory quantum mechanics texts.5,7
Here, we review the basic features of the problem. We take
as our initial condition
wx;0ðÞ¼eik0x
p1=4ﬃﬃﬃrpe/C0xþxLðÞ2=2r2; (18)
where k0>0 is a propagation constant. The initial probabil-
ity distribution jwðx;0Þj2is a Gaussian centered at x
¼/C0xL<0 and has full-width at half maximum 1 :67r/C28xL.

This wave packet is localized to the left of the potential and
moves towards the barrier with average speed
v0¼/C22hk0=m: (19)
At any time t>0, the wave function wðx;tÞcan be expanded
in terms of the eigenfunctions as

0dkULðkÞwLðk;xÞþURðkÞwRðk;xÞ ½/C138 e/C0i/C22hk2t=2m;
(20)
where ULðkÞandURðkÞare expansion coefﬁcients. The inte-
gral is restricted to positive values of ksince the eigenfunc-
tions wL;Rðk;xÞgiven in Eqs. (9)and(10) are so restricted.
Since the incident wave packet is localized to the left of theorigin and moving to the right, U
RðkÞ/C250:Moreover, the
e/C0ikxcomponent of wLðk;xÞdoes not contribute signiﬁcantly
to the expansion at time t¼0 since it corresponds to a particle
moving to the left. As a consequence, it is a good approxima-tion to expand the initial wave packet in terms of free-particle
plane wave eigenfunctions,

Although it is not difﬁcult to evaluate the integral in
Eq.(24) numerically, the wave packet evolution simpliﬁes
considerably if we are able to neglect wave packet spreadingand take the initial packet to be quasi-monoenergetic (condi-tions that are compatible, as we will see below). We areinterested in times of order t
s¼2xL=v0for which the scatter-
ing is complete and there is a component of the wave packetto the left of the potential moving to the left and a compo-nent of the wave packet to the right of the potential movingto the right. On this time scale, spreading of the wave packetcan be neglected if/C22hDk2

Using these expansions and setting the e/C0i/C22hk2t=2mfactor in
Eq.(24) equal to unity (neglect of spreading), we obtain

Equation (28) is intuitively satisfying. The ﬁrst term corre-
sponds to the incident packet and will vanish approximately
once the scattering is complete, that is for timest/H11407x
L=v0þ3r. The second term is the reﬂected packet and
the third the transmitted packet, both of which are nonvan-ishing only for t/H11407x
L=v0/C03r, that is, only after the incident
packet has reached the barrier. Following the scattering,
there are reﬂected and transmitted components of the wavefunction, each of which has the same envelope as the inci-dent packet (because spreading has been neglected).

IV. SCATTERING OF TWO IDENTICAL BOSONS
OR FERMIONS
We now extend the calculation to the scattering of two
non-interacting identical bosons or fermions, with oneparticle incident from the left and one from the right. By
“identical,” we mean the two particles have the same spin
and z/C0component of spin. We take as our initial wave

Theþsubscript is for bosons, and the – subscript is for fer-
mions. We have allowed for the distance from the origin of
the peaks of the initial left and right probability distributions
to differ, that is jwLðx;0Þj2, is peaked at x¼/C0xLwhile
jwRðx;0Þj2is peaked at x¼xR. One particle is localized to
the left of the potential and one to the right, but the compos-ite wave function is symmetric or antisymmetric on
exchange of the particles. To simplify matters, we have
assumed that the central velocities of the two components
are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction and that the
envelope functions of the two components are the same.
These restrictions can be relaxed without changing any of
the general results that are to be derived, but the resulting
calculations are somewhat more complicated.
The calculation then proceeds as in the single particle
case, and we ﬁnd

V. CONCLUSION
We have illustrated the importance of particle statistics
on the scattering of two identical bosons or fermions by a
one-dimensional potential barrier. If the particles are des-
tined to meet and overlap in the potential region, the overall
wave function must be symmetrized or anti-symmetrized to
properly describe the scattering. Aside from the pedagogi-
cal value of the calculation, it should be noted that the pre-
dictions of the theory for bosons are consistent with
experiments that have been carried out using single-photon
pulses3or a source of atom pairs.10In both cases, it isnecessary that the radiation pulses or atomic wave packets
that are incident on the beam splitter are indistinguishable.
This was achieved using down conversion to produce pairs
of single-photon pulses3or a He Bose condensate to pro-
duce atom pairs.10
