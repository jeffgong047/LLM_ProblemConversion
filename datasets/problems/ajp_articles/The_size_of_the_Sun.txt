Why does the Sun have a radius around 696 000 km? We will see in this article that dimensional
arguments can be used to understand the size of the Sun and of a few other things along the way.
These arguments are not new and can be found scattered in textbooks. They are presented here in a
succinct way in order to better confront the kinematic and mechanical viewpoints on size. Wederive and compare a number of expressions for the size of the Sun and relate large and small
scales. We hope that such presentation will be useful to students, instructors, and researchers alike.

I. INTRODUCTION
InThe Character of Physical Law , Richard Feynman
stated that “every theoretical physicist who is any goodknows six or seven different theoretical representations for
exactly the same physics. He knows that they are all equiva-
lent, and that nobody is ever going to be able to decide whichone is right at that level, but he keeps them in his head, hop-ing that they will give him different ideas for guessing.”
1
Following Feynman’s advice, we provide several differentexpressions for the radius of the Sun. More generally, thiswill lead us to expressions for the size of other stars andastronomical bodies like planets and satellites, and eventu-
ally to a discussion of size in a broader sense.
Many excellent textbooks review the multiple sciences
involved in the understanding of stars, their mechanics,thermodynamics, acoustics, the intricacies of radiative andconvective processes, the interplay of atomic and nuclear
physics, or the crossover between quantum and relativistic
phenomena. To assist writing this article, we principally usedthe book Stellar Structure and Evolution .
2These many
approaches cover widely varying scales and viewpoints, andthey can be followed quite rigorously in many cases, yielding
very good agreement with observations. The present article
proposes a walk through some of the most thought-provokingformulas offered by this ﬁeld in order to show how the differ-ent viewpoints are related, painting a kaleidoscopic answer to
the question: “what is the size of the Sun?”
Volumes have been written on the physics of stars because
each argument that we will highlight can actually be pushedto a high degree of precision through adequate considerationof the geometric and dynamical subtleties underlying them.
To enable a wide-ranging exploration in the short span of
this article, we will have to neglect these subtleties; we willrely mostly on dimensional arguments. Formulas that will bepresented have to be understood as approximate, neglecting
small numerical factors of order 1. For instance, we will say
that the volume of a sphere of radius RisR
3, omitting the
factor 4 p=3. Similarly, we will neglect careful integration of
spatially varying ﬁelds like pressure and density and only
rely on approximate bulk averages. At no point shall we ven-
ture to state exact results, so we have used the sign “ ¼”t o
stand for approximate equality, where others usually use“/”o r“’.” We have reserved these last two symbols to,
respectively, stand for scaling relations and approximate
numerical results. Thus, when we will say that A/B,w e
mean that Ais proportional to B, and when we say that
A’aua, we mean that the value of Ain units uais approxi-
mately the number a.
II. HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM
The most common way to approach the size of the Sun
and similar stars is to consider that it derives from an equilib-rium between two competing factors. The ﬁrst factor is grav-
ity, which tends to compress the Sun. It can be expressed as
a force per unit volume W(dimensions ML
/C02T/C02). The sec-
ond factor is the pressure inside the sun, resisting furthercompression. It can be expressed as a force per unit area R
(ML
/C01T/C02). From these two quantities, dimensions can
combine to produce a length
R¼R
W: (1)
This length Ris the radius of the Sun, understood as a ratio
of pressure and force density. This approach is generally
called that of “hydrostatic equilibrium,” because it basically
has the same form as the relation between the pressure insidea ﬂuid and its own weight.3This argument of hydrostatic
equilibrium ﬁrst emerged in the late 19th century in studies
by Lane, Kelvin, and Helmholtz.4,5The equilibrium can also
be written as W¼R=R, which relates the force density to a
pressure gradient, or as WR¼R, which relates the gravita-
tional inward pressure on the left to the outward pressure on
the right. The radius can also be seen as the result of the bal-
ance of forces WR3¼RR2. Of course, neither pressure nor
force density are homogeneous inside the Sun, so the quanti-tiesWandRshould be understood as giving average orders
of magnitude.
To evaluate the relevance of Eq. (1), we can express the
force density as the product between the average density ofthe Sun and the acceleration of gravity on its surface:
W¼qg. Using the experimental values q’10
3kg/m3and
g’31 02m/s2, this gives W’31 05N/m3.6Since the
observed radius of the Sun is R’71 08m, for Eq. (1)to be

valid would imply that the average pressure of the Sun is
R’21 014Pa. In practice, the pressure of the Sun varies
from about 10/C02Pa in its corona7to 3 1016Pa in the core, so
R’21 014Pa must be understood as a bulk average.6
III. SOUND SPEED AND GRAVITATIONAL
ACCELERATION
The hydrostatic equilibrium as expressed in Eq. (1)is the
archetype of a mechanical expression for a length scale. By
this, we mean that the radius R, with dimension L,i s
expressed as a ratio between two “mass-carrying quantities,”
i.e., quantities with mass in their units. In the case where the
force density can be expressed as a weight density W¼qg,
the hydrostatic equilibrium can also be turned into a purely
kinematic expression
R¼v2
s
g; (2)
where vs¼ðR=qÞ1
2is the “speed of sound” inside the Sun,
i.e., the speed of mechanical waves.3In this expression of the
radius, the terms of the ratio on the right-hand side do nothave any mass in their units. The dimensions of the speed v
s
areLT/C01, and the dimensions of the acceleration gare
LT/C02. Overall, the ratio v2
s=ghas the dimensions of a dis-
tance. Here again, the terms of the equation can be moved
around so as to gain new insight. For instance, one can notice
thatR=vsis the time required for sound waves to travel across
the Sun. According to Eq. (2), this time scale should be equal
tovs=g. We will shortly see how to interpret this time scale.
If the radius and accelerations are known, Eq. (2)can be
used to estimate the average sound speed inside the Sun, as
vs¼ðRgÞ1
2’41 05m/s. This value is indeed the right order
of magnitude of the bulk average.6,8
IV. THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANTS
We mentioned that at the surface of the Sun, the gravita-
tional acceleration is g’275 m/s2,y e to nE a r t hi ti s g’9:8
m/s2. This difference is due to the fact that behind the accelera-
tionghides the mass and the radius Ritself. Indeed, the weight
Fi¼migof an object of mass miat the surface of the Sun can
be expressed more generally from Newton’s formula as
Fi¼GMm i=R2,w h e r e G’61 0/C011kg/C01m3s/C02is the uni-
versal gravitational constant, and where M’21 030kg is the
mass of the Sun. Then, we can replace gbyGM=R2and
express the density of the Sun as q¼M=R3. By inserting these
expressions for gandqinto Eq. (2)and solving for R,w eg e t

If instead we express the mass in terms of the density, we get

: (4)
These two equations are mechanical in the sense deﬁned
above: they involve quantities with mass in their dimensions.
However, in contrast to Eq. (1), these equations involve three
rather than two quantities.V. SOUND/ESCAPE SPEED AND FREE-FALL TIME
To a gravitational ﬁeld with acceleration g¼GM=R2,o n e
can also associate an “escape speed” ve¼ðGM=RÞ1
2,w h i c h
gives the typical speed necessary to escape the attraction of a
body of mass Mand radius R. Coincidentally, this speed is
also the orbital speed at a distance R.E i t h e rw a y , veis the scale
of speed set by gravity. One can see that the escape speed can
be expressed as ve¼ðgRÞ1
2, which is also the expression of the
sound speed deduced from Eq. (2). Hence, the radius of the
sun can be understood as corresponding to the identity
between the sound speed and the escape speed, ve¼vs

This approach is usually associated with Jeans, who derived
the condition for a gas cloud to collapse into a star to be
ve/H11407vs.9
Now that we know that for a gravity-bound body at hydro-
static equilibrium, the sound speed is equal to the escape
speed, and we can give an interpretation to the time scale
vs=g. Indeed, since vs¼ve¼ðgRÞ1
2, then we can deﬁne a
time scale s¼vs=g¼ðR=gÞ1
2¼ðGqÞ/C01
2. This time scale is
often called the “free-fall time” and corresponds to the timethat a body would take to collapse under its own gravita-
tional attraction.2For the Sun, s’1 h. This time scale does
not depend on the absolute size of the object but on its den-
sity. Since the Sun and a human being have similar densities,
they would collapse after a similar time of one hour.
The radius Rcan be understood as the distance traveled by
sound over a time equal to s. Generally, we have
R¼vss¼ves: (6)
VI. SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS
Gravitation associates a special radius to any object with a
given mass. This is the Schwarzschild radius,10which corre-
sponds to the size of a black hole with that mass. For the Sun,
this radius is Rs¼GM=c2’1 km, where c’31 08m/s is
the speed of light. We can use Eq. (3)to express the size of
the Sun in terms of its Schwarzschild radius as
R¼Rsc2
ðv3
evsÞ1
2¼Rsc
ve/C18/C192
¼Rsc
vs/C18/C192
: (7)
In this identity, the dimension of length is provided by Rs,
and the rest of the equation is a dimensionless ratio built out
of the speeds vs,ve, and c. In the limit where ve¼vs¼c,w e
have R¼Rs, i.e., if the escape/sound speed is equal to the
speed of light, then the object is a black hole.
VII. SOLAR INTERNAL ENERGY
So far, we expanded on Eq. (1)by specifying the content
of the force density W¼qg¼q2GR¼GM2=R5when the
inward force comes from gravity. In contrast, we barely
investigated the pressure R; we just related it to the sound
speed. Density is quite naturally connected to a ratio between
mass and volume, as in q¼M=R3. In a similar way, the
dimensions of pressure suggest that it can be expressed as a
density of energy since ML/C01T/C02¼ML2T/C02=L3. Thus,
915 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 12, December 2022 M. A. Fardin and M. Hautefeuille 915 04 October 2023 23:22:20
one can deﬁne a solar energy as E¼RR3and express the
radius of the Sun as
R¼E
F¼GM2
E; (8)
where F¼WR3¼GM2=R2is the scale of the self gravita-
tional force. The second expression will later be useful. The
ﬁrst equation can also be rearranged to express the solar
energy as E¼Mv2
e¼MgR’1042J. As a comparison, type
Ia supernovae release an energy on the order of 1044J.11
If one uses the density q¼M=R3, the energy E, and the
free-fall time s¼ðGqÞ/C01
2, then the radius of the Sun can be
written as
R¼E
q/C18/C19 1

s25: (9)
This expression is reminiscent of the formula for the spread-
ing of an explosion blast in the Taylor–Sedov regime,12,13
which includes supernovae. Here, the free-fall time srepla-
ces the time since the beginning of the explosion. The size of
the Sun is similar to that of an explosion frozen at a time s
after ignition.
VIII. EQUATION OF STATE AND POLYTROPE
Note that Eq. (3)should not be used to infer that R/R/C01
4,
nor should Eq. (4)be used to infer that R/R1
2. Indeed, both
mass and density can depend on pressure. The actual scaling
between size and pressure will depend on the “equation of
state” of the body; i.e., on the speciﬁcation of an additional
relation between Rand q.3We will see later that in some
contexts this relation can be speciﬁed from microscopic con-siderations, but it can also be set phenomenologically by pre-
scribing that the equation of state be that of a “polytrope”14

where in the ﬁrst equation, the dimensions of the proportion-
ality factor KareM1/C0cL3c/C01T/C02. The dimensionless expo-
nent is usually written as c¼ðnþ1Þ=n, where nis called
the “polytrope index.” In the rightmost equation, we deﬁnethe proportionality factor in terms of a reference density and
pressure as K¼R

r. The polytrope is expected to be valid
in the vicinity of the reference values.
Using Eq. (4)in conjunction with the polytrope equation,
we can express the radius Ras

This approach is usually associated with Lane and Emden.15,16
We will now see that values of Kandccan sometimes be
computed from microscopic models.
IX. MICROSCOPIC DENSITY AND PRESSURE
Whereas mass and energy are typically understood as
“extensive” properties and depend on the size of the system,
density and pressure are “intensive” and are expected to be
independent of the size of the test volume. In fact, thisindependence of size only holds down to microscopic scales.
Let us call r,m, and ebe the size, mass, and energy of the
smallest scale where m=r3¼qand where e=r3¼R. We call
this scale the microscopic scale. For sizes smaller than r,
density and/or pressure signiﬁcantly vary from the macro-scopic values. Using Eq. (4), we can write
R
2¼e
Gm2r3¼r3
d: (12)
We know from Eq. (8)thatd¼Gm2=eis the size of a body
of mass mat hydrostatic equilibrium under its own gravity
and pressure e=r3. However, this size dmust be different
from r. Indeed, by construction we have r<Randd<R, and
Eq.(12) states that R2d¼r3, thus d<r<R.
The identity between the microscopic and macroscopic
pressures, e=r3¼E=R3is sometimes formulated as the
“Virial theorem”17
e¼GmqR2¼GmM
R: (13)
This equation relates the potential energy between the mac-
roscopic mass Mand the microscopic mass mto the micro-
scopic energy e. The energy eis usually understood as a
kinetic energy involving the sound speed ðe=mÞ1
2¼ðR=qÞ1
2.
X. MICROSCOPIC EQUILIBRIUM
In Eq. 12, both lengths dandrare associated with the
same energy eand mass m, but not in the same way. How
can one express the size r? Can this be done in analogy with
what we derived for the size of the Sun? Expressions, suchasR¼R=WorR¼E=F, are too vague to ever be false. They
owe their generality to their vagueness. If one speciﬁes themass M, or the force F,o rt h ee n e r g y E—or their densities ( q,
W,R), then one can express more detailed results. This is
what we did for the Sun, where the force comes from gravity.For the size r, we can similarly state without too much risk
that
r¼
e
f; (14)
where fis a yet unspeciﬁed force. The only thing we know is
thatf6¼Gm2=r2; i.e., the dominant force at the microscopic
scale is not self-gravity. Indeed, otherwise we would haver¼er
2=Gm2¼d¼Raccording to Eq. (12). Density and
pressure would be far from intensive. If density and pressureare constant down to a scale of size r<R, then this scale
must be governed by forces beyond gravity.
XI. ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUILIBRIUM
The dominant force fat scale rcan take many forms
depending on contexts, but one example has proven to bevery fruitful. This is the case where Newton’s law of gravita-tion(15) is replaced by Coulomb’s law of electrostatics (16)

916 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 12, December 2022 M. A. Fardin and M. Hautefeuille 916 04 October 2023 23:22:20
For the gravitational force, we assumed self-gravitation of a
mass Mand size R, as in the case of the Sun. For the electro-
static force, we assumed two opposite charges ne,w h e r e e
’1:61 0/C019C is the elementary charge and nis an integer.
The two charges are separated by a distance r. The Coulomb
constant k’91 09kg m3s/C02C–2and the elementary charge
can be combined into a single quantity S0¼ke2’21 0/C028
kgm3s/C02(no more units of charge). We then deﬁne S¼n2S0.
The number nis usually small due to screening between posi-
tive and negative charges.
Using f¼S=r2andr¼e=f, we can obtain the electro-
magnetic equivalent of the hydrostatic equilibrium
r¼S
e: (17)
In the same way that the energy Eand pressure Rwere left
unspeciﬁed in the gravitational case, here the nature of the
energy eis unknown. For the gravitational case, we used the
values of MandRto deduce the values of EorR. Here, val-
ues of randSwould be enough to deduce a value of the
energy eor pressure e=r3.
XII. ELECTROMAGNETIC KINEMATICS
The substitution of the electromagnetic force in place of
the gravitational force changes the deﬁnition of the kine-
matic quantities described so far. The formulas derived for
the hydrostatic equilibrium of a body under its own gravity
can be extended to the electromagnetic case by using the fol-lowing substitutions:
g¼GM
R2!S

v2
s¼R

v2
e¼GM
R!S
mr; (20)
s2¼1
Gq!mr3
S; (21)
Rs¼GM
c2!S
mc2: (22)
For instance, in analogy with Eq. (2)one can say that
r¼v2
s=g, only if the sound speed is redeﬁned as
vs/C17ðe=mÞ1
2, and if the “electromagnetic acceleration” is
redeﬁned as g/C17S=ðmr2Þ.
XIII. STONEY MASS AND PLANCK MASS
In the electromagnetic expressions, we have used the
radius r, mass m, and energy e, the same symbols we used in
Eq.(12) to describe the smallest scale at which density and
pressure are equal to their macroscopic values. How can one
be sure that electromagnetic forces dominate over gravity at
the scale r? Using Eqs. (12) and(17), we can write the size
of the Sun in terms of the size obtained from electromagneticequilibrium as
R¼ðSG/C01Þ1
2
mr: (23)This expression is legitimate if electromagnetism is the rele-
vant force at the scale r. The strengths of the gravitational
and electromagnetic forces can be expressed, respectively, asGm2andS(both with dimensions ML3T/C02). When m¼M,
the electromagnetic force is completely negligible since
GM2/C29S(1050/C2910/C028kg m3s/C02, assuming S¼S0). One
can then derive the mass mSthat would correspond to the
case where the electromagnetic and gravitational forces havesimilar strengths, i.e., when R¼r

: (24)
In cases where the strength of the electromagnetic forces is
well characterized by the value S0obtained for a pair of ele-
mentary charges, then mS’10/C09kg. This mass is called the
Stoney mass.18Thus, Eq. (23) can be rewritten as
R¼mS
mr: (25)
Similarly, we can write d¼ðm=mSÞ2r. Note that if a mate-
rial can locally deviate substantially from neutrality then the
value of SandmSmust be increased accordingly.
One can also deﬁne the ﬁne structure constant as a¼S0=
/C22hc’1=137 with Planck’s constant /C22h’10/C034kg m2s/C01and
reach
R¼a1
2mP
mr; (26)
where the Planck mass is mP¼mS=a1
2¼ð/C22hc=GÞ1
2.18
So far, we have used electromagnetism to derive a relation
between the macroscopic Rand the microscopic r, but we
have not speciﬁed any value for randm. From Eq. (17),w e
know that specifying ewill lead to r, but mseems relatively
free, as long as m/C28mS. We know from Eq. (25) that if the
mass massociated with the size ris much smaller than mS
then electromagnetism will be dominant over gravity.
However, other forces may dominate over electromagnetism,
in which case Eq. (25) or Eq. (26) loose their validity.
XIV. ATOMIC UNITS
A particularly interesting choice of microscopic size and
mass considers the standard atomic units based on the hydro-
gen model with one nucleon (proton) of mass m0and one
electron of mass me. This model is particularly useful for
stars since they are mostly composed of hydrogen. In this
context, we have S¼S0,m¼m0’1:7/C210/C027kg, and the
Hartree energy and Bohr radius18

where we used the electron mass me’91 0/C031kg. Note that
the ratio S0=/C22hhas the dimensions of a speed and is often
expressed as ac. With these units, pressure and density have
values comparable to Randq

expected to be the smallest possible size. The radius is asso-ciated with the following mass:

19who used these reference values in the der-
ivation of the maximum mass of stable white dwarfs (nowcalled the Chandrasekhar limit). The depth of these formulas
has been noticed on several occasions.20–23Note that

XV. FROM NATURAL SATELLITES TO STARS
Given how we crudely neglected numerical factors, R0is
not such a bad approximation for the radius of the Sun.However, there are stars with sizes smaller or larger than theSun, for which the mass mand energy emust differ from the
atomic units. There can be atoms larger than hydrogen, withm>m
0, and there could be atomic energies different from
Hartree’s formula. Deviations from the reference value com-
puted in terms of atomic units can be revealed quite strik-ingly by plotting the density M=R
3vs the radius Rfor anarray of astronomical bodies from natural satellites to stars,24
as shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen the atomic units provide
the size of the crossover between stars and planets, but stars,
planets, and smaller bodies can signiﬁcantly deviate from thereference point. Moreover, stars display a different trend
than smaller bodies.
For stars, the density usually decreases as the radius
increases. Whereas a star like the Sun has a density close to
that of water, stars a hundred times larger can have a density
smaller than that of air. This trend can be understood roughlyby invoking the Virial theorem in Eq. (13), which states that
q¼e=GmR
2. Thus, if the microscopic energy per unit mass
e=mis constant then q/R/C02.I nF i g . 1, the dotted line pro-
vides this scaling in the case where e¼e0, assuming m¼m0.
As is obvious, this choice of atomic energy strongly underes-
timates the density. The dotted dashed line gives a better ﬁtfor an energy e¼100e
0. We shall explain such difference
shortly.
For planets and smaller bodies, the density is roughly con-
stant, close to the reference atomic value q0. For the density to
remain constant for bodies of different sizes, the Virial theorem
imposes that the kinetic energy per unit mass should followe=m/R
2. This can also be stated as e=r3/R2,o ra s R/R2.
The smaller the size the smaller the internal pressure R.
The mass m, energy e, and size rof the microscopic scale
can be fairly independent from one another. The microscopicparameters can produce different types of pressure e=r

XVI. THE EDDINGTON MODEL
To give but one example of the ways in which the size of
astronomical bodies can deviate from the reference value, let
us consider the Eddington stellar model.25This model is
sometimes called “the standard stellar model,” and it is usu-
ally described in textbooks concerned with stars.2Discussing
this model also gives us the opportunity to underline the fact
that our approach so far has been a bit stereotypical of an
astro physical viewpoint, in contrast to the astro nomical per-
spective. Typical astronomical observations of stars rarely
yield their size or mass, the most common observables being
rather their luminosity and spectral characteristics. These
observables are then transformed to mechanical quantities
like mass, pressure, density, etc. The link for such a transfor-
mation is temperature.
In the Eddington model and others of its kind, the equation
of state relating pressure and density uses the star tempera-
ture T. In practice, the temperature varies inside stars from
the core to the envelope, and Tmust be understood as a bulk
average. Using Boltzmann’s constant kB’1:38 10/C023m2kg
s/C02K–1, an energy can be translated into a temperature using
eT¼kBT. In this framework, Hartree’s atomic energy would
correspond to a temperature T0’31 05K. Thus, for the stars
in Fig. 1, the energy e¼100e0corresponds to a temperature
T’31 07K, which is the right order of magnitude for the
temperature in stars like the Sun.6
Eddington’s model proposes that the pressure inside a star
be given as a ﬁxed combination of a gas pressure and a radia-
tion pressure, where the gas pressure follows the ideal gas
lawR1¼ðq=mÞeT, and where the radiation pressure follows
Stefan–Boltzmann law R2¼e4
T=ðc/C22hÞ3.I f h2½0;1/C138is the
proportion of thermodynamic pressure then 1 /C0his the pro-
portion of radiation pressure, such that hR¼R1and
ð1/C0hÞR¼R2, where Ris the total pressure. One can then
replace the thermal energy ebymhR=qto express the radia-
tion pressure as
ð1/C0hÞR¼R4
ðc/C22hÞ3mh
q/C18/C194
: (38)
This equation can be solved for the total pressure R.B y
noticing that c/C22h¼S0=a, the total pressure can then be
expressed as
R¼1
a1/C0h
h4/C18/C19 1
3m0
m/C18/C19 4
3q
q0/C18/C19 4
3R0: (39)
If one assumes that m¼m0and that his constant, then this
equation provides a fully speciﬁed polytrope with c¼4
3(and
references qr¼q0andRr¼ð ð1/C0hÞ=h4Þ1
3R0). With this
equation of state, the radius and mass of the star become

M0: (41)
Stars following this equation of state can have different radii,
but they all share the same mass. If one assumes that the Sun
follows such equation of state, it would imply that radiation
only account for 20% of the pressure. Note that this equationof state implies q/R/C03. The data in Fig. 1are closer to
q/R/C02, which can be interpreted by changing the propor-
tion of radiation and thermodynamic pressures as the size
increases. Arguments aimed at deciphering the value of hfor
different populations of stars usually relies on a decomposi-tion of the size of a star into layers (core, envelopes, etc.)with different amounts of radiation and convection.
Schematically, greater accuracy on the size of stars requires
their radius to be decomposed additively, for instance, asR¼R
coreþRenv, where the sizes of the core and envelop are
then decomposed multiplicatively as in the many ways wefollowed in this article.2This degree of precision goes
beyond our scope but is inescapable if one wishes to recover
the properties of the wide variety of stars in the cosmos.
XVII. WHITE DWARFS, NEUTRON STARS,
AND BLACK HOLES
All expressions of Rfrom Eq. (3)to Eq. (9)are essentially
equivalent, they just present the same relations under differ-ent disguises. All these formulas correspond to an objectbound by its own gravity, which is resisted by an unspeciﬁedinternal pressure R, which can be expressed as an energy Eif
need be. These expressions are expected to be valid for all
objects in Fig. 1. Actually, these equations are expected to
be valid for some objects beyond the range of the ﬁgure, inparticular, for stars outside the “main sequence.”
The stars represented in Fig. 1all lie on the “main
sequence,” where the internal pressure is some mixture of
thermodynamic or radiation pressures, well described by the
Eddington model. However, some stars are governed by dif-ferent types of internal pressure, which can lead to massesand radii lying outside the range of Fig. 1. Table Igives a
few classical examples, left for the reader to ponder.
XVIII. CONCLUSION
A diversity of “ideas for guessing” led us to more than a
dozen formulas providing equivalent approximations of thesize of the Sun. The size of the Sun can be seen as the resultTable I. Pressure and associated radius for different types of astronomical
objects beyond the main sequence of stars. For a given object, the various
expressions for the pressure are equivalent, assuming that the mass of the micro-
scopic scale is m¼m0. The ideal neutron star considers a star with a nuclear
density qn¼m0=r3
n’1018kg/m3,w h e r e rn¼/C22h=m0cis the Compton wave-
length of the nucleon, and a nuclear energy en¼m0c2. For the black hole of
mass M0, the density is qb¼c6=G3M2
0. We recall that b¼m0=me’1836 and
a¼S0=/C22hc’1=137.

of a balance of forces or pressures, or as the consequence of
an equation relating sound and escape speed, or as a frozenexplosion. The size of the Sun can be expressed in terms ofthe size of its equivalent black hole, or in terms of the size ofits microscopic constituents. We saw that some of these for-mulas also apply to other objects bound by gravity includingdifferent types of stars, as well as planets, and to some extentto microscopic objects bound by forces beyond gravity.
The gigantic gap between the microscopic realm of atoms
and the astronomical realm of planets and stars is quitedaunting. In this paper, we provided a few simple argumentsthat can help bridge this divide, demonstrating the stronglinks between the quantum microcosm and the much largerscales dominated by gravity.
The path we took to connect all these different formulas is
one out of many. Any written story has a beginning and an
end, so we had to start somewhere, with the hydrostatic equi-
librium, and ﬁnish somewhere else, with the Eddington modeland a table of additional cases based on different kinds ofpressure. The beginning was in no way a means to an end, northe end our goal. We invite the reader to explore their ownpath across the fascinating landscape of stellar physics, whichprovides an exciting laboratory for thought experiments aboutwhat we collectively mean by the “size” of something.
