The latest iteration of the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) pro-
ject, ChatGPT,1has attracted considerable attention in the
technology and education communities. ChatGPT is anAI-based chatbot that is capable of responding to queries,
writing essays (even poems), as well as “solving” technical
problems, including coding. ChatGPT is able to synthesize acoherent response, though incorrect sometimes, from a vast
data and knowledge base. At the moment, many in the edu-
cation community are concerned that students might use it tocheat, while others openly embrace its potentially productive
use.
2Regardless of where one stands, we believe the physics
education community needs to be aware of ChatGPT’s capa-bilities. In this letter, we describe our initial tests of
ChatGPT’s basic problem-solving capabilities. (Readers can
see the exact queries and responses in the supplementarymaterial.
3)
First, we asked ChatGPT this question (Table 1 of the sup-
plementary material3): “Solve the motion of a body on a fric-
tionless incline.” After typing the question in, ChatGPT gavea response outlining these key results: the force along the
incline F¼mgsinh, acceleration a¼F=m¼gsinh, plus a
kinematic equation for the position x. The free-response is
very clear and impressive. Even though we worded the prob-
lem vaguely, ChatGPT was able to parse the problem, inter-
pret our intent, assume variables such as gand the angle of
incline h, and give the most relevant quantity, the accelera-
tion. If this were an assigned class problem to be graded, we
would give
10
10.
With the same question, ChatGPT usually produces differ-
ent responses in separate chat sessions. It can also regenerate
different responses within the same session. We took the lat-ter approach to request another response (see Table 1 of the
supplementary material3). This response is quite different in
wording, but the results are broadly the same, giving the cor-rect acceleration along the incline. However, it also gave an
extraneous—and wrong—result for the acceleration in the y
direction as /C0gcosh. It is probably due to confusion of the
coordinate systems. This is interesting because sometimes
we do see students giving the right results for the wrong rea-
son. Still, we would probably give a
9
10mark.
Next, we tried a more speciﬁc variation of the problem
typically found in introductory physics and asked this:“A body is at rest on an inclined plane. The angle is raised
slowly such that the body is on the verge of sliding. Findthe maximum angle.” ChatGPT gave a straightforwardanswer: The maximum angle, h
max, can be calculated using
the equation tan ðhmaxÞ¼ls(Table 2 of the supplementary
material3). It is worth noting that ChatGPT apparently
“knew” well enough to infer that there was static friction inthe problem and correctly assumed the coefﬁcient of static
friction. This response simply gave the result but did notexplain the process. Impressive as it was, if we were to grade
it as an assignment problem, we would probably give
8
10for
not showing work or adequate explanation.
Because we have integrated computation into our physics
curriculum, we were particularly interested in solving the
problem with computation as well. So we asked ChapGPT towrite a
PYTHON program to solve it (Table 2 of the supple-
mentary material3). ChatGPT output a complete program in
real time— even with comments (see Table 3 of the supple-
mentary material3). The program consisted of a main loop in
which the angle is incremented in each iteration. At a givenangle, the parallel component of gravity is compared withthe static friction, and if the former is greater than the latter,
the loop is terminated and the angle is taken as the required
result. In addition, the program imported the math library,assumed the necessary variables ( m,g,l
s,h0,Dh, etc.), and
printed the ﬁnal result. We were pleasantly surprised, as wellas impressed, that ChapGPT created a “simulation” utilizing
an algorithm (rudimentary as it may be), instead of just print-
ing a h
maxvalue from the formula that we had seen in other
sessions. It would be worth10
10if graded.
While ChatGPT’s performance on these formulaic prob-
lems and coding was impressive, they tested a limited calcu-lational ability. Thus, we decided to test ChatGPT on anonformulaic conceptual question in quantum mechanics(Table 4 of the supplementary material
3). So our next ques-
tion was: “An electron is prepared with its spin in the posi-
tive z direction. After passing through a Stern-Gerlachselector in the x direction, what is the probability of ﬁndingthe electron with its spin in the positive x direction?”ChatGPT did not hesitate and gave 0 as the answer, citing a
nonsensical reason for the electron being deﬂected in the
6ydirections (see Table 4 of the supplementary material
3).

The answer is clearly wrong, because regardless of the spin
being in the positive or negative zdirections, the correct
answer in either 6xdirections is1
2due to equal representa-
tion in the superposition. Again, if the question was to be
graded as a class assignment, we would give2
10for effort.
Now, getting ChatGPT stumped and sensing weakness,
we decided to challenge its response. We followed up with
“We are not so sure. Should not the answer be1
2?” To our
surprise, ChatGPT backtracked totally, simply responding
with “Yes, you are correct. The probability … is1
2” (Table 4
of the supplementary material3). Further emboldened, we
next asked: “Actually, we think the answer should be1
4.”
Well, ChatGPT did not put up a ﬁght at all, repeating again
“You are correct, I apologize for my previous mistakes. The
probability … is indeed1
4”!
Based on our initial limited impression, ChatGPT seems
very impressive in interpreting simple physics problems,assuming relevant parameters, and writing correct codes.It did not do as well—in fact it was totally wrong—in
answering the conceptual question. Nonetheless, our limited
observations show high potential. The physics education
community is well-positioned to investigate the use andcapabilities of ChatGPT and other AI systems. For instance,
could the use of ChatGPT lead to more insight or better
learning outcomes? Hopefully, more careful and controlledstudies are forthcoming.

A revolution in physics education was forecast in 1989, why hasn’t it
happened? What will it take?

The potential impact of computers on physics education
was announced in a 1989 paper “Using Computers in
Teaching Physics.”1The paper is subtitled “Computers can
revolutionize not only the way we teach physics, but alsowhat physics we teach,” and begins:
The computer has revolutionized the way we do
physics, but surprisingly, it has not significantlyaltered the way we teach physics. Talks and paperson teaching with computers fill the meetings andjournals of the American Association of Physics
Teachers, and workshops on the topic abound, yet the
real impact of computers in the classroom is slight.
The beneﬁts of the anticipated revolution are described in
the section “Computers Change the Curriculum”:
We must engage students in the intellectual
process of modern physics much earlier in theirtraining. The microcomputer can help bring this
change about by permitting students to approach a
wider variety of phenomena and problems thanthey can grasp with only analytic tools, and byenabling them to understand those phenomena ona deeper and yet more concrete level.
What can we expect from a computer revolution in phys-
ics education?
Classical physics is based on the analysis of differential
equation models of physical processes. Computers revolu-
tionized physics because:
•Computers and computational calculus make it possible to
analyze analytically unsolvable differential equation mod-els of physical systems.

•The models of most physical systems are analytically
unsolvable.
•Computational calculus quickly became the norm for ana-lyzing physical systems outside the classroom.
Fortunately, and perhaps surprisingly, since analytic cal-
culus is so difﬁcult, the powerful basic method of computa-tional calculus is simple, intuitively transparent, and can betaught to high school science students in a single one-hourlecture.
Computational calculus removes all the difﬁculty of ana-
lytic calculus in the analysis of physical systems, as if bymagic. Poof! It’s gone! Projects that are beyond the scope ofundergraduate university physics programs become assign-
ments in high school physics, e.g., the Apollo trajectory and
several others described in “The Coming Revolution inPhysics Education.”

The computer revolution in physics education will have
two striking effects, both of which will happen overnight:differential equations will be taught in introductory physics,and the number and types of physical systems that can beanalyzed will explode.
This will require rewriting the courses in classical phys-
ics, introductory to advanced. “The Coming Revolution inPhysics Education”
2describes such an introductory course,
and I’ve taught the course at a local high school. A newdraft paper, “A New Physics Curriculum,”3covers systems
modeled with partial differential equations. The draft paperincludes analyses of systems in central force motion, elec-tric circuit analysis, rigid-body dynamics, heat transfer,wave phenomena, stress and strain in elastic materials,ﬂuid dynamics, and electrodynamics; results are shown inFig.1.
Prototypical systems in most branches of classical physics
are analytically unsolvable; computational methods maketheir analysis routine. Students will learn the methods usedfor the analysis of physical systems in science and engineer-ing today and apply them to a wide range of fascinating real-world phenomena.
