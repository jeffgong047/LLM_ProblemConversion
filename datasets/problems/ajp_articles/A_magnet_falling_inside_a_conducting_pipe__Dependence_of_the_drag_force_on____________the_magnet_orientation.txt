We develop a simple model to investigate the orientation-dependence of the drag force acting on a
magnet falling inside a vertical conducting pipe. We approximate the magnet by a point magnet andthe pipe by a two-dimensional cylindrical surface. Independent of the magnet’s orientation, the drag
force is proportional to its velocity: ~F
d¼/C0k~v. We show that the coefﬁcient k!of the horizontally
oriented magnet is about 2/3 of the coefﬁcient k"for the vertically oriented magnet. If the magnetic
moment makes an angle hwith the vertical direction, the drag coefﬁcient kcan be expressed as
k¼k"cos2hþk!sin2h. When the magnet falls with a non-vertical orientation, a local charge
distribution is induced in the pipe, which plays a role as important as that of the time-varying magneticﬁeld due to the falling magnet in generating the eddy currents. The model’s predictions are compared
with experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION
Dropping a magnet into a vertical conducting pipe is one
of the fascinating demonstrations to illustrate Faraday’s andLenz’s laws in the physics classroom.1Students are gener-
ally very impressed by a magnet drifting slowly downwards
through the pipe. As you will see, this provides a rich experi-ment, which can also illustrate how a free-falling object
reaches a constant terminal velocity due to the drag force it
experiences. The slowing down can be explained intuitivelyby eddy currents ﬂowing in the pipe along the electric ﬁeld
induced by the time-varying magnetic ﬁeld. These eddy cur-
rents generate a magnetic ﬁeld that opposes the motion ofthe magnet. A discussion on the conversion of gravitational
potential energy into Joule heating by eddy currents can be
another talking point in class.
Due to the difﬁculties in handling eddy currents at the fun-
damental physics level, this subject has been discussed only
qualitatively in a few textbooks.
2However, it can be an
interesting physics laboratory experiment to measure andanalyze the terminal magnet velocity and the drag force it
experiences when falling down a conducting pipe,
3and
many interesting works on this subject have been reported.For example, in this journal, elaborated experimental setups
have been suggested for the quantitative analysis of the phe-
nomenon,
4,5the drag force on a cylindrical magnet has been
calculated quantitatively by evaluating the energy dissipation
rate,6the dependences of the drag force on the thickness of
the pipe7and on the shape of the magnet8have been investi-
gated, and the off-axis effects and the dynamics of two mag-
net compositions have been explored.9Recently, it has been
shown that the conducting pipe can be replaced by a cylindermade of kitchen aluminum foils, and the magnet is slowed
down, even when the pipe is slit lengthwise.

Eddy currents are easy to visualize in the most ideal situa-
tion where the magnetic moment is vertically aligned and itfalls through the centerline of the pipe. The moving magnet
induces an electric ﬁeld in which the ﬁeld lines form circles
concentric with the pipe. Thus, eddy currents ﬂow alongthose circular paths, and the corresponding current density
can be obtained by applying Ohm’s law. The usual explana-
tion for the slow falling magnet in this case is that themagnetic ﬁelds produced by the Eddy currents oppose the
fall of the magnet, just as if two vertically oriented magnets
were placed below and above the falling magnet.
However, in real life experiments, such ideal conditions can-
not be fulﬁlled. As a consequence, the magnet undergoes a
complex motion during the fall: It changes its orientation,
rotates and precesses about the vertical axis,
9as can be seen
when dropping a button-shaped magnet in a conducting pipe.
To mitigate these effects, people have tried to forcedly maintain
the magnet’s orientation vertical by various techniques: attach-
ing the magnet to two hanging masses,8encasing it in a plastic
shell with a protrusion,5or guiding it using a glass tube.9In
these experiments, it has also been noticed that the magnet does
not fall with a constant terminal velocity. This implies that the
drag force on the magnet depends on its orientation.
In general, the drag force, coming from the magnetic
brake effect, arises whenever the magnet and the conductor
are in relative motion.11,12However, it is not easy to ﬁgure
out intuitively how the drag force acts on a horizontally ori-ented magnet for instance. To answer this question, one
should numerically solve Maxwell’s equations, which is
beyond most undergraduate physics classes.
In this paper, we develop a simple model to calculate the
drag force experienced by a falling magnet, whatever its ori-
entation. We do so by assuming the thin pipe is a two-
dimensional cylindrical surface. We work in the adiabatic
approximation where the magnet’s motion is much slowerthan any electric reaction times in the conductor, so that
eddy currents are assumed to be steady at all times.
We ﬁrst consider a point magnet falling inside an ultra-
thin conducting pipe with either of two extreme orientations:
vertical or horizontal and derive the corresponding drag
forces. Then, we show that the drag force on a magnet with
an arbitrary orientation can be expressed as a linear combina-
tion of the two previously obtained forces. We also carry outan experiment to validate the model’s predictions.
II. DRAG FORCE ON A MAGNET FALLING
THROUGH A CONDUCTING PIPE
Let us consider a point magnet of magnetic dipole moment

conducting pipe of radius aand of negligible thickness sat
~rmand with a velocity ~v¼d~rm=dt, where the subscript m
denotes the position of the magnet. According to Faraday’s
law, the falling magnet induces an electric ﬁeld ~EðiÞ.A t ~r

The superscript ( i) is added to distinguish this induced elec-
tric ﬁeld from the electric ﬁeld generated by real charge
distributions.

Eddy currents ﬂow with a current density given by ~j¼r~E.
Here, ris the conductivity of the conducting material.
However, the current can ﬂow only in the conducting mate-rial of the pipe, so that steady current densities should not
have any component normal to the pipe’s surface. This con-
dition can only be satisﬁed in the ideal case of the verticallyoriented magnet falling along the centerline of the pipe. Inthe general case, the current and the induced electric ﬁeld
~E
ðiÞcannot be parallel. To resolve these apparent contradic-
tions, one needs to solve Maxwell’s equations with the
proper boundary conditions. As we will see, the electricﬁeld corresponding to Eddy currents then has anothercontribution.
Indeed, in order to solve this problem, we need to consider
the effect of eddy currents. We will consider the surface
eddy current density ~K/C24~j
ks, where ~jkis the tangential cur-
rent density. In particular, we neglect the radial currents, as
well as the radial dependence of the tangential currents. Note
that, since ~Kis a surface current, it does not distinguish
between the inner and outer surface of the real-life pipe.
Eddy currents generate a magnetic ﬁeld in space according
to Biot–Savart’s law

where the integration is over the entire cylindrical surface
and~R0¼~r/C0~r‘0with ~r‘0representing a position of dSon
the surface. This magnetic ﬁeld is different from the mag-netic ﬁeld generated by the magnet, which would be
obtained by taking the curl of ~Aof Eq. (2). The superscript
“EC” is employed to distinguish them. ~BðECÞexerts a mag-
netic force on the point magnet~Fd¼~rð~l/C1~BðECÞÞ: (6)
Since the magnitude of ~EðiÞis proportional to v, so are the
eddy current density ~Kand the generated magnetic ﬁeld
~BðECÞ. The direction of ~Fdis not apparent in Eqs. (4)–(6) .A s
we will see, it will come out to be in the opposite directionto~v.
To proceed, we introduce the cylindrical coordinates
ðq;/;zÞ. We take the centerline of the pipe as the z-axis and
take the magnet position at any given instant as the origin of
the coordinates. Then, the two-dimensional cylindrical sur-
face is deﬁned as a surface of q¼a. In the following, we
will set ~v¼/C0 v^e
zand assume that the time scale associated
with vis orders of magnitude bigger than the electric reac-
tion times of the conductor. Under this adiabatic approxima-tion, we will require Eddy currents steady.
Although it has been described thoroughly in the litera-
ture,
5we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the case where the falling mag-
netic moment is oriented vertically. When ~l¼l^ez,~EðiÞis
along the ^e/direction. Since it is tangential to the cylindrical
surface, we can directly apply Ohm’s law to get eddy cur-
rents as

The symbol "will hereafter be associated with the fall of the
vertically oriented magnet. These eddy currents are steadyunder the adiabatic approximation, because ~r/C1~K
"vanishes.
Note that ~K"has only a ^e/component, which does not
depend on /. The currents are shown in Fig. 1(a).
Because of the axial symmetry of ~K", the magnetic ﬁeld
generated by the currents has an axial symmetry as well.Here, we introduce the use of a tilde to note that the quantityis scaled by a, the radius of the cylinder, for example,
~x¼x=a.A t~r¼x^e

In deriving Eq. (8), we have further assumed that the length
of the pipe is much larger than the radius of the cylinder aso
that the integration on zcan run from /C01 toþ1.
Presented in Fig. 1(b) is the conﬁguration of the magnetic
ﬁeld (8)in the x–zplane. The magnetic ﬁeld in other planes
can be deduced from the axial symmetry about the zaxis. As
can be seen, it is similar to the magnetic ﬁeld generated bytwo vertically aligned electromagnets, S-poles facing the ori-gin, as depicted schematically in Fig. 1(c). If a point magnet
with ~l¼l^e
zis placed between these two electromagnets, it
is pushed upwards by both electromagnets, which explainsqualitatively how the drag force is generated.

As shown in Fig. 1(d), the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the
origin, where the point magnet is located. However, the mag-
netic force acting on the point magnet is given by the gradi-ent of ~l/C1~B, which leads us to

which has been evaluated analytically by integrating Eq. (9)
forx¼z¼0.
On the other hand, the problem is quite different and more
complex when the magnetic moment of the falling magnet isin the horizontal direction. Let the magnetic moment ~lbe in
thexdirection. Substituting ~l¼l^e

The symbol !will be used hereafter to denote that it is asso-
ciated with the falling of the horizontally oriented magnet. Inthis case, the induced electric ﬁeld has yandzcomponents.
The zcomponent is tangential to the pipe, but the ycompo-
nent is not. As explicitly shown in Fig. 2(a), the electric ﬁeld
is no longer tangential to the pipe except for points at /¼0
or/¼p. Thus, we cannot directly apply Ohm’s law to get
the eddy currents. In the real pipe, currents may ﬂow parallelto the induced electric ﬁeld only during a very short time
that can be neglected in our adiabatic approximation. Almost
immediately, the radial component of the current isresponsible for charge accumulation, as shown in Fig. 2(b),
on the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe, which equili-
brates the radial component of ~E
ðiÞ
!inside the conductor.
Although such an equilibration may not be perfect, we may
neglect the remaining radial component of the current as
long as the pipe is thin enough. The electric ﬁeld generated
by these charges is conﬁned in the space between the outerand inner side surfaces, like between the two plates of a
capacitor. If the accumulated surface charge densities ron
the outer surface and /C0ron the inner surface satisfy the rela-
tionr¼/C15

!/C1^eq, they would cancel the radial component
of the induced electric ﬁeld. By combining, these surface
charges can be interpreted as a set of inﬁnitesimal electric
dipoles. These electric dipoles generate an electric ﬁeld over
the whole space. However, except in the space between thedipoles, it is one order higher in the pipe thickness sand can
be neglected in our s!0 approximation.
We will now try to determine the induced electric ﬁeld

!using trial functions. Due to the cancelation of the radial
ﬁeld by the accumulated dipoles, one may take only the /
andzcomponents of the electric ﬁeld (Eq. (12)) to get ~KðtrialÞ

does not vanish. Thus, the method we have used in the case
of the vertically oriented magnet cannot give any usefulinsight on the induced eddy currents in the present case.
Nonetheless, let us go one step further and examine how
the conducting material adjusts to the external electric ﬁeld.
As a consequence of the non-vanishing divergence of ~KðtrialÞ
!,
net charges will accumulate locally only if ~KðtrialÞ
! ﬂows
through the pipe. These charges will, in turn, generate an
electric ﬁeld, which will counterbalance the current ﬂow asshown in Fig. 2(c). In the end, Eddy currents will be steady.
By taking directly the two-dimensional divergence of the
current density, as in Eq. (14), one can check that the cur-
rents are not steady, and they will accumulate net charges.
Or, we can show it more explicitly. In Fig. 3,~Ktrial

sented at a few points on the /¼0;/¼p=2,z¼0, and

/¼0 and z¼6a=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
lines, while no current ﬂows along or
across the z¼0 line, and it ﬂows along the /¼p=2 line.

which implies that the current ﬂowing into the shaded region
ABCD is half the current ﬂowing out. Thus, negative charges
will accumulate in that region. They will enhance the incom-ing current in the ^e
/direction but reduce the outgoing cur-
rent in the ^zdirection. Note that the current density
component along ^zcannot be presented by the cross-
sectional view of Fig. 2(c).
It may seem odd to require such a steady state condition
when studying the induction created by a falling magnet,which is a dynamical phenomenon. As mentioned earlier, inthis work, we take an adiabatic approximation. Since thetime scale associated with the magnet’s motion is much
larger than that of the electric equilibration in a conductor,
we assume that charge redistributions of Figs. 2(b) and2(c)
are achieved instantaneously, and eddy currents are need tobe steady at any instant. Figures 2(b) and2(c) are just con-
ceptual steps to intuitively ﬁnd an appropriate solution for
~E
!and, hence, ~K!on the two-dimensional cylindrical
surface.
The accumulated charges shown in Fig. 2(c) are net
charges and should be carefully distinguished from the sur-face charges shown in Fig. 2(b), which form inﬁnitesimal
electric dipoles and generate an electric ﬁeld only in thespace between the dipole elements. The role of those electricdipoles is to equilibrate the radial component of the induced
electric ﬁeld. In contrast, the charges in Fig. 2(c) generate an
electric ﬁeld in all space and are responsible for making thecurrent steady. It is not necessary that these charges accumu-late only on the surfaces of the pipe. They can accumulate inthe conducting material of the pipe with a volume chargedensity q
q. In our model, we represent these accumulated
charges by a surface charge density rq/C24qqs.
The total electric ﬁeld, therefore, includes the electric ﬁeld
generated by these accumulated charges

face of the pipe, the current coming into the shaded region ABCD across the

charges will accumulate in the ABCD region.

Now, one can understand what happens in the pipe when a
horizontally oriented magnet falls through it. The magneticﬁeld generated by the eddy currents will be similar to the
one generated by four electromagnets arranged as in Fig.
4(c), which explains intuitively how the drag force arises.
All four electromagnets have a magnetic moment parallel tothat of the point magnet. The two magnets below the pointmagnet push it up, while two above pull it up. It is interestingto see that the eddy currents ﬂowing in the /C0p=2</<p=2
region and in the p=2</<3p=2 region are completely
separated. It implies that, even if we divide the pipe into twohalves along the /¼6p=2 lines and insulate them from one
another, the drag force would not be altered as long as the
magnetic moment of the point magnet is in the xdirection.
The magnetic ﬁeld generated by eddy currents is shown in
Fig.4(b) with arrows indicating the magnitude. There is no y
component of the magnetic ﬁeld strength vectors in x–z
plane, so that the arrows represent ~Band not a projection of
~Bonto this plane. Since we have broken the cylindrical sym-
metry by choosing the xaxis parallel to the magnetic

/6¼0;pwould have a different conﬁguration and cannot be
obtained simply by rotating this conﬁguration. Again, as
shown in Fig. 4(d), the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the origin,
where the magnet is located. However, the magnetic ﬁeldstrength vectors at points AandBlead us to @B

~Bitself vanishes. Thus, the drag force on the magnet is again

Here, the prefactor 4.76 has been evaluated numerically. In
Eq. (11), the corresponding coefﬁcient for k!is
45p2=64¼6:94. That is, k!is about 2/3 of k". Since the drag
force is equal to the magnet’s weight when it moves with a ter-
minal velocity, the terminal velocity of the horizontally ori-
ented magnet would be about 1.5 times larger than that of the
vertically oriented magnet. The electric ﬁeld ~EðiÞ
!induced by
the moving magnet and the electric ﬁeld /C0~rVðcÞgenerated by
the accumulated charge play equally important roles in gener-ating the dragforce (24) on the horizontally oriented magnet. If
we had not incorporated the accumulated charges and had justsubstituted ~KðtrialÞ
! of Eq. (13) into Eqs. (5)and(6), we would
have obtained 51 p2=256ð¼1:98Þ,t h a ti s , k"/3.
So far, we have considered two extreme orientations, which
is enough for us to evaluate the drag force on a magnet fallingwith an arbitrary orientation. As can be seen in Fig. 1(d),t h e
magnetic ﬁeld generated by the vertical component of the
magnetic moment cannot exert a drag force in the zdirection
on the horizontal component of the magnetic moment, becauseB

horizontal component of the magnetic moment cannot generatea drag force on the vertical component in the zdirection. Thus,
for a point magnet with ~l¼lðcosh^zþsinh^xÞ, the drag force
in the zdirection is the sum of the drag forces acting on each
component separately

However, as can be intuited from Figs. 1(d) and4(d),B";x

functions of x. This implies that the magnetic moment along
one direction creates a horizontal force that acts on themoment in the other direction. Thus, unless h¼0o rp=2, the
path of the falling magnet deviates from a straight vertical line.
III. EXPERIMENT
In order to check the validity of our model, we carried out
an experiment. The experimental setup, which is similar tothat of Ref. 8, is schematically drawn in Fig. 5. Instead of
dropping the magnet directly into the pipe, we connect it to a
Fig. 4. (a) (Color online) Black lines: Eddy current densities ~K!¼r~E!swith ~E!, given in Eqs. (21) and(22), ﬂowing on the two-dimensional cylindrical
surface. The spacings between the lines are adjusted in such a way that the electric currents ﬂowing between two consecutive lines are equal. Note that eddy
currents ﬂowing in the /C0p=2</<p=2 region and the p=2</<3p=2 region are completely separated. The contours represent the accumulated charges.
The numbers denote the surface charge densities in the unit of e0ðl0=4pÞðlv=a3Þ. Negative charges are accumulated around the points ( /¼þp=2;~z¼0) and
(/¼/C0p=2;~z¼61:2). Positive charges are accumulated around the points ( /¼/C0p=2;~z¼0) and ( /¼þp=2;~z¼61:2). (b) The magnetic ﬁeld ~B!gener-
ated by eddy currents in the x–zplane. All the magnetic ﬁeld strength vectors are calculated numerically by substituting ~K!into Eq. (5). The lengths of the
thin black arrows and thick black arrows are scaled by factors 2 and 4, respectively, compared to the thin gray arrows. The two thick gray lines at ~x¼61
represent the thin pipe. (c) An arrangement of four electromagnets qualitatively equivalent to the eddy currents shown in panel (a). The blue arrow wi thiindi-

hanging mass of /C2430 g by a thread, via two pulleys. It helps
the magnet fall along the centerline of the tube and increases
the time the magnet takes to reach terminal velocity, whichis helpful when analyzing the data to measure the drag coef-
ﬁcient. The hanging mass also moves through another pipe.
Since we use an ultrasonic detector (Korea Digital Co.,
KDS-1042) that measures the distance to any object within
0.15–2.0 m and within 64
ofrom its axis, the pipe prevents
any object other than the hanging ball from being detected.
The pipe also counters any wind effect. The position of the
magnet is inferred from that of the hanging mass.
We use a spherical neodymium magnet, since it generates
the same magnetic ﬁeld as a point magnetic dipole.15
However, the drag force acting on this spherical magnet ofﬁnite size is different from the one that would act on the
point dipole, so that, rigorously, Eq. (6)needs to be modiﬁed
as
~F

~rð~M/C1~BÞdV; (27)
where ~Mis the magnet’s magnetization and where the inte-
gration runs over the entire magnet’s volume. We will
neglect, however, this size effect, as we will see, it does not
signiﬁcantly alter the results.
To avoid any rotation of the magnet during the fall, sev-
eral experimental procedures have been proposed in the liter-
ature. Reference 5, for instance, proposed to embed the
magnet in an overall spherical capsule with a protrusion that
would be oriented downwards during the fall. We found that
this is not enough to maintain the magnet’s orientation, and
one needs to provide a large enough torque for the weight to
keep the verticality of the assembly. We achieved this byconnecting a massive ( /C2430 g) spherical capsule containing a
metallic ball to the magnet’s capsule via a 15 cm-long
wooden stick. In Ref. 8, a cylindrical magnet is pulled
upward and downward by using two hanging masses in order
to prevent the magnet from aligning with the geomagnetic
ﬁeld. Instead of hanging a heavy object to the downside of
the magnet using a thread, we attach it using a long solid
stick to provide more stability to the magnet’s motion. Since
it is quite difﬁcult to attach anything to the neodymiummagnet directly, we fabricated a spherical capsule that
tightly ﬁts the magnet, using a 3D printer. It is designed sothat the wooden stick can be attached to the capsule, everyp=6 relative to the direction of the magnetic moment. A
metallic ball is enclosed in another tight 3D-printed plasticshell glued to the other end of the wooden stick.
To reduce any other electromagnetic effects, we avoid
using ferromagnetic and conducting materials in the experi-
mental setup, except for the magnet, the hanging metallic
balls and the conducting pipe. The two pipes and pulleysare ﬁxed to a wooden frame using rubber bands. Since themetal ball is placed 15 cm (about ten times the pipe’sradius) below the magnet, the effect of the magnetic ﬁeldgenerated by eddy currents on this metal ball could beignored.
If we neglect the mass of the thread, the friction between
the pulley and the axle, the slipping of the thread on the pul-ley, and any air drag, the velocity and the position of themagnet assembly along the vertical axis are given by

not have any information on it. Since it has a few holesbetween the axle and the rim, we cannot evaluate its momentof inertia by any simple numerical calculation. It will beexperimentally determined by analyzing the motion of themagnet.

capsule. (b) Schematic diagram of the experimental setup. Two copper pipes are vertically aligned and ﬁxed to a wooden structure to which two pulleys a re

Typical data xi/C0x0¼xðtiÞ/C0x0as recorded by the detec-
tor are shown in Fig. 6(circles). The time interval Dt
between two measurements is set to 0.05 s. The magnet
velocity, approximated by vi¼ðxiþ1/C0xi/C01Þ=2Dt, is shown
with triangles. Since the detector can read distanceswith mm accuracy, the velocities can be evaluated only up to
cm/s accuracy. Although we do not have a precise measure-
ment of the release time t
0, it can be determined by ﬁtting
the data xitox(t) of Eq. (28) with two more adjustable
parameters vtands. In general, vtandsare closely connected
by a constant, ðm1/C0m2Þg=ðm1þm2þ2I=r2Þso that they
cannot be independent. The value of I=r2is determined from
the values of vtands.
Since the magnet assembly eventually experiences a com-
plex motion at the later stage,16we take only the data at the
beginning of the motion to ﬁt the trajectory to Eq. (28). The
ﬁrst data point we consider is the one that begins to deviatefrom x
0and the next /C2420 data points are chosen. They are
represented by open circles in Fig. 6. Since the magnet
reaches its terminal velocity within a second, /C2420 data
points are enough to ﬁt vtands. The ﬁt is shown as a dashed
line in Fig. 6. We then ﬁt xitox(t) as given in Eq. (28), using
the same vtands(black line in Fig. 6).
We performed ﬁve trials for each value of h¼(0,
p=6;p=3;p=2). All the data are presented in Fig. 7. As can
be seen, the reproducibility is within measurement uncer-
tainty. The x(t) graphs are asymptotically linear, which
implies that the magnet reaches its terminal velocity after afraction of a second. However, the magnet assembly’s veloc-ity is not strictly constant, even a few seconds into the fall.
These variations are not just random errors caused by differ-
ences in initial conditions or by the friction between the pipewall and the magnet assembly. The ﬂuctuations in the veloci-
ties show a clear and reproducible pattern at h¼p=6 for
instance. Indeed, although we tried to drop the magnet verti-cally, the magnet rotates to align with the Earth’s magneticﬁeld, thus triggering a precession about the vertical axis. The
larger theta, the more visible the precession. We have also
observed a rotation of the assembly about its symmetry axis.Such a rotation provides the assembly with some angular
momentum. Since it is hard to change the angularmomentum by a small torque, the rotation seems to stabilize
the motion of the magnet assembly, just like a spinning top
rises up and does not fall down. The precession masks thenoise in the v(t) graph, which could arise due to other factors
such as the friction on the pipe.
We have ﬁtted all ﬁve sets of data separately to obtain v
t
ands, and then taken their averages. The results are listed in
Table I. Note that the ratios vt=sobtained for the four differ-
ent angles are almost the same. With their average value
0.286 m =s2and by taking g¼9:8m=s2, we could determine
2I=r2to be 8.3 g. It enabled us to determine the drag coefﬁ-
cients by using Eq. (29). We distinguish the drag coefﬁcients
obtained from vtands, respectively, by kandk0in Table I.
In Table I,kmaxandkminare the maximum and minimum val-
ues among each ﬁve kand k0obtained for a given h. The
ratio of kh¼p=2=kh¼0is 0.72, which is slightly higher but close
to our model prediction of 2/3.
Figure 8shows the drag coefﬁcient as a function of h. The
dashed line corresponds to k"cos2hþk!sin2h, with k"and
k!set to the corresponding average value at h¼0 and p=2,

respectively. The measured values kh¼p=6and kh¼p=3are
close to the curve, which shows that the model prediction
(Eq. (26)) works well.
IV. CONCLUSION
Treating eddy currents is a non-trivial problem, even in
such a simple demonstration where a horizontally orientedmagnet is dropped through a vertical conducting pipe.Instead of solving the full Maxwell equations with the corre-sponding boundary conditions, we have developed a simpli-ﬁed model where the pipe is modeled as a two-dimensionalcylindrical surface. Although the solution involves some spe-cial functions such as modiﬁed Bessel functions, it is mucheasier than solving the full partial differential equations andprovides better intuition than just solving the problemnumerically. The model enables us to see clearly what hap-pens in the pipe and in the surrounding space, and how thedrag force is generated on the horizontally oriented magnet.We believe that this constitutes a valuable pedagogical exer-cise for the classical electrodynamics class.
We have shown that the model is in quantitative agree-
ment with experiment. Setting up the experiment itselfwould be a good laboratory exercise for undergraduates. Inparticular, compared to experiments where students justmeasure the falling time to determine the terminal velocity,analyzing the magnet motion allows them to check that themagnet indeed reaches terminal velocity. Asking students tomake their own computer codes to ﬁt the data to the theoreti-
cal formulas could be another good training for them.

16Because of the tilting and precession, the magnet touches the pipe and one
may hear the sound of the magnet sliding on the pipe surface. In that case,
friction is no longer negligible, and Eq. (28) does not hold.
