The dynamics of a heavy symmetric top are studied in connection with the Hannay angle. When
the top undergoes a steady precession due to gravity without nutation, the Hannay angle has ageometric nature such that it is identical to the solid angle subtended by the loop swept out by the
symmetry axis of the top. Here, we show that the Hannay angle can also be described by the angle
between two radial vectors on the disk of the top corresponding to the pure spinning motion and
the coupled motion of spin and precession for one period of the precession. The geometric nature
of the angle between the two radial vectors is veriﬁed by demonstrating, via parallel transport, thatthe magnitude of the angle is the same as that of the solid angle. In the presence of nutation, the
path constructed by the symmetry axis is not closed, and the steady precession appears in the limit
of inﬁnite initial spin angular velocity. As a consequence, in an ideal situation of no friction, theHannay angle as a pure geometric effect does not exist in the superposed motion of precession and
nutation.

I. INTRODUCTION
The motion of a symmetric top under the inﬂuence of uni-
form gravity, called a heavy symmetric top,1is a well-
known problem of classical mechanics and is discussed inmost textbooks from elementary to advanced levels. Whilethe essential dynamics of heavy symmetric tops is well
understood, there is an interesting point associated with the
motion of a spinning top that has not received much atten-tion, namely, the geometric aspect of the dynamics of thetop. This is known as the Hannay angle,
2which is a classical
analog to the quantum geometric phase or Berry phase.3,4
According to the classical adiabatic theorem,5,6when a
system undergoing a cyclic motion is coupled to anothercyclic motion called a parametric motion in such a way thatthe period of the parametric motion is much longer than thatof the system, the periodic motion of the system is almost
preserved during the full cycle of the parameter; this is
described below for the case of a spinning top. Hannay
2used
this theorem to show that after one period of the parametricmotion, the angle variable (the conjugate quantity to the
action variable) of the periodic system acquires a phase shift
composed of two parts termed the dynamical angle and geo-metric angle. The dynamical angle depends on the period,but the geometric angle is time-independent and is deter-
mined by the geometric nature of the parametric motion.
This geometric contribution to the total phase shift of theangle variable is called the Hannay angle.
A representative example of this effect is the Foucault
pendulum, in which the angular difference between the ini-
tial and ﬁnal orientations of the oscillation plane after one
complete rotation of the Earth becomes the Hannay angle,and is equivalent to the solid angle subtended by a closedloop swept out by the axis of the pendulum for one day.
7The
geometric phase of the Foucault pendulum has been exten-
sively studied, but there are not many articles about theHannay angle of the heavy symmetric top except the seminalpaper by Hannay
2and a paper by Berry and Shukla.8
Hannay gave a qualitative description of the existence of the
geometric angle in a top: When a spinning symmetric top
with a ﬁxed end is manually driven to follow a closed path,it can have the geometric phase of solid angle encircled by
the axis of the top; this is explained by the parallel transport
of a vector on a unit sphere (see Sec. III C). Berry considered
a gravity-driven top and showed that when it undergoes asteady (or “pure” in his terms) precession, the Hannay angle
is the same as the solid angle subtended by the loop made by
the precessional motion of the axis of the top. These papers,however, treated the problem in an advanced level by usingdifferential geometry (Hannay) and topology (Berry).
9A
more illustrative treatment to understand how the Hannay
angle is connected with the geometric nature of the dynamicsof a heavy symmetric top is not available; Montgomery
10
and Mecholsky11studied the Hannay angle for force-free
rotations of a rigid body and an asymmetric top, which aredifferent from the present case.
In this paper, we study the Hannay angle of a heavy sym-
metric top in a more tractable way. Our goal here is not to
add new concepts to the problem but rather to make theexisting concept easier to understand by visualizing its geo-
metric feature. In Sec. II, for sake of completeness, we reder-
ive the equations of motion for the top by employingspherical coordinates instead of the ordinary approach of
using Euler angles. In Sec. III, we recapitulate the basic con-
cept of the Hannay angle for steady precession. In Secs. III B
and II C, we demonstrate that the Hannay angle can be
expressed by a scalar product of two position vectors, and its
equivalence to the solid angle is then veriﬁed by the paralleltransport of a vector on a sphere. In Sec. IV, we discuss the
inﬂuence of nutation on the geometric property of the
Hannay angle and show that it can appear only in the limit ofinﬁnite spin angular velocity of the top. Section Voffers a
summary and conclusions.
II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION
Consider a symmetric top comprising a disk (radius a) and
axle (length l) whose end is pivoted on a plane, as shown in
Fig.1. We assume the mass of axle and the thickness of disk
are negligible compared to the mass and radius of the disk;
the center of mass is at the center of the disk. To describe the
dynamics of the top, we employ Cartesian coordinates
357 Am. J. Phys. 91(5), May 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 357 04 October 2023 22:52:04
ðx;y;zÞ(space frame) with origin at the pivot point and
spherical coordinates ðr;h;/Þmoving with the top as shown;
we set h<p=2 in the following discussion. With this choice
of coordinates, the er-axis coincides with the symmetry axis;
the transformation between the Euler-angle representationand the spherical coordinates is given in the supplementarymaterial.

The rotational kinematics of the top can be described by
three angular velocities. As depicted in Fig. 2(a), these are
the spin angular velocity xsabout the symmetry axis and the
rates of change of the angles hand/. The corresponding
angular velocity vectors are
xs¼xser¼_wser; _h¼_he/; _/¼_/ez; (1)
where wsis the angle corresponding to the spin angular
velocity xsand the dots represent time derivatives. We can
decompose _/into components along the directions erand
/C0eh[see Fig. 2(b)]
_/¼_/cosherþ_/sinh/C0ehðÞ : (2)The total angular velocity xdescribing a general rotational
motion of the top is the sum of these three vectors. In spheri-
cal coordinates, this is
x¼xsþ_hþ_/¼Xrer/C0XhehþX/e/; (3)
whereXr,Xh, andX/are given by
Xr¼xsþ_/cosh;Xh¼_/sinh;X/¼_h: (4)
To express the total angular momentum of the top Lin
spherical coordinates, we start from the expression for Lin
terms of the basis vectors ðe1;e2;e3Þ, which are the principal
axes in the Euler-angle representation,13and use the transfor-
mation relation between ðe1;e2;e3Þandðer;eh;e/Þgiven in
the supplementary material12

where x1,x2, and x3are the components of the total angular
velocity vector in the Euler-angle representation and I3¼Ir
and I1¼I2¼Iare, respectively, the moments of inertia
about the symmetry axis and the perpendicular principal
axese1ande2.14
The dynamics of the top can be investigated by solving
the equation of motion N¼dL=dt; we consider an ideal situ-
ation of no friction. The torque Ndue to gravity is given by
N¼l/C2ðmgÞ¼mglsinhe/. Since the basis vectors
ðer;eh;e/Þdepend on time, the equation of motion can be
expressed as

¼I_X/e//C0I_XhehþIr_XrerþIXh_e/
/C0IXh_ehþIrXr_er: (6)
Using Eq. (4)and the time derivatives of ðer;eh;e/Þ,12the
equations of motion for each component are, respectively,

As expected, these are the same as the equations obtained
from the Euler angles.
The above coupled differential equations can be solved in
various ways to analyze the general motion of the top. Animmediate result can be found from Eq. (7)

In fact, the action integral15forLrisJ¼ÞLrdws¼2pLr,s o
the action variable is J=2p¼Lr. As a consequence, Xris the
spin angular velocity corresponding to an angle variable con-
jugate to the action variable Lr. Hereafter, to distinguish xs¼
_wsfromXr, we refer to xsas akinetic spin angular velocity .
As is well known, the general motion of the top consists
of the spin of the disk about the symmetry axis, plus preces-sion, and nutation of the axis. In particular, depending on the
initial conditions, one may have a steady precession or a
superposed motion of precession and nutation . We consider
the ordinary method of starting the top: spin the top about its
axis with angular velocity x
0, incline the axis by hifrom the
vertical, then release it. The initial conditions are then
xsð0Þ¼x0;hð0Þ¼hi; _hð0Þ¼0: (11)
In addition to these, one needs an initial condition for _/, for
which we choose
_/ð0Þ¼ _/0:steady precession ; (12)
_/ð0Þ¼0:precession with nutation ; (13)
where _/0has speciﬁc value determined by x0[see Eq. (15)]
and the second condition produces a cusplike path (see
Fig.9). In the following discussion, it is convenient to intro-
duce the dimensionless parameter k0and the time parameter
sdeﬁned as
k0¼Irx0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃImglp ;s¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ

k0incorporates the information on the initial spinning
motion, and 2 psis the same as the period of a physical pen-
dulum for small oscillation about h¼p.
III. STEADY PRECESSION AND HANNAY ANGLE
We begin by examining steady precession in more detail.
Steady precession, which is also called pure precession8or
regular precession ,16occurs when the incline angle of the
axis is constant, so hðtÞ¼hiand hence _hðtÞ¼0: The tip of
the symmetry axis (or, the center of the disk) traces out a cir-
cular path. In this case, from Eq. (8), the precession angular
velocity _/becomes a constant, that is, _/ðtÞ¼ _/0from Eq.
(12). Conservation of Lrin Eq. (10) then leads to
IrXr¼IrXri, where Xriis given by Xri¼x0þ_/0coshi.O n
substituting these into Eq. (9), one can have two values of
_/0for a given value of x0; these are termed the fast and
slow precessions. For rapidly spinning top (our interest), the
slow precession dominates. Using the initial conditions in
Eq.(11) and the parameters k0andsof Eq. (14), the angular
velocity of the slow precession is
_/0¼k0/C0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
k2
0/C041/C0Ir=I ðÞ coshiq
2s1/C0Ir=I ðÞ coshi¼_/: (15)
Forhi<p=2, this requires k0/C21kcto have a precessional
motion, where kc¼2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
ð1/C0Ir=IÞcoship
¼Irxc=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃImglp.
Thus, in order to have a steady precession, a delicate initial
condition is necessary: The top, which is spinning with angu-
lar velocity x0/C21xc, should initially be pushed in the e/direction with initial speed _/0, determined by the above
expression;17if_/0is different from this value, the motion of
the top will always be accompanied by the nutation. From
the plot of _/0ðx0Þin Fig. 3, we observe that, as x0increases,
the precession gets slower, that is, its period Tbecomes lon-
ger. To summarize, for a rapidly spinning top, the two
important characteristics of the steady precession, which will
be used in the discussion of the Hannay angle below, are theslow precession and the closed circular path described by the
symmetry axis.
A. Hannay angle as a solid angle
As stated in Sec. I, the Hannay angle stems from an argu-
ment based on the classical adiabatic theorem, where“adiabatic” implies “slow.” In the case of the spinning top,
the adiabatic theorem can be explored using the previous
analysis of the steady precession. When the symmetric topspins under the inﬂuence of gravity, the spinning motion of
the disk (that is, the cyclic motion) is coupled to the preces-
sion (the parametric motion). Let the period of the spinning
motion be T
s; recall that the period of the precession is T.A s
investigated above, if the top spins rapidly the precessionalmotion becomes slow, that is, T/C29T
s. In this case, the spin-
ning motion of the disk remains almost constant for the time
scale Ts, that is, the axis of spinning motion changes little for
time Tsin the course of the whole precessional motion. This
is known as the adiabatic invariant,5,6in which the conserved
quantity is the action variable. For the present case of steady
precession of a spinning top, the action variable is the con-
stant angular momentum Lras given in Eq. (10).
Since the precession itself is a periodic motion, the spin-
ning disk will return its original place after time T. On intro-
ducing a point Pon the rim of the disk as depicted in Fig. 4,
one can ask “What is the ﬁnal angular position of the point P
after one complete precession?” According to Hannay,2the
answer can be stated as follows: Even though the fast cyclicmotion of Pis maintained due to the adiabatic invariance
during the whole period of precession, it acquires an addi-
tional angle (the Hannay angle) in addition to the angle due
to pure spinning motion. An important outcome is that the
additional angle can be explained purely geometrically,regardless of the spinning motion.

period for the precession with nutation, obtained from numerical calcula-
tions [see Eq. (33)].

To illustrate this, we consider a position vector RPfrom the
origin Oof the space frame to the point P.A ss h o w ni nF i g . 4,
this can be written as RP¼lþrP,w h e r e rPis the radial vector
f r o mt h ec e n t e ro ft h ed i s kt o P(notejrPj¼a, the radius of the
disk). Using the freedom of choice of the basis vectors ehand
e/and the orthogonal relation of eh/C2e/¼er, one can set
rP¼aeh. The position vector RPis then
RP¼lþrP¼lerþaeh: (16)
As the top spins about the symmetry axis, the point Pwill
rotate around the center of the disk with angular velocity xs.
If the spinning top undergoes a steady precession at a rate _/
about the z-axis, then, since _h¼0, the total angular velocity
of the top is x¼xserþ_/ezfrom Eq. (1). Thus, the rate of
change of the vector RPin the space frame is
dRP
dt¼x/C2RP¼xserþ_/ez/C0/C1
/C2lerþaeh ðÞ
¼_//C2lþXrer/C2rP; (17)
where we have used _/ez/C2aeh¼_/coshier/C2rPin the
second line. The ﬁrst term, _//C2l¼dl=dt, means that the
axis vector lrotates about the z-axis with angular velocity _/;
that is, it precesses around the z-axis. The second term is
equivalent to x/C2rP¼drP=dt; this describes the rotation of
the vector rP, hence the point P, about the symmetry axis er
with angular velocity Xr¼xsþ_/coshi. Thus, in the frame
of space coordinates, the point Pexperiences a coupled
motion of rotation and precession, which yields a compli-cated path; see the green curves in Fig. 5.
In the absence of precession, since _/¼0 we have
dl=dt¼_//C2l¼0, and Eq. (17) reduces to
dRP
dt¼drP
dt¼xs/C2rP: (18)
In this case, since lis constant the point Pexhibits a simple
rotational motion about the ﬁxed axis l¼lerwith angular
velocity xs, which we refer to as a pure spin; see the blue cir-
cle in Fig. 5.
This analysis of the kinematics of the point Pmakes it
clear that, when pure spinning motion is coupled to thesteady precession, the point Pacquires extra angular velocitydue to the precession. The resultant angular velocity is the
constant rate X
r. Our goal is to ﬁnd the ﬁnal angular position
ofPon the disk after the time of one complete precession,
that is, the total spin angle of Pfor time T. This is deter-
mined by the kinetic angular velocity xs¼_ws, which, from
the relation Xr¼xsþ_/coshi, is given by
_ws¼Xr/C0_/coshi: (19)
Introducing angle variable Wrsuch that dWr=dt¼Xr, the
angle rotated by the point Pfor one period of precession T
reads
wsðTÞ/C0wsð0Þ¼WrðTÞ/C0Wrð0Þ/C0ðT
0_/coshidt:(20)
Choosing wsð0Þ¼0;Wrð0Þ¼0 so that WrðTÞ¼XrTand
using that _/andhiare constant in the steady precession and
_/T¼2p, this can be written as follows:
wsT¼WrT/C02pþc; (21)
where wsT¼wrðTÞ;WrT¼WrðTÞ¼XrT, and cis the
Hannay angle deﬁned by
c¼2p/C0ðT
0_/coshidt¼2p1/C0coshi ðÞ : (22)
The angle wsTis composed of two parts. One is the time
dependent angle WrT¼XrT, which is called a dynamical
angle; this depends on the constant angular velocity Xrand
the period T. The other is the Hannay angle c(apart from the
additional phase factor /C02p), which depends on neither the
dynamical variable Xrnor the time Tbut rather is determined
by the incline angle hiof the symmetry axis from the verti-
cal. Moreover, it is exactly the same as the solid angle sub-tended by the circular loop formed by the precessionalmotion of the axis of the spinning symmetric top (see Fig. 6),
which displays the geometric nature of c.

B. Hannay angle as a scalar product of position vectors
In this section, we show that the Hannay angle can be
expressed in terms of a scalar product of two position vectorsof the point Pat time T, which are associated with the pure
spinning motion and the coupled motion of spin andprecession.
Recalling that _/¼0 for pure spinning motion, we use the
following notation for the total rotation angle of the point P
at time T:
W
rT¼XrT¼x0T¼w0Tfor pure spin ; (23)
where we have used Xr¼Xri¼x0from Eqs. (10) and(11).
The angles wsTin Eq. (21) andw0Tin Eq. (23) are then inter-
preted as follows. The angle wsTis the total spin angle of the
point Pafter the spinning top ﬁnishes one complete steady
precession. The angle w0Tis the total angle of the pure spin-
ning motion of the point Pfor the time Tand is equivalent to
the dynamical angle. Thus, apart from the phase factor 2 p,c
can be viewed as the difference between these two angles,that is, w
sT/C0w0Tþ2p¼c.
To express the Hannay angle in terms of a scalar product
of two position vectors, we ﬁrst consider the radial vector rP
on the disk. At time t, it is given by
rPðtÞ¼acoswsðtÞehþasinwsðtÞe/; (24)
where ais the radius of the disk, wsðtÞis the angle due to
xsðtÞat time t, and ehande/are reference basis vectors at
time t¼0 so that they are independent of time. If we choose
the initial condition wsð0Þ¼0, then rPinitially coincides
with the basis vector eh. As time passes, the point rotates
around the center of the disk. For this there are two angular
velocities, namely, xsfor the coupled motion of spin and
precession and x0for the pure spinning motion. After one
precession period T, one can think of two disks, with each
corresponding to one of the angular velocities. For steady
precession, these disks are completely overlapped and have
the same centers and orientations. The ﬁnal angular positions(or phases) of the point Pare then designated by two points,that is, P
sTdue to xsandP0Tdue to x0on the same disk (see
Fig. 6), with which we can associate angles wsTandw0T,
respectively. We now construct radial vectors from the com-
mon center of the two overlapped disks to each of the two
points such that
rsT¼acoswsTehþasinwsTe/;
r0T¼acosw0Tehþasinw0Te/; (25)
where ehande/are the reference bases at time t¼0a s
before. Note that the ﬁnal phases of Pwith respect to ehand
e/are determined by the angles wsTandw0T, both modulo
2p. The scalar product of the two vectors yields
rsT/C1r0T¼a2coswsT/C0w0T ðÞ /C17a2cosc; (26)
where we have used Eqs. (21) and(23). Note that the phase
factor 2 pand the choice of time-independent reference bases
forehande/do not affect the ﬁnal result. From this, ccan
be expressed as
c¼arccos usT/C1u0T ðÞ ; (27)
where usT¼rsT=aandu0T¼r0T=aare the unit vectors
along each of the two vectors. ccan also be expressed in
terms of the position vector RPgiven in Eq. (16). In this
case, by transforming the spherical basis vectors into the
Cartesian basis vectors with the help of Eq. (10) in the sup-
plementary material,12the Hannay angle is
c¼arccosRsT/C1R0T
a2/C0l2
a2/C18/C19
; (28)
where RsTandR0Tare, respectively, the position vectors
from the origin Oto each of the ﬁnal points PsTandP0Tat
time T. The two expressions (27) and(28) are essentially the
same because, if we move the center of the disk to the origin
O,lbecomes zero and RPreduces to rP.
As can be seen from Eq. (22), the Hannay angle cfor
steady precession is independent of the dynamical variablex
0¼Xriand is determined solely by the inclination angle
hi. This suggests that the angle between r0TandrsTshould
also be the same for a given inclination angle hi.I nT a b l e I,
some numerical values of the total angles wsTandw0Tand
the Hannay angle care listed. In Fig. 7, we also display the
radial vectors using Eq. (25) and the angle between them
calculated from Eq. (27). These numerical examples con-
ﬁrm the independence of con the dynamic variable x0.
Thus, the Hannay angle is visualized by the angle betweenthe two vectors r
0TandrsTon the disk, which demonstrates
another geometric interpretation of c.

The preceding geometric interpretation of cis further clar-
iﬁed by using an analysis similar to that used to explain theprecession of Foucault pendulum,18–20namely, parallel
transport. Consider a sphere of radius lsuch that the disk of
the top is tangent to the surface of the sphere [see Fig. 8(a)].
Now introduce a cone whose side is tangent to the sphere atthe center of the disk so that its base intersects the sphere toform a circle of radius lsinh, which is the same as the loop
formed by the precessional motion. After the precessionperiod T, we consider a disk that has spun without precession
(i.e., pure spin) and denote the unit vector from the center tothe point P
0T, that is, the ﬁnal position of the point Pat time
T,a su0T. We then make a parallel transport of u0T(hence
the disk) along the circumference of the circle on the sphereto construct a vector u
sT, which is the unit vector to the point
PsTon the disk that has undergone both the spin and preces-
sion for the same time T. Since the circular path is on the
curved surface of the sphere, the resultant vector usTis not
the same as u0T, so that there exists an angular difference
between the two. This difference turns out to be the Hannayangle c.
That the angle between u
sTandu0Tbecomes the Hannay
angle, and ccan be veriﬁed by showing that it is the same as
the solid angle given in Eq. (22). For this purpose, we open
the cone and unfold the lateral surface to form a fan. Theparallel transport of u
0Tis then mapped into the parallel
transport along a circle of radius ltanhin 2D plane, as illus-
trated in Fig. 8(b). After completion of the parallel transport
through the circular curve of length 2 plsinh(i.e., the cir-
cumference of the circular loop due to the precession), theﬁnal vector usTis seen to be different from u0Tby an angle
c, so it can be expressed in terms of their scalar product, that
is,c¼arccos ðu0T/C1usTÞ. By noticing that the angle sub-
tended by the arc AB_¼2plðtanh/C0sinhÞis congruent with
the angle difference c, we can write
c¼arccos u0T/C1usT ðÞ ¼AB_
ltanh¼2p1/C0cosh ðÞ ; (29)
which is just the solid angle subtended by the surface area of
the incline angle h. This analysis clearly shows how the
Hannay angle of a spinning top in steady precession can be
interpreted as a scalar product of the two radial vectors onthe disk of the top as well as the solid angle.
IV. PRECESSION WITH NUTATION
The general motion of a spinning heavy symmetric top
including nutation as well as precession occurs when _h6¼0.
The type of nutation depends on the initial value of _/. Here,

we consider the initial condition given in Eq. (13), that is,
_/ð0Þ¼0. To investigate the inﬂuence of the nutation on the
geometric phase, we ﬁrst note that the equations of motion(7)–(9) produce three constants of motion. The ﬁrst is con-
servation of L
rgiven in Eq. (10). The second is
LrcoshþI_/sin2h/C17L/¼constant ; (30)
and the third is the conservation of effective total energy
~E/C17E/C01

where Eis the true total energy composed of kinetic energy
and potential energy. From the initial conditions in Eqs. (11)
and (13), the initial values of the constants of motion
become

(32)
From the conservation relations LrðtÞ¼Lri;L/ðtÞ¼L/i,
and ~EðtÞ¼ ~Ei; then using the parameters k0andsin Eq.

For the initial condition of _/ð0Þ¼0, the resultant motion is
such that the center of the disk (or the tip of the top) follows acusplike path in the course of precession, as displayed inFig.9. The path swept out by the axis after one complete pre-
cession (time T) is not closed, which is in contrast to theclosed path for steady precession. Even in this case, since X
r
is constant, we can still use Eq. (22) to ﬁnd the difference in
angle between the two radial vectors, which we now call anextra angle and denote by c
e. Substituting Eq. (33) into Eq.

0_/ðtÞdt¼2p,
where _/ðtÞis given in Eq. (33) (see Fig. 3).
The extra angle cecan also be obtained from the scalar
product of two radial vectors on the disk. As before, we can
think of two disks after the precession period T, one that has
undergone pure spinning motion and the other having spunwith both precession and nutation. Unlike with steady pre-cession, the ﬁnal orientations and centers of the two disks donot coincide, as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, we cannot directly
use Eq. (27) to ﬁnd c
e. However, by either moving their cen-
ters to the origin O(keeping the orientations unchanged) or
using Eq. (28) we can still evaluate ce, which can be com-
pared with the direct evaluation of the integral in Eq. (36).
Table IIand Fig. 10show some numerical results of the
extra angle ceobtained from Eqs. (28) and(36) for various
values of k0(i.e., x0) when hi¼p=4, for which the geomet-
ric phase of steady precession is given by the Hannay anglec¼2p½1/C0cosðp=4Þ/C138 ¼ 1:840 rad. We observe two fea-
tures. First, the period and amplitude of the nutation diminishask
0increases, approaching the closed path of the steady
precession in the limit of k0!1 . Second, since the whole
path for one period of precession is not a closed loop, thevalues of c
eare not the same as the Hannay angle cbut vary
with k0: They decrease as k0increases and approaches the
value of the steady precession in the limit of k0!1 (i.e.,
x0!1 ); see Fig. 11.
Thus, in the presence of nutation, the extra angle ce
depends on the dynamical variable x0and cannot be
expressed as a solid angle. This tells us that the Hannay
angle of a spinning top, as a pure geometric effect of thesolid angle, can exist only in cases of steady precession. Incases of precession with nutation, the steady precessionappears in the limit of k
0!1 . In other words, when the
top starts with the superposed motion of precession andnutation, steady precession is not possible.22We remark
here on two points. First, one should distinguish this from
the steady precession discussed in Sec. IIIbecause their

initial conditions are different from each other, as given in
Eqs. (12) and (13). Second, this seemingly unphysical
behavior is because we are considering an ideal situation,having ignored friction between the top and horizontalplane; the nutation is quickly damped out by friction toleave a steady precession, which is called a pse udo-regular
precession.
16A more realistic model which takes friction
into account may eliminate the limit of inﬁnity, so thatsteady precession (or the pseudo-regular pr ecession) can be
established at ﬁnite spin angular velocity.V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the dynamics of a spinning
heavy symmetric top composed of an axle and a disk toexplore its geometric properties, namely, the Hannay angle.The equations of motion are derived by using spherical coor-dinates, which are shown to be the same as those obtained
using the Euler angles. When the top undergoes a steady pre-
cession, the Hannay angle is identiﬁed with the solid anglesubtended by the circular path formed by top’s spin axis. Byexamining the motion of a point on the disk, we have demon-strated that the Hannay angle can also be described by thescalar product of two radial vectors on the two effectivedisks of common centers and the same orientations; one vec-
tor corresponds to the pure spinning motion and the other to
the superposed motion of spin and precession. The anglebetween the two vectors is shown to be independent of theinitial spin angular velocity x
0. The identiﬁcation of this
angle with the solid angle is further supported by the geomet-ric analysis based on the parallel transport of the radial vec-
tor along the circular path due to the steady precession on an
imaginary sphere whose radius is that of the axis. Overall,the geometric nature of the Hannay angle of a spinningheavy symmetric top can be explained either by the scalarproduct of the two radial vectors or the solid angle.
When nutation occurs, the path produced by the axis of the
top for one period of precession is not closed. The parametricmotion, that is, the superposed motion of nutation and preces-
sion, is no longer a cyclic motion and hence one cannot
directly associate the angle between the two radial vectorswith the Hannay angle; this is because the angle depends onthe initial spin angular velocity x
0and hence cannot be
expressed as a solid angle. We have also found that the nuta-tion dies out in the limit x
0!1 . In this limit, the motion
approaches steady precession, making the path a closed circu-
lar loop. Thus, in view of the superposed motion of nutation
and precession, the Hannay angle as a solid angle appears inthe inﬁnite initial spin angular velocity. This unphysical resultmay be resolved if one considers a real situation including fric-tion that damps the nutation. A quantitative analysis is neces-sary to answer at which value of x
0and how fast the nutation
disappears due to friction. Nevertheless, it is clear that the
Hannay angle exists in a spinning heavy symmetric top if it
achieves the steady precession in any way.

APPENDIX: AMPLITUDE OF NUTATION
Here, we derive an analytic form for the amplitude of
nutation by using the harmonic approximation of the effec-tive potential energy ~VðhÞin Eq. (35). For rapidly spinning
top, this is a good approximation because, when k
0(i.e., x0)
is large, the effective total energy ~Eis close to the minimum
of~VðhÞ. In this approximation, we can write
~VðhÞ’ ~V0þk
2h/C0h0 ðÞ2; (A1)
where h0is the angle at which ~VðhÞbecomes minimum,
~V0¼~Vðh0Þ, and k¼½d2~V=dh2/C138h¼h0. Substituting this into
Eq.(34) and using the initial condition hð0Þ¼hi, one ﬁnds

slow manifold by using the dynamics of a heavy symmetric top. According
to this paper, the geometric interpretation of the dynamics shows that the
pure precession of the heavy symmetric top corresponds to the slowmanifold, in the sense that it is a special case of the general motion of the
top including both precession and nutation.
