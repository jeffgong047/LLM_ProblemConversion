LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
The downloaded PDF for any Letter in this section contains all the Letters in this section.
Letters are selected for their expected interest for our readers. Some letters are sent to reviewers for advice;
some are accepted or declined by the editor without review. Letters must be brief and may be edited, sub-ject to the author s approval of signiﬁcant changes. Although some comments on published articles and
notes may be appropriate as letters, most such comments are reviewed according to a special procedure
and appear, if accepted, in the Notes and Discussions section. (See the Statement of Editorial Policy atajp.aapt.org.) Running controversies among letter writers will not be published.

There is a considerable body of the physics education lit-
erature purporting to show that all magnetic dipoles areuniquely “Amperian”; that is, at a fundamental level all mag-netic dipoles effectively arise from electric current loops.This long-held view has had an unfortunate effect, particu-larly on the teaching of magnetic properties of materials, inthat it has generated an unwarranted over-emphasis on a cur-rent loop analogy. Statements such as
all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges
in motion, and in fact, if you could examine apiece of magnetic material on an atomic scale youwould find tiny currents: electrons orbiting aroundnuclei and spinning about their axes

Sometimes, it is easier to think in terms of the
“Gilbert” model of a magnetic dipole (separatedmonopoles), instead of the
physically correct
“Ampe `re” model (current loop)1
or
The electron also has a spin rotation about its own
axis (something like the earth rotating on its axis),and as a result of that spin it has both angularmomentum and a magnetic moment

are misleading, to say the least.3
The suggestion that classical spin of electrons could
explain bulk magnetic properties was ﬁrst proposed byCompton as early as 1920,4but the idea was not embraced
by the physics community at the time. In 1925, the conceptwas reintroduced by Kronig5and, famously, by Uhlenbeck
and Goudsmith.6It was realized almost immediately, how-
ever, that a model of an electron as a rotating charged sphere
was not viable since its surface speed would be superlumi-
nal; this remains the accepted position almost a hundredyears later.
In any event, the development of quantum mechanics
from 1926 cast a very different light on these issues. Pauli’sinclusion of spin matrices
7in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics was followed in 1928 by Dirac’s relativistic quan-tum mechanical equation for the electron8from which elec-
tron spin emerges naturally. It is now recognized thatLorentz invariance requires that intrinsic angular momentum
arises as a particle property inherent to the symmetries ofMinkowski space-time and has an associated intrinsic mag-netic dipole moment.
In the intervening years, however, attempts were made to
model intrinsic magnetic dipole moments of particles aseither (i) “Amperian” (inﬁnitesimal current loops) or (ii)“Gilbertian” (inﬁnitesimally short magnetic needles); formore details, see Ref. 9and numerous references therein.
The thinking behind this was reviewed by Mezei
10in 1986.
It was asserted that the force experienced when a magneticdipole passed through an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, likethat in a Stern-Gerlach experiment or scattering in a solid,would be different for each model. Certain experiments
9
have been interpreted to favor the “Amperian” model, butthese experiments involved particles such as neutrons thatare known to have non-zero radius.
A recent paper by Rafelski et al. ,
11using a rigorous
Lorentz invariant treatment, conﬁrms that any point particlehas an intrinsic angular momentum and associated intrinsicmagnetic dipole moment without the need for either of theabove analogies. These authors proceed to show that theStern-Gerlach force on a point magnetic dipole is the same
for both models , and thus, it is not possible to distinguish
dynamically between them. Accordingly, neither the“Amperian current loop” nor the “Gilbertian dipole” analogscan be applied meaningfully to electrons.
While permanent and/or induced current loops at an
atomic level do indeed contribute to various magnetic phe-nomena, this is not the case for the magnetic dipole momentsthat stem from intrinsic angular momentum, such as that ofthe unpaired electrons involved in paramagnetism and ferro-magnetism. This is a point of conceptual and practicalimportance, because, for example, the magnetic properties ofall ferromagnetic materials arise almost entirely from theintrinsic magnetic moments of their electrons and their con-tribution should be understood as separate from (small)orbital electric current contributions.
12
In the context of teaching classical electromagnetism,
however, it may sometimes be pedagogically helpful to
recognize that the magnetic moment of fundamental pointparticles can be visualized heuristically in either model,but neither heuristic visualization should be presented as

fundamental. Forcing a “current loop” or “spinning charged
sphere” interpretation on the origin of the magnetic dipole
moment of the electron inevitably leads to pedagogical difﬁ-
culties, contradictions, and misconceptions. Indeed, in thelimit that the area of the loop becomes inﬁnitesimally small,a relativistic treatment is clearly required.
It is important that instructors emphasize that dominant
magnetic effects in real materials arise from the
intrinsic
magnetic moment of the electrons and acknowledge that thephysical origin of intrinsic magnetic moments lies outside
the remit of classical electromagnetism. Failure to recognize
this impedes a proper understanding of magnetic effects inmaterials.
12
We are not suggesting that intrinsic magnetic moments ﬁt
seamlessly into the classical theory of electromagnetism.
Even Ampere and Maxwell13appreciated that something
beyond their electromagnetism was needed to understandmagnetic materials. The something beyond, of course, turned
out to be quantum mechanics and its intrinsic magnetic
moment of the electron.
Spin arises from fundamental symmetry requirements of
relativistic quantum mechanics—it is as intrinsic to a parti-cle as its charge. Thus, when discussing magnetic materials
even within classical electromagnetism, the electron should
be recognized as a point particle that has two independentfundamental electromagnetic properties: its charge andits
magnetic moment. A clear statement of this fact is essen-
tial, even in the context of elementary pedagogical treat-ments. Quite simply, it is not physically correct to state that
all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in
motion.a)ORCID: 0000-0002-5165-8043.

36-1, p. 36-2. However, in an earlier section (34-1, p. 34-2), Feynman had
already pointed out that “it is not possible to understand the magnetic
effects of materials in an honest way from the point of view of classical
physics. Such magnetic effects are a completely quantum-mechanical
phenomenon.”
3We do not wish to imply that such misconceptions are unique toGrifﬁths’s or Feynman’s otherwise excellent texts. They appear in someform in many other undergraduate electromagnetism textbooks in English,
but Grifﬁths and Feynman are probably among the most widely used.

ented internet websites.
