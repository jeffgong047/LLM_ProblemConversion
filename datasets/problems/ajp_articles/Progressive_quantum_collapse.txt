Instantaneous collapse of the wave function upon measurement of a single particle is one of the
postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, what happens when
a many-body system in a macroscopic coherent state is measured one particle at a time? Here, we
consider successive measurements of individual spins from a spin Bose condensate that starts in aSchr €odinger cat state. When the spin measurements are done one particle at a time, the collapse of
the spin condensate is not instantaneous but leads to probabilities for spin measurement that
strongly depend on the previous measurements. What is surprising is that an almost completecollapse occurs in very few measurements. Even in a large system, a single cat component is
emphasized quite quickly in the sequence of measurements. We examine the process by analysis of
a simple two-Fock-state cat, as well as a cat state that has many components. Justiﬁcation is givenfor our theoretical measurement process.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wave function collapse upon measurement is one of the
tenets of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechan-
ics. This effect is not built into the Schr €odinger equation; it
is assumed in a separate postulate, often called the “von
Neumann reduction hypothesis,”1which states that when a
measurement of a physical quantity, A, is carried out on a
wave function that is a superposition of the eigenfunctions of
A, the wave function instantaneously collapses to one of
those eigenfunctions. Many alternatives to this approach
have been suggested. One possibility is that the Schr €odinger
equation is incomplete; alterations have been suggested2so
that when a massive object (a measuring device) is present,
the equation itself provides the removal of any superposition.
At another extreme is the interpretation by Quantum
Bayesianists,3who say that the wave function is not a real
physical entity; it is simply one’s best guess at the probabil-
ity of any outcome. Different interpretations of quantum
mechanics may interpret “collapse” in different ways or
even avoid the term.
Here, we don’t concern ourselves with these issues of
interpretation. We simply use collapse in the traditional way
to describe the mathematical process of change in the wave
function with measurement. At the moment when a singleparticle is said to be measured, we instantaneously replace
the wavefunction with an eigenfunction of the measured par-
ticle using probabilities calculated from the wavefunction
right before collapse. Yet here, the single particle that is
measured is taken from a coherent many-body state contain-
ing many particles. How does this macroscopic quantum
state collapse as individual particles are measured?
In recent years, there have been several experimental stud-
ies of the effect of measurement on systems of
Bose–Einstein condensates.4,5These include studies showing
how the interference between two Bose condensates6can
arise due to measurements, even if the condensates each startout in Fock states (states with a ﬁxed number of particles in
each condensate) with no pre-established relative phase. In
the case of spin systems, transverse polarization measure-ments were considered on a Fock state composed of an equalnumber of up and down spins
7(that is, unpolarized), in
which the measurements induced a state polarized in some
direction with a transverse component at a random angle inthex–yplane.
In the experiments on measurement of Bose condensates,
the measurement and analysis was carried out one particle at
a time, resulting in a steady process of change to the system
wave function. One remarkable aspect is how few particleshad to be measured for the system wave function to reach itsﬁnal state. Nevertheless, no single measurement was respon-
sible; each one contributes so that one sees a step-by-step
approach of the wave function to its ﬁnal state. Nothing likethis occurs in normal textbook discussions of collapse thatconsider only a single quantum system, so we feel it could
be illuminating to discuss measurement of these systems in a
classroom setting. We have included both some simpliﬁedanalysis that could be used in classroom discussions, as wellas a complete numerical recipe in the supplementary mate-
rial
8that could be used for student projects.
Wigner considered a sequence of measurements in terms
of a series of projectors applied to the wave function;9here,
we use a different approach derived from quantum optics.4
The process we consider has similarities to recently devel-
oped experimental techniques. Serge Haroche won the
Nobel Prize in 2012 for work on Schr €odinger cat states.
These were not condensates as in our case but linear combi-nations of various photon number states. His method
involved sending atoms through a cavity containing the
photon quantum state: “The information acquisition processusing successive atoms captures the progressive collapse ofthe ﬁeld’s wave function. The ﬁeld starts as a coherent state
without a well-deﬁned number of photons, and it ends in a
Fock state.”

For our quantum analysis, we consider dual Bose conden-
sates, which are a mixture of two different kinds of bosons.
These might be different species of bosons or simply bosons
in two different states; any pair of states into which bosonscan condense will do. We refer to one state as “spin up” and
the other as “spin down,” even if there is no real spin. A
recent experimental example is the mixture of the two hyper-ﬁne states of Rb;
11each of these states actually has a differ-
ent total spin angular momentum. Here, we consider a
simple system composed of a number of identical bosons ina double potential well.
12The “up spin” ( þ) consists of those
bosons in the left well and the “down spin” ( /C0) those in the
right well. In order to construct our cat state, however, weneed the possibility of one boson type converting into theother. For the Rb system, there are electromagnetic spin-ﬂip
methods that allow such a conversion. For the double well
system used here, atoms can quantum tunnel through the bar-rier between the wells. With such tunneling, one might ques-
tion whether the system is “fragmented”
12into two
condensates, or just one. However, as long as the tunnelingis relatively small, we are still able to make a measurement
and clearly detect which well the particle was in; we will call
this a measurement of spin up or spin down in the commontwo-level terminology developed for measurement of a sin-
gle quantum state.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
To show how we build a cat state on which we can make
“spin” measurements, consider the Hamiltonian

the number operators for each type, tis the tunneling param-
eter that transfers particles between the wells, Vþ;V/C0are the
interaction energies of each type of particles among others of
the same type, and Vþ/C0is the interaction between different
types.
Consider ﬁrst the case when t¼0 and there is no tunnel-
ing. Furthermore, let us take the single particle energies and
interactions for each type to be the same; e¼eþ¼e/C0and
V¼Vþ¼V/C0. In this case, the Hamiltonian can be written
as
H0þHi¼eþ1
2VðN/C01Þ/C18/C19
ð^nþþ^n/C0ÞþDV^nþ^n/C0;
(5)
DV¼Vþ/C0/C0V; (6)
where N¼^n/C0þ^nþis the total number of particles. The
value of Nis ﬁxed; thus, we have replaced it with a scalar
here. The eigenfunctions of this Hamiltonian are Fock states
(number states), given byjNþ;N/C0i¼ða†

withj0ithe vacuum state. Consider the case where Vþ/C0¼0
so that two particles in different wells do not interact. Thenhaving DV¼/C0V<0 implies that particles in the same well
repel one another so the lowest energy state has an even splitbetween the wells ( N
þ¼N/C0¼N=2Þ; the particles want to
spread themselves out evenly. This makes jN=2;N=2ithe
lowest energy state. However, for DV>0Þ, all particles will
group in either one well or the other to take advantage oftheir attraction for one another. In this case, there are twodegenerate ground states, jN;0iandj0;Ni.
Next consider the case where the interactions vanish and
the hopping parameter tis nonzero ( H
0þHt¼eNþHtÞ.
Tunneling means that the single-particle ground state is asuperposition of the different Fock states. The second-
quantized ground state eigenfunction is

Now the states are a linear combination of Fock states dis-
tributed over their entire range. The wave function coefﬁ-cients are peaked around the central state havingn¼N=2¼N
þ¼N/C0. Keep in mind that this is not yet a cat
state, because a cat state is a superposition of two macro-scopically distinct states; here, there is only one distributionaround N=2.
Finally, consider the full Hamiltonian with both tunneling
tand interactions, DV6¼0. Tunneling will disperse particles
out of a single Fock state like Eq. (7).I fDV<0, tunneling
creates a distribution around the central state jN=2;N=2i
with the width narrowing as jDVj=tincreases.
ForDV>0, there are two possibilities depending on
how strong the tunneling is: When DVN=t<2, a single cen-
tral peak remains; when DVN=t>2, a double peak is cre-
ated as interactions dominate. In the latter case, the wave
function is spread out over the possible Fock states, but thedistribution splits into two distinct segments, forming a catstate. Figure 1shows these two types of distributions. In the
limitDVN=t!1 , the cat state approaches the so-called
N00N state

below, when we take Nto be large, we make dependence on

tion. We write a distributed state in this basis as

Figure 1plots these coefﬁcients Clfor the DVN=t¼2 and 3
cases. Further details of the solution for such states are dis-cussed in Ref. 12and in the supplementary material.8
We have now deﬁned our cat state; produced from the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (1)withDVN=t>2. Next we want to
calculate how the wave function evolves as we measure
spins (i.e., which well each particle is in) one at a time for asystem that starts in just such a cat state. Initially, we are
going to simplify the situation and consider a state composed
of just two components jliandj/C0li. This will be our initial
model of the more complicated distributed state with a dou-ble peak, to which we return later.
III. MEASURING A TWO-TERM CAT STATE
Consider a dual-spin condensate wave function in a single
Fock state as
jUi¼j N
þ;N/C0i¼j l;Ni; (12)
where one condensate has Nþ¼N=2þlparticles (spin up)
and the second condensate has N/C0¼N=2/C0lparticles (spin
down). Suppose we remove a particle from the dual system
and measure its spin. It seems sensible that the probability ofgetting a spin result g
1¼61 in the ﬁrst measurement of a
single particle in a Fock state would be the ratio of the num-
ber of spin g1particles to the total number of spins
pg1¼Ng1
N: (13)
What is the probability of picking a second particle with spin
g2? (We assume the second measurement is done immedi-
ately after the ﬁrst so the wave function does not evolve.)
After the measurement, the wavefunction collapsed to either
jNþ/C01;N/C0iorjNþ;N/C0/C01i, so the number operator pro-
duces different results. One particle is now missing so theprobabilities of each outcome are now
p
g2¼Ng2/C01
N/C01;g2¼g1;
Ng2
N/C01; g2¼/C0 g1:8
>><

The removal of a particle of spin g1slightly changes the
probability of ﬁnding the next spin since there is one fewerspin g1particle in the system. In the supplementary mate-
rial,8we give the formal quantum measurement theory from
which these reasonable probabilities are derived.
A. Large N approximation
Here, we make the approximation that the number of spins
in the system is so large that we can neglect the correctionsto the probabilities from the loss of particles. Thus, we haveforanyspin measurement

This approximation is equivalent to a measurement of the
spin of the particle without removing it from the system.
Now let us make Msuccessive measurements of spins
from a single Fock state jli, assuming also that M/C28N. The

Suppose that instead of a Fock state, we start with a superpo-
sition of two Fock states

for a particular value of l. (The Hamiltonian of Sec. IIprodu-
ces a state composed of two distributions of Fock states, onecentered around jliand the other centered around j/C0li,
which we will return to later.) The superposition describes
our uncertainty: Do we have 2 lmore particles in the left well
(“up spins”) than in the right well (“down spins”), or is it anexcess of 2 lparticles in the right well? On average, there
are an equal number of particles in either well. (With, say
l¼25;N¼100;the number or particles in the left and right
wells is ambiguous, the state could be either N
þ¼75 or
N/C0¼25 or Nþ¼25 and N/C0¼75. On average, there are 50
particles in each well.)
Next we will measure spins to see how measurements
affect this state and progressively change this uncertainty.
For the cat state, the probability of obtaining some particularsequence of the Mvalues g

where the R¼1/2 is a normalizing factor that accounts for
the fact that there are two Fock states in our initial state.Using this expression for probability, we can also deﬁne theconditional probability of getting a spin gin the Mþ1 mea-
surement, given the sequence g

The ﬁrst spin measured has a probability 1/2 of being up;
and the probabilities are then iterated, always ﬁnding theprobability to measure the next gbased on how the previous
measurements have changed the state.
To see how these formulas work, consider a state that
begins with an equal mixture of Fock states A and B, wherestate A contains three million up spins and one million , and
state B describes the reverse

There are so many spins that we can simply use y¼1/2 for
each measurement. If we choose from state A, then there is a3/4 chance to obtain an up spin, whereas if we choose fromB, the probability is 1/4. However, either state A or B isequally likely. So the probability of getting the ﬁrst spin up
from the cat state, with no previous measurements having
been made, is via Eq. (20)

which is larger than the 50% chance of ﬁnding the ﬁrst up
spin. The probabilities of getting three up spins in states A
and B, are, respectively,
PAðþ;þ;þÞ ¼3
4/C18/C193
;PBðþ;þ;þÞ ¼1
4/C18/C193
; (26)giving, from Eq. (20), a total probability to measure three
up spins in a row of 7/32. The conditional probability of
getting an up spin, given two previous measurement of anup spin, is
Gðþjþ ;þÞ ¼7=32
5=16¼7
10¼70%; (27)
which is larger than both the 50% chance of ﬁnding the ﬁrst
up spin, as well as the 62.5% chance of ﬁnding the secondup spin.
In contrast, if we had previously measured an even mix-
ture of one up spin and one down spin, the probability of
measuring the next spin up is only
Gðþjþ ;/C0Þ ¼¼1
2341434þ1
2143414
123414þ1
21434¼3=32
3=16¼50%:(28)
This demonstrates the essential point of our results, which is
that the probabilities for the next measurement depend on
what we obtained from the previous measurements. In theSec. III B, we will show that this occurs because the coherent
many-body wavefunction remains in a superposition as wemeasure individual spins, but the relative amplitudes of the
different Fock states change as a result of previous
measurements.
Figure 2shows the results of a numerical simulation. We
proceed in this way starting with a large system of particlesin the cat state with the same spin distribution as Eq. (22),
picking one spin at a time: The ﬁrst spin is selected with
probability 1/2 using a computer generated random number.
Using Eq. (21), we ﬁnd the sequence of conditional proba-
bilities of measuring another up spin, each measurementbeing done after Mprevious measurements, with Mranging
from zero to 100. The up-spin probability almost immedi-
ately converges to a value corresponding to one of the catstates or the other, as if the second Fock component wereabsent, in basically less than ten measurements!
We can understand in more detail how our result comes
about by noting that, in computing the probability at a partic-
ular Mþ1 value, the order in which the Mprevious spins

shown for y¼1=2 [Eq. (16)], one converging to probabilities 0.75 (black
circle) and the other to 0.25 (blue squares) each corresponding to just one of
the cat components.

were measured, in the case M/C28N;does not matter and they
can be grouped according to gvalues. In any sequence of M
measurements, Mþup spins and M/C0down spins will result,
and if D¼Mþ/C0M/C0we can then write Eq. (21)as

(29)
where Dcan be either positive or negative. Suppose in a run
Dbecomes sizable and positive. Then ð1þyÞD/C29ð1/C0yÞD
and we ﬁnd GðgÞ!ð 1þgyÞ=2. For example, with y¼1=2;
one gets GðþÞ ¼ 3=4 and Gð/C0Þ ¼ 1=4. However, suppose
we have just D¼3;which gives GðþÞ ¼ 0:73;almost the
limiting value of 0.75. These are almost the values that
would occur if the wave function had contained only thej3N=4;N=4icomponent, rather than being in a cat state con-
taining both components j3N=4;N=4iandjN=4;3N=4iof
Eq.(19). Once many up spins have already been measured,
further measurements of up spins are favored. We can also
have runs where Dbecomes large and negative. In that case,
the probability becomes GðgÞ!ð 1/C0gyÞ=2 so that GðþÞ
¼1=
4 and down spins become more strongly favored in sub-
sequent measurements as if the original state were
jN=4;3N=4ialone. In many repetitions of the entire experi-
ment, the two possible outcomes are equally favored so the
average of the sequences approaches 0.5.
In this section, we have assumed the number of measure-
ments Mwas much less than the particle number N. The
detailed measurement theory given in Sec. IIof the supple-
mentary material8accounts for the particle removal upon
measurement. In the above, we ignored the change in theprobability form as particles were removed in using, say, Eq.(15) instead of Eq. (14). In Sec. IIIof the supplementary
material, we report the exact calculation; the resulting plot
looks almost the same as that shown in Fig. 2.
B. Evolution of the wavefunction during measurement
To understand what is going on, let us start with a simple
few-particle quantum state and track its evolution as eachmeasurement is made. Here, particles are removed to mea-
sure their spin as is done in the general measurement theory
given in the supplementary material.
8Consider the state

The measurements perhaps involve bringing a detector to
interact with the system, creating a small probability of a
particle tunneling out into the detector, which can then dis-
tinguish the source well. There is a small enough probabilityof tunneling so that only one particle appears in the detectorat a time. We represent this removal by operating on the
wave function by the ﬁeld operator

where D ðgÞis the wave function of the detector for spin state
g, and in the ﬁnal form, we have provided proper normaliza-
tion of the wave functions. If we now examine the detectors,we will ﬁnd spin up with probability 1 =2 and the same for
spin down. When we measure the up spin, the new conden-
sate state collapses to

now different,ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

, respectively. One has been
emphasized over the other. Our ﬁrst measurement has causeda collapse of the wavefunction to a changed distribution ofFock states in which state A, the Fock state containing moreup spins, is more likely.

new wave function in Eq. (33) gives the entangled state of
the system as

Now the probability of ﬁnding a spin up, given that a previous
spin up was found in the ﬁrst measurement, is 1 =3 while that
for spin down is 2 =3. These probabilities are different from
what they were for the ﬁrst spin, which is the point of this paper.The probabilities change as measurements are made because thewavefunction after each measurement alters to emphasize one
Fock state over the other. Theoretically, we are watching the rel-
ative amplitudes of the components change. This is what wemean by “progressive” wave function collapse. In Fig. 1,w e
saw the probability of spin up change as measurements pro-
ceeded. Experimentally, one could monitor how often a plus
spin occurs and watch the collapse occur.
IV. A MORE COMPLICATED CAT STATE
In Sec. II, we described how we could construct a cat state
from a mixture of two Bose condensates. In Sec. III, we treated
a simpler two-component cat. We return to the full cat state
here. The cat state is again given in Eq. (11)with the C

sented as two Gaussian peaks of the form e/C0ðl6aÞ2=r2with
a¼50 and r¼20. The plot of the peaks looks similar to that

where Mgis the number of gspins that are removed from the
system when measured. Nevertheless, the calculated result ismuch like that in Sec. IIIwhere the measurement centers on
one component and the other is ignored after a few measure-ments. We ran sequences of M¼50 measurements of spin
and recorded the ﬁnal G
50ðþÞ of each run, the conditional
probability of getting an up spin, given that we had done 49previous spin measurements one particle at a time. Werepeated this procedure 3000 times and formed a histogramof the results as shown in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, we show the counts versus value of the condi-
tional probability G
MðþÞ. Each sequence of spin measure-
ments locks in on one cat component or the other. Withinthe sequences, each of which looks much like one of thosein Fig. 2, and the ﬁnal probability varies but only within
the limits of the width of the cat component. The posi-tions of the histogram peaks correspond strongly to thepeaks in the cat state distribution in Fock states C
l.T h e
peaks in the wave functions correspond to l=N¼60:25,
so the wave function peaks would translate to probabili-ties of spin up of 0.75 and 0.25. Interestingly, the widthof the cat peaks is reﬂected in the width of the distribution
of counts.
In Eq. (35), the quantity in curly brackets appears in place
ofjC
lj2as a new wave function probability density in subse-
quent measurements. This seems to be a boson bunchingeffect, where measurement of an up-spin favors the nextmeasurement to be an up-spin. The measurement operationsenhance the probability of one superposition peak over theother. We can see this more clearly by writing the probabilitydensity in Eq. (35)asF

assume D>0 and plot Fl, we can see how the effective probabil-
ity density is changed by a few excess counts of Mþ(see Fig. 4).
The measurement of equal numbers of up and down spins modi-ﬁes the cat peaks equally, but when the number of one kindexceeds the other by a small number, subsequent measurementsare skewed considerably in the same direction.

V. DISCUSSION
The usual treatment of wave function collapse, as in text-
books, is an all-at-once event; one measurement does the
trick. Schr €odinger’s cat is either alive or dead when one
looks. A classic experiment involved a superposition of mac-
roscopic electron currents in a SQUID, one clockwise and
the other counterclockwise.13The energy splitting between
the symmetric and antisymmetric states was observed show-
ing the interference between the cat components. In a single
component, all the electrons are moving in the same direc-
tion. Presumably, the measurement of the direction of a sin-
gleelectron would collapse the wave function to one of the
components. However, our model with a linear superposition
of mixed Fock states allows ambiguity in a single spin mea-
surement since each Fock state contains both types of spins.
Several questions can arise. Does the cat state still collapse?
If so, how many measurements does it take to collapse it?
While in the process of collapsing, what form does it take?
Here, we have tried to answer these questions by simulating
the measurement process. Our model starts with a linear super-position of mixed Fock states, which allows ambiguity in a sin-gle spin measurement since each Fock state contains both typesof spins. We ﬁnd that it does collapse towards a single Fockstate as measurements are made, and only a surprisingly smallnumber of measurements are needed for that to happen. Eachmeasurement gives a bit more information about the wavefunction. The new wave function evolves in response to thosemeasurements, making the next measurement more likely tocorrespond to one of the cat components. The process takesplace by altering the wave function probability amplitudes witheach measurement. Theoretically, we can see this change of thecoefﬁcients take place with each measurement and so watchthe progressive quantum collapse.
