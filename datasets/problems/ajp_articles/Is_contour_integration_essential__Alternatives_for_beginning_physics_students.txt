The standard method to evaluate many deﬁnite integrals that are encountered in physics is contour
integration. Here, we show how these can be evaluated by other means, enlarging the toolbox availableto students and enabling the discussion of physical problems where these integrals arise before contour
integration is introduced.

I. INTRODUCTION
Contour integration is the default technique to solve many
deﬁnite integrals for which the range of integration is thereal line or an interval over which the integrand is periodic.Once this technique is taught to students, they are able toapply it without difﬁculty, since the steps are similar for allproblems. Deﬁnite integrals which may otherwise seemimpossible to evaluate can be solved using contour integra-
tion. These deﬁnite integrals are most frequently encountered
in quantum mechanics and electromagnetism.
Here, we show that many integrals that one encounters in
physics, for which contour integration is the standardmethod, can be evaluated using other methods as well. Thisenables topics involving these integrals to be taught beforecontour integration is encountered, providing greater ﬂexibil-ity in the classroom. We focus on those that are relevant forphysics applications, although we show that some other inte-grals and inﬁnite series can also be tackled. The integrals dis-cussed here include all the standard examples worked out intextbooks
1,2when contour integration is taught.
II. FOURIER TRANSFORM INTEGRALS
Contour integration is often useful in evaluating Fourier
transforms such as the Fourier transforms of the Lorentzianand Gaussian distributions. One common reason to evaluatethese Fourier transforms is that adding two random variablesresults in convolving their probability distributions, for
which multiplying their Fourier transforms is more efﬁcient.
Differentiating under the integral sign for the integral canenable the evaluation of these integrals without contourintegration.
A key result that allows us to do this is one of the repre-
sentations of the Dirac delta-function

¼2pdðkÞ: (1)
The integral is evaluated by splitting it into two parts, one
for positive xand one for negative x, each of which is easy to
evaluate. The last step in the equation is justiﬁed by notingthat lim
/C15!0þ/C15=ð/C152þk2Þis zero if k6¼0 and inﬁnity if k¼0;
and its integral over /C01 <k<1isp:We now apply this
result to evaluate various integrals.For the Fourier transform of a Lorentzian distribution, if

homogenous equation. Therefore,

where we have chosen decaying exponentials on both sides
of the origin because I(k) in Eq. (2)is well-deﬁned for all k.
Atk¼0;the function I(k) must be continuous, so A¼B:
Integrating Eq. (3)over an inﬁnitesimal interval containing

Therefore, IðkÞ¼pe/C0jkj:This method of evaluating the inte-
gral in Eq. (3)has been discussed in Ref. 3.
It is easy to generalize this result to the case when the denom-
inator in the integrand in Eq. (2)is an arbitrary m/C0th order
polynomial PmðxÞ:Without loss of generality, we can choose
the coefﬁcient of xminPmðxÞto be unity. The corresponding

parts are only included in the linear combination for k<0;and
ka’s with negative real parts are only included in the linear com-
bination for k>0. Thus, there are munknown constants in IðkÞ:

Generalizing still further, if the numerator in Eq. (2)is a
polynomial QnðxÞof order n, the integral I(k) is equal to the
operator Qnð/C0id=dkÞacting on I0ðkÞ;where I0ðkÞis the inte-
gral with QnðxÞreplaced by 1 inside the integral. (The order
of the polynomial, n, does not affect anything here.)
A variant of this class of integrals is
IðkÞ¼ð1
/C01sinðkxÞ
xdx: (7)
This integral is useful in physics because lim k!1sinðkxÞ=x
is a representation of pdðxÞthat is encountered in many prob-
lems, and the integral has to be evaluated to conﬁrm that theproportionality constant is p:Differentiating,
dIðkÞ
dk¼ð1
/C01cosðkxÞdx¼Reð1
/C01eikxdx¼2pdðkÞ:(8)
Thus, I(k) is a constant function for k<0 and k>0 with a
jump of height 2 patk¼0:Since I(k) in Eq. (7)is an anti-
symmetric function of k, we obtain IðkÞ¼psgnðkÞ;where
sgn is the sign function. One can use this general approach
of solving a differential equation supplemented with symme-
try conditions to obtain I(k) for more complicated integrals
such as the integral of sin2ðkxÞ=x2over the range from /C01
toþ1:
Finally, we consider the Gaussian distribution, another
probability distribution whose Fourier transform is useful inphysics, such as in the time evolution of the Gaussian wave-
packet in quantum mechanics (or a Gaussian initial probabil-
ity density for the diffusion equation)

standard Laplace transforms and try to transform any given
Laplace transform into a combination of these.
III. FOURIER SERIES INTEGRALS
In this section, we consider the integrals that give the
Fourier series of a periodic function fðhÞ. The function fðhÞ
is often only speciﬁed over one repeating interval and
deﬁned outside this interval through its periodicity.However, if fðhÞis a function of e
ih, it is automatically peri-
odic. Examples of such integrals occur when calculating theeffect on the orbit of a planet due to a perturbing planet: themultipole expansion of the gravitational ﬁeld of the perturb-ing planet in the secular approximation involves integrals of
this type.
6At a less specialized level, calculating such inte-
grals illustrates the important result that if all derivativesexist for a periodic function fðxÞ;the coefﬁcients f
nin its
Fourier series decay exponentially with jnjfor large jnj:7
A simple example of this type of function is
fðhÞ¼1
aþbcoshfn¼1
2pð2p
0e/C0inhfðhÞdh; (15)
where a>b>0:The integral can be evaluated using con-
tour integration by converting it to an integral over the unit
circle in the complex plane and calculating the residues of
the integrand. Here, we use an alternative approach of con-structing a difference equation for f
n:Although this tech-
nique is not widely used in physics, it is very similar to thedifferential equations we used for Fourier transformintegrals.
We start by rearranging Eq. (15)
ðaþbcoshÞfðhÞ¼1; (16)
which is equivalent to

where dn;0is the Kronecker delta. Collecting terms propor-
tional to einhon both sides,

We solve this equation for n>0 and n<0 and match the
two solutions at n¼0:Forn6¼0;we have a homogeneous
linear difference equation with constant coefﬁcients. We usethe standard technique of assuming f

in Eq. (18)forn6¼0 to obtain

therefore

fn/C200¼A<kn
1þB<k/C0n
1(20)
is a valid solution to Eq. (18)forn6¼0 with arbitrary coefﬁ-
cients A>;<andB>;<:Since the general solution to a second
order difference equation has only two arbitrary parameters,we have obtained the general solution, validating theassumption f
n/knwe started with. (This is similar to the
standard technique of solving linear differential equations
with constant coefﬁcients, where an exponential dependenceon the independent variable is assumed.) Since f
n!61cannot
diverge, and jk1j<1;we have B>¼A<¼0:Since fn/C210
andfn/C200have to match at n¼0;we have A>¼B<¼C;
i.e., fn¼Ckn
1forn/C210 and fn¼Cð1=k1Þnforn<0:
Substituting these forms in the difference equation with
n¼0;we have

can be solved to obtain the four roots k1;k2;1=k1;1=k2with

This set of equations can be solved to obtain the coefﬁcients
A1;A2;B1, and B2;from which fncan be obtained.
This method can be generalized to the case when the
denominator in the integrand is an arbitrary polynomial in
coshand sin h:If the polynomial is of degree m, the analog
of Eq. (25) is a polynomial of degree minðkþ1=kÞand
ðk/C01=kÞ=iwith real coefﬁcients. Taking the complex con-
jugate of this equation and exchanging kwith 1 =k;we see
that the roots come in pairs k1;1=k/C3

both fj’s with j>0 and with j<0:The last equation is f0
¼PAa¼PBa:These 2 mequations allow the AaandBa
coefﬁcients to be found. Generalizing still further, if a pol yno-
mial in cos hand sin his inserted in the numerator of the inte-
grand, the integral is a linear combination of the fn’s obtained
without this factor.
This method is no more complicated than contour integra-
tion. The polynomial whose roots give the allowed values of
kis the same as the polynomial whose roots give the poles of
the integrand in the complex plane. Setting up and solving
the linear equations for the Aa;Bacoefﬁcients takes longer
than applying the residue theorem, but is straightforward.
IV. INFINITE SERIES
Complementary to Sec. IIIis the task of summing an inﬁ-
nite series. For example, the seriesP
n1=ð1þn2Þcan be
summed by ﬁrst deﬁning the function
fðxÞ¼X1
n¼/C011
1þn2einx: (28)
Our task is equivalent to evaluate fð0Þ:Thus, we have to ﬁnd
the function f(x) from the coefﬁcients in its Fourier series, as
opposed to ﬁnd the Fourier series of a given function.
However, how do we ﬁnd f(x) from its Fourier coefﬁ-
cients? These problems are often presented backwards: A
function f(x) is given; its Fourier series is calculated; and by
evaluating f(x) at a special value of x, an inﬁnite series is
summed. However, it is not clear from such an approach
how, if one encounters a series to be summed, one couldguess the appropriate function fðxÞ:A method that works in
some cases is to use complex analysis, as shown in Ref. 8.
However, here we present a different approach.
172 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 3, March 2023 Onuttom Narayan 172 04 October 2023 22:50:00
We show how to sum such series without any guesswork,
by—as in Sec. II—deriving a differential equation for fðxÞ;
from which fð0Þ¼P1=ð1þn2Þcan be obtained.
A useful result similar to Eq. (1)is

where the sum is broken into two geometric series, one for
non-negative nand one for negative n, each of which is
summed. The ﬁnal expression is clearly a periodic function
ofx. Since the numerator tends to zero with /C15;so does the
sum unless the denominator also tends to zero, which hap-pens when cos x¼1:Forx/C250;the sum tends to an integral

As in Secs. IIandIII, this can be extended to the sum over
all integer nof any rational function of n.
As in Sec. II, we can apply a variant of the same technique
to the sum of a rational function of nover all the integers
when the function is singular at n¼0:Unlike Sec. II, where
the singularity is cured by having a function in the numeratorthat cancels it out, here it is easiest to just exclude the n¼0
term. For example, the Riemann Zeta function

of the expression for the low temperature speciﬁc heat of theDebye model of phonons.10
More generally, the family of integrals
ð1
0ðlnxÞm
ð1þxÞ2dx¼ð1
/C01um
ð1þeuÞ2eudu (42)
occur in the Sommerfeld expansion for integrals associated
with the Fermi–Dirac distribution.11It is not difﬁcult to ver-
ify that the integrand is an even (odd) function of uifmis
even (odd). If mis even, the integral is, therefore,

As a ﬁnal example, we consider an integral that, as with
the Sommerfeld expansion, can be converted to the sum of
an inﬁnite series. However, unlike the examples we have
considered so far, this series is related not to a periodic func-
tion, but a Bloch function. Consider the integral

This result can also be obtained using a branch cut in a con-
tour integral, or by other techniques not involving contour
integration.12
V. RESPONSE FUNCTIONS
Two additional examples where contour integration is
often used in physics are the Kramers–Kronig relations
for the linear response of a causal system and scattering
in the Born approximation. However, it is possible toobtain the standard results without contour integration,
and the alternative methods are in fact more physically
motivated.With the Born approximation for scattering in the
Schrodinger equation, one has to calculate the three-dimensional spatial Green’s function that satisﬁes the differ-
ential equation
ðr
2þk2ÞGðrÞ¼d3ðrÞ: (50)
One can Fourier transform this equation and then inverse
Fourier transform it13to obtain GðrÞ,

This is a singular integral, because the integrand diverges
when q¼6k:If one replaces kwith kþic;where cis an
inﬁnitesimal positive quantity, the singularity is removed,and the integral can be evaluated using contour integration
GðrÞ¼/C01
4peikr
r: (52)
However, one can avoid the replacement of kwith kþic;
which is difﬁcult to motivate, and in fact avoid the complexplane entirely, by realizing that the symmetry of GðrÞ
implies that it is a spherically symmetric function GðrÞ:This
can be evaluated14if one makes the physical choice that
GðrÞonly has outgoing waves from the origin.
Mathematically, this approach is similar to that in Sec. II,
where one solves the inhomogeneous differential equation
forI(k) instead of trying to evaluate its integral form, except
that the differential equation is now three-dimensional.
Turning to the Kramers–Kronig relations and using the
electromagnetic response of a dielectric medium as an exam-ple, these can be written as15
/C15ðxÞ=/C150/C01¼i
pPð1
/C01/C15ðx0Þ=/C150/C01
x/C0x0dx0; (53)
where /C15ðxÞis the frequency-dependent dielectric constant
andPrefers to the principal part of the integral. Taking the
real and imaginary parts of this equation yields two equa-tions that relate the real and imaginary parts of /C15ðxÞ:
This result can be derived15,16by treating xas a complex
variable, realizing that causality of the dielectric response
has implications for this extended function, and applying thisto some well-chosen contour integrals. The details are notimportant here, because we focus instead on the fact that
causality is much more naturally expressed in the time
domain. Thus, if the polarization Pðr;tÞin a region of the
dielectric is
Pðr;tÞ¼/C15
0ð1
/C01Gðt0ÞEðr;t/C0t0Þdt0(54)
in terms of the electric ﬁeld Eðr;tÞ;then causality implies
thatGðt<0Þ¼0:(The response to the electric ﬁeld is local
in space but non-local in time, so we replace Pðr;tÞand
Eðr;tÞwith PðtÞandEðtÞ, respectively.) The necessary and
sufﬁcient condition for this to be true is that17

and applying the convolution theorem to Eq. (54) gives us
~PðxÞ¼/C150~GðxÞ~EðxÞ;i.e., ~GðxÞ¼/C15ðxÞ=/C150/C01:Applying
the convolution theorem to Eq. (55)then yields

from which Eq. (53)follows.
Working in the time domain has advantages beyond
avoiding contour integration. First, the condition of causality
can be expressed as GðtÞ¼HðtÞGðtÞin terms of the
Heaviside step function, or GðtÞ¼½HðtÞþfðtÞHð/C0tÞ/C138GðtÞ
for any fðtÞ;instead of GðtÞ¼sgnðtÞGðtÞ:Although the
Fourier transforms of these alternative forms are initially dif-
ferent, the time-domain perspective assures us that all ofthem can be mapped to each other, and there is no additionalconsequence of causality hidden in the complex plane.
Second, sum rules for /C15ðxÞcan also be obtained transpar-
ently. If we assume that a time-independent electric ﬁeld is
switched on at t¼0;the electrons initially respond as free
particles, so that

ume and the Oðt3Þterm depends on interparticle forces.
Comparing with Eq. (54), we see that Gðt>0Þ¼NZe2t=
ðm/C150ÞþOðt2Þ:Since G(t) is a real function, its symmetric
and antisymmetric parts have real and imaginary Fourier
transforms, respectively, from which we conclude, with the

where g(t) is a smooth function of t. It is clear from the dis-
cussion above that there are no additional sum rules; G(t)beyond O(t) is non-universal. Extensions to anisotropic
media are also trivial. To our knowledge, the time-domainderivation of these sum rules has not been discussed before.
VI. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have seen that it is possible to evaluate
certain integrals in physics for which contour integration isnormally used by alternative means. The alternative methodsdiscussed here are useful if contour integration is not taughtbefore these expressions are encountered. Various seriessums are also evaluated.
This is not to claim that all physically relevant problems
that can be done using complex analysis are amenable toother methods, which is much broader than contour integra-tion. Conformal mapping can be used to solve Laplace’sequation in two dimensions in regions of various shapes,which is useful in electromagnetism.
18The Bromwich inte-
gral1,2can be used to systematically evaluate inverse
Laplace transforms, although in engineering applications,where Laplace transforms are more widely used than inphysics, the use of inverse Laplace transform tables is com-mon.
5The method of steepest descent to evaluate integrals
can require deforming the contour of integration into thecomplex plane,19although such a deformation is not needed
for many applications. The properties of analytic functionscan sometimes be used to solve integral equation problems.20
Integrals that are evaluated by contour integration of func-tions with branch cuts cannot be done easily without com-plex analysis; two of these were solved at the end of Sec. IV,
but the method given there does not cover all such branchcut integrals.
