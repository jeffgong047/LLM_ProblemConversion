The recently unveiled deep-ﬁeld images from the James Webb Space Telescope have renewed
interest in what we can and cannot see of the universe. Answering these questions requires
understanding the so-called “cosmological horizons” and the “Hubble sphere.” Here, we review the
topic of cosmological horizons in a form that university physics teachers can use in their lessons,using the latest data about the so-called standard “Lambda cold dark matter” ( KCDM) model.
Graphical representations are plotted in terms of both conformal and proper coordinates as an aid
to understand the propagation of light in the expanding universe at various epochs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Amber Straughn, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland, said during the live event of presenta-tion of the ﬁrst James Webb’s images:
1“Today, for the ﬁrst
time, we’re seeing brand new stars that were previously
completely hidden from our view.” This might suggest that with
technological evolution we will be able to see virtually every-thing in the universe. In general, this statement should be under-stood as limited to the so-called observable universe , bounded
by the particle horizon .E v e nw i t h i nt h eo b s e r v a b l eu n i v e r s e ,
two questions can be asked: (i) Is it possible to observe galaxiesthat, due to the expansion of the universe, were receding atsuperluminal speeds when they emitted their light? (ii) Waiting
even for inﬁnite time, will it be possible in the future to see the
entire universe? Answers to these questions require the knowl-edge of the so-called cosmological horizons , a topic that has
already been the subject of several publications. The ﬁrst com-
prehensive one, aimed at providing a clear deﬁnition and repre-sentation of horizons is Rindler’s 1956 paper,
2which
summarizes all previous works on the subject. However, it is
obsolete today. Another noteworthy article is by Edward
Harrison,3which, however, was written in 1991, well before the
discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. The ﬁrsteducational article devoted to the topic of cosmological horizons
belongs to the same period (1993) and was published in this
same journal
4by George Francis Rayner Ellis and Tony
Rothman. The treatment, however, was limited to a matter-onlyuniverse, which is no longer acceptable today. More recent and
up-to-date works on the topic are those by Margalef-Bentabol,
Margalef-Bentabol, and Cepa
5,6and that by Faraoni in Chapter
3o f Cosmological and Black Hole Apparent Horizons .7
However, none of these references provide calculations of the
horizons with the current parameters of the KC D Mm o d e l .T h i s
literature, therefore, cannot be used directly to calculate the pathof photons emitted from different sources in the expanding uni-
verse and to evaluate how these sources are located with respect
to the horizons. It is worth mentioning that there have also beenpublications aimed at correcting misconceptions on the topic,such as the seminal ones by Davis
8–10which, however, do not
include a comprehensive treatment of cosmological horizons.
We will give, here, a didactic presentation of cosmological
horizons in the case of a ﬂat universe, in view of the fact thatexperimental evidence has shown that our universe does notdeviate appreciably from ﬂatness.
11The presentation is
intended as a support for academics who want to teach thetopic of cosmological horizons in introductory courses onrelativity or cosmology. Since all the formulas for the vari-
ous quantities under consideration are derived in the text,
students could draw the graphs themselves or devise newones, using tools such as
MATHEMATICA . Sections II–IV are
intended to provide the necessary background by summariz-ing the known information. In particular, in Sec. II, we will
brieﬂy present Hubble’s law, the Hubble radius, and the pastlight cone. In Sec. III, we will deﬁne cosmological horizons,
while the third introductory section will be devoted to thederivation of the expansion law of the scale factor.
II. THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE
The starting point is the metric of the homogeneous and
isotropic universe. This metric is known as the Friedmann–Lema ^ıtre–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric that in spheri-
cal coordinates reads

where kis the curvature parameter. We will be concerned
with the case of a ﬂat universe, where k¼0. The dimension-
less function a(t), called the scale factor , accounts for the
expansion, while ris called the comoving radial coordinate .
It is customary to assume that, at this time, ðt¼t0Þ;aðt0Þ
¼1, so that the comoving radial coordinate represents the
proper radial distance at this time. At the generic time t, the
proper radial distance is given by

evaluation of the scale factor at the time of the emission of theradiation we receive today by means of the relation13

Here, we have deﬁned the function

called Hubble parameter , whose value at this time, denoted
byH0/C17Hðt0Þ, is customarily (but improperly) called the
Hubble constant . The relation (6)evaluated at this time
vrecðt0Þ¼H0Rðt0Þ (8)
constitutes the so-called Hubble’s law, experimentally found
and published by Hubble in 1929.14Expression (4)is useful
for determining the velocity that a photon travelling in space
along radial directions has with respect to us. In fact, know-
ing that the peculiar speed of light is always equal to c, this
formula allows us to obtain the velocity relative to us of a
photon that at time tis at the comoving radial coordinate r
and moving radially toward us ( vpec¼/C0c),
vphotðtÞ¼rdaðtÞ

We observe that if vrec>c, the photon’s velocity becomes
positive and, thus, points away from us. The comoving radial

: (10)
A photon emitted from a source that has a comoving radial
coordinate greater than rHfails to approach us at the moment
of emission. However, as we shall see, the Hubble sphere
also expands with time so that in some cases it comes to
“encompass” the photon which then moves towards us.
As is well known, photons travel along null geodesics. If
we consider photons moving along radial directions, from
the FLRW metric (1)with k¼0, we can write that
aðtÞdr¼6cdt: (11)
The positive sign applies to photons travelling away from
the origin, while the negative sign describes photons moving
toward the origin. Taking into account Eq. (5), relation (11)reﬂects the fact that the peculiar speed of light is always
equal to c. By integrating Eq. (11) with the negative sign
between the space-time point of emission and our space-time
point of observation ðt¼t0;r¼0Þ, we obtain the comoving
distance travelled by light from the point of emission to us.Denoting this distance by r
LCðt0;tÞ, we get the deﬁnition
rLCðt0;tÞ/C17ðt0
tcdt0
aðt0Þðt<t0Þ: (12)
The function rLCðt0;tÞfor all t<t0describes our past light
cone, which represents the locus of space-time points from
which the photons that reach us now were emitted. If insteadof present time t
0, we consider the generic time t/C3, we obtain
the past light cone relative to time t/C3,
rLCðt/C3;tÞ/C17ðt/C3
tcdt0
aðt0Þðt<t/C3Þ: (13)
III. THE HORIZONS
Each past light cone has a maximum distance rLCðt/C3;0Þ.
This is the comoving radial distance travelled by a radiation(e.g., gravitational) emitted at time zero and received at timet
/C3. It has been given the name of comoving particle horizon ,
and we denote it by rPHðt/C3Þ. Removing the superscript/C3, the
comoving particle horizon at time tis, therefore, deﬁned by
rPHðtÞ/C17ðt
0cdt0
aðt0Þ: (14)
Of particular interest is the comoving particle horizon at pre-
sent time, rPHðt0Þ: It represents the farthest comoving dis-
tance from which we can retrieve information from the pastand constitutes the boundary between the region whose
events have already been observed and the region whose
events cannot yet be observed. We mention that sometimestheoptical horizon r
OHðt0Þis introduced.7It is simply the
comoving radial distance travelled by photons emitted whenlight has decoupled from matter. These photons constitute
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and
originate from the maximum distance one can see in theelectromagnetic domain. Indicating with t
lsthe time of emis-
sion of the CMBR, the optical horizon is deﬁned by
rOHðtÞ/C17ðt
tlscdt0
aðt0Þðt>tlsÞ: (15)
The concept of particle horizon is more relevant than that of
optical horizon, since there could be gravitational waves that
bring us information about what happened before photondecoupling.
The light cone relative to an inﬁnite time r
LCð1 ;tÞis of
particular interest. It constitutes the locus of the space-timepoints ( t,r) from which the radiation will reach r¼0a ta n
inﬁnite time. The relevance of this light cone lies in the fact
that it constitutes a horizon because a photon emitted from a
position beyond this limit can never reach r¼0. It is, there-
fore, called the comoving event horizon at time t, and we
denote it by r
EHðtÞ. From Eq. (13), we get
rEHðtÞ/C17ð1

To fully understand the implications that horizons and the
Hubble sphere have on the visibility of cosmic objects, it is
helpful to plot them in space-time diagrams. To this end, it isﬁrst necessary to determine the time dependence of the scale
factor.
IV. EVOLUTION OF THE SCALE FACTOR
We can obtain the equations for determining the time
dependence of the scale factor by substituting the metric (1)
into the Einstein ﬁeld equations. The stress-energy tensor forthe isotropic, homogeneous universe is that of a perfect ﬂuid,
given by
12

c2/C18/C19
ulu/C23þpgl/C23; (17)
qandpbeing the mass density and pressure, respectively,
andulis the 4-velocity vector ﬁeld of the ﬂuid. Due to the
symmetry of the metric (1), the ten ﬁeld equations reduce to
two, known as Friedmann equations, that in the case of k¼0
are13

; (20)
which expresses the conservation of mass-energy, since it
coincides with rlTl0¼0.12If the ﬂuid is a mixture of two
or more non-interacting ﬂuids, such an equation holds sepa-rately for each ﬂuid. This assumption is crucial for the solu-
tion of the Friedmann equations and is generally accepted.
Furthermore, it is assumed that each ﬂuid has an equation ofstate of the type

barionic and dark matter) and 1/3 for radiation. Using previ-
ous assumptions and substituting Eq. (21) into Eq. (20),w e
arrive at
qmðtÞ¼qm0aðtÞ/C03for matter ; (22)
qrðtÞ¼qr0aðtÞ/C04for radiation ; (23)
where qm0andqr0are the matter density and radiation den-
sity at this time, respectively. We will assume in the follow-ing that matter dominates over radiation, an assumption that
only fails in the ﬁrst /C2430 000 year, a period of time that rep-
resents about two millionths of the current lifetime of theuniverse. For simplicity, we will omit the subscript
min the
matter density in the following. Substituting Eq. (22) into
Eq.(18), we get1

Depending on the sign, this expression describes a monotoni-
cally increasing or decreasing scale factor. Since the scale
factor is currently increasing, we must choose the plus sign.Furthermore, by deﬁning x¼a

form

Eq.(30) can be easily integrated. The lower integration limit
for time is zero, while the lower limit for xdepends on the
value that the scale factor takes on at time zero. It is generally
assumed to be zero, but actually, it could also be other thanzero, as in the case where an initial period of inﬂation is con-sidered. In any case, it is a very small value on a cosmological
scale, so we will conform to the custom of considering it equal
to zero. We, thus, arrive at the following expression:

(32)
We emphasize that this time dependence of the scale factor
is relative to the KCDM cosmological model that best
describes the universe we live in, which assumes that it is
ﬂat and that the contribution from radiation, affecting only
the very early stages of cosmic expansion, is negligible.

V. THE HORIZONS IN CONFORMAL
COORDINATES
The representation of cosmological horizons becomes par-
ticularly simple if we introduce a new time variable, denotedbyg, deﬁned by the relation
gðtÞ/C17ð
t
0dt0
aðt0Þ; (33)
so that
dg¼dt
aðtÞ: (34)
The simpliﬁcation occurs because this last expression is the
integrand that appears in Eqs. (12),(14), and (16) that deﬁne
our past light cone, the particle horizon, and the event hori-zon, respectively. As a function of the new time variable, the
FLRW metric (1)with k¼0 reads
ds
2¼a2ðgÞ/C0c2dg2þdr2þr2dh2þsin2hdu2/C0/C1 /C2/C3
;(35)
which is a ﬂat Minkowski metric except for the conformal
factor a2ðgÞ; for this reason, gis called the conformal time .
We will refer to the conformal time and to the comoving
radial distance as “conformal coordinates.” In order to evalu-ate the integrals in Eqs. (12),(14), and (16), once expression
(34) has been inserted, we need to determine the values of
gðt
0Þ(that we denote with g0) and of gð1Þ. This last, as we
will see, in the case of the KCDM model assumes a ﬁnite
value that we denote with gmax. We will calculate these val-
ues in Sec. VI. Substituting expression (34) into Eqs. (12),
(14), and (16), we get, respectively,
Past Light Cone at g0:

adopt the same lengths for the units of Glyr and Gyr.

Substituting the value (42) into the upper integration limit of
Eq. (39) and using the expression (41), we obtain

obtain gmax¼63:6960:49 Gyr. It is useful, for future pur-
poses, to study the behaviour of gðtÞfor both small and large
values of nt. In the ﬁrst case, in the integrand of Eq. (39) we
can replace sinh ðxÞwith its series expansion near x¼0,
obtaining at ﬁrst order

This expression shows that for large values of cosmic time,
the conformal time slows to a halt. The function gðtÞis
shown in Fig. 1on logarithmic scales. We are now ready to
graph our past light cone and the two horizons accordingto Eqs. (36)–(38) , plotting the conformal time vs. the
comoving radial distance. In this conformal representation,
the world lines of comoving cosmic objects arevertical straight lines. To represent the Hubble sphere, we
use Eq. (10) substituting in it the expression (32), thus
obtaining

To get rHðgÞ, we would have to invert Eq. (39) to get tðgÞto
be substituted in Eq. (47). Unfortunately, this step can only
be performed numerically.17However, it is possible to obtain
approximate expressions for both small and large values ofnt. In the ﬁrst case, restricting ourselves to the ﬁrst-order
term of the series expansion of the right-hand side of Eq.(47)in terms of ntin the proximity of nt¼0, we get

HðtÞ’3c
2nXK
1/C0XK/C18/C191=3
ðntÞ1=3ðnt/C281Þ: (48)
Using expression (44), we can then write the Hubble radius
in terms of the conformal time as
rHðgÞ’1
2cgðg/C281Þ: (49)
This is a straight line of slope 2 in the plane ðr;cgÞ. Instead,
for large values of nt, we can adopt for expression (47) the

21=3nXK
1/C0XK/C18/C191=3

Then thanks to Eq. (46), we can ﬁnally write rHas a function
ofg,
rHðgÞ’cðgmax/C0gÞðg/C291Þ: (51)
This is exactly the expression of the event horizon (16):a t
large conformal times, the Hubble sphere becomes tangentto the event horizon. We will see later that this is because thephysical velocity of photons proceeding along the event hori-zon (which is a null geodesic) tends progressively to zero,and thus, the event horizon tends to the Hubble sphere. It canbe shown numerically that everywhere else (that is, forg<g
max) relation rEHðgÞ>rHðgÞresults.
While the straight line described in Eq. (49)diverges from
r¼0, the straight line (51) converges to r¼0. This means
that the conformal Hubble radius must reach a maximumvalue. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine it inclosed form, but it can be found numerically that its value is
ðr
HÞmax’16:52 Glyr at conformal time g¼39:25 Gyr (cos-
mic time t¼7.65 Gyr).
All the curves are shown in Fig. 2, which comprehensively
illustrates the dynamics of each light emission event, thus
making it clear what structures we can see today, will see in
the future, and will never see, regardless of the resolving
power of telescopes. We begin by considering the A0
event placed on our past light cone near time zero (or,
for convenience, at the time of the surface of last scattering
tls’380 000 years: It could be a spot in the CMBR with
a slightly different temperature). Such an emission event
occurred at the comoving radial coordinate r’cg0
¼47:1060:39 Glyr, well outside the Hubble sphere, whose
radius goes to zero for t!0. So the photons emitted in A0
toward the origin had a receding (positive) physical velocity
relative to us. In particular, Eq. (6)with t¼tlsgives
vrecðtlsÞ’65c, a highly superluminal. However, as can be
seen from Fig. 2, in comoving coordinates, the velocity was
of approach (negative). This is because in conformal coordi-nates, the expansion velocity is absent and, thus, the total
velocity coincides with the peculiar velocity, which for light
is always equal to 6c. In fact, based on Eqs. (11) and(34),
in conformal coordinates, the velocity of light always results,
v
pec¼dr=dg¼6c, so there cannot be superluminal veloci-
ties. Therefore, in these coordinates, photons emitted in A0
approached the Hubble sphere, which they reached at g
’31:91 Gyr ( t’4:05 Gyr). After that, they travelled toward
us at an increasing physical speed. Meanwhile, a possible
lump in A0has evolved into structures that now reside in A1
(r¼rPHðt0Þ¼cg0;g¼g0): structures that will never be
visible to us, since they fall well outside the event horizon,
whose value at this time is rEHðt0Þ¼cðgmax/C0g0Þ’16:59
60:18 Glyr. Simultaneously with the CMBR coming from
event A0, we also receive the light coming from all events
laying on our past light cone, for example, events C2(at
r¼20.0 Glyr) and E(atr¼10.0 Glyr). While the emission
from C2was still outside the Hubble sphere, the emission
from Ewas inside, and thus, its photons always had negative
velocities in both comoving and physical coordinates.
Studying Fig. 2leads us to the following series of
conclusions:
(A) An emission of light that occurred at any space-time
point inside our past light cone has reached us in everycase, regardless of whether the emission point was
inside or outside the Hubble sphere (see, e.g., emission
event C
1). In principle, we could see all emission events
that lie on our past light cone. It is only a matter of tele-
scope resolution at the various observing frequencies
whether we are actually able to see them. In this regard,
the JWST telescope has greatly improved in resolving
power over the previous Hubble telescope, and thus, it
has become possible to see sources not bright enough to
be detected by Hubble.
(B) An emission of light that occurred at any space-time
point outside our past light cone but within the eventhorizon, entered (or will enter) the Hubble sphere, if not
already within it, and will reach us at a future time
between now and inﬁnity (see, e.g., emission event Bat
r¼30.0 Glyr, g¼25:0 Gyr that will reach us at g
¼55:0G y ro r t’24:8 Gyr). Whether this radiation can
be detected will depend only on the sensitivity of the
telescopes.Fig. 1. Representation of conformal time gas a function of cosmic time t.

(C) An emission of light occurring anywhere outside the
event horizon will never be able to reach us. In particu-
lar, we will never see the background radiation emitted
by cosmic structures having a comoving radial coordi-nate greater than 63.69 Glyr. This is a relevant point thatcan only be seen in this diagram, since the representa-tion in physical coordinates does not highlight this fact.
(D) We can see objects that have always been receding at
superluminal speeds, like the comoving structure identi-
ﬁed with the letter C, of which the emission events C
0,
C1,C2are shown. In the conformal coordinate graph,
this is clear because the photon recession velocity isabsent, whereas, as we shall see, in the physical coordi-nate graph, this is explained because the Hubble sphereexpands faster than the recession velocity of the emitted
photons, catches up with them, and encompasses them.
(E) Once a cosmic object falls within the particle horizon, it
remains within this horizon. For example, in Fig. 2, the
light coming from the cosmic structures placed at theradial distance of 20.0 Glyr on the surface of last scatter-ing ( C
0event of CMBR emission), entered the particle
horizon at the conformal time g¼10:0 Gyr, and
became visible to us at g¼20:0 Gyr. They have been
visible ever since and will still be visible in the future:for example, the light emitted at C
1(g¼20:0G y r )
reached us at g¼40:0 Gyr, while the light emitted at C2
on our past light cone reaches us just now. It follows
that statements referring to galaxies entering and then
leaving the particle horizon are false.
(F) On the contrary, there can be cosmic structures that
enter and then leave the Hubble sphere. An example,shown in Fig. 2, is cosmic objects placed at a comoving
radial distance of 15.0 Glyr, which entered the Hubble
sphere at g’31:4 Gyr (event D
1) and exited at g
’46:0 Gyr (event D2). We now see these cosmic
objects as they were when they crossed our past lightcone, at g’32:1 Gyr.VII. PHYSICAL COORDINATES DIAGRAM
Using conformal diagrams implies a penalty: They
completely hide true distances. The proper distance between
different cosmic regions when t!0 goes to zero, while in
the conformal diagram it remains constant, ﬁxed at today’svalue. The physical distances near t¼0 are, thus, severely
distorted, appearing much larger than they actually are, and
this distortion becomes inﬁnitely large as t!0. We, there-
fore, reproduce the key features of Fig. 2in physical coordi-
nates (cosmic time and proper radial distance) by replacing
the conformal time gwith the cosmic time tand multiplying
the comoving coordinates r(t) at time tby the scale factor
a(t). The graph takes on the appearance shown in Fig. 3,
where the lattice of constant comoving radial distances is
translated into a series of lines starting from the origin and
progressively diverging. The drawback of this representa-tion, compared to the conformal one, lies in the fact that
everything is “squashed” toward the null proper radial dis-
tance at time zero. For this reason, Fig. 4shows a detail of
this region, in which the same lengths are adopted for the
units of Glyr and Gyr. This ﬁgure also illustrates some
details of Fig. 2such as light rays propagating towards the
origin from the BandC
1emission events, and the paths of
comoving particles A,C, and D. The functional dependencies
on cosmic time of particle and event horizons expressed in
terms of proper radial distance, as well as the equation of ourpast light cone, become more complex than those in terms of
conformal coordinates (36)–(38) . However, we can easily
derive the analytical form of the different entities.
For our past light cone in terms of physical coordinates,
R

As can be seen from Figs. 3and4, the past light cone takes
on the appearance of a “drop” because toward time zero theFig. 2. Graph of past light cone at t0, particle horizon, event horizon, and Hubble sphere in conformal coordinates, together with the paths to the origin of pho-

were originally very close to the origin, from which theymoved away until they crossed the Hubble sphere at t’4:06
Gyr reaching the maximum proper radial distance,R
LCðt0;4:06Þ’5:85 Glyr. They then began to approach us.
Like Fig. 2, Fig. 4also shows the light tracks toward us for
the emissions that occurred at the C1andBevents. These
paths belong to past light cones pertaining to cosmic timest
/C3’8:12 Gyr and t/C3’24:85 Gyr. Like our past light cone,all these light cones reach their maximum radial proper dis-
tance when they cross the Hubble sphere.

tance. However, as we already pointed out, this does not
mean that we will be able to see the entire universe: regionsthat are at comoving coordinates r>63.69 Glyr will never

VIII. HORIZONS AND REDSHIFT
The connection of the previously analysed quantities with
experimental observables is made through the cosmologicalredshift z. The redshift allows the direct determination of the
scale factor by means of Eq. (3)and, through Eq. (32),t h e
KCDM model provides an evaluation of the cosmic time at
which the emission event occurred. By virtue of the relation-ship between redshift and emission time, all quantities can bedescribed and represented as a function of redshift. Figure 5
gives such a representation. In particular, the equation for the
past light cone in terms of physical coordinates, Eq. (52),g i v e s
the proper radial distance of the emitting body at the time ofemission. On this curve lie all the emission events that we candetect today. Below it lie the emission events whose radiationhas come to us in the past (pale yellow area in Fig. 5), while
above, but below the event horizon curve, are the emissionevents whose radiation will reach us in the future (pale bluearea in Fig. 5). The equation for the past light cone (12)gives
the comoving radial distance of the emitting body, which coin-cides with its current proper radial distance.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
Referring to the so-called standard cosmological KCDM
model, the properties of cosmological horizons (particle hori-zon, optical horizon, and event horizon), the past light cone atvarious epochs (especially our past light cone), and the Hubblesphere have been illustrated. With the help of graphical repre-sentations, both in conformal and physical coordinates, theradial motion of photons was examined, and their physicalvelocities with respect to us were derived. It has, thus, beenclariﬁed what portions of the universe we can and will be ableto see in the future, and what we can never see. The treatmentis aimed at teachers who wish to comprehensively explain cos-mological horizons in their Relativity or Cosmology courses.AUTHOR DECLARATIONS
