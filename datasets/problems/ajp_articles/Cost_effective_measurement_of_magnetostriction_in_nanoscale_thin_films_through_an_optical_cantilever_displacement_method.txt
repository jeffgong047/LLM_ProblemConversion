A cost-effective method for the quantitative characterization of the magnetostrictive effect in thin ﬁlms
is presented. In this method, a sample’s magnetostriction is extrapolated from the tip displ acement of a
thin-ﬁlm magnetostrictive cantilever. The tip displacement is measured by monitoring the position of a
reﬂected laser beam using two differentially coupled photodiode positioning sensors. In contrast withalternative optical deﬂection-angle devices designed for educational purposes, the detection limit of
our setup resolves submicron-level displacements from nanoscale thin ﬁlms. The efﬁcacy of the system
is demonstrated through measurements using amorphous 200-nm thick Terfenol-D/Si (100) bimorphcantilevers. In these measurements, magnetostriction values of 106 63:5 ppm at 64300 Oe applied
ﬁeld were attained, where the voltage noise ﬂoor was 60.05 V (a cantilever displacement uncertainty
of670 nm). In-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization curves and crystallographic x-ray
diffraction (XRD) were performed to determine the magnetic behavior and conﬁrm the amorphous
nature of the ﬁlms, respectively. The experimental methods and material characterization systems
demonstrated here enhance the understanding of complex magnetic phenomena and introduce commonmeasurement techniques to better equip students with the skills for insightful analysis of fundamental
magnetic physics.

I. INTRODUCTION
The precise measurement of the magnetostrictive effect in
thin ﬁlm materials is a complex task and is often the subject
of magnetics education. Magnetostriction is an inherent prop-erty of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials anddescribes the change in a sample’s dimensions upon applica-
tion of a magnetic ﬁeld H, which enables the conversion of
electromagnetic energy to mechanical energy or vice versa.This applied Hwill cause magnetic domains—regions of
aligned spins and orbitals of unpaired electrons—most closely
aligned with the direction of Hto accumulate over domains
oriented in different directions. Accordingly, the dipoleswithin these differently oriented domains will experience atorque from Hand rotate to align themselves with this ﬁeld.
Rotations result in an induced strain as the spacing between
atoms must change to accompany the realignment of the orbi-tals in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.
1,2Depending on its
sign, the magnetostrictive strain kmsincreases or decreases
until it levels off towards a saturation value ksat. This effect
has been exploited for sensory and actuation purposes foundin milling process monitoring,3high-accuracy position sen-
sors,4linear motors,5among other applications.
Since its discovery in 1842, numerous methods have been
devised to directly measure magnetostriction as a function of
the strength of the applied magnetic ﬁeld H, including strain
gauges,6laser Doppler/holographic interferometry,7,8and
deﬂection-angle devices.9–11Strain gauges offer an accurate
and cost-effective approach commonly used for bulk crystal-line materials, but cannot be applied to thin ﬁlms due totheir signiﬁcantly reduced dimensions ( <1lm) and micro/
nanoscale displacements.
1Interferometry uses the superposi-
tion of interfering waves between the sample and a referencemirror to extract information about either phase or amplitudechanges. These apparatuses offer incredible precision, but
are meticulous to implement, expensive (especially for edu-
cational demonstrations), and highly sensitive due to theoptics required.
8Instead, an alternative method to cost effec-
tively and accurately measure the magnetostrictive effect isthrough the deﬂection method,12wherein the displacement
of a reﬂected laser beam from the sample is read via a posi-tioning sensor or camera. With these systems, calibration

and further data processing are required to properly assess
equipment sensitivity constants (e.g., the apparatus’ camera
constant K; see discussion below) but offer substantially more
cost-effectiveness and less complexity than interferometry-based techniques. Previous cantilever-based setups incorpo-rating the deﬂection angle approach and designed for
classroom purposes have demonstrated accurate measure-
ments for ﬁlm thicknesses t
fin the range of tens of lm.9,10
The new setup described in this paper is ideal for educational
purposes as it is suitable for nanoscale thin ﬁlms with tfin the
hundreds of nm deposited in a number of ways—sputtering,
evaporation, or molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE)—and has amuch lower detection limit k
DLfor a variety of bimorph canti-
lever proportions than similar setups suggested by Laumann
et al.9and Adhikari et al.10Furthermore, even though similar
apparatuses exist using voltage measurements, they are need-lessly complex to set up, require a complex array of beam
splitters and mirrors,11and ultimately distract from the heart
of the experiment, despite their accuracy. On the other hand,the beneﬁts associated with the versatility of our system, easeof set up and operation through educationally available free
software (e.g., the entire experimental procedure can easily be
automated in MATLAB ,Python , or similar programs), and
capability to measure magnetostriction of a variety of ﬁlmsfrom nanoscale to bulk thickness are promising for general
laboratory and educational purposes.
This article outlines our cost-effective magnetostriction
measurement apparatus with nanoscale precision designed foreducational purposes. In Sec. II, a theoretical background is
provided to outline the equations required to extract k
msfrom
the raw data, followed by a derivation of the detection limit
kDL. Custom and commercially available components utilized
in apparatus design and the methods for implementation are
provided in Sec. III. To show the efﬁcacy of the system, mag-
netostriction measurements are performed on nanoscale amor-phous Terfenol-D (Tb
0:3Dy0:7Fe1:92) thin ﬁlms with measured
values of 106 63:5p p m a t 64300 Oe. Magnetic hysteresis
curves and properties (e.g., actual Msatvalue and remnant
magnetization Mr) are further analyzed with in-plane (IP) and
out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic hysteresis loops measured by ascanning superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) magnetometer to supplement characterization of the
amorphous Terfenol-D samples studied. This study illustratesthe various unique magnetic and structural properties of ferro-
magnetic and ferrimagnetic materials that may be emphasized
when performing this experiment. For example, performing acomplete magnetic ﬁeld sweep reveals the property of mag-netic hysteresis, a critical component for many applications
ranging from geological record keeping
13to computer hard
disk drive (HDD) storage14to transformers.15Additionally,
these hysteresis loops enable further quantitative study of amaterial’s magnetic response (e.g., characterization of its
magnetically soft and hard axes from IP and OOP SQUID
data, among other quantities which are discussed below).From an instructional standpoint, the focus should remain on
the analysis of these various magnetomechanical properties of
the collected data for students to better understand the reason-ing behind the use of certain magnetic materials in theirrespective applications.
II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Bimorph magnetostrictive cantilevers are constructed of
two layers, consisting of a substrate material that exhibits nomagnetostriction, followed by a thin magnetostrictive ﬁlm as
illustrated in Fig. 1. In the absence of an applied magnetic
ﬁeld (i.e., H¼0), the ﬁlm layer has a rest length of L
f. Upon
application of a magnetic ﬁeld, the length of the thin ﬁlm
layer changes through longitudinal and transverse deforma-
tions causing the cantilever to deﬂect transversely (see Fig.1). During this process, the dimensions of the substrate layer
remain constant exhibiting no magnetostriction. Measuringthe transverse cantilever displacement requires sensitiveequipment, which is accomplished by a cantilever deﬂectionmeasurement system consisting of an incident laser beamand a position detector that determines the position of adeﬂected laser beam as shown in Fig. 2. The position of the
laser beam on the position detector is derived from the dif-ference in beam intensity, which corresponds to a voltageoutput provided by a differential operational ampliﬁer circuit(see Fig. 3). However, the extent to which the voltage
changes for any given position change is unknown anddependent on the geometry of the apparatus. This factor,termed the apparatus’ camera constant K , needs to be
obtained prior to magnetostriction measurements and isrequired to correlate the displacements in the laser beam’sposition on the position detector to the voltage changes givenby

ﬁt line is determined in which the slope of the curve equates to
the camera constant K(see the supplementary material40for
data processing and additional discussion).
For measurement of magnetostriction in a cantilever
beam, the cantilever experiences an angular deﬂection at Lf
ofhupon application of a magnetic ﬁeld ( H¼6H^x). To
measure this displacement, an incident laser beam is shone
onto the ﬁlm’s endpoint Lf, which is then reﬂected back onto
the position detector. For a cantilever experiencing a uniformload throughout its length (e.g., due to the magnetic ﬁeld H),
the magnetostrictive tip displacement D

approximated for sufﬁciently small has

The factor of 3/4 is derived from the analytical relationship
between a cantilever beam’s free end slope and maximum
deﬂection for a uniformly distributed load. During the mag-
netic ﬁeld sweep, the reﬂected laser beam will continuouslychange its x-position, which corresponds to a change in the
differential voltage. From the deﬁnition of the camera con-stant, the displacement on the position detector during the
magnetic ﬁeld sweep r
ican be expressed in terms of the
measured voltage at any speciﬁc instant DVias

The magnetostrictive strain of a sample is deﬁned as
kms/C17DLf=Lf, but measuring this quantity is difﬁcult and
requires precise equipment. Derived from the satisfaction of
boundary and compatibility conditions, van de Riet16proved
that if the cantilever is free on one end, its width w(i.e.,
depth in the y-dir.) is negligible compared to Lf, and tf/C28ts,
then the magnetostriction of the ﬁlm layer can be calculated

where Eis Young’s modulus, tis the thickness, /C23is Poisson’s
ratio, and the subscripts f and s denote these properties for the
ﬁlm and substrate, respectively. Since the cantilever is a
bimorph, the elastic properties of the substrate must also be
accounted for, as the mechanical coupling between the sub-
strate and magnetostrictive layers inﬂuences the bending of
the beam, which in turn dictates the measured tip displace-
ment Dms.E q u a t i o n (6), moreover, assumes the deposition is
ideal (i.e., the ﬁlm layer is evenly distributed across the
entirety of the substrate). Ensuring that the cantilever abides
by all of these requirements is salient to the experiment’s reli-
ability and enables the use of Eq. (6)to accurately infer kms
from minute laser-beam position displacement—provided that
all of the geometrical conditions and assumptions are adhered
to accordingly. Film deposition techniques such as sputtering
and MBE mechanically couple the ﬁlm and substrate layers
without the use of a bonding agent or other crude methods
that would impact the bending response of the cantilever.
Furthermore, these methods evenly deposit the two layers on
top of each other with customizable tf. The efﬁcacy of these
methods allow Eq. (6)to be used to correlate Dmstokms.
In our setup, the magnetic ﬁeld is swept in the direction par-
allel along the cantilever’s length, i.e., along the x-direction
in Fig. 5. Additionally, there is an option for biasing permanent
magnets that provide Hbiasand saturate the cantilever along the
y-axis. By applying Hfrom the electromagnets, we obtain the
magnetostriction that corresponds to a 90/C14domain rotation (see
Fig.5), and for simplicity, one magnetostriction coefﬁcient kms
will be used to describe the ﬁlm’s dimensional change.
Since the data are read from a data acquisition (DAQ)
device that is processing measurements collected by a differ-
ential op-amp circuit, it is desirable to rewrite Eq. (6)in
terms of the differential voltage DVi. Replacing Dmswith Eq.

The substrate and ﬁlm layers are also assumed to be mechan-
ically isotropic with the experiment taking place at constant
temperature such that no thermally induced strains are gener-ated (see supplementary material40Secs. I and II for an in-
depth discussion of thermal effects on error). Checking that
the magnetostriction is discernible from thermally induced
curvature for a given geometrical and material conﬁgurationis critical to obtaining sensible results.
Equation (7)is reliant on Poisson’s ratio and Young’s
modulus of the ﬁlm and substrate layers. However, exper-imentally measuring the values of Eand /C23of bulk materi-
als are quite complex and require sophisticated sample
geometries which must be placed in load frames. In therealm of thin ﬁlms, estimations of Eand /C23are commonly
taken from bulk values as they are even more difﬁcult to
obtain accurately. We are forced to instruct students and
their instructors to obtain the Young’s moduli andPoisson’s ratio of the substrate and ﬁlm from their bulkcounterparts (or for the thin ﬁlm if available), which are
readily accessible in peer-reviewed manuscripts, theses,
and dissertations.
Differential voltage measurements are subject to mea-
surement uncertainties, noise, and equipment detection lim-its that dictate the peak resolution of the setup. The noise

noise in a system, including thermal ﬂuctuations, Johnson-Nyquist noise, power supply noise, 1 =fnoise, laser beam

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE
The apparatus for the optical cantilever displacement
method for the measurement of magnetostriction consists ofan electromagnet connected to an 8-Ampere bi-directionalpower supply, a He-Ne laser (wavelength k¼632 nm, a
beam diameter of 0.81 mm, and a source divergence of 1.0
mrad), a custom-designed 3D printed cantilever mount with
a 900 Oe bias ﬁeld supplied by four NdFeB permanent mag-nets (see Fig. 6), and a custom single-axis position detectorFig. 5. (Color online) Magnetic domain rotation mechanism associated with
kmsðHÞasH!Hsat, which induces a ﬁlm length change DLfðHÞarising
from spin-orbit coupling (Refs. 17and18). The ﬁlm is initially saturated
along the ﬁlm’s short side by the biasing permanent magnets, which supplies
a constant bias magnetic ﬁeld Hbias.

composed of two separate photodiodes (ams-OSRAM SFH
2440 with peak sensitivity at k¼620 nm and an active area
of 7.02 mm2, see Fig. 7separately). The applied magnetic
ﬁeld provided by the electromagnet was swept using the
National Instruments NI-9263 DAQ device’s analog outputcorrelating to –8 A to þ8 A output from the power supply
controlled by a MATLAB script (see supplementary material
40
Sec. VII for the automation software). Cantilever deﬂection
Dmswas measured by a custom single-axis position detector
consisting of two separate photodiodes connected to a differ-ential operational ampliﬁer (Part # Texas Instruments
INA121; see supplementary material40Sec. VI for comments
on op-amp conﬁguration). The camera constant Kwas deter-
mined by moving the position detector along the x-axis using
a single-axis linear stage micrometer while recording thechange in the voltage output from the ampliﬁer. The inverse
of the slope of the resultant calibration curve of the voltage
vs. distance was taken as Kfor the measurements.
A cantilever beam with the dimensions 0.4 /C23c m
2was
mechanically diced from the wafer for measurement. Theamorphous Terfenol-D thin ﬁlm employed in this work was
deposited on a 2 in. 100 lm thick (100) silicon substrate at a
thickness of 200 nm by ultra-high vacuum magnetron sput-tering from a single alloy target with the compositionTb
0:3Dy0:7Fe1:92. The ﬁlms were deposited using a sputtering
power of 200 W and an argon working pressure of 6 mTorr
at a base chamber pressure of 1 /C210/C06Torr. A 10 nm Ta
barrier layer and a 5 nm Ta capping layer were depositedprior to and post in situ deposition of the Terfenol-D thin
ﬁlm, respectively, to prevent oxidation, producing a layered
structure Si (100 lm)/Ta (10 nm)/Terfenol-D (200 nm)/Ta
(5 nm). The mechanical properties of the substrate and ﬁlmare estimated as E
f¼35 GPa, Es¼140 GPa, /C23f¼0:3;19
and /C23s¼0:3.2,20,21The residual stresses rresidual on the 2 in.
Si (100) wafers were calculated with the aid of a laser wafercurvature measurement system (KLA Tencor Flexus FLX-2320) pre and post ﬁlm-deposition. Stoney’s equation
22was
then used to relate the measured curvatures to the residualstresses; residual stresses of approximately –700 MPa (com-pressive) were found for the sample (see supplementarymaterial
40Sec. IV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Bragg-
Brentano geometry veriﬁed the amorphous nature of theTerfenol-D thin ﬁlms by scanning the 2 hangle from 20
/C14to
60/C14with ﬁxed Cu K aradiation. In-plane (IP) and out-of-
plane (OOP) DC MvsHcurves were measured by sweeping
the magnetic ﬁeld between –6 and þ6 kOe using scanning
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mag-netometry at 300 K.
Magnetostriction measurements were performed in the
sample holder with an applied bias-ﬁeld of 900 Oe suppliedby permanent magnets to saturate the sample perpendicularto the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld wasswept between –4300 and þ4300 Oe with a step size of
50 Oe and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz during the magneto-striction measurements to smooth the effects of noise andenable the system to adequately stabilize. Additionally, thepresence of vibrations on the setup can be catastrophic tomeasurements, rendering data useless if unaccounted for. Tomitigate any vibrations originating from the electromagnetand any other sources, an optical table is employed to per-form the experiment on to minimize the impact of anyunforeseen disturbances on readings. The distance betweenthe cantilever beam and the PD was held at d¼169 cm, and
a camera constant of K¼2:10/C210
/C04m/V was determined
by calibration at this distance before measurement. As illus-trated in Fig. 1, the sample is oriented such that its length is
parallel to the applied magnetic ﬁeld H¼H^x.
All components employed to develop the magnetostric-
tion measurement apparatus along with their approximatecost are available in Table I. While some components may
be relatively expensive, we highlight additional alterna-tives to reduce equipment costs in Sec. V of the supple-mentary material, which are analyzed in the context oftheir potential impact on measurement precision.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Amorphous Terfenol-D’s magnetic properties and the
cantilever’s crystalline structure
Figure 8shows the XRD pattern of the Terfenol-D ﬁlm
(black) with the crystalline Terfenol-D reference (red) pro-vided for 2 hbetween 20
/C14and 60/C14. The ﬁlm’s XRD plot
reveals that the Terfenol-D ﬁlm is amorphous due to the
hump-like pattern between 30/C14and 50/C14, followed by the lack
of overlap between the ﬁlm’s peaks with the crystalline ref-erence. Additionally, the low intensity count of the ﬁlm also
indicates the amorphous nature of the ﬁlm. The sharp peak
coupled with a broader peak located near 33
/C14is due to the
silicon wafer’s forbidden peak,23which is generated as the
ﬁlm was mechanically diced (i.e., cleaved) before measuring
the XRD pattern.
Figure 9shows the IP and OOP SQUID MvsHcurve of
the amorphous Terfenol-D ﬁlm. The plot illustrates that thesample possesses an OOP magnetization, which is also the
magnetic easy-axis (i.e., the axis that is the most energetically
favorable for magnetization), whereas the IP orientationbehaves magnetically hard. The magnetization aligns in the
OOP plane orientation as a consequence of the compressive
residual stress of the ﬁlm along with the positive coefﬁcientof magnetostriction of Terfenol-D.
20This in turn results in a
negative magnetoelastic energy contribution towards the total
magnetic anisotropic energy, as there is negligible contribu-tion from the magnetocrystalline anisotropy due to the amor-phous nature of the Terfenol-D ﬁlms.
21,24
Referring to the inset of Fig. 9, both OOP and IP direc-
tions show a near zero remnant magnetization as a result of
the compressive residual stress of the ﬁlm coupled with theferrimagnetic nature of Terfenol-D.24Therefore, a sufﬁ-
ciently strong magnetic ﬁeld must be present in order for the
Terfenol-D ﬁlms to remain magnetized. To hold the ﬁlms ina magnetized state, a 900 Oe biasing magnetic ﬁeld isapplied IP along the short axis of the cantilever by the per-
manent magnets shown in Fig. 6. Now by referring back to
Fig. 6(a) portraying the orientation of cantilever in theapparatus, it can be seen that the applied magnetic ﬁeld and
the biasing magnetic ﬁelds are both IP. This demonstratesthat the 90
/C14domain rotation in the magnetostriction mea-
surements performed for the Terfenol-D cantilever will be
between two magnetically hard axes and thus requires muchlarger magnetic ﬁelds to saturate completely. Consequently,a sufﬁciently large sweeping magnetic ﬁeld ( <6 kOe) is
required to fully saturate the Terfenol-D ﬁlm and measure
k
sat. Alternatively, for ﬁlms consisting of 3 dmagnetic ele-
ments with lower magnetoelastic anisotropies such as FeGa,the easy axes lie IP for ﬁlms even with high residual
stresses.25,26Therefore, the apparatus will also be suitable
for the measurement of 3 dmagnetostrictive thin ﬁlms along
with any other magnetostrictive material (e.g., Ni, Fe, etc.).
B. Magnetostriction data measured by the optical setup
Figure 10(a) shows the measured magnetostriction ( kms)o f
the amorphous Terfenol-D thin ﬁlm cantilever ( tf¼200 nm,
ts¼100lm) on the left-ordinate axis and the magnetostrictive
tip displacement Dmsdetermined using Eq. (5)on the right-
ordinate axis as a function of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Here,the error bars represent the measurement uncertainty of the
magnetostriction given by the noise ﬂoor k
DL/C2563:5p p m
(Dnoise/C25670 nm) calculated using Eq. (8). Additionally, the
numbered arrows sequentially represent the directional pathsof the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld. Near the extrema H/C2564:3
kOe, k
mstrends toward similar magnetostriction values of
approximately 106 ppm ( Dms/C252:14lm). As indicated in Fig.
10(a) , the Terfenol-D ﬁlms did not reach saturation due to the
insufﬁciently supplied magnetic ﬁelds in the harder IP axis.
This agrees with the IP SQUID curve in Fig. 9,a st h eﬁ l m s
were not completely saturated at 6 kOe. Additionally, a limita-tion of the setup was that the power supply could only supplyup to68 A to the electromagnet. Therefore, as k
satwas not
measured, the measured magnetostriction of the ﬁlms may be
potentially larger at higher magnetic ﬁelds. It is important tonote that the magnetostrictive responses measured by the setupare in good agreement with reported values for amorphous
Terfenol-D thin ﬁlms between 150 (Ref. 27) and 320 ppm
(Ref. 28) considering these values were reported at larger

ing no coercive ﬁeld (i.e., Hc/C250 Oe) and no remnant magnetization (i.e.,

magnetic ﬁelds in excess of /C2410 kOe and that our ﬁlm was not
saturated. Accordingly, the obtained results demonstrate that
the magnetostrictive apparatus is capable of discerning the
magnetostriction of thin ﬁlm magnetostrictive cantilevers withlow measurement uncertainty for laboratory purposes while
also suitable in an instructional setting.29–39
Figure 10(b) shows the normalized magnetization derived
from the magnetostriction results in Fig. 10(a) using Eq. (9)
vs the applied magnetic ﬁeld H. It is important to note that
the magnetic behavior observed in the ﬁgure is different
from those of the IP SQUID curve shown in Fig. 9due to the
presence of the 900 Oe bias ﬁeld perpendicular to the sweep-ing magnetic ﬁeld. Notably, the results in Fig. 10(b) show
that the sample possesses a remnant magnetization at the ori-
ginM
r=Msat/C250.34. Referring back to the IP SQUID curve
in Fig. 9, this 900 Oe IP bias ﬁeld corresponds to an IP nor-
malized magnetization of approximately 0.28, which is in
relative agreement with the results of Fig. 10(b) . The dis-
crepancy between the two Mr=Msatvalues may be associated
with ksatrequired in Eq. (9), as the maximum magnetostric-
tion value measured was set as ksatdue to the lack of a satu-
ration magnetostriction value in Fig. 10(a) . In addition, the
magnetization deduced from the magnetostriction results in
Fig.10(a) shows important magnetic behavior which is often
difﬁcult to replicate in SQUID or vibrating sample magneto-
meters (VSMs) and useful for understanding the deduced
magnetostriction more clearly in these settings. Moreover, themagnetization determined using the magnetostriction may be
helpful for instructors without expensive magnetometery
equipment and provides a demonstration of the intertwinedrelationship between magnetism and magnetostriction.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
A cost-effective method for the quantitative characteriza-
tion of the magnetostrictive effect in thin ﬁlms was detailedin this article, where the magnetostriction is extrapolated
from the tip displacement of a thin-ﬁlm magnetostrictive
cantilever using the position of a reﬂected laser-beam mea-sured by two differentially coupled photodiode positioning
sensors. The measurement capability of the apparatus was
veriﬁed through magnetostriction measurements of nano-scale amorphous Terfenol-D (Tb
0:3Dy0:7Fe1:92) thin ﬁlms,
where magnetostriction values up to 106 63.5 ppm were
obtained. From the magnetostriction data, a normalized mag-
netization M=Msatvs applied magnetic ﬁeld Hhysteresisloop was extrapolated inferring useful information regarding
the magnetic behavior of the ﬁlm under test. Magnetic trends
from IP and OOP magnetic hysteresis loops measured by a
SQUID magnetometer show Mr/C250 emu/cc, revealing the
need for Hbiasin the setup to maintain the Terfenol-D ﬁlms
in a magnetized state during magnetostriction measurements.
Additionally, XRD data conﬁrmed the amorphous nature ofthe Terfenol-D ﬁlms as compared with a crystalline refer-
ence. With all of the characterization techniques presented,
this experiment provides a segue into the origin and quantita-tive exploration of the unique properties of ferromagnetic
and ferrimagnetic materials and elucidates their use in many
technologies today to students. Consequently, we foresee themethods and equipment outlined in this work suited for dem-
onstrations of the fundamental physics of magnetic materials
for classroom instruction, while also well-capable for cost-effective laboratory magnetostriction measurements catered
to nanoscale thin ﬁlms.
