We present a simple design of a balloon-borne infrared spectral photometer that can be built and used
by undergraduate students to perform an experiment demonstrating the atmospheric greenhouseeffect. The experiment demonstrates that the Earth radiates heat to space in the infrared region but
that the radiation at the top of the atmosphere has a much lower effective radiation temperature than
at the surface of the Earth, which is the essence of the greenhouse effect. The experiment alsodemonstrates that the greenhouse effect is much more pronounced in molecular absorption bands
than in the so-called infrared window. The thrill of putting together a balloon experiment aside,
students performing this experiment also gained experience in practical applications of Planck’s law.

I. INTRODUCTION
The atmospheric greenhouse effect1is a signiﬁcant com-
ponent of the Earth’s climate system.2However, the typical
physics curriculum rarely includes an experimental investi-
gation of the effect. As discussed by Bell,3previously pub-
lished benchtop demonstrations that purport to demonstratethis effect
4–6are in fact more sensitive to convective rather
than radiative heat transfer, so that they fail to illustrategreenhouse effect-induced warming.
7,8One exception is
Sieg et al.9who do demonstrate the absorption of IR radia-
tion by CO 2gas, which is one component of the greenhouse
effect. To overcome the limitations of benchtop experiments,we developed an in situ experiment in the Earth’s atmo-
sphere to demonstrate this crucial aspect of the Earth’s cli-
mate to students. It can be performed by undergraduates,providing that they have access to a high-altitude balloon. Inour case, we beneﬁted from the Louisiana Space GrantConsortium’s Louisiana Aerospace Catalyst Experience forStudents (LaACES) Program.

To understand how the greenhouse effect is essential to
explain the temperature at the Earth’s surface, let us ﬁrstassume that the atmosphere does not play any role. In thisﬁrst very simple model, the Earth absorbs approximately/
q¼235 W/m2of heat from the Sun in the form of ultravio-
let (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (IR) radiation.2In
the steady state, the Earth re-radiates this heat back to space
in the form of mid- to far-IR thermal radiation with an effec-tive temperature Tof 254 K, which can be inferred from the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, /
q¼5:67/C210/C08Wm/C02K/C04 ðÞ T4.
In this model, the average temperature of the Earth’s surfacewould be T/C25254 K. This ﬁrst simplistic model, therefore,
cannot account for the actual average surface temperature ofthe Earth, which is 287 K.
11
To be more realistic, one can devise a second model,
where the Earth is in radiative equilibrium with a singleatmospheric layer containing greenhouse gasses that absorb
none of the UV, VIS, and near-IR radiation from the Sun,
but do absorb a fraction fof the mid- to far-IR thermal radia-
tion from the Earth. The thermal energy absorbed by theatmosphere is re-radiated equally upward to space and down-ward to the Earth, so that this additional heat ﬂux raises theEarth’s surface temperature. In this model, an average sur-
face temperature of 287 K is obtained if f¼77%,
12whereas
the actual value is closer to f¼90%.2
Furthermore, to accurately describe the observed altitudinal
dependence of the effective IR radiation temperature, one
needs a more realistic model that considers the atmosphere to
be composed of multiple atmospheric layers containing green-house gasses in radiative-convective equilibrium.
13The tem-
perature of the atmospheric layers decreases with altitude dueto adiabatic cooling of rising air parcels in response to thehydrostatic decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude. Athigher altitudes, the absorbed IR radiation is, therefore, re-radiated at lower temperatures. Observing the decrease ineffective radiation temperature with altitude is the ﬁrst objec-
tive of this experiment.
The second objective of this experiment is to demonstrate
the spectral effect of greenhouse gasses on the effective radi-
ation temperature. In the [8–12] lm wavelength band, the IR
transmittance from the surface of the Earth to space is veryhigh in the absence of clouds. This wavelength band isreferred to as the atmospheric IR window. At slightly shorterwavelengths, IR radiation is strongly absorbed by watervapor, and at slightly longer wavelengths, IR radiation isstrongly absorbed by carbon dioxide.
14These two gasses are
predominantly responsible for the absorption of IR radiation
in the atmosphere. In our experiment, we measure separately
the effective radiation temperature in the IR window and theabsorption bands. We expect that the effective radiation tem-perature to space will be higher in the atmospheric windowthan in the absorption bands, since radiation to space thenoriginates from deeper (and warmer) layers of theatmosphere.
To compare with the experimental results, we have per-
formed a simulation of the infrared radiation transfer in theatmosphere using MODTRAN.
15,16MODTRAN is an algo-
rithm that models the atmosphere as a series of horizontally
homogenous layers and calculates the transmittance andradiance of the atmospheric constituents in each layer in0.2 cm
/C01spectral bands over the [0.2–100] lm spectral
range. Figure 1shows the MODTRAN-simulated upward IR
heat ﬂux spectrum at the surface of the Earth and at an alti-tude of 25 km, using the parameter values listed in Table I.17

At the surface of the Earth, the IR heat ﬂux spectrum dis-
plays the characteristic blackbody shape with a maximum
emission near 10 lm. At an altitude of 25 km, however, the
spectrum displays differential absorption with little absorp-tion in the range from 8 lm to approximately 12 lm (except
for the narrow ozone absorption band near 10 lm), but
presents bands of signiﬁcant absorption outside of that.Although the IR heat ﬂux spectrum is not that of a black-body, one can calculate an effective radiative temperature T
by integrating the spectrum and comparing it to the integral
of Planck’s law as follows:

k5ehc=kkT ðÞ /C01 ðÞ; (1)
where his Planck’s constant, cis the speed of light, Xis ﬁeld
of view of the detector expressed as a solid angle, and kis
Boltzmann’s constant. One can calculate an effective radia-
tion temperature for the spectrum as a whole, or for any
selected wavelength band [ kmin,kmax]. Our practical method
of inverting Eq. (1)to calculate the effective radiation tem-
perature is presented in Appendix A . Figure 2shows the alti-
tude dependence of the effective radiation temperature forthree bands: observed (designated o) [5.5 lm, 14 lm]; IR
window band (designated w)[ 8lm, 12 lm]; and absorption
band (designated a) [5.5 lm, 8.0 lm]þ[12.0 lm, 14.0 lm].
Figure 2, therefore, models the expected results of our
experiment.
II. METHOD
Our method for observing the greenhouse effect directly
was to have a balloon lift a downward-pointing infrared ther-
mometer from the surface of the Earth up to an altitude of atleast 25 km, to observe the decrease in the effective tempera-ture of the radiation coming from the surface of the Earth.The payload measured the IR heat ﬂux using Arduino-
controlled MLX90614 infrared thermometers.
18The
MLX90614 has an integrated IR ﬁlter with a passbandbetween 5.5 and 14.0 lm. The ﬁeld of view of the sensor
1.87 sr. The thermometer is factory-calibrated to read out theeffective radiation temperature based on the incoming heat
ﬂux in this wavelength range and for this solid angle. In our
experimental conditions, the quoted accuracy of the radiationtemperature measurements is 60.5 K. The MLX90614 also
reads out the temperature of the sensor itself, T
s, which is
used in our data analysis.
Figure 3is a schematic of the instrument, and Fig. 4shows
photographs of the instrument. The instrument comprises
three ML90614 sensors, designated as S1, S2, and S3. S1and S2 both directly measure the overall IR radiation temper-ature directly. In front of S3 is placed an additional externalIR ﬁlter which acts as a passband between 8.0 and 12.0 lm,
with a transmissivity t¼0.859, per the manufacturer’s data-
sheet. Therefore, S3 measures the radiation temperature in
the atmospheric IR window. The instrument also comprisesa GPS receiver for time and altitude data, an SD card drivefor data storage for post-ﬂight analysis, and two LED statusindicators. An Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller controls
all of these devices. Batteries provide power, and a 3-cm
thick polystyrene housing provides mechanical support andthermal insulation. Because the high-altitude balloon carriesseveral experiments suspended vertically below the balloon,the sensors are mounted at an angle of 30
/C14with respect to
the nadir direction, so as to avoid having their ﬁeld of view
obstructed by one of the experiments suspended below ours.As long as, we can approximate the surface of the Earth and

the atmospheric strata as ﬂat planes and, as long as, the
entire ﬁeld of view of the sensors remains below the hori-zon; the orientation of the sensors does not affect the heat
ﬂux received.
19This is due to two competing effects: The
ﬁrst is that blackbody surfaces radiate in accordance withLambert’s law,
20which states that the intensity of the radi-
ation coming from a unit area decreases as the cosine ofthe viewing angle with respect to the surface normal. Thesecond is that the radiating surface within the ﬁeld of viewof the sensor is a conic section (a circle or an ellipse)whose area increases as the reciprocal of the cosine of theviewing angle. Therefore, as the viewing angle increases,the increase in visible horizontal area exactly offsets thedecrease in intensity per unit surface area, resulting in aheat ﬂux to the sensors that is the same at all viewingangles.
Since both S1 and S2 measure the observed effective tem-
perature of the IR radiation to space, T

We determined the reﬂected heat ﬂux /q/C0/C1
ras a function
of the sensor temperature, Ts, by calibration. We did this by
roughly reproducing, on the ground, the temperature proﬁle
that the sensor would experience during the ﬂight. We started
by placing the instrument outside in direct sunlight for 30 min
while operating. This raised the sensor temperature to as high
as 326 K (53/C14C). We then placed the instrument in a /C020/C14C
freezer for 30 min to lower Ts. In the freezer, Tsgradually

object (a book) covered in black vinyl electrical tape (to
ensure a high object emissivity) in the freezer. We positionedthe instrument and the object so that the object ﬁlled the ﬁeld
of view of the sensors. The object temperature T
owas mea-
sured by S1 and S2 as in Eq. (2). We performed this measure-
ment twice, once with the object initially at room temperature
and once with the object at a higher initial temperature,
accomplished by leaving the object outside in direct sunlight
for 30 min alongside the instrument. We did this to ensure that
we would obtain the same results for /q/C0/C1
rregardless of the
object temperature, as would be expected if we were indeed
measuring only the reﬂected heat ﬂux from S3 itself. Finally,
we solved Eq. (4)for/q/C0/C1

III. DATA
The instrument was launched by high-altitude balloon,
launched from 30.4773000/C14N longitude, 92.6936333/C14W lati-
tude at 16:17:03 UTC (10:17:03 local standard time) onAugust 3, 2020. The surface temperature was 34
/C14C (307 K),
and there were scattered cumulus clouds present. The instru-ment ascended to an altitude of 27 419 m and then returned
to the surface of the Earth by parachute. Atmospheric tem-
perature and pressure versus altitude as measured by ourcompanion instrument, which we built and launched on thesame balloon ﬂight, are shown in Fig. 6. The data gathered
during the ﬂight for this experiment are shown in Fig. 7.
IV. ANALYSIS
The results of analyzing our data using Eqs. (2)–(10) are
s h o w ni nF i g s . 8and9. Figure 8shows that the overall radia-
tion emission temperature, T
o, decreases with altitude in quali-
tative agreement with the results derived from our MODTRANsimulations, thus illustrating the gree nhouse effect. The
observed difference in radiation temperature between the sur-
face and the highest altitude is 310 K /C0276 K ¼34 K. The
measured and modelled effective radiation temperatures are inquantitative agreement up to an altitude of 7 km. Above thataltitude, the measured effective radiation temperature shows asigniﬁcant deviation from the model that peaks at a deviationof about /C012 K at around 15 km in altitude. This is possibly
due to a loss of accuracy when the sensor temperature is chang-ing, as implied by the datasheet for the MLX90614.
18We
intend to reduce this effect in future experiments by shading thesensors before launch and by locating the sensors outside of theinsulating housing. This should prevent the sensor temperaturefrom reaching such a high temperature before launch. Indeed,

waste heat from the electronics typically raises the temperature
inside the housing to 50/C14C before launch. In our case, as seen
in Fig. 7, the sensor temperature TSwas (325 K ¼52/C14C) at
launch (altitude ¼0 km). Reducing the initial sensor tempera-
ture would reduce the rate of cooling during the ﬂight. It is also
possible that atmospheric turbulence around the tropopause (at
an altitude around 15 km) caused the sensor look direction todeviate from its designed direction.
23While a downward oscil-
lation would not affect the IR ﬂux received by the sensor,
upward oscillations greater than 15/C14would cause at least part
of the sensor ﬁeld of view to rise above the horizon and reducethe IR ﬂux received. The net effect would be to bias the IR ﬂux
measurements downward.
As seen in Fig. 9, the qualitative result that the IR radia-
tion temperature in the IR window, T
w, is higher than the
radiation temperature in the absorption bands, Ta, is clear.
The radiation temperatures in the IR window band, and the
absorption bands are also in quantitative agreement withtheir corresponding models up to an altitude of 7000 m, with
signiﬁcant deviations above that altitude.
V. CONCLUSION
The performance of the developed instrument was sufﬁ-
cient to demonstrate the greenhouse effect. The decrease inthe Earth’s effective radiation temperature with altitude was
qualitatively correct and in quantitative agreement with the
model predictions up to an altitude of 7 km. Additionally, we
observed that T
win the IR window was greater than the over-
all effective radiation temperature Toand, conversely, we
showed that Tain the absorption bands was smaller than To.
These results were also in rough quantitative agreement with
the model predictions.
One could also adapt this instrument to perform ground-
based experiments. For example, if the sensors were ori-
ented toward the sky, the instrument would measure the IR
heat ﬂux from the atmosphere to the Earth. The IR heat ﬂuxfrom a clear sky is concentrated in the absorption bands,
with very little radiation from the atmospheric window. This
would appear as a higher effective temperature in the
absorption band than in the atmospheric window. In con-
trast, clouds radiate with the same effective temperatures inboth bands.
In performing the experiment described in this article, the
group of undergraduate physics students gained a practical
understanding of an important part of the global climate sys-
tem as well as the experience of designing their own instru-
ment. Planned improvements in this instrument include theaddition of an array of upward-facing thermometers to mea-
sure the downward IR heat ﬂux and, therefore, the net heat

received by S3.

ﬂux as a function of altitude. With those sensors, we intend
to observe the difference between net heat ﬂux in the IR win-
dow and the absorption bands. Additionally, a triple-axis
accelerometer will be included to determine the sensor nadir/
zenith angle and payload motion at all time. Another group
of undergraduates developed such an instrument, which ﬂew
on June 12, 2021. Initial results show improved accuracy inthe radiation temperature measurements, indicating that plac-
ing the temperature sensors outside of the insulating housing
is the better design option.

APPENDIX A: CALCULATING THE HEAT FLUX
AND THE EFFECTIVE RADIATION TEMPERATURE
In performing the proposed experiment, it is frequently
necessary to calculate the IR heat ﬂux from the effective
radiation temperature and vice versa, using the integral of
Planck’s law. The integral of Planck’s law does not have aclosed form solution. (Widger and Woodall
24obtained an
inﬁnite-series solution for the integral of Planck’s law, but
that is not practical for our purpose.) Therefore, we adopted
the following procedure: For each wavelength band, we inte-
grated Planck’s law numerically for all integer values of Tin
the [240, 320] K range, inclusive. We then ﬁt the result to a
second order polynomial as follows:
/q¼2hc21:87 srðÞðkmax
kmindk
k5ehc=kkT ðÞ /C01 ðÞ
/C25a0þa1T/C0280 K ðÞ þa2T/C0280 K ðÞ2; (A1)
where a0,a1, and a2are ﬁtting parameters. The standard
error of the IR heat ﬂux is, therefore, given by

22During design and testing, we investigated using a 8 lm long-pass IR ﬁlter
to separately measure the radiation temperature in the 5.5–8.0 lmH 2O
absorption band and the 12–14 lmC O 2absorption band. Due to accumu-
lated measurement error, however, this proved not to be feasible. and this
ﬁlter and its sensor (S4) were not used in this experiment.
23The tropopause is the upper boundary of atmospheric convection, wherevarious instabilities drive turbulence.
