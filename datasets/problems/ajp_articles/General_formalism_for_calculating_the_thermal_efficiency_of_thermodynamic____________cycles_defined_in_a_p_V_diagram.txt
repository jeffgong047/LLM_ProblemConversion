We develop a general method for calculating the thermal efﬁciency of arbitrary thermodynamic
cycles deﬁned in the pressure-volume ( p–V) diagram. To demonstrate how effective our approach
is, we calculate the thermal efﬁciency of ideal gas engines for a few non-trivial cycles in the p–V
diagram, including a circular shape, a heart shape, a cycloid of Ceva, and a star-shaped curve. We
determine the segments along the cycle where heat is absorbed or released from the heat engine.
Our method can be applied to any gas model, and, as an example, we present the results for the vander Waals gas.

I. INTRODUCTION
Calculating the efﬁciency of thermodynamic cycles is a
central issue in practical applications. Moreover, when teach-ing, the basic concepts of thermodynamics can be introduced
very efﬁciently through calculations of energy efﬁciency. In
most textbook examples,1–3the thermodynamic cycles in the
pressure-volume ( p–V) diagram include only four types of
processes: isothermal (constant temperature), isochoric (con-
stant volume), isobaric (constant pressure), and adiabatic
(heat-insulated system). Engines including such cycles, likethe Carnot, Otto, Brayton (or Joule), Diesel, Stirling, Rankine,and Sargent cycles, are well known in the literature. To calcu-late the exchanged heat and work done for these systems, it isassumed that all processes are idealized; i.e., they are quasi-static and reversible, and there is no friction, turbulence, orheat loss. The common feature in the four above-mentionedtypes of idealized processes is that the exchanged heat and the
work done can be calculated analytically for a gas character-
ized by its equation of state and its internal energy.
The calculation of the speciﬁc heat and of the thermal efﬁ-
ciency for unconventional thermodynamic processes (which
deviate from the four special ones mentioned above) hasbeen a frequently studied issue in the literature. For example,the speciﬁc heat has been calculated for gases in an arbitraryprocess in Ref. 4and for the ideal gas along an elliptical p–V
cycle in Ref. 5. Similarly, to calculate the thermal efﬁciency,
the use of logarithmic plots of the p–Vdiagram has been sug-
gested in Ref. 6. The thermal efﬁciency has been calculated
for cycles in the p–Vdiagram involving diagonal processes
with negative slope,
7–11parabolic processes,10circular pro-
cesses,12an unconventional lobe,13and an alternative ther-
modynamic cycle for the Stirling machine.14
Extending the calculation of the thermal efﬁciency to gen-
eral cycles then is a natural development. Indeed, for uncon-ventional processes, the calculation of the efﬁciency is notobvious at all since it is rather difﬁcult to calculate theabsorbed and released heat during the cycle. In principle,one needs to locate the segments of the cycle where heat isabsorbed or released by the ﬂuid. These segments are sepa-rated by points at which the adiabatic curves are tangent tothe curve representing the given cycle.
11In most cases, suchcalculations cannot be performed analytically. This problem
can be complicated even in the simple case of a circularprocess.12
To avoid this problem, in this work, we present a general
formalism for calculating the thermal efﬁciency for arbitrarycycles parametrized in the p–Vdiagram. Figure 1shows
such an example in which the cycle is a heart-shaped curve.
Although such a heat engine is probably not realistic, ourgeneral approach could be useful in practice and may pro-vide a didactically useful example for teaching the calcula-tion of thermal efﬁciency as well.
Our formalism is quite versatile; it is valid for all gases
provided their equation of state and their internal energy are
known. We shall calculate the thermal efﬁciency both forideal gas and for the van der Waals gas. From the calcula-tion, we shall identify the segments of the p–Vdiagram,
where heat is absorbed or released from the heat engine.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present our
general formalism to obtain the thermodynamic efﬁciency. In
Sec.III, we demonstrate the universality of our method by cal-
culating the thermal efﬁciency of ideal gas engines for a fewnon-trivial processes deﬁned in the p–Vdiagram. In Sec. IV,w e
extend our formalism to the van der Waals gas. Finally, in Sec.V, we summarize our main conclusions.
II. GENERAL FORMALISM

tion of state and its internal energy UðT;V;nÞare known.

From the equation of state, we may write

One can see that the exchanged heat /C22dQcan be obtained by
knowing only the equation of state and the heat capacity atconstant volume C
V.Note that Eq. (3)is valid for all gases,
and the temperature dependence of the three partial deriva-tives can be eliminated using the equation of state, so thatthey depend only on pandV. Equation (3)is one of the cen-
tral results in this work and a starting point for further
calculations.
Let us now parameterize the cycle in the p–Vdiagram. For
a general cycle, we deﬁne the dimensionless pressure PðuÞ
and volume VðuÞas a function of a parameter uin the fol-
lowing way:
pðuÞ¼p
0PðuÞ;and VðuÞ¼V0VðuÞ; (4)
where p0andV0are constants characterizing the dimensions
ofpandV, and the parameter uis a real number varying in a
closed interval ½ui;uf/C138. For a closed cycle, pðuiÞ¼pðufÞ
and VðuiÞ¼VðufÞ. In this work, we consider only heat
engines in which the cycle runs clockwise in the p–Vdia-
gram, i.e., the point ðVðuÞ;PðuÞÞon the curve of the cycle
moves in the clockwise direction as uincreases. Note that a
similar approach has been used in Ref. 13for an unconven-
tional lobe in the p–Vdiagram with an ideal gas and Ref. 14
for a Stirling engine, where the volume of the gas isparameterized by the camshaft angle h. However, the formal-
ism presented below is valid for arbitrary cycles and gases.
Since d p¼p0ðdPðuÞ=duÞduand d V¼V0ðdVðuÞ=
duÞdu, the exchanged heat in Eq. (3)along the curve is
given by
/C22dQ¼p0V0qðuÞdu;where (5a)

Note that to obtain the dimensionless heat function qðuÞ,i t
is enough to know the equation of state of the gas, the heatcapacity C
V, and the parametrized curve of the cycle in the
p–Vdiagram. When qðuÞ>0 the system absorbs heat, and
when qðuÞ<0 heat is released from the system (according
to the usual sign convention for heat transfers and workdone). Note that a similar heat function has been introducedby Plischke and Bergersen in problem 1.5 (see their book
and the solution in Refs. 15and16, respectively).
It is convenient to calculate the absorbed and released heat
from the function qðuÞby introducing two further functions
q
6¼1
2jqj6qðÞ : (6)
Using this deﬁnition, if q>0 then qþ¼qand q/C0¼0,
while for q<0 we have qþ¼0 and q/C0¼/C0q>0. In a
closed cycle, it follows from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
thatQþ/C0Q/C0þW¼0, where QþandQ/C0(both are positive
numbers) are the total heat absorbed and released from thesystem, respectively, and – Wis the work done by the engine
(for clockwise direction in the p–Vdiagram, W<0). Using
our heat functions q

Equations (5)and(8)are our main results in this work.
In principle, to ﬁnd the parts of the cycle where the heat is
absorbed or released by the system, one needs to calculate
the points ( adiabatic points ) where the curves corresponding
to adiabatic processes are tangent to the curve of the cycle.13
However, even for the simple circle-shaped cycle, it is arather difﬁcult task to determine algebraically or numericallythese adiabatic points along the cycle (see, e.g., Ref. 12).
The adiabatic points are the zeros of the heat function qðuÞFig. 1. Heart-shaped curve in the p–Vdiagram. The parametric curve is
given in the text (Eq. (16)). The red lines and the blue dotted lines corre-
spond to segments, where heat is absorbed and released by the system,
respectively.
195 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 3, March 2022 V. K €onye and J. Cserti 195 04 October 2023 23:03:54
given in Eq. (5). However, determining zeros is not an easy
task either.
The advantage of our general formalism is that, knowing
the heat function qðuÞgiven in Eq. (5b), the amount of
absorbed and released heat can be easily calculated from Eq.
(7a) without knowing the location of the adiabatic points.
Moreover, the sign of the function qðuÞallows us to ﬁnd
numerically where the heat is absorbed or released from the
heat engine.
As we shall see below, often the integrals in Eq. (8)can
only be evaluated numerically. In these cases, we also calcu-
late the work done directly as
W¼/C0ðuf
uipðuÞdVðuÞ¼/C0 p0V0ðuf
uiPðuÞdVðuÞ
dudu;
(9)
and the numerical precision can be controlled by checking
whether the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is satisﬁed. To com-
pute the thermal efﬁciency from our formalism, it is neces-
sary to know the equation of state, the heat capacity, and the
path on the p–Vdiagram. In practical applications, these are
not necessarily given analytically, but as discrete points. In
these cases, the thermal efﬁciency can be approximated
using standard numerical methods to compute the derivatives
and integrals in Eqs. (5)and(8).
Our method can also be used to calculate the entropy
along the cycle in the p–Vdiagram. Using Eq. (5), the
change of entropy can be expressed in terms of qas
dS¼/C22dQ=T¼p0V0qðuÞdu=TðuÞ.
III. APPLICATIONS FOR IDEAL GAS
In this section, we apply our general formalism to ﬁnd the
thermal efﬁciency for an ideal gas for which the equation of
state and the internal energy are pV¼nRT and
UðT;V;nÞ¼CVT, respectively, where Ris the molar gas
constant. We assume that the heat capacity CVis known for
the given gas.
Then, in Eq. (5), the partial derivatives can be easily cal-
culated from the equation of state, and the heat function
qðuÞbecomes
qðuÞ¼1
c/C01cPðuÞdVðuÞ
duþV ð uÞdPðuÞ
du/C20/C21
; (10)
where we introduce the ratio of the heat capacities
c¼Cp=CV. (Here, Cpis the heat capacity at constant pres-
sure.) In the derivation, we made use of Mayer’s relation
Cp/C0CV¼nR.
From Eq. (10), we can easily derive the heat function for
the standard processes, i.e., the isobaric, isochoric, isother-
mal, and adiabatic processes, as follows:
(i) for isobaric process (at dimensionless pressure P0
between dimensionless volumes V1andV2),VðuÞ
¼V 2uþV 1ð1/C0uÞ;PðuÞ¼P 0;u2½0;1/C138, the heat
function is
qpðuÞ¼c
c/C01P0ðV2/C0V 1Þ;
(ii) for isochoric process (at dimensionless volume V0
between dimensionless pressures P1andP2),VðuÞ¼V 0;PðuÞ¼P 1uþP 2ð1/C0uÞ;u2½0;1/C138,
the heat function is
qVðuÞ¼1
c/C01V0ðP2/C0P 1Þ;
(iii) for isothermal process (at temperature Tbetween
dimensionless volumes V1and V2),VðuÞ¼u;
PðuÞ¼nRT=ðp0V0uÞ;u2½ V 1;V2/C138, the heat func-
tion is qTðuÞ¼nRT=ðp0V0uÞ, which means that
/C22dQ¼pdV as we expect from the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics,
(iv) for adiabatic process from the parameterization
VðuÞ¼u;PðtÞ¼c=uc(here, cis a constant),
u2½ V 1;V2/C138, it follows that qðuÞ¼0 for all u,a si t
should be.
From the heat function qðuÞ, we can get the heat transfer
Q, which agrees with the well-known textbook results, and
derive the thermal efﬁciency of all well-known cycles men-
tioned in the introduction.
A. Thermal efficiency of an ellipse in the p–Vdiagram
As a ﬁrst example for applications, we consider a cycle
described by an ellipse with axes parallel to the axes in
thep–Vdiagram. (For a circular shape, see the left panel in
Fig.2.) This cycle can be parametrized as
P¼ p=p0¼1þacosðuÞand
V¼ V=V0¼1þbsinðuÞ; (11)
where 0 /C20a;b/C201. Note that a similar parametrization has
been used in Ref. 4. Then, from Eq. (10)we ﬁnd
qðuÞ¼ab
c/C01c1
aþcosu/C18/C19
cosu/C01
bþsinu/C18/C19

:
(12)
Now, it is clear that the thermal efﬁciency given in Eq. (8)
depends only on a,b, and c. In the case of a¼b¼1, the cir-
cular curve touches the pandV-axes, as shown in Fig. 2for
a mono-atomic gas for which c¼5=3.
Although, in general, the zeros of qðuÞcannot be calcu-
lated analytically, for a¼b¼1 these zeros can be deter-
mined as
Fig. 2. Circle-shaped cycle in the p–Vdiagram given in Eq. (11) with
a¼b¼1 (left panel) and the heat function qðuÞ(right panel). Solid red
lines are used where qðuÞ>0 and dotted blue lines where qðuÞ<0.

Thus, in this case, there are four sign changes in the heat
function qðuÞas can be seen in Fig. 2and is predicted in
Ref.17. This case is quite unusual because, from our numeri-
cal calculation, we found that if the circle is a little bit further
off from the pandV-axes, then there are only two adiabatic
points.
Finally, the integrals in Eq. (8)can also be evaluated
analytically,
ð2p
0qðuÞdu¼pandð2p

c2/C01;
(14)
and, thus, for a¼b¼1, the thermal efﬁciency becomes a
universal value
g¼2
1þ4
pc2þcþ1
c2/C01: (15)
Taking a mono-atomic gas with c¼5=3, we have
g¼8p=ð49þ4pÞ/C250:4082. Note that, as long as the ellipse
touches the pandV-axes, the thermal efﬁciency is a univer-
sal constant independent of p0andV0. Of course, this case is
nonphysical since the volume and the pressure cannot be
zero during the cycle. Therefore, the above universal resultcan be interpreted only as a limiting case while p!0o r
V!0 at some points of the cycle.
Note that using Eqs. (8)and(10), we can easily ﬁnd that
g¼0:115, which agrees with that given in Eq. (18) in Ref.
12 for a circular cycle with P¼ 1:5þ0:5 cosðuÞ,
V¼ 1:5þ0:5 sinðuÞ, and c¼1:4. Another example in
which our formalism can be tested is in Ref. 17where it was
shown that, for elliptical cycles, the maximum of the thermalefﬁciency is obtained for a¼b¼1, and g
max<0:3. Indeed,
from Eq. (15), for c¼1:4, we have gmax¼12p=ð109þ6pÞ
/C250:295.
We would like to mention that in 2015 in the Rudolf
Ortvay Competition in Physics, organized by E €otv€os Lor /C19and
University problem 8 was related to the thermal efﬁciency ofa circle-shaped cycle as the one discussed here.18In this
competition, the ﬁrst author of this paper presented a solu-
tion to this problem, which served as a basis for the present
work.
B. Thermal efficiency for other shapes in the
p–Vdiagram
We now consider the heart-shaped cycle Fig. 1. The curve
can be parametrized as19
p
p0/C17P¼ 2þ1
2013 cos ðuÞ/C05 cosð2uÞ ½
/C02 cosð3uÞ/C0cosð4uÞ/C138; (16a)V
V0/C17V¼ 2þ4
5sin3ðuÞ; (16b)
where u2½0;2p/C138.
Again, from Eq. (10), one can calculate the heat function
qðuÞanalytically for this cycle, and it is plotted in Fig. 3(a)
(right panel). However, the integrals in the expression for thethermal efﬁciency (Eq. (8))can only be evaluated numeri-
cally. For a mono-atomic ideal gas ( c¼5=3), we ﬁnd that
g¼0:1373.
Our next non-trivial example is the cycloid of Ceva,20
which is parametrized by
p
p0/C17P¼ 1þ1
32 cosð2uÞ/C01 ½/C138 cosu; (17a)
V
V0/C17V¼ 1þ1
32 cosð2uÞ/C01 ½/C138 sinu: (17b)
The shape of the curve and the corresponding heat func-
tion qðuÞare shown in Fig. 3(b). For a mono-atomic ideal
gas (c¼5=3), we ﬁnd numerically that g¼0:1493.
As shown by the previous two examples, it is quite clear
that our method can be applied to cycles that can bedescribed in polar coordinates.
Finally, we show that our method can be extended to
cycles consisting of straight segments in the p–Vdiagram.

Eq.(17), and (c) star-shape. The left panels show the cycle in the p–Vdia-
gram, and the right panels show the corresponding heat function qðuÞ. The
coloring of the lines is the same as in Fig. 2.
197 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 3, March 2022 V. K €onye and J. Cserti 197 04 October 2023 23:03:54
Any straight segment linking points ( VA,pA) and ( VB,pB)
can be parametrized as
pðuÞ¼pAþðpB/C0pAÞu; (18a)
VðuÞ¼VAþðVB/C0VAÞu; (18b)
where the parameter is u2½0;1/C138. Now, one can choose
V0¼VAandp0¼pAin Eq. (4). Then the exchanged heat
/C22dQfrom Eq. (5)can be easily calculated to obtain the ther-
mal efﬁciency.
Using the parametrization (18) and our general approach,
we can reproduce the results found in the literature. We
obtain the same result as that of problem 1.5 in the book byPlischke and Bergersen.
15,16Moreover, our calculation leads
to the same thermal efﬁciency g¼16=97/C250:165 for the
cycle shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 7. Similarly, using our formal-
ism, we easily veriﬁed the result shown in Fig. 4 of Ref. 10.
Finally, we use this type of parametrization to calculate
the thermal efﬁciency of the star-shaped cycle shown in Fig.
3(c). For a mono-atomic ideal gas ( c¼5=3), we ﬁnd numer-
ically that g¼0:1453.
IV. THERMAL EFFICIENCY FOR THE VAN DER
WAALS GAS
Our method to calculate the thermal efﬁciency may be
applied not only to the ideal gas but also to more realistic
ones such as the van der Waals gas. The equation of state
proposed ﬁrst by van der Waals takes into account particleinteractions and the ﬁnite size of the particle. It is given by
pþan2
V2/C18/C19
V/C0bnðÞ ¼nRT; (19a)
UðT;V;nÞ¼CVT/C0an2
V; (19b)
where a>0 and b>0 are constants characterizing the inter-
actions and the size of the particles of a given gas.
Introducing the dimensionless variables ^V¼V=Vc;
^p¼p=pc, and ^T¼T=Tc, the equation of state (19a) can be
written in a universal form independent of the parameters of
the gas
^pþ3
^V2/C18/C19
3^V/C01 ðÞ ¼8^T; (20)
where Vc¼3bn;pc¼ð1=27Þða=b2Þ, and RTc¼ð8=27Þða=bÞ
are the volume, pressure, and the temperature at the criticalpoint of the van der Waals gas, respectively. This is the law
of corresponding states.
If we now choose the previously deﬁned parameters in Eq.
(4)asp
0¼pcandV0¼Vc, we get P/C17 ^pandV/C17 ^V. Now,
using Eqs. (5)and(19), we ﬁnd that the heat function is

; (21)
where C¼1þðnR=CvÞ. Note that for the ideal gas
C¼c¼Cp=CV.We now calculate the thermal efﬁciency and the heat
function qðuÞof the heart-shaped curve deﬁned in Eq. (16)
using the van der Waals gas (see Fig. 4). The curve is chosen
so that T>Tcis always satisﬁed throughout the cycle.
Using C/C255=3 calculated from the heat capacity of argon,
we get g¼0:1396. As it is expected the difference between
the monoatomic ideal gas and a more realistic model forargon is very small above the critical temperature.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We developed a general formalism to calculate the ther-
mal efﬁciency of heat engines for arbitrary cycles deﬁned in
thep–Vdiagram. Our method can be applied to all gases pro-
vided their equation of state and their heat capacity areknown. We derived a general and rather simple expressionfor the thermal efﬁciency. To demonstrate how versatile ourformalism is, we calculated the thermal efﬁciency for a fewrather non-trivial cycles. Finally, we derived the heat func-tion for the van der Waals gas. A
PYTHON code for calculating
the thermal efﬁciency of the cycles presented in this work isavailable in the supplementary material.21
We believe that our general formalism provides a conve-
nient and practical method to calculate the thermal efﬁciencyof thermodynamic cycles deﬁned on a p–Vdiagram without
the need to locate the adiabatic points. Moreover, from apractical point of view, our method can also be applied tomodel more general cycles, different from the ones usuallydescribed in textbooks. We hope that our work can be usefulfor physics teachers and students to get more insight into thecalculation of thermal efﬁciency.
