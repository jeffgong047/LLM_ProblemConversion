Causality, determinism, and physics
Julio Gea-Banacloche
90(11), p. 809
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087017The language of cause and effect is deeply important to
classroom physics instruction, and curious students seek to
understand the meaning and implications of these terms.This essay offers historical insights, an overview of the cur-
rent debate, and an extensive bibliography that can enrich
classroom discussion on this topic.
Using Hexbugs
TMto Model Gas Pressure and Electrical
Conduction: A Pandemic-Inspired Distance Lab

90(11), p. 817
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087142Hexbugs are toy automatons that move in straight lines
until they reach an obstacle, after which they are randomly
scattered and continue their journey. As such, they can beused to model randomly moving physical objects: gas par-
ticles or electrons for instance. This paper proposes to
revisit some thermodynamics and statistical mechanics con-cepts in the laboratory using these toys. The authors
describe an undergraduate modern physics distance lab
course, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic,where students grasp a better understanding of the ideal
gas law and of the Drude model by simulating microscopic
behaviors with macroscopic objects. This work is also aninvitation to rethink our lab teaching practice and focus on
developing students’ experimental research skills by letting
them investigate a topic of their choosing.Turbulent dispersion of breath by the wind

https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064826The dispersal of aerosols is a century-old problem that was
brought to the forefront of our attention by the COVID-19 pan-demic. The combination of turbulence with the bulk motion of
air that was found to exist in many large indoor spaces yields
unexpected results that are characterized in this paper. Thiswork introduces non-experts to concepts in ﬂuid mechanicsand could easily lead to a variety of future student projects. A
video abstract accompanies the online version of this paper.
Free fall of a quantum many-body system
A. Colcelli, G. Mussardo, G. Sierra, and A. Trombettoni
90(11), p. 833
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0013427The motion of freely falling object is one of the ﬁrst sys-
tems students encounter in classical mechanics. The analo-
gous quantum problem is often omitted in introductoryquantum physics courses as the energy eigenfunctions
involve unfamiliar special functions. This paper builds on
previous studies employing operator methods to gain physi-cal insight into this quantum mechanical problem in a much
more accessible way, requiring no arcane functions. Some
important generalizations are made, including the applicationto freely falling systems of more than one quantum particle.
The paper contains material of interest to a wide range of
readers: from undergraduates ﬁrst learning about operatorsto experts in quantum many-body theory.
Submarine paradox softened
Hrvoje Nikolic ´
90(11), p. 841
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0084185A drop of ink is immersed in a completely still lake.
Suppose the density of the ink is such that it neither sinksnor ﬂoats when it is at rest. Now, what happens if the ink
moves relativistically with respect to the water: Does it sink
or ﬂoat? Explorations of the subtleties of relativistic buoy-ancy have been published over the years; the original
“submarine paradox” of this type was posed in this journal
over 30 years ago. This article brings a new dimension tosuch questions as it employs general relativistic ﬂuid dynam-
ics to develop the answer. A student who has taken a course
on general relativity will ﬁnd they possess the mathematicalskill needed to understand the details of the paper, and all
readers will certainly enjoy wrestling with such conceptual
puzzles.

Long-term changes in the Earth’s climate: Milankovitch
cycles as an exercise in classical mechanics
R.C.T. Rainey
90(11), p. 848
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0013563
The Milankovitch cycles are periodic changes in the
earth’s orbit that are believed to be responsible for the ice
age cycles over the last million years. The cycle with thestrongest effect on climate modulates the tilt of the earth’sspin axis with respect to its orbital plane. This paper showshow the periods of these cycles can be calculated through afairly simple method, suitable for an advanced undergraduatemechanics course.
Simple precession calculation for Mercury: a
linearization approach
Michael J. W. Hall
90(11), p. 857
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0098846The explanation of the anomalous perihelion precession
of Mercury is one of the crown jewels of general relativity.Unfortunately, analyses of this effect require advancedmathematics, with essential steps often having to be sup-plied to students. This paper develops an approximatetreatment of the precession effect by linearizing the rela-tivistic orbital equation, which puts it in a form very simi-
lar to that for a Kepler orbit. The precession effect can
then be extracted in a straightforward manner without hav-ing to invoke perturbation analyses or complicated inte-grals. Appropriate for introductory classes in generalrelativity.Comment on projectile motion with quadratic drag using
an inverse velocity expansion
Antonio Corvo
90(11), p. 861
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0097411This paper shows how an unconventional Taylor series
expansion can be used to obtain trajectories for projectilemotion in the presence of quadratic drag. This method providesstudents with practice in expansion methods and allows insightinto the factors that are important to modeling trajectories mea-sured in classroom demonstrations or the teaching laboratory.
Surface plasmon resonance sensing in the advanced
physics laboratory

90(11), p. 865
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0070022A set of nanoplasmonics-based experiments for
detecting minuscule changes in the refractive index of a ﬂuid ispresented. The experimental setup implements the Kretschmann-Raether conﬁguration using a commercially available surfaceplasmon resonance substrate (glass prism with a titanium/goldﬁlm coating) and microﬂuidic cell (for ﬂow of solutions alongthe substrate’s metal ﬁlm surface), thus signiﬁcantly lowering thesample fabrication barrier to implementation. The paper providesinstructions for performing the experiments as well as adetailed theoretical and computational background. The workdescribed here offers an accessible project–the surface plasmonresonance phenomenon–for the undergraduate instructionallaboratory.
