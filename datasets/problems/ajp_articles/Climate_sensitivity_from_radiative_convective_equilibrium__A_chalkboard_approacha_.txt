Simple models for Earth’s climate sensitivity (i.e. its temperature response to radiative forcing) are
developed by combining the time-tested idealization of one-dimensional radiative-convectiveequilibrium (RCE) with simple yet quantitatively reasonable models for CO
2forcing and the water
vapor feedback. Along the way, we introduce key paradigms including the emission level
approximation, the forcing-feedback decomposition of climate sensitivity, and “Simpson’s law” forwater vapor thermal emission. We also discuss climate feedbacks unaccounted for in this RCE
framework, as well as differing variants of climate sensitivity, all of which may be ripe for their
own chalkboard treatments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), or the long-
term global-mean surface temperature change due to a dou-
bling of CO 2, is arguably the most central quantity in climate
science. First studied by Arrhenius in 1896,1ECS sets the
overall magnitude and, thus, the severity of global warmingand remains a topic of intense interest to the present day.
2
The consensus value of ECS has remained close to 3 K for
decades, thr oughout many su ccessive generations of model
intercomparisons and literature reviews, most notably theassessment reports from the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC).
3These assessments have been based
largely on calculations with numerical models of increasingcomplexity, along with observations and paleoclimate recon-
structions. However, the ﬁrst credible estimate of ECS, given
by Manabe and Wetherald
4in 1967 as 2–3 K, used a highly
simpliﬁed one-dimensional representation of the climate sys-tem known as radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE; we refer
to this paper hereafter as MW67). This model for Earth’s cli-mate makes some drastic simpliﬁcations, such as representingthe atmosphere in terms of a single, global average column, butthen treats other aspects of the climate system in detail, such asthe frequency-dependent greenhouse gas radiative transfer ofboth water vapor (H
2O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). These
approximations, and insight they facilitated, have proved
remarkably durable, and were recognized with Manabe’s
receipt of part of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics.5
The simplicity of Manabe’s RCE approach and the robust-
ness of the 3 K value for ECS suggest that much of the phys-ics of ECS might actually be understood using a handful ofbasic physical principles, rather than lying hidden behind theintractable complexity of the climate system. Indeed, recentresearch has shown that essential topics, such as CO
2radia-
tive forcing6and the H 2O feedback,7can be described to a
reasonable approximation with simpliﬁed models amenableto analytic description. Taken together, such models allow
for an analytic estimate of ECS, at least within the simpliﬁed
context of RCE. A self-contained formulation of such anestimate is a primary goal of this paper.
8
The utility of such an estimate and the motivations for
documenting it here are many-fold. The most obvious moti-vation is for classroom teaching. Current texts in climatescience at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate
level, such as the excellent books by Hartmann
9and
Pierrehumbert,10treat the fundamentals extremely well and
use them to build intuition but then tend to jump to empiricalobservations and numerical simulations to describe real-
world phenomena. This is often the best that can be done,
but reasonably quantitative chalkboard estimates (where pos-sible) help ﬁll this gap between fundamental theory and
empirical observation. Such back-of-the-envelope reasoning
is also helpful for everyday practitioners trying to understandand debug the behavior of complex climate models.
11The
analytical approach taken here might also appeal more natu-
rally to physicists, providing them a more suitable entry
point for understanding or perhaps even contributing to cli-mate science.
However, there are also more profound reasons for pursu-
ing a simpliﬁed understanding of ECS and climate science
more broadly.
12Simple models of the kind developed here
embody our understanding of the subject at its most basic
level. This philosophy is well known to physicists in the
guise of Fermi problems and the Feynman lectures. Giventhe societal importance of climate change, as well as linger-ing skepticism about it in some quarters, a chalkboard expla-
nation of ECS, even if only approximate, seems essential for
demonstrating the depth of our understanding.
Given this motivation, we develop an estimate of ECS in
the simpliﬁed framework of RCE pioneered by Manabe. We
begin by establishing the paradigm of radiative-convective
equilibrium as well as the forcing-feedback framework. Wethen turn to simple models of the greenhouse effect for bothCO
2and H 2O, which lead to analytical descriptions of both
CO 2forcing and the water vapor feedback. These ingredients
are then combined, via the forcing-feedback framework, toyield an analytical estimate of ECS. We will ﬁnd that this
estimate is around 2 K, within the range found by MW67 but
somewhat smaller than the consensus value of 3 K. This dis-crepancy is due to the approximations inherent in the RCE
approach, which neglects clouds and changes in absorbed
solar radiation. We then discuss these phenomena and theprospects for capturing their effects via principled estimates.We close by introducing other metrics of climate sensitivity
that account for ocean heat uptake and the carbon cycle, and
for which a chalkboard understanding might also be useful.

For classroom instruction, this material might be consid-
ered a unit of perhaps eight lectures at the advanced under-
graduate or beginning graduate level for either physics
students or students of atmospheric and climate science.Suggestions for exercises are sprinkled throughout the main
text and the endnotes.
II. RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE EQUILIBRIUM (RCE)
We begin by building a very simple model for Earth’s sur-
face temperature T
s, based on the idea of radiative-
convective equilibrium (RCE), which we explain in detailbelow. Before turning to RCE, however, we must consider
the even more basic notion of planetary energy balance.
A. Planetary energy balance
The zeroth order determinant of T
sis the amount of sun-
light Earth receives. The solar ﬂux at Earth’s orbit is
S0¼1360 W =m2, and this ﬂux is incident on an effective
surface area pR2
E(the projected area of the Earth onto a plane
perpendicular to the Sun’s rays, where REis Earth’s radius).
A signiﬁcant fraction of this incident ﬂux is reﬂected back tospace, primarily via clouds and gaseous atmospheric
(Rayleigh) scattering, as well as from bright surfaces such as
deserts and ice caps. This fraction is known as Earth’salbedo a, measured to be a/C250:30.
13
Dividing by the Earth’s total surface area 4 pR2
Ethen gives
the globally averaged net incoming solar radiation,
S/C17S0ð1/C0aÞ
4/C25240 W =m2: (1)
The most basic physical constraint on climate is that of
planetary energy balance , which says that in steady-state S
must be balanced by outgoing thermal radiation, also known
as the “outgoing longwave radiation,” or OLR (here“longwave” means thermal infrared). We estimate OLR as
blackbody emission,
OLR ¼rT
4
em; (2)for some “emission temperature” Tem. Planetary energy bal-
ance then reads
S¼OLR (3a)
¼rT4
em: (3b)
The observed value of Syields Tem¼255 K. This is much
colder than the observed global average surface temperature
Ts¼288 K but is a reasonable estimate of an effective atmo-
spheric temperature, consistent with the fact that OLR
largely emanates not from the surface, but from atmospheric
greenhouse gases (GHGs, which are gases that absorb and
emit thermal infrared radiation—most prominently watervapor and carbon dioxide). However, given the atmospheric
T
em, how can we ﬁnd Ts? How are surface and atmospheric
temperatures related?
B. Single-layer radiative equilibrium
Perhaps the simplest model for estimating Tsin the pres-
ence of GHGs is that of a single-layer atmosphere of unit
emissivity, i.e., one that absorbs and emits as a perfect black-
body, pictured on the left hand side of Fig. 1(ignoring con-
vective processes for the moment). Such an atmosphere is
characterized by an atmospheric temperature Ta, blackbody
emission rTa4from GHGs emanating both upwards to space
and downwards to the surface, and transparency to sun-
light.14The energy budgets at the top of the atmosphere
(TOA) and surface then read (Fig. 1)
TOA :S¼rTa4; (4a)
surf :SþrTa4¼rTs4: (4b)
These equations can be immediately solved to yield
Ta¼Tem¼255 K and Ts¼21=4Tem¼303 K, overestimat-
ingTsby 15 K.
Despite this disagreement, this model is standard in introduc-
tory texts.15Many of these texts remedy this disagreement by
introducing a non-unit emissivity for the atmosphere, but
the value of this emissivity is typically set by requiring
Fig. 1. A cartoon of radiative-convective equilibrium. See the text for explanation.
732 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 9, September 2023 Nadir Jeevanjee 732 04 October 2023 22:56:59
Ts¼288K, thus eliminating the model’s predictive power.
Furthermore, this approach does not remedy the model’s gross-
est approximation, which is not that of unit emissivity but
rather of neglecting heat transfer by convection .
C. A radiative-convective equilibrium model
Convection brings water vapor and heat from the surface
into the interior of the atmosphere, where the water vapor
condenses to form cloud and rain drops. This condensationreleases the latent heat of vaporization which was drawn from
the surface when the molecules ﬁrst evaporated, and this heat
from condensation is then radiated out to space by atmo-spheric GHGs, closing the loop. These processes are depicted
on the right-hand side of Fig. 1. Thus, planetary energy bal-
ance is not achieved through purely radiative means but ismediated by convection, with water vapor as the key middle-
man. The atmosphere is, thus, better thought of as in a state of
radiative-convective equilibrium , or RCE for short.
16
To incorporate this into the simple one-layer model (4),
we must add a convective heat ﬂux Fcto the surface energy
balance (4b). An additional variable requires an additional
equation, however. To obtain this, we invoke the fact thatconvective heat ﬂuxes are extremely efﬁcient at transferringheat to the atmosphere, with two simplifying consequences:
The surface temperature becomes essentially continuous
with the atmospheric temperature near the surface, and atmo-spheric temperature proﬁles T(z) lie more or less along a con-
vective adiabat . A convective adiabat is the temperature
proﬁle of a parcel lifted adiabatically from the surface; sucha parcel will expand and cool as it rises along the z-axis to
lower pressures, much like the cool air escaping from the
valve of a pressurized bicycle tire. For a dry air parcel, thisproﬁle is determined by the dry adiabatic lapse rate ,

where gis the gravitational acceleration and Cpis the spe-
ciﬁc heat of air (see Appendix A , which includes a derivation
of Eq. (5)from undergraduate thermodynamics). Moisture,
along with atmospheric dynamics besides convection, modi-
ﬁes this lapse rate somewhat and makes it variable over the
globe, with a global average value of
C/C17/C0dT
dz/C256:5K=km ðavg:lapse rate Þ: (6)
If we then assume a mean pressure pa¼0:5 atm for our single-
layer atmosphere, corresponding to a height of za/C255k m
(Fig. 2),17then Eq. (6)yields the convective constraint ,
Ts/C0Ta¼Cza¼32:5K: (7)
Our single-layer RCE model is then
S¼rTa4; (8a)
SþrTa4¼rTs4þFc; (8b)
Ts/C0Ta¼Cza: (8c)
Solving these equations is again straightforward: Eq. (8a)
again yields Ta¼Tem, so then Eq. (8c)yieldsTs¼TemþCza¼287:5K: (9)
This is remarkably close to the observed preindustrial value
of 288 K. Furthermore, Eq. (9)tells us that this value stems
from the radiative energy balance of the planet (as embodied
inTem), combined with the effects of convection on the tem-
perature proﬁle of the troposphere (as embodied in C). Thus,
this single-layer RCE model appears to have signiﬁcant ped-
agogical advantages over the single-layer radiative equilib-rium model (4), but to our knowledge has not yet appeared
in textbooks. It has appeared in the journal literature before,
for instance, in the papers of Hansen et al.
18and Payne
et al.19
An important subtlety in the simple calculation above is
that it was not necessary to solve the surface energy balance
equation (8b); the convective ﬂux Fcthere acts as a
Lagrange multiplier, taking on whatever value is required to
satisfy Eq. (8b) subject to the constraint (8c); the convective
ﬂux is, thus, analogous to the tension in a pendulum arm,
which takes on whatever value is required to satisfy
Newton’s laws while keeping the pendulum bob at a ﬁxed
distance from its origin.
While this simple one-layer RCE model yields a reason-
able estimate of Tsand also illustrates the essence of how
convection couples the surface and atmospheric tempera-
tures, we will also need a vertically resolved view of the
atmosphere for what follows. Figure 2shows the following
temperature proﬁle, obtained by integrating Eq. (6)and also
converting to pressure coordinatesFig. 2. A simpliﬁed RCE temperature proﬁle, given by Eq. (10)with Ts¼288
K, along with an isothermal stratosphere with temperature Tstrat¼210 K. The
RCE proﬁle (10) reaches up to the tropopause at roughly 12 km or 200 hPa,
where it intersects the isothermal stratospheric proﬁle. Also shown is the repre-
sentative height of the single-layer atmosphere pa¼0:5a t m ¼500 hPa, as well
as the characteristic cloud-top temperature Tcld¼220 K discussed in Sec. VI A.

where Rdis the gas constant for dry air and psis the surface
pressure (see Appendix A for the deﬁnition of Rdand the deri-
vation of Eq. (10b) ). Equation (10a) is the vertically resolved
version of the convective constraint Eq. (8c). In general, how-
ever, this convective constraint is only valid below an a ltitude of
10–15 km; this region is known as the troposphere . Above the
troposphere lie the stratosphere and other air masses, which areheated primarily by ultraviolet solar absorption rather than con-vection, and are closer to radiative equilibrium rather than RCE.For simplicity, the stratosphere is represented here by an isother-mal layer with characteristic temperature T
strat¼210 K, which
is attached to the troposphere at the tropopause ,w h e r e Ta¼
Tstrat(Fig. 2). The physics governing the height and temperature
of the tropopause and, hence, the characteristic temperatureT
strat, is still a subject of active research.20
A profound implication of the convective constraint (10a)
is that the tropospheric temperature proﬁle Tais pegged to
Ts, and the two cannot be varied independently. In other
words, the surface and atmosphere should be thought of as aunit, with a single degree of freedom between them.21This
tight surface-atmosphere coupling is a hallmark of RCE and
has important consequences, as we will see below.
III. FORCING-FEEDBACK PRELIMINARIES
Now that we have a picture for Earth’s energy ﬂows and
RCE, we can begin to think about climate sensitivity. Anextremely useful paradigm for this is the forcing-feedback
framework , which we describe next.
A. The forcing-feedback framework
In this paper, and in much (but certainly not all) climate
modeling, the atmospheric CO
2speciﬁc concentration22q
(kg CO 2/kg air) is considered an external parameter, which
is prescribed and does not respond to the internal dynamicsof the system.23In studying changes in surface temperature
DTs, which result from changes in q, it turns out to be
extremely convenient to decompose the system’s responseinto two distinct processes, one which occurs at ﬁxed T
s, and
the other which occurs at ﬁxed q.24(Also, it will be natural
sometimes to use /C0OLR as our variable for planetary ther-
mal energy ﬂux, since an increase in /C0OLR indicates
increasing planetary thermal energy.)
The ﬁrst process is the decrease in OLR (increase in
/C0OLR) due to an increase in qfrom an initial concentration
qito a ﬁnal concentration qf, holding Tsﬁxed; since the lapse
rateCdoes not depend on q, this also ﬁxes TaðzÞin Eq.
(10a) .25This decrease in OLR due to the change in qis
known as the CO 2forcing ,
F/C17/C0 ð OLRðqfÞ/C0OLRðqiÞÞ (11)
(Fis the change in /C0OLR, so F>0 for a CO 2increase).
The forcing Fbreaks the planetary energy balance, causing
additional heat to accumulate in the system.
Next, this heat accumulation causes a temperature increase
DTsand, hence, a countervailing increase in OLR (decreasein/C0OLR), which persists until the planetary energy balance
(3a) is restored and a new equilibrium is established (how
long this takes, and what happens along the way, is
addressed in Sec. VII A ). This increase in OLR due to
increasing Tscan be approximated as ðdOLR =dTsÞDTs,
where the derivative is taken at ﬁxed q¼qf. Consistent with
the sign convention in Eq. (11), we then deﬁne the “feedback
parameter” kas minus this derivative26
k/C17/C0dOLR
dTs/C12/C12/C12/C12
q¼qf: (12)
Noting that ðdOLR =dTsÞDTs¼F in equilibrium, we have
DTs¼/C0 F =k. When qf¼2qi, we write the forcing as F2/C2,
and the corresponding DTsis deﬁned to be the equilibrium
climate sensitivity (ECS), that is
ECS¼/C0F2/C2
k: (13)
(The choice of a multiplicative rather than additive change
inqfor deﬁning ECS will be discussed below.) Equation
(13) is known as the forcing-feedback decomposition of
ECS. It allows us to study ECS by studying Fandksepa-
rately, which we will do in Secs. IVand V, respectively.
Note that we have ignored the possibility that the absorbed
solar radiation Smay also depend on Ts, which would con-
tribute a dS=dTsterm to the deﬁnition of k. We discuss these
so-called “shortwave” feedbacks in Sec. VI.
B. Blackbody estimate of ECS
As an exercise, we will use Eq. (13) to estimate ECS using
the blackbody approximation (2). The blackbody approxima-
tion allows us to calculate k, but we still need a value for the
forcing F2/C2. For the moment, we obtain this by appealing to
comprehensive radiative transfer calculations, which for dec-ades
27have found a fairly consistent value of
F2/C2/C254W=m2: (14)
We will provide a theoretical estimate of this number in
Sec. IV.
Turning now to the feedback parameter k, a blackbody
estimate for this can be obtained from Eq. (2), noting also
that TemandTsvary in a 1–1 fashion according to Eq. (9).
Recalling that Tem¼255 K, this yields
kblackbody ¼/C0dOLR
dTs¼/C04rTem3/C25/C03:75 W =m2=K:
(15)
According to Eq. (13), this yields ECS ¼ð4W=m2Þ=
ð3:75 W =m2=KÞ/C251 K, three times smaller than the consen-
sus value of 3 K.
To understand why F2/C2/C254W=m2, as well as make a
better estimate of kand hence ECS, we need to move beyond
the blackbody approximation and account for the spectral
nature of Earth’s greenhouse effect, i.e., that the emission
temperature Temof outgoing longwave radiation actually
depends rather markedly on frequency, and that Temat a
given frequency and Tsmay not necessarily exhibit a 1–1
relationship as in Eq. (9). A key ingredient in understanding
734 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 9, September 2023 Nadir Jeevanjee 734 04 October 2023 22:56:59
how these quantities do behave will be the emission level
approximation , which we turn to next.
C. Emission level approximation
In Sec. II, we deﬁned Earth’s emission temperature Temin
Eq.(2)and then assumed an average blackbody emission
level pa¼0:5 atm. This led to a 1–1 relationship between
TemandTs, which allowed us to estimate k.
To reﬁne this, we ﬁrst deﬁne a spectrally resolved emis-
sion temperature Temð/C23Þby the relation,
OLR /C23¼pBð/C23;Temð/C23ÞÞ; (16)
where OLR /C23is the spectrally resolved OLR in units of
W=ðm2/C1cm/C01Þand satisfying OLR ¼Ð
OLR /C23d/C23, and
Bð/C23;TÞis the Planck density in units of W =ðm2/C1cm/C01/C1srÞ.
(The factor of pabove accounts for integration over solid
angle.)28The spectral coordinate here is “wavenumber” /C23,
deﬁned as inverse wavelength and, thus, proportional to fre-quency, with standard unit of cm
/C01. The deﬁnition (16) of
Temð/C23Þ, as the temperature whose Planck emission yields
OLR /C23, straightforwardly generalizes the blackbody deﬁni-
tion(2).
The next task is to determine what level(s) in the atmo-
sphere determine Temð/C23Þ, for a given /C23. This task is aided by
the following heuristic, illustrated in Fig. 3. Consider an
atmospheric column with GHG molecules whose density
qGHG [ðkg GHG Þ=m3] decreases exponentially with height;
this is true for both CO 2and H 2O.29Now consider the emis-
sion to space (i.e., the contribution to the OLR /C23at a given /C23)
from these molecules, as pictured in Fig. 3. The top two
layers (Fig. 3(a)) have little difﬁculty emitting to space,
because their view is unobstructed, but the density of emit-
ters in these layers is relatively low, so the emission will also
be low. In the third layer (Fig. 3(b)), the molecules’ view of
space is still unobstructed (just barely), and their density ishigher, so their emission to space is higher. For layers four
and ﬁve (Fig. 3(c)), there are plenty of emitters, but their
view is almost totally obstructed, so their emission to spaceis again very low. Thus, emission to space is maximizedaround a “sweet spot” where the absorbers/emitters above
have not yet totally obstructed the view of space, but the den-
sity is high enough for emission to be appreciable. Thissweet spot will be our emission level.To formalize this, we need the notion of optical depth ,
deﬁned as

¼Effective area of absorbers
Actual area of column: (17)
Here, jrefð/C23Þare the mass absorption coefﬁcients of our GHG,
which give the effective cross-sectional area of our GHG molecules
at wavenumber /C23per unit mass (units m2=kg), evaluated at a refer-
ence pressure pref. This effective cross-section depends strongly on
frequency (e.g., Figs. 4(a)and5(a)below) but also scales with
pressure approximately as p=pref, hence the presence of this
factor in Eq. (17).31The factor of qGHGdz0in the integrand in
Eq.(17) gives the absorber mass per unit area (kg =m2)i na n
atmospheric layer of differential depth dz0.T h u s ,t h ei n t e g r a l s/C23
in Eq. (17) can be interpreted as the ratio of the integrated
effective area of absorbers above height zto the actual area of
the column, as noted in Eq. (17). Applying this notion to Fig. 3,
we see that the top two layers with low emissions correspond tos
/C23<1, where the total effective area of absorbers above is less
than the actual area of the column (the “optically thin” regime).
Similarly, the bottom two layers with low emissions correspond
tos/C23>1, where the total effective area of absorbers above is
greater than the actual area of the column (the “optically thick”
regime). The sweet spot occurs around s/C23/C251.
For simplicity, we further assume that allemission occurs
at exactly s/C23¼1; we refer to this as the emission level
approximation .32With this in mind, we deﬁne our emission
pressure pemð/C23Þby the relation
s/C23ðpemð/C23ÞÞ ¼ 1: (18)
This equation will form the basis for reasoning about both
CO 2forcing as well as the H 2O feedback, which are the sub-
jects of Secs. IVandV.
IV. CO 2FORCING
This section constructs a simple analytic model for the CO 2
forcing Eq. (11), with the aim of enabling a back-of-the-enve-
lope estimate of the characteristic 4 W =m2value for F2/C2.

The approach here is to consider spectral variations in CO 2
absorption but to do so in a simpliﬁed manner, so as to keep the
model analytically tractable. The model we construct has prece-
dent in relatively recent literature, e.g., the works of Wilson and
Gea-Banacloche,33Seeley34Jeevanjee et al. ,35and Romps
et al. ,36but has not yet appeared in textbooks. We present here
a very simple version of the model, which can be generalizedto include the effects of a non-isothermal stratosphere as well
as spectral overlap between CO
2and H 2O absorption.37
We begin with CO 2reference mass absorption coefﬁcients
jCO 2in the strongly absorbing and climatically relevant /C232
bending mode centered on wavenumber /C230¼667 cm/C01.
Figure 4(a)displays this absorption spectrum.38A key simpliﬁ-
cation we make is to ignore ﬁne-scale spectral structure and
note that on a broad scale, jCO 2ð/C23Þmay be parameterized as
jCO 2ð/C23Þ¼j0exp /C0j/C23/C0/C230j
l/C18/C19
; (19)
where j0represents a smoothed peak absorption coefﬁcient
andlis a “spectroscopic slope,” which sets the rate at which
absorption declines away from the peak.
With Eq. (19) in hand, we next evaluate the optical depth
integral (17) for CO 2, for which qGHG¼qqwhere qis a con-
stant CO 2speciﬁc concentration and qis the density of air.
Plugging this into Eq. (17) and invoking hydrostatic balance

The pressure broadening factor in the integrand above, as
well as the fact that the mass of CO 2in a layer is given by

the “exponential spectroscopy” (19), we can set sCO 2¼1

than a doubling.) The pemcurves take the form of “emissiontriangles,” which widen and deepen with increased CO 2.T h er e d
and green highlighted regions show that an increase in qyields a
decrease in surface emission, as well as “new” emission fromportions of the stratosphere (around 20 hPa) that were not emit-
ting signiﬁcantly before. Also, from Eq. (21)one can deduce that
the change in width of the emission triangles with qis given by
D/C23¼llnqf
qi/C18/C19

Note the logarithmic dependence on q, which we comment
on further below.
To turn this insight into a formula for CO 2forcing, Fig.
4(c) shows OLR /C23¼pBð/C23;TemÞobtained by inserting the
emission levels pemfrom Fig. 4(b) into the temperature pro-
ﬁle Eq. (10b) and then applying the Planck function. The
large values on the outside of the CO 2band correspond to
surface emission pBð/C23;TsÞ, and the smaller values in the
center correspond to stratospheric emission pBð/C23;TstratÞ(i.e.,
where pemð/C23Þ/H11351200 hPa). Given the deﬁnition Eq. (11) of
the forcing and the expression (22) forD/C23, the forcing can
then be read off from Fig. 4(c) as just the difference in the
area under the solid and dashed curves, i.e.,
F¼ 2llnqf
qi/C18/C19
pBð/C230;TsÞ/C0pBð/C230;TstratÞ ½/C138 : (23)
This formula can also be interpreted via Fig. 4(b) as a swap
of stratospheric emission for surface emission over spectral
regions of total width 2 D/C23. For an analytical derivation of
Eq.(23),s e e Appendix B .
We are now in a position to make a back-of-the-envelope
estimate of CO 2forcing. Evaluating Eq. (23) forTs¼288
K,Tstrat¼210 K, and for qf¼2qiyields the estimate
F2/C2/C252lln 2 pBð/C230;288 K Þ/C0pBð/C230;210 K Þ ½/C138

close to the standard value of 4 W =m2.39The magnitude of
CO 2forcing is thus set by the gross characteristics of CO 2
spectroscopy (as embodied in l), as well as the difference in
surface and stratospheric temperatures.
The formalism developed here also yields insight into the
logarithmic scaling of CO 2forcing, evident in the ln ðqf=qiÞFig. 4. (a) CO 2absorption coefﬁcients jCO 2as calculated87by a line-by-line (LBL) benchmark radiation code, coarse-grained into 10 cm/C01bins, along with an

factor in Eqs. (22) and (23). Unwinding the mathematics
leading to Eq. (22), one ﬁnds that the ln ðqf=qiÞfactor stems
from the exponential spectroscopy jCO 2ð/C23Þin Eq. (19). The
fact that jCO 2ð/C23Þappears multiplied by qin all the relevant
physical quantities [e.g., Eqs. (20) and (21)] means that a
multiplicative change in qis equivalent to an additive change
in/C23(cf.Appendix B ). Thus, multiplicative changes in q
always change the width of the pemtriangles in Fig. 4(b) by
the same D/C23, and the forcing is proportional to this width.

Note the absorption minimum at roughly 1000 cm/C01, which

inverting Eq. (28) either numerically or analytically;43where

A conspicuous feature of Fig. 5(b) is that Temin the opti-

Ts, i.e., dTem=dTs/C250. This can be deduced from Eq. (28),
where vertical variations in sH2Oat a given /C23are dominated
by the temperature-dependent exponential, with thepressure-broadening factor playing only a secondary role.Thus, to a good approximation, s
H2Ois a function of tem-
perature alone, and sH2Oð/C23Þ¼1 will occur at approximately

737 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 9, September 2023 Nadir Jeevanjee 737 04 October 2023 22:56:59
We formalize this fact, ﬁrst formulated by Simpson44in
1928, as “Simpson’s law”:
Simpson’s law : At ﬁxed RH, and for optically thick wave-
numbers /C23dominated by H 2O absorption, emission tempera-
tures are insensitive to surface temperature, i.e.,
dTemð/C23Þ
dTs/C12/C12/C12/C12
RH/C250ð/C23optically thick Þ:
This result is of course only approximate, as the pressure
broadening factor (which includes a mild Ts-dependence via
Eq.(10b) ) and other effects cause slight deviations,45but
we, nonetheless, refer to it as a “law” as it plays a fundamen-tal role in governing the strength of the water vapor feed-
back, as follows. If T
emð/C23Þand, hence, OLR /C23(by Eq. (16))
are independent of Tsfor optically thick /C23, and if we con-
sider the atmosphere perfectly transparent for the opticallythin/C23in the window region so that OLR
/C23is given by surface
emission pBð/C23;TsÞfor those wavenumbers, then the
spectrally resolved feedback parameter k/C23(satisfying

In other words, the feedback is zero in the optically thick
regions due to Simpson’s law, and in the window region is
just given by the surface blackbody response. Given this, itis now straightforward to spectrally integrate k
/C23and evaluate
atTs¼288 K to obtain k; all that is required is an estimate
of the limits of the window region. This is typically46taken
to be 800 </C23< 1200 cm/C01, although these limits are not
precisely deﬁned. For the sake of obtaining round numbers,we take the lower limit to be 750 cm
/C01, which then yields
our RCE estimate of k,47

where the integral is computed numerically. This value of
k, which was obtained here in an RCE context but in the
literature is known as the “longwave clear-sky feedback”
as it ignores cloud feedbacks and shortwave feedbacks, israther universal and occurs ubiquitously throughout obser-vational and modeling studies.
48Furthermore, kRCE
embodies the water vapor feedback discovered by MW67;
by holding RH rather than speciﬁc humidity ﬁxed,Simpson’s law becomes applicable and tells us that a sig-
niﬁcant portion of the longwave spectrum does not con-
tribute to kbecause T
emð/C23)i sﬁ x e d( F i g . 5(b)). This
signiﬁcantly reduces kfrom the naive blackbody estimate
(15) by a factor of about 2, consistent with MW67’s early
ﬁnding that the water vapor feedback doubles climate
sensitivity.
Indeed, a feedback parameter of kRCE¼/C02W=m2=K,
combined with F2/C2¼4W=m2, yields an estimated equilib-
rium climate sensitivity ofECS RCE¼/C0F2/C2
kRCE/C252K: (30)
This estimate is close to those obtained by MW67
(2.3–2.9 K) though somewhat smaller than the consensus
value of 3 K. Given the evidence that the neglected cloudand shortwave feedbacks are likely positive, however (see
Sec. VI), it is unsurprising that ECS
RCEis biased low, and it
is perhaps best regarded as a lower bound on ECS. Indeed,2
/C14C is the lower bound of the very likely range of 2–5/C14C
found in the recent sixth assessment report of the IPCC.49
VI. BEYOND RCE: ADDITIONAL FEEDBACKS
In this less detailed section, we sketch the phenomena
unaccounted for in the RCE framework, discuss their
impacts on kand ECS as assessed with numerical simula-
tions and observations, and discuss prospects for principledestimates similar in spirit to those presented above.
A. Clouds
A major omission from the framework developed so far is
clouds. Clouds exert enormous leverage over the climate sys-
tem by absorbing and emitting longwave radiation essentiallyas blackbodies, and also by reﬂecting shortwave radiation
(roughly half of Earth’s albedo is due to clouds
50). In the long-
wave, certain aspects of the radiative effects of clouds can bedescribed with a relatively simple formalism, as follows.
51
The longwave effects of clouds stem primarily from the
high clouds arising from thunderstorms and mid-latitude
winter storms; consistent with their height these clouds arevery cold with a typical cloud-top temperature T
cld¼220 K
(Fig. 2). Their Planck emission is, thus, much reduced rela-
tive to the clear-sky OLR one would see in their absence. Ifthese high clouds cover a fraction fof the Earth’s surface
(f/C250:18 in the present-day global mean
52), then one can
write the “all-sky” (i.e., actual) OLR as
OLR all¼ð1/C0fÞOLR clrþfrTcld4: (31)
In other words, high clouds mask a fraction fof OLR clr,
replacing it with cloud-top emission rTcld4.
To differentiate Eq. (31) and obtain the all-sky longwave
feedback kall, one needs to know how fandTcldrespond to
warming. Fortunately, the latter question is answered quite
simply by the so-called ﬁxed anvil temperature hypothesis,53
which is related to Simpson’s law and says that high clouds
rise with global warming so as to keep Tcldﬁxed, i.e.,
dTcld
dTs/C250: (32)
Differentiating Eq. (31), thus, yields
kall¼ð1/C0fÞkclrþdf
dTsðOLR clr/C0rTcld4Þ: (33)
As for df=dTs,fis generally expected to decrease with warm-
ing (a feedback known as the “iris effect”),54but the magnitude
of this decrease is uncertain and there is as yet insufﬁcient the-
ory to estimate it from ﬁrst principles. The terms in Eq. (33)
related to fanddf=dTs, thus, tend to compensate, and the value
738 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 9, September 2023 Nadir Jeevanjee 738 04 October 2023 22:56:59
ofkallends up not far from kclr/C25/C02W=m2=K but with larger
error bars.55
On the shortwave side, there are highly reﬂective subtropical
marine low clouds whose areal coverage is thought to decrease
with global warming, yielding an increase in absorbed sunlightwith warming and, thus, a positive contribution to the totalfeedback parameter of k
SW
cld/C240:2W=m2=K.56This decrease in
coverage is often understood via changes in environmental vari-
ables known as “cloud-controlling factors” such as the local seasurface temperature and relative humidity; sophisticated analy-
ses of these dependencies allow us to quantify the associated
feedback.57Meanwhile, these clouds have also been described
by simpliﬁed “mixed-layer models.”58However, these dots so
far remain unconnected, and a ﬁrst principles estimate of the
tropical marine low cloud feedback also remains unformulated.
B. Shortwave feedbacks
In addition to changes in sunlight reﬂected by clouds,
there are other signiﬁcant shortwave feedbacks (i.e., changesin absorbed solar radiation Swith warming) left unaccounted
for in the RCE framework. Perhaps the largest of these is the
surface-albedo feedback, due primarily to decreasing snow
and ice cover with warming, which manifests as changes inalbedo a[cf. Eq. (1)]. This yields a positive feedback
k
albedo/C240:3–0:4W=m2=K.59While highly idealized models
of the ice-albedo feedback have existed for decades,60and
comprehensive modeling studies reveal a close connection
between this feedback and the seasonal cycle,61again this
gap has not been bridged and a chalkboard estimate of thesurface-albedo feedback has yet to be formulated.
Another shortwave feedback, which receives less attention
but is not insigniﬁcant, is that due to shortwave absorption by
water vapor. Though often neglected in introductory treatments
such as that of Sec. II, it turns out that water vapor absorbs a
rather signiﬁcant amount of near-infrared sunlight—around
80 W =m
2.62Since the mass of water vapor in the atmosphere
increases with warming [at a rate roughly dictated by theClausius–Clapeyron relation (27)],63water vapor shortwave
absorption also increases, reducing the amount of (near-infra-
red) sunlight reﬂected out to space and, thus, increasing S.T h e
end result is a positive shortwave water vapor feedbackkSW
wv/C240:25 W =m2=K.64A principled estimate of kSW
wvmay be
fairly easy to obtain, leveraging the fact that water vapor short-
wave absorption should be a ﬁxed function of temperature (i.e.,
it obeys its own version of Simpson’s law), in analogy to watervapor longwave emission.65
C. The total feedback
Putting the RCE (or longwave clear-sky) estimate (29)
together with the cloud and shortwave feedbacks outlined
above yields an estimate for the total feedback parameter

This is close to the value of k¼/C01:3W=m2=K assessed by
Sherwood et al.66from multiple lines of evidence, which
indeed yields the consensus ECS value of /C0F 2/C2=k
¼ð4W=m2Þ=ð1:3W=m2=KÞ/C253 K. This more realistic
value of kwill be a key ingredient in estimating other mea-
sures of climate sensitivity, which we take up in Sec. VII.VII. BEYOND ECS: OTHER MEASURES
OF CLIMATE SENSITIVITY
In this ﬁnal section, we look beyond ECS to other mea-
sures of climate sensitivity. We will ﬁnd that ECS is a quiteidealized notion, and that other measures of climate sensitiv-
ity are more relevant for present-day warming and for under-
standing and deﬁning emissions targets. However, we willalso see that ECS, as well as its key ingredients Fandk,
naturally appear in these other measures. Thus, the basic
understanding of ECS developed here is necessary for under-standing these other measures.
A. The deep ocean and timescales of global warming
The equilibrium climate sensitivity is exactly that: An
equilibrium quantity. However, how long does it take the cli-
mate system to equilibrate with a given CO
2concentration,
and what does this evolution look like? To address this, we
need a time-dependent model of the Earth’s surface tempera-ture T
s. We proceed by neglecting the dynamics of the land
surface (since the Earth is roughly 2/3 ocean covered) and
invoking the popular two-layer ortwo-box model for the
ocean.67This model consists of a shallow mixed layer with
depth hml/C2550 m and temperature anomaly T0
mlequal to
DTs, sitting atop a much larger deep ocean with global aver-
age depth hd/C252500 m and temperature anomaly T0
d. The
model is pictured in Fig. 6.
An important characteristic of this model is that if the
mixed layer is warmed by a forcing F, it both radiates extra
energy to space at a rate of jkjT0
mland also exports energy to
the deep ocean , which we parameterize in linearized form as
cðT0

Because the deep ocean has a much larger depth and,
hence, heat capacity than the mixed layer ( hd/C29hml), we
expect T0
mlto respond to Fmuch faster than T0
ddoes.
Indeed, assuming T0
d¼0 in Eq. (35a) yields a linear,
Fig. 6. Two-box model for the ocean. See the text for discussion.

acteristic timescale,
sml¼qwhmlCw
cþjkj/C253 years : (36)
If we now consider timescales longer than sml, we may set
dT0
ml=dt¼0 in Eq. (35a) , solve for T0
ml, plug the result into
Eq.(35b) , and solve for the characteristic deep ocean time-
scale sd. This makes a nice exercise with result
sd¼qwhdCwcþjkj
cjkj/C25700 years : (37)
Thus, the vast difference in total heat capacity between the
mixed layer and deep ocean indeed leads to two timescalesfor global warming: A “fast” timescale of about s
ml/C253
years during which the mixed layer equilibrates (really a“quasi-equilibrium,” since this equilibrium state will changeas the deep ocean slowly responds), and a “slow” timescaleofs
d/C25700 years during which the deep ocean equilibrates
(a true equilibrium). On intermediate timescales in betweens
mlandsdin which the mixed layer is in quasi-equilibrium,
we can assume both dT0
ml=dt¼0 and T0
d/C250, which from
Eq.(35a) yields
T0
ml/C25F
cþjkjquasi-equilibriumðÞ : (38)
This gives the transient warming which occurs before the
deep ocean has responded. Indeed, if we specialize to thecase of a CO
2doubling, the temperature in Eq. (38) becomes
a standard sensitivity metric known as the “transient climateresponse,” or TCR,69
TCR¼F2/C2
cþjkj/C252K: (39)
This estimate is quite close to the value of 1.8 K found in the
recent sixth assessment report of the IPCC.70Comparing Eq.
(39) with Eq. (13) shows that ECS >TCR: on the intermedi-
ate timescales during which T0
ml¼TCR, the mixed layer is
both radiating heat to space andexporting heat to the deep
ocean (Fig. 6) and can, thus, come to (quasi-)equilibrium at a
lower temperature. This is of course not a true equilibriumstate, and one can interpret the ratio TCR =ECS as a measure
of the ocean’s thermal disequilibrium; this measure willprove useful in Sec. VII B .
A key assumption in Eqs. (38) and(39) is that T
0
d/C250o n
intermediate timescales. This approximation turns out to be areasonable description of the present day, and the quasi-equilibrium formula (38) (which is just a scaling of TCR)
can be used to credibly model historical as well as near-term
global warming.
71In these ways, TCR is a more relevant
metric for present day climate change than ECS, whichinstead assumes that both the mixed layer and deep ocean
have reached a mutual equilibrium, which from Eq. (37)
would take many hundreds of years.72
Note that the two-box model, while popular, is by no
means canonical. Some recent work instead employs three-box models, and the older literature often employed diffusivemodels.
73Two-box, three-box, and diffusive models were all
employed by the IPCC as emulators of more comprehensivemodels.74All these approaches, however, require empiricallydetermined parameters for heat transfer coefﬁcients and
diffusivities, analogous to our heat uptake efﬁciency c,
and principled estimates for these quantities are still
lacking.75
B. The carbon cycle and measures of carbon-climatesensitivity
In addition to only describing very long-term warming,
another limitation of ECS is that it assumes that the per-turbed CO
2concentration qisconstant while the Earth sys-
tem equilibrates. If we stop burning fossil fuels, however, q
will not remain constant; the real Earth has an active carboncycle in the land and ocean, both of which absorb signiﬁcant
amounts of anthropogenic CO
2, which would cause qto
decrease over time. Full consideration of these dynamicsleads to two additional measures of climate sensitivity which
are fundamental for both climate change science as well as
policy: the transient climate response to cumulative emis-
sions (TCRE) and the zero emissions commitment (ZEC).
TCRE is deﬁned to be the warming at a given time divided
by the cumulative emissions released prior to that time, in
Kelvins per gigaton of carbon (K/GtC). TCRE is found tohave a characteristic value of /C242K=1000 GtC, which in sim-
ulations turns out to be fairly invariant over time as well as
insensitive to emissions scenario.
76The robustness of TCRE
tells us that any identiﬁed temperature target (e.g.,
DTs¼1:5o r2/C14C) automatically reduces to a cumulative
emissions target (e.g., 750 or 1000 GtC), which can only bemet if we cease emissions prior to reaching the target. This
leads directly to the notion of net zero emissions.
77
It is possible to use the TCR of Sec. VII A , as well as the
logarithmic scaling of CO 2forcing, to make a back-of-the-
envelope estimate of TCRE as follows. Let Cemitbe our
cumulative carbon emissions since the preindustrial era
(GtC), Cprethe preindustrial mass of CO 2in the atmosphere
(GtC), and abe the fraction of Cemitstill residing in the
atmosphere (the “airborne fraction”), so that the total mass
of CO 2in the atmosphere is CpreþaCemit. Recalling that in
the quasi-equilibrium approximation, surface warming DTs
can be obtained by scaling the TCR by F=F2/C2[cf. Eqs. (38)
and(39)], we then have

In the last equality, Cemitdrops out of this expression, giving
some insight into why simulations ﬁnd TCRE to be roughlyinvariant over time.
78Furthermore, evaluating Eq. (40) for
Cpre¼590 GtC and the present day airborne fraction of a¼
0:4 indeed yields roughly 2 K/GtC, consistent with simula-
tions.79However, here we are simply using the observed
value of a; we do not yet have ways to make principled esti-
mates of afrom basic carbon cycle dynamics, and thus to

understand how and why adoes or does not vary across time
and emissions scenarios.
The zero emissions commitment (ZEC), on the other
hand, is complementary to TCRE and is deﬁned to be the
amount of residual warming occurring after emissions cease .
Simulations80tend to show that ZEC is small relative to DTs,
which is a requirement for net zero emissions goals to mean-
ingfully limit DTs. Similar to the estimate for TCRE, we may
scale TCR and also ECS to estimate ZEC, following an argu-
ment due to Tarshish.81LetTzeandazebe the temperature
and airborne fraction of cumulative emissions when emis-sions cease, and T
fandafbe the temperature and airborne
fraction at ﬁnal equilibrium, respectively. Normalizing
ZEC/C17Tf/C0TzebyTze, we have
ZEC
Tze¼Tf
Tze/C01
¼lnCpreþafCemit
Cpre/C18/C19
ECS
lnCpreþazeCemit
Cpre/C18/C19
TCR/C01b yð13Þ;ð23Þ;ð39Þ
/C25af=aze
TCR =ECS/C01: (41)
This tells us that the sign and magnitude of ZEC is deter-
mined by a competition between the chemical disequilibriuma
f=azeand thermal disequilibrium TCR =ECS when emis-
sions cease. If the chemical disequilibrium is more pro-
nounced than the thermal disequilibrium, i.e., if af=aze
<TCR =ECS, then the decline in CO 2forcing due to equilib-
rium carbon uptake will dominate over the reduction in the
deep ocean heat sink, yielding ZEC <0, and vice-versa if
af=aze<TCR =ECS. Noting that af/C250:2 is a characteristic
value, which may be obtained from principles of carbonate
chemistry,82the previously cited values aze¼0:4;TCR
¼1:8 K, and ECS ¼3 K then give ZEC =Tze/C25/C00:17,
which is indeed small (and, perhaps surprisingly, negative).
While Eq. (41) appears to explain why ZEC is small, it is
only a proximal explanation. The heat uptake efﬁciency c,
which entered into our estimate Eq. (39) of TCR, as well as
the present day airborne fraction a/C250:4, were evaluated via
simulations or observations rather than theoretically, so we
do not yet have fully principled estimates for TCRE or ZEC.Such estimates would necessarily draw upon physics from
across the Earth system, including the dynamics of ocean
heat uptake, ocean carbon uptake, CO
2fertilization of the
biosphere, and more. A chalkboard explanation of these
quantities, thus, poses a grand challenge to climate science;
the simple models presented here are simply a ﬁrst steptowards that goal.

We here derive expression (5)for the dry adiabatic lapse

Consider a rising convective parcel that conserves its mass

APPENDIX B: ANALYTIC DERIVATION
OF FORMULA FOR CO2FORCING
The forcing Fis usually obtained by numerical integra-
tion in /C23across the CO 2band shown in Fig. 4. Here, we will
instead pursue an analytical integration over /C23, following the
thesis of Seeley.87We will take advantage of the symmetry
evident in Fig. 4and simply double the integral for /C23>/C23 0.
We will also take advantage of the key fact that qand
jCO 2ð/C23Þappear in Eq. (20) as a product; this, along with the
exponential spectroscopy Eq. (19) and the fact that Temand
pemare related by Eq. (10b) , means that
dTem
dlnq¼dTem
dlnjCO 2¼/C0ldTem
d/C23: (B1)
This equation encapsulates the fact, mentioned towards the
end of Sec. IV, that a multiplicative change in qis equivalent
to that of a uniform translation in /C23. Putting these ingredients
together, the forcing Eq. (11) can now be evaluated as an
integral over /C23from band center /C230to the upper limit
/C23þ/C25750 cm/C01, where we ignore spectral variations in the
Planck density. This yields

14See Sec. VI B and Note 65 for more on this approximation.

16Thermodynamically speaking, this is a steady-state, not an equilibrium, as
the net fluxes of e.g., solar radiation, thermal radiation, water vapor at the
Earth’s surface, etc., are nonzero. Accordingly, the Earth does not come intothermal equilibrium with either the Sun or outer space but tends towards a
temperature in between them. Nonetheless, the use of the term “equilibrium”to describe a steady-state in climate is ubiquitous, so we adopt this terminol-ogy here.
17It is a nice exercise to derive this height analytically, as follows: Assume
an isothermal atmosphere with T¼Tem, which from Eqs. (A3) and(A2)
yields the exponential dependence
p¼ð1 atmÞexpð/C0z=HÞ; (B2)
where H/C17RdTem=g/C257:5 km is the atmospheric “scale height.” Setting
pa¼0:5 atm then yields za¼Hln 2/C255 km. Note also that in this isother-
mal approximation, and by the ideal gas law (A2) ,q/C24p=Talso declines
exponentially with height.
18Hansen et al. (1981) .
19Payne et al. (2015) .
20Stratospheric temperatures are sometimes thought to be governed by the
so-called “skin temperature,” which arises by considering an optically thin
layer of atmosphere sitting atop the troposphere; a standard argument yields
a skin temperature of Tem=ﬃﬃﬃ
24p
¼214 K ( Pierrehumbert, 2011 ;Hartmann,
2015 ). This argument ignores the strong dependence of tropopause and
stratospheric temperatures on atmospheric composition, however (e.g.,
Manabe and Strickler, 1964 ). Recent work instead postulates that Tstratis
governed by the physics of H 2O radiative transfer ( Seeley et al. , 2019 ;
Jeevanjee and Fueglistaler, 2020b ), but more work on this topic is needed.
21At least to first approximation. See discussion in Jeevanjee et al. (2022) .
22This is the ratio of the mass of a given substance in a parcel to the total
mass of the parcel. For further discussion, see Pierrehumbert (2011) , p. 87.
23While such a perspective ignores the interactive carbon cycle dynamics of the
atmosphere, land, and ocean, it is, nonetheless, a useful starting point for under-standing the impacts of fossil-fuel combustion on Earth’s climate. We discuss
how carbon cycle dynamics modify the picture presented here in Sec. VI.
24There are, however, processes known as atmospheric adjustments which
blur this distinction; see Sherwood et al. (2015) .
25An important exception to this reasoning is the stratospheric adjustment ,
which is the direct response of stratospheric temperatures to a change in q
resulting from the increased emission to space depicted in Fig. 4(b) (greendashed lines). This change in stratospheric temperatures occurs indepen-
dently of changes in T
s, precisely because the stratosphere is not coupled to
the surface in the way the troposphere is. For further discussion, see Hansen
et al. (1997) ;Houghton et al. (1994) .
26Another useful consequence of this definition is that “positive,” amplify-
ing feedbacks make positive contributions to k.

29Since CO 2is well-mixed, its density is proportional to the air density q,
andqdecreases exponentially with height (cf. Note 17). For H 2O, its density
is dominated by its Clausius–Clapeyron exponential dependence on temper-ature (Eqs. (26) and(27)), and temperature is linear in height, so H
2O den-
sity is exponential in height as well.
30We here assume a two-stream approximation with unit diffusion coeffi-
cient for simplicity ( Pierrehumbert, 2010 ).
31This pressure scaling is due to collisional pressure broadening away from
spectral line centers and is also accompanied by additional, typically lesspronounced temperature scalings. See Pierrehumbert (2010) .

39This estimate ignores several effects, each of which generate 20%–30%
corrections but which offset each other. These effects include the overlap-ping of CO
2absorption by H 2O absorption, the masking of CO 2forcing by
clouds, and stratospheric adjustment. See Jeevanjee et al. (2021b) ;Huang
et al. (2016) .
40The H 2O absorption coefficients shown here have been simplified by
neglecting so-called “continuum” absorption. Continuum absorption signifi-
cantly affects absorption in the infrared window at warmer surface tempera-
tures of 300 K and above. See Pierrehumbert (2010) ;Shine et al. (2012) ;
Koll et al. (2022) .
41This fixed relative humidity assumption, popularized by Manabe and
Wetherald (1967) , has been well justified by decades of subsequent simula-
tions and observation ( Jeevanjee et al. , 2022 ;Colman and Soden, 2021 ).
42In particular, we multiply the integrand by Tav=T0, which does not deviate
too far from 1 but which allows the exponential to be integrated. Since theintegrand is dominated by values of the exponential evaluated near T,w e
also approximate pðT
0Þ/C25pðTÞso it can be pulled outside the integral. This
expression and these approximations are discussed in more detail inJeevanjee and Fueglistaler (2020b) .

consistent with the interpretation that the atmosphere and surface function asa unit so repartitioning energy between them do not affect theirtemperatures.

69Strictly speaking, TCR is defined via simulations in which CO 2is
increased from its preindustrial value at 1% year until the concentration hasdoubled, and TCR is defined as the warming at the time of doubling (aroundyear 70). However, it has been shown that the two-box expression (39) forTCR captures the actual TCR fairly well (Held et al. , 2010; Geoffroy et al. ,
2013).

Wigley and Schlesinger (1985) .
74See Chapter 7 of the IPCC sixth assessment report ( Forster et al. , 2021 ),
and in particular, cross-chapter box 7.1. Two popular emulators employedthere are MAGICC ( Meinshausen et al. , 2011 ), which has a diffusive deep
ocean, and FaIR ( Leach et al. , 2021 ), which has a three-box ocean.

79Friedlingstein et al. (2020) provide values of Cpreanda. It is also a nice
exercise to estimate Cpreby multiplying the mass of the atmosphere
4pR2
Eps=gby the specific CO 2concentration corresponding to the number
concentration of 280 ppm. Note also that for present-day Cemitof roughly 700
GtC, we have aCemit=Cpre/C250:45, so the approximation ln ð1þaCemit=
CpreÞ/C25aCemit=Cpreused in Eq. (40) is marginally acceptable, but will fail
for larger Cemit.

86There is some sleight-of-hand here, as hydrostatic balance typically applies
to the pressure and density of the quiescent environment , rather than a rising
parcel. For most applications (such as ours), this approximation is permissible,but if we take it to extremes (such as applying the dry adiabatic lapse rate Eq.(5)over large enough distances to generate negative temperatures) it can lead
to nonsensical results; for further discussion see Romps (2020) .
