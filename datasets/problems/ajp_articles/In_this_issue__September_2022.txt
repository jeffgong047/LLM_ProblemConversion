Calculation and measurement of center of mass: An all-
in-one activity using Tangram puzzles
Jose M. Campillo-Robles, Ibon Alonso, Ane Gondra, and
Nerea Gondra
90(9), p. 652
10.1119/5.0061884Experimentally determining a rigid body’s center of mass
is straightforward and is often done in middle or high school.An accurate calculation of the center of mass is more of achallenge for undergraduate students, especially if the bodyin question does not possess a high degree of symmetry. Thisarticle presents a ﬂexible activity where students create theirown geometric ﬁgure, analytically calculate its center ofmass with the aid of CAD software, and then check their
results experimentally. Student and instructor resources are
provided to readers as supplemental material. Instructors ofapplied physics or engineering physics may be particularlyinterested in adapting and implementing this activity in theircourses. A video abstract accompanies the online version ofthis paper.
The golfer’s curse revisited with motion constants

Calling all golfers. How often have you experienced that
moment of horror as your perfectly-directed putt rolls aroundon the lip of the hole, seemingly undecided as to whether itwill fall in or spite you by popping back out onto the green?This paper, appropriate for an advanced dynamics class,investigates the physics of this situation both theoreticallyand experimentally. Popping-out behavior is, in principle,possible for balls with high enough rotational velocities, on
the order of 20 radians per second. While this is higher than
would normally be the case in a game (which is probablywhy such emergence is rare in practice), it is not unreason-able: try making it happen. Experimentally, the authorsreport measurements of the moment of inertia and coefﬁcient
of dynamic friction of a golf ball.
Conic transfer arcs for Kepler’s problem
Robert W. Easton, Rodney L. Anderson, and
Martin W. Lo
90(9), p. 666
10.1119/5.0080491Orbits for spacecrafts can be optimized for fuel costs,
travel time, or a variety of other quantities. Inspired by the
Lambert problem, this paper shows how to ﬁnd all possibleorbits between two points in terms of a single parameter,thus simplifying the problem of searching for an optimizedorbit.
The basic concepts determining electromagnetic
shielding
Guy A. E. Vandenbosch
90(9), p. 672
10.1119/5.0087295Undergraduate treatments of the interaction of electro-
magnetic waves with surfaces frequently involve only abrief discussion of reﬂection, transmission, absorption,and skin depth. Unfortunately, this treatment leaves stu-
dents underprepared to understand electromagnetic shield-
ing in practical applications. While the intricacies ofshielding are discussed in the research literature, this paperbridges the gap, providing an understanding of how shieldswork in various geometries and guidelines for their
effectiveness.
Electrostatic shape energy differences of one-dimensional
line charges
Matt Majic
90(9), p. 682
10.1119/5.0079100Subtracting two divergent quantities to obtain physically
relevant information is a technique used in many branchesof physics. This paper explores this process both analyti-
cally and numerically in an electrostatics context.
Undergraduate students will already know how to calculatethe electrostatic potential energy of a continuous chargedistribution and may already be aware that the potentialenergy of a one-dimensional line charge is formally inﬁnite.
Nevertheless, students can learn to think of the one-
dimensional case as a limit of various extended objects. Bysubtracting the self-energy of two differently shaped

objects, a ﬁnite energy difference is obtained, even in the
one-dimensional limit. Students of electromagnetism willundoubtedly be interested in the content of this article, aswill anyone who wants to learn more about the ﬁne art oftaming inﬁnities.
A new presentation of electromagnetic relations in SI
units
Mitchell Golden
90(9), p. 688
10.1119/5.0085513Many instructors are familiar with the struggle of trying to
explain the meaning of the permittivity of free space e
0and
the magnetic permeability of free space l0when teaching
electromagnetism. While it is common to blame SI units forthis circumstance, this paper shows how electromagnetismcan be reformulated within SI to do away with these histori-cal constants while retaining the general convenience of SIby introducing a new, common-sense coupling constant.
Black-hole analog in vehicular traffic
Luanna K. de Souza and George E. A. Matsas
90(9), p. 692
10.1119/5.0091957This article offers an amazing connection between a situa-
tion familiar to students, namely the danger under extremeweather conditions of a trafﬁc pileup, and the appearance ofa black hole communication horizon. The correspondingvehicular spacetime analogue can serve as a simple introduc-tion to black hole physics.
An approach to graded physics colloquium assignments
Eric W. Burkholder
90(9), p. 697
10.1119/5.0097099Most graduate programs require students to attend depart-
mental colloquia on a credit or non-credit basis as part oftheir curriculum. However, little literature exists on facultyexpectations for why students should attend and what theyare expected to get out of colloquia, student perceptions oftheir value, or assessments of how well any expectations are
met. This paper describes a model for a graded colloquium
course that involves a faculty survey of expectations and stu-
dent feedback on the effectiveness of presentations.Suggestions for future revisions to the model are suggested,
as are possible avenues for future study.
Apparatus and method to recover the Mueller matrix in
bright-field microscopy
Soﬁa Obando-Vasquez, Ana Doblas, and Carlos Trujillo
90(9), p. 702
10.1119/5.0081673A polarization-sensitive brightﬁeld microscopy setup to
measure the Mueller matrix of transparent samples is pre-
sented. Acquisition and analysis of thirty-six intensity-based
images using this setup is demonstrated to produce a sam-ple’s Mueller matrix, from which several of the sample’s
optical properties can be determined, including diattenua-
tion, polarizance, retardance, depolarization, and angle ofpolarization. Samples investigated include a linear polarizer
and two biological materials. The work described here offers
an accessible optics-related project on polarization andMueller matrix analysis for the undergraduate instructional
laboratory.
