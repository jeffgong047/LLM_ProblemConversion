The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, and the exact coefﬁcients
of the decomposition can be determined through a few measurements of its value at different
locations. Using measurements from a magnetometer on board the International Space Station, we
computed the multipolar moments of an expansion in spherical harmonics to order 3, calculated thelocation of the magnetic dip poles, and produced an intensity map of the magnetic ﬁeld across the
globe. The accuracy of the results was evaluated by comparison with data from the International
Geomagnetic Reference Field.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Laplace equation,
r2V¼0; (1)
shows up early in an electromagnetism course in the context
of electrostatics (Ref. 1, Chap. 1). Solving the Laplace equa-
tion in spherical coordinates leads to the expansion of theelectrostatic potential Vin spherical harmonics:1

Here, r,h, and /are, respectively, the distance to the origin,
the polar angle, and the azimuthal angle. AlmandBlmare the
expansion coefﬁcients, and PlmðxÞis the associated Legendre
polynomial; landmare called the degree and order of the
spherical harmonics, respectively.
In this article, we propose a real-life application of the
multipolar expansion of the solution to the Laplace equation
to the case of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. From the compari-
son of a limited number of measurements to this seriesexpansion, one can reconstruct the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeldabove its surface and determine the location of the magneticdip poles. This project relates the theory with real data and
allows easy comparison with tabulated data, making it a nice
tool in the teaching of electromagnetism.
In the work carried out by our students (presented in Sec.
IV), measurements of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld were per-
formed on board the International Space Station (ISS) at
points along its orbit. However, this project can be applied to
other situations such as measurements collected from differ-ent locations on the surface of the Earth (Sec. III). In addi-
tion to giving students the thrill of working with datacollected on the ISS, using these measurements challenged
students to understand not only electromagnetism but also
reference frame transformations. Moreover, the comparisonbetween theory and experiment required the construction ofalgorithms and some amount of programming. Using knowl-
edge acquired in other disciplines raised students’ awareness
that, to tackle practical problems, they needed to intercon-nect different disciplines of their curriculum.
II. MULTIPOLAR EXPANSION OF THE MAGNETIC
FIELD ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is complex and evolves in
time. Deriving tractable models to describe it as accuratelyas possible is of practical importance for navigation,
2
defense, and land surveying, and also of scientiﬁc impor-
tance for study of topics ranging from properties of the
Earth’s core3to animal migration (see Ref. 4for a review).
The intensity of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld along its surface
varies between 20 and 65 lT. This ﬁeld can be described, to
a ﬁrst approximation, by a magnetic dipole placed at the cen-
ter of the Earth and tilted by 11/C14with respect to Earth’s rota-
tion axis. The geomagnetic poles are the (antipodal) points of
intersection of the dipole axis with the surface of the Earth.
The real magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth is, however, not per-
fectly dipolar. For example, the intensity of the magneticﬁeld is abnormally low in the South Atlantic (the so-called
South Atlantic anomaly), and the dip poles (points on the
surface of the Earth where the magnetic ﬁeld is vertical) donot coincide with the geomagnetic poles, neither are they
antipodal (on opposite points on the Earth’s surface).
Improved descriptions of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld can beobtained by going to higher orders of a multipolar expansion,
as we shall see below.
We start from Ampe `re–Maxwell’s law,

where ~His the magnetic ﬁeld strength and ~jis the free cur-
rent density. One can neglect the time-variation of the dis-
placement ﬁeld ~D:@~D=@t¼0, since the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld varies slowly in time. At the surface of the Earth and in
the atmosphere, one can further set ~j¼0, because the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is essentially produced by currents

inside its core.5Moreover, in the atmosphere, ~H¼~B=l0,
where ~Bis the magnetic ﬁeld and l0is the magnetic perme-
ability of the vacuum. Equation (3)then simpliﬁes to
~r/C2 ~B¼0) ~B¼/C0 ~rw; (4)
where wis called the scalar magnetic potential. Plugging Eq.
(4)in Gauss’s law for the magnetic ﬁeld, one gets
~r/C1~B¼0)r2w¼0; (5)
that is, the scalar potential wobeys Laplace’s equation.
The scalar magnetic potential can, therefore, be expanded
into spherical coordinates in the same way as in Eq. (2).I ti s
natural to choose the center of the Earth as the origin of thecoordinates and the axis of rotation of the Earth as the polaraxis. The terms with coefﬁcients A
lmgrow with rand, hence,
cannot represent the magnetic ﬁeld created by currents circu-lating inside the Earth. We shall, therefore, set them to zero,as, on the surface of the Earth and in its atmosphere, theinﬂuence of external sources is not generally signiﬁcant.Moreover, since there are no magnetic charges, the monopo-lar term is B
00¼0. Finally, the terms with coefﬁcients Blm
can be rearranged to give

Equations (6)and (10) are in fact those used in the
International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) withN¼13 for the latest (2020) model.6The IGRF computes the
values of the multipolar moments gm
landhm
lfrom large sets
of data obtained from observatories and satellites across the
globe.7It is updated every 5 years and, for each release, con-
tains both the multipolar moments and their expected (linear)time variation for the next 5-year period.6In the following,
we will compare our results with the much more preciseresults of the IGRF. We chose the IGRF as reference, as we
are more familiar with it, the other major model of the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld using a spherical harmonics expan-sion, with N¼12, being the WMM (world magnetic
model).

A note should be made about the comparison of the
N¼13 IGRF moments to our N¼3 results. If we had access
to measurements covering the entire surface of the Earth,
then a model with N¼13 should produce the same moments
up to order 3 as a model with N¼3. However, that is not the
case with a ﬁnite number of measurements (for a clear dis-cussion of this issue, see Ref. 5, Chap. 2.3), and the less
well-spaced the measurements, the bigger the difference is inthe moments evaluated by the different order models.
However, the IGRF model is based on a large and well-
spaced set of measurements, and the absolute value of themoments decreases fast with increasing order. This makes
437 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 6, June 2022 Barros e S /C19aet al. 437 04 October 2023 23:10:45
the values of the lowest order moments in the IGRF model
almost insensitive to further raising the order of the expan-
sion, so that they can be considered as good estimates of the
real values of the moments. The choice of the N¼3 order
for the truncation of the series in our model was made to
make the problem interesting enough for the students while
still rendering it possible to solve using a personal computerin a reasonable amount of time.
III. CALCULATING THE MULTIPOLAR MOMENTS
FROM MAGNETOMETER READINGS
We would now like to show how measurements of the
magnetic ﬁeld on different locations around the globe, either
at its surface or in the atmosphere, enable the determination
of the multipolar moments g
m
landhm
lvia Eqs. (9)and(10).
These equations are written in a spherical geocentric frame
(where we may assume that the polar axis is the rotation axis
of the Earth, and that the azimuthal angle measures longi-tude), while magnetometer readings typically come in the
cartesian frame of the magnetometer, so that, in order to
compare the two, one has to convert between the two framesat each location.
We begin by writing Eq. (10) in the cartesian Earth-
centered Earth-ﬁxed frame (ECEF) ð^e
x;^ey;^ezÞ, which is such
that
^er¼coshcos/^exþcoshsin/^eyþsinh^ez; (13)
^eh¼/C0sinhcos/^ex/C0sinhsin/^eyþcosh^ez; (14)
^e/¼/C0sin/^exþcos/^ey: (15)
Note that we used lowercase letters for the cartesian axes of
the ECEF frame in order to differentiate them from those of
the magnetometer for which we shall use capital letters.
For the purpose of a student project, readings of the mag-
netic ﬁeld across the globe are freely available from the
global scientiﬁc magnetic observatory network through the
Intermagnet website.9Alternatively, a collaboration can be
setup among schools using lower precision magnetometers,
which are available at low cost, as was done in Ref. 10.
For most magnetic measurements on the Earth’s surface,
the magnetometer’s frame is chosen such that the Xaxis of
the magnetometer points towards the north, its Yaxis points
towards the east, and its Zaxis points towards the center of
the Earth (Fig. 1). It is an instructive task for students to
obtain the equations that relate the components of the ﬁeld inthe magnetometer frame, B
X,BY, and BZ, to its components
in the ECEF frame Bx,By, and Bz:
BX¼/C0cos/sinhdBx/C0sin/sinhdByþcoshdBz; (16)
BY¼/C0sin/Bxþcos/By; (17)
BX¼/C0cos/coshdBx/C0sin/coshdBy/C0sinhdBz; (18)
where hdstands for the geodetic latitude, which is the angle
made by the normal to the surface of the Earth with the plane
of the equator. Geocentric latitude, h, on the other hand, is
the angle made by the equator with a straight line connectingthe location with the center of the Earth. The two quantities
differ by a very small amount, but they are not identical,
since the Earth is not perfectly spherical. The WorldGeodetic System (WGS84) uses a reference ellipsoid for the
surface of the Earth deﬁned by the equation

Once the measurements have been performed, the experi-
mental values can be compared to Eqs. (16)–(18) to derive
the value of the multipolar moments. This can be done using
the method of least squares. Let bi

IV. OUR TEAM’S PROJECT
Our team’s work was done in the context of the “European
Astro Pi Challenge Mission Space Lab 2020–2021,” a contest
promoted by ESA and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, where
secondary school students are invited to write a code to berun on a Raspberry Pi device12on board the International
Space Station (ISS). Another example of work conducted bystudents in the Astro Pi Challenge, using the same equipment,
can be found in Ref. 13.
Our team of students (the last three authors of this article)
wrote a code in Python to register the magnetic ﬁeld at regu-lar time intervals along the two orbits of the ISS duringwhich the code was run (Fig. 2). They recorded 4871 read-
ings on April 21, 2021, from 02:24:23 GMT to 05:18:56
GMT, with an average interval between readings of 2.15 s.
The magnetometer we used was the one included in the
Sense Hat,
12an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi computer,containing a gyroscope, an accelerometer, a magnetometer, and
sensors for temperature, pressure, and humidity. The Raspberry
Pi is an affordable single-board computer, costing approxi-mately 80 e, while the Sense Hat costs about 40 e. The dimen-
sions of the whole set (Raspberry Pi plus Sense Hat, Fig. 3)a r e
approximately 9 /C26/C22c m3, and it weights less than 100 g.
The Sense Hat magnetometer has a relatively low accuracy ofthe order of hundreds of nT. The Sense Hat was made espe-cially for the Astro Pi mission, but other low-cost magneto-
meters can be attached to the computer, as was done in Ref. 10.
The ISS circles the Earth with a 93-min period at an aver-
age altitude of 400 km, and its orbit is inclined by 51.6
/C14with
respect to the equator. We had access to the ISS positioncoordinates for each measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld in
the form of the altitude h, longitude /, and geodetic latitude
h
dand converted them to the cartesian coordinates of the
ECEF using Eqs. (21)–(23) .
However, we cannot use Eqs. (16)–(18) to convert the
components of the ﬁeld between the ECEF frame and the
magnetometer’s frame because the magnetometer axes are
not, in this case, aligned in the bottom–up, South–North, andWest–East directions. In fact, we were not provided with
information about the orientation of the magnetometer inside
the ISS. All we knew was that is was at rest with respect tothe ISS. Therefore, we ﬁrst related the components of the
Fig. 2. The two orbits of the ISS mapped by our team.

magnetic ﬁeld in the ECEF frame, Bx,By, and Bz, with its
components in a moving frame ﬁxed with respect to the ISS,
B~X;B~Y, and B~Z, and then related, through a ﬁxed but
unknown rotation, the latter with the ﬁeld components along
the magnetometer axes, BX,BY, and BZ. The resulting trans-
formations from the ﬁrst to the third set of components
replace Eqs. (16)–(18) in our case. We note that the remain-
ing results of Sec. IIIare unaffected and remain valid in our
case.
The ISS is made to orbit the Earth with the same side per-
manently facing the Earth and with the same side facing the
direction of motion too (Fig. 4). This allows for an easy con-
struction of a reference frame, which is ﬁxed with respect to
the ISS. The LVLH (local vertical, local horizontal) refer-
ence frame of the ISS is deﬁned in the following manner:
The ~Zaxis points towards the Earth’s center, and the ~Yaxis
is normal to the orbit, pointing in the opposite direction to
the angular velocity; the frame is completed with the ~Xaxis
being orthogonal to the other two. Since the orbit of the ISS
is approximately circular, the ~Xaxis points in the direction
of movement of the ISS.
In a fairly good approximation, we can write

where ~riis the position of the ISS at a certain instant tiand
~ri/C01is its position at the instant ti/C01, immediately before ti,
all expressed in the ECEF reference frame.
Hence, the components of the magnetic ﬁeld in the LVLH
reference frame are given by

This procedure added extra sources of error and more process-ing time to run the algorithms, which should be avoided, butcould not be within the rules of the “Astro Pi Challenge.”
V. RESULTS
Although we were not provided with the orientation of the

model, since Bdoes not depend on the magnetometer’s orienta-
tion. This is depicted in Fig. 5.
Albeit agreeing overall in order of magnitude and in the
position of the peaks, our data differed signiﬁcatively from theestimate from the IGRF model. This could not be explained by
variations of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld: Changes on time scales
greater than one year are of origin internal to the Earth and areaccounted for by the IGRF model, whereas seasonal variations

are expected to be of the order of a few tens of nT.14,15The
lithospheric ﬁeld, although of higher magnitude, should not
exceed 20 nT at the ISS altitude.16Additional short-term mag-
netic ﬁeld variations may be due to ionospheric currents or
originate in the magnetosphere. In both cases, they should also
occur on the scale of a few tens of nT,15,16while we observe
deviations reaching 10 lT, almost a thousand times greater!
This discrepancy could, however, come from the presence
of a static magnetic ﬁeld inside the ISS or from an improper
calibration offset, as both effects would shift the measure-
ments by a constant ﬁeld. In order to take this into account,
we assumed the existence of such a ﬁeld ~b0, with compo-
nents ðb0

All calculations described in this article were performed
using Mathematica computing software17and are available
at the repository.18Due to the presence of trigonometric
functions in Eq. (37), the minimization of Sproduces several
local minima. The built-in function NMinimize attempts toﬁnd the global minimum but with no guarantee of success,as it turned out to happen in our case. We, therefore, mini-
mized Susing the function FindMinimum, which ﬁnds local
minima starting from given seed values. The price to pay isthat the program had to run for different seed values of the
angles, a,b, and c, until all the local minima were found.
From these, the absolute minimum was determined.
As a measure of the accuracy with which our model ﬁtted

We obtained DB¼1:9lT for our data (and DB¼3:6lT for

The intensity of the subtracted constant ﬁeld ~b0deter-
mined by the minimization process (38 :8lT for our data and
22:0lT for the data used in Sec. VI) seemed too large either
to be the average ﬁeld inside the ISS or to result from a
wrong calibration offset. It could also result from the magne-
tometer being close to magnetized or electronic equipment.Table I. Multipolar moments obtained from our analysis and the IGRF refer-

We have no way to determine that, but we are satisﬁed that it
must result from one of these possibilities, or from a combi-nation of them, since its subtraction produced a very goodmatch with the values predicted by the IGRF (as shown inFig. 5, where the lower curve is a plot of the absolute value

expected linear variation for 2020–2025,6andtis the time
elapsed between 2020.0 and the instant of the ﬁrst reading ofthe magnetometer. Since we did not have any information onthe precise location of our setup in the ISS, we could notassess the values for a,b, and cthat came out of the
minimization.
The location of the magnetic dip poles was obtained by
the method described in Sec. IIIand is compared with the
IGRF’s values in Table II. Figure 6shows a contour map of
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld intensity, calculated from the val-ues of the multipolar moments that we obtained.All calculated multipolar moments agree with the ones
from the IGRF, both in order of magnitude and in sign. Yet,
they are not accurate. For example, the dipole moment
(l¼1) is 20.8% weaker in magnitude than the expected
value and 3.5
/C14off the right direction. The same lack of accu-
racy is visible in the calculated location of the magnetic
poles (Table II) and in the intensity map in Fig. 6(to be com-
pared with the corresponding one in Ref. 6). Despite these
uncertainties, some major features of the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld, such as the South Atlantic anomaly, are visible.
VI. ANOTHER SET OF ORBITS
Our results could hardly be improved by sampling more
points along the probed orbits, as that would only augmentthe precision for shorter wavelengths, associated with higher
order terms. However, they could beneﬁt from a greater
number of orbits. For that purpose, after the work for the“Astro Pi Challenge” was completed, we repeated our analy-
sis for a set of 15 orbits extracted from data provided by the
Raspberry Pi site.
19This set of ISS orbits provides data that
are more uniformly distributed along the surface of the
Earth, forming a homogeneous grid between latitudes of
52/C14N and 52/C14S (Fig. 7), even though it has a lower number
of measurements per orbit than our data. The selected data
were recorded from February 23, 2016, 10:52:51 GMT to
February 24, 2016, 10:00:11 GMT. It comprised of 8261 read-ings taken with an average interval between them of 10.08 s.
The values of the multipolar moments we obtained are
given in Table III, along with the IGRF’s values for compari-
son. The latter were computed for the instant of the ﬁrst

reading from a linear interpolation between the 2015.0 and
the 2020.0 values in Ref. 6.
In Table IV, the location of the poles calculated from this
set of orbits is compared with the IGRF’s values. The loca-
tion of the poles and the values of the momenta are not the
same as the ones in Tables IandIIdue to the secular varia-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld between the two sets of measure-
ments in 2016 and 2020. In Fig. 8, we show the contour map
of the expected ﬁeld intensity for the values of the multipolar
moments obtained for this set of 15 orbits.
We see that a better spatial sampling of the data provided
great improvement in the determination of the multipolar
moments (the dipole magnitude is only 3.6% shorter of the
IGRF value and its orientation is only 0.6/C14off the IGRF
axis), and the contour map in Fig. 8is much closer to the cor-
responding map in Ref. 6. However, the improvement in the
determination of the location of the poles was more modest,
probably due to the fact that the ﬁelds in the polar regions
were still not sufﬁciently sampled.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
A magnetic ﬁeld is a concept in electromagnetism with
which students have some familiarity, because people are used
to playing with magnets from an early age, and, by seeing the
action of a compass, realize that the Earth itself has magnetic
properties. The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, thus, provides an oppor-
tunity to create a bridge between the more abstract and mathe-
matical contents of electromagnetism courses with the
students’ day-to-day experience. The project reported here pro-
poses such a bridge between Laplace’s equation and its solu-
tions in terms of spherical harmonics (a mathematical tool that
also appears in more advanced disciplines of physics).
It came to us as a surprise that, with data points covering
only a thin ring over the surface of the Earth, and 3 h of mea-
surement with a low-cost magnetometer onboard the ISS,one could reconstruct the main features of the Earth’s mag-
netic ﬁeld: Its magnitude, its angle with respect to theplanet’s rotation axis, its non-uniformity, and even some of
its anomalies. We made use of a Raspberry Pi-powered mag-netometer on board the ISS, but the project could easily beadapted to ground measurements with state-of-the-art gauss-meters, Arduino-powered Hall sensors, or even smartphonemagnetometers, and take advantage of the internet or socialmedia to devise a participatory science experiment.
