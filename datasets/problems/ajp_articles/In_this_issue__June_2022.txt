Gravitoelectromagnetism: Removing action-at-a-distance
in teaching physics
Friedrich Herrmann and Michael Pohlig
90(6), p. 410
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009888Unless one invokes general relativity, gravitation is still
taught mostly in its Newtonian action-at-a-distance formula-tion. Little attention is paid to how the energy exchanges
within a system of moving particles such as a mass being
lifted in Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld actually take place. A the-ory that avoids such issues, gravito-electromagnetism, wasdeveloped by Oliver Heaviside in 1893. Heaviside’s theory
was analogous to Maxwell’s equations and the Poynting ﬂux
theorem, but it was not widely adopted because many of theeffects it describes are small and the later emergence of gen-eral relativity seemed to make such a theory of gravitationunnecessary. This paper describes Heaviside’s theory and
explores its application to some simple examples.
Particularly interesting is the emergence of a gravitational“Lorentz force” analogous to the attractive or repulsiveforces between parallel electrical currents. Appropriate for
teaching upper-level students who are familiar with
Maxwell’s equations.
How energy is conserved in Newtonian gravity
Vytenis M. Vasyli /C22unas
90(6), p. 416
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009889This paper points out that even within the purely classical
theory of gravitation, in which gravitational ﬁelds and poten-
tials change instantaneously throughout space, there are stillmany interesting questions concerning how energy is storedlocally in ﬁelds and conﬁgurations. Making analogies with
electromagnetic ﬁelds, the author presents three different
forms for this energy. Students who are familiar with inter-mediate-level electromagnetism can be shown how to applythe tools and modes of thinking that were developed in elec-
tromagnetism in order to gain new insights into the subtleties
of gravitational energy that they may have overlooked in aninitial presentation of mechanics.
On the linearity of the generalized Lorentz
transformation
Frank Verheest
90(6), p. 425
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0010234Deriving the Lorentz transformations without assuming an
invariant speed of light normally requires a fairly involved
step showing that the transformations are linear with respectto time and space. This paper presents a simple demonstra-
tion of linearity based on velocity transformations.
Measuring the Hannay geometric phase
H. Fanchiotti, C. A. Garc /C19ıa Canal, M. Mayosky, A. Veiga,
and V. Vento
90(6), p. 430
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0081149The Hannay phase is the geometric phase that is familiar to
physicists as the latitude-dependent rotation rate of the plane ofoscillation of a Foucault pendulum. While not all universities
have a Foucault pendulum available for students to observe, they
can all give students the opportunity to learn about the Hannayphase by building a simple circuit, as described in this paper,that is governed by exactly the same differential equation.
Modelling the Earth’s magnetic field
Nuno Barros e S /C19a, Lourenc ¸o Faria, Bernardo Alves, and
Miguel Cymbron
90(6), p. 436
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0074846Why restrict your labworks to the usual laboratories and
benches, when you can use the International Space Station asan extension of your workshop? This paper proposes to do
just that: ask an astronaut to record the magnetic ﬁeld on
board the ISS as it orbits a few times around the Earth, and,from these measurements, retrieve the multipolar expansionof the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. This requires a few tricks,
including a few frame transformations, but the results are
surprisingly precise. The same experiment could be adaptedto ground measurements. It is appropriate for undergraduate
electromagnetism labs or for a student project, and it will
also encourage students to develop their programming skills.
Optical measurements on a budget: A 3D-printed
ellipsometer
Matthew Mantia and Teresa Bixby
90(6), p. 445
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009665Ellipsometry is an optical technique that uses light polariza-
tion to measure the physical properties of dielectric thin ﬁlms.Such ﬁlms are critical for integrated circuitry and optical coat-
ings. Commercial ellipsometers, however, are too expensive to
be included in student laboratories. In this article, the authordescribes a homemade, 3D-printed instrument that can be con-structed inexpensively and is capable of measuring ﬁlm thick-
ness and index of refraction with accuracy comparable to
commercial instrumentation. An EXCEL analysis program toextract ﬁlm thickness and index of refraction from optical mea-surements is included in the supplementary materials, as are
extensive construction details and ﬁles for 3D-printing. If you
are interested in exposing your students to this important tech-nique, this article will give you the tools to get started.

Bringing three-dimensional learning to undergraduate physics:
Insight from an introductory physics laboratory course
Jason M. May, Claudia De Grandi, Jordan M. Gerton,
Lauren Barth-Cohen, Adam Beehler, and Brianna Montoya
90(6), p. 452
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009715The National Research Council deﬁned three dimensions
of science learning—scientiﬁc concepts, experimental practi-
ces, and reasoning tools—as goals for K-12 science instruc-tion. This paper shows how these goals can be extended into
the university teaching laboratory, giving an example of their
implementation in a life sciences laboratory course.
Introducing simple models of social systems
Pablo Jensen
90(6), p. 462
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0086028The author discusses the agent-based Schelling model of
housing segregation originally proposed in the 1960s. Themodel shows that, even if everyone individually favors amixed neighborhood, segregation can occur, nevertheless. Astatistical mechanics derivation of the results, and the prosand cons of using physics motivated models to learn aboutsocial systems, are also discussed.
Voronoi cell analysis: The shapes of particle systems
Emanuel A. Lazar, Jiayin Lu, and Chris H. Rycroft
90(6), p. 469
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087591Given the positions of many particles in space, the
Voronoi cell of each particle is the region of space closer toit than to any other particle. The authors describe how theVoronoi cells are constructed and the many physical applica-tions of this construction.
