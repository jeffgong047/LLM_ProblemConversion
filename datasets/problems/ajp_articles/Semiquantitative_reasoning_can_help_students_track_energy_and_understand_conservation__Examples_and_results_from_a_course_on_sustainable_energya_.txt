The ability to track ﬂows of energy in complex and dissipative contexts is essential to understand
many aspects of sustainable energy and climate change. Traditional physics instruction largely fails
to develop that ability. This work argues that one plausible contributor to this deﬁciency could bean overemphasis on cases that lend themselves to quantitative calculation. Drawing on examples
and data from a small sample of college physics students in a class on sustainable energy, it
proposes that practice in semiquantitative energy tracking, using suitable visual and/or manipulablerepresentations, can help develop students’ skills in using energy reasoning in real-world,
dissipative contexts.

I. INTRODUCTION
Issues of sustainable energy and climate change are inex-
tricably linked to the tracking of energy ﬂows. We’ll want to
understand how climate change happens; why electric cars
are not generally “zero-emissions vehicles” but do use lessenergy per mile than conventional ones; and what changeswill most reduce the energy needed to heat a building. Forall these examples, the starting point is tracing the ﬂow ofenergy through the system. Energy tracking is, of course,
only one aspect of education in sustainability, but it is a vital
one, especially for physics students.
Numerous studies have shown that many high-school and
college students who have experienced conventional physicsinstruction have little understanding of energy conservationand little ability to use it to reason about real-world situa-tions.
1–5In this work, I argue that one plausible contributor
to the ineffectiveness of conventional instruction about
energy is an overemphasis on situations that are amenable toquantitative calculations. I present data and examples from asmall sample of college physics students in a class on thephysics of sustainable energy in which explicit attention was
paid to the semiquantitative tracking of energy ﬂows in real-
world, dissipative contexts. We use a representationalapproach, energy cubes,
6,7previously used primarily with
K–12 students and teachers. In agreement with the studiescited above, many of the students—all of whom had experi-enced conventional college physics instruction—initially
demonstrated misunderstanding of the principle of energy
conservation and little facility in using energy reasoning inreal-world contexts. By the end of the class, the group exhib-ited signiﬁcant gains in their ability to interpret and explainenergy ﬂow in relevant real-world scenarios.
Fundamentally, reasoning about energy is a game of
accounting, governed by the principle of conservation of
energy.
8As Driver and Warrington observed, “It is only
when energy is quantiﬁed, making energy conservation ameaningful notion, that the idea is useful to students as ananalytical tool. This suggests that ways of introducing andreinforcing energy as a quantity need to be considered in
basic science courses”
1(emphasis added). Traditional intro-
ductory physics instruction, however, has perhaps taken thisadvice too far. When energy ideas are taught, we often focuson systems in which the total amount of energy, however
manifested, remains constant. In simple, idealized cases—africtionless pendulum, a mass on a spring, projectile motion,ice melting in an insulated container of water—we can do thequantitative calculations in detail, and so these tend to be thecases emphasized in coursework. Many widely used textbooksdevote far more pages and include far more problems thatfocus on conservation of mechanical energy than on thebroader—and much more fundamental and important—principleof conservation of energy in general. Cases in which the non-conservative work can be calculated from simple models, suchas kinetic friction, are sometimes included, but the analysisoften stops with calculation of the work done by friction withlittle or no attention to where the corresponding energy goes.
9
Frequently, the question of “where does the energy go when
it’s ‘gone’” is given only passing attention, although this ques-
t i o ni sp e r p l e x i n gt ob o t hc h i l d r e na n da d u l t s .2,7,10–12A clear
resolution is particularly important for reconciling the scientiﬁcidea of energy—as an inherently conserved quantity—withthe model of energy as a consumable resource that prevails indealing with energy “consumption” and “production” in thecontext of sustainability.
In almost all scenarios that are relevant to issues of sus-
tainable energy (such as those mentioned in the ﬁrst para-graph) and indeed in most real-world scenarios where energyreasoning is helpful, the system of interest (a car, for exam-ple, or a building in winter) exchanges energy with the out-side world. In such cases, the conservation principle is morecomplicated: the rate of change in the system’s total energymust be equal to the net rate at which energy ﬂows into thesystem. Dissipation into the environment is a crucial part ofthe energy story, and often we can’t really do the accounting:When a car brakes to a stop, we may know, in principle, thatthe initial kinetic energy must ultimately be converted into
thermal energy, but how much goes into the tires, the road
surface, the brakes, the suspension, the air? Unless you’redesigning one of those things, does it matter?
If we want our students to be able to track energy ﬂows in
real-world contexts, it seems clear that we should providethem with appropriate representational tools and practice inusing them—as, for example, we teach students about free-body diagrams and give them extensive opportunity to usethem.
13This approach to energy tracking has been shown to

be highly effective in work with K–12 students and teach-
ers.12–16The present work extends the strategy to the college
level, describing and discussing examples of how it can be
used, presenting selected samples of student work, and provid-ing some preliminary evidence suggesting its effectiveness.
II. CLASS ACTIVITIES IN SEMIQUANTITATIVE
ENERGY TRACKING
The subjects were 16 college students enrolled in two itera-
tions (5 in one, 11 in the other) of Energy in Science and
Society , a semester-long course at Tufts University, a highly
selective private research university. The course is designed
for science and engineering students and examines the natureof energy as a concept in physics, as well as issues relating to
sustainable energy technology for a modern society. Students
worked extensively in assigned groups named after female sci-entists engaged in research, policy, or advocacy related to sus-
tainable energy.
17The students in the sample had all
completed at least one introductory college physics course, and
most had taken more advanced courses in physics.
The course included a series of in-class activities, hands-
on experiments, and homework problems that emphasizetracking the ﬂow of energy semiquantitatively without the
use of formal calculations.
Diagrams shown in lecture, for example, qualitatively
traced the energy ﬂow in the operation of conventional,hybrid, and electric cars. One point of emphasis was that, in
hybrid and electric cars, the electricity to charge the battery
comes from somewhere, and, in our current system of elec-trical generation, much of it comes from fossil fuels.
Another was that in every case, all of the energy eventually
winds up as thermal energy in the environment.
Working in groups, the students frequently analyzed sce-
narios using Energy Cubes , a dynamic, tactile representa-
tional scheme developed by Seeley and coworkers
6,7and
previously used primarily in elementary school and teachereducation settings7,12,14(see Fig. 1). Units of energy are rep-
resented by small cubes similar to dice. The amount ofenergy represented by each cube is arbitrary and context-
dependent and is never speciﬁed quantitatively. All that mat-ters to the representation is that the amount of energy repre-sented by a cube doesn’t change as the scenario progresses,and each cube represents the same amount of energy, so thatthe number of cubes acts as a proxy for the amount ofenergy. Sides of the cubes are marked with symbols or colorsto represent different energy forms or manifestations such asmotion, elastic, chemical, thermal, or electrical. Circlesdrawn on a piece of paper or a whiteboard represent differentobjects. As they proceed through the scenario, groups of stu-dents negotiate which objects to represent and how to trackthe ﬂow of energy in the system by moving cubes from onecircle to another to represent energy transfer between com-ponents of the system and ﬂipping the cubes to show differ-ent labels on the top face to represent energy transformation.
The representation is semiquantitative, because the number
of cubes in any object with a given side showing correspondsto an amount of energy of a given form associated with thatobject. Since the total number of cubes is ﬁxed, the principleof conservation is implicitly built into the representation.
In previous implementations with K–12 students and
teachers, energy cubes allowed learners with limited mathe-matical knowledge to track the ﬂow of energy in a process,accounting for gains and losses, without the need for alge-braic equations or numerical computation. The present workextends the approach into the college physics setting. Thesestudents possess much more advanced mathematical skillsand are accustomed to using them. However, when we limitour examples to ones that exercise those skills, we excludethe messy, real-world situations—cars, air conditioners, andpeople—that are relevant to issues of sustainable energy.Semiquantitative representations, such as energy cubes,energy tracking diagrams,
7,13and others,13,15,16,18open the
door to a conceptual understanding of how the physics ofenergy can be applied in these important contexts. Eachoffers its own set of advantages and limitations.
13A particu-
lar advantage of energy cubes is that energy accounting isbuilt in—while numerical values of Joules or kilowatt-hoursare not used, relative amounts of energy, and the overall con-servation of energy, are visibly represented through the num-ber of cubes. It thus meets the challenge of Driver andWarrington
1to introduce and reinforce energy as a quantity,
yet without limiting its application to cases in which numeri-cal values can be computed.
In-class activities involving energy cubes included track-
ing the ﬂow of energy in the operation of an air conditionerand a heat pump. Figure 1shows a group of students
engaged in this activity. Later, in an in-class experiment,
each group was given an insulated box equipped with a digi-
tal temperature sensor and a battery-powered device—a lightbulb, a fan, a cellphone, or a thermoelectric cooler (a solidstate device that uses an electrical current to draw heat fromone side of the device and exhaust it on the other)—andasked to predict and then measure what would happen to thetemperature in the box when the device was operated insideit. Each group then used energy cubes to represent the ﬂowof energy and shared their results with the class. The mostsurprising case for the students was the thermoelectriccooler. Most students predicted that the temperature in thebox would go down, and they were surprised to see itincrease, but the energy cube representation made it clearthat, just as in the case of the other devices, the energy drawnfrom the battery, as well as the heat being transferred, must

which objects to represent; they have not yet begun using the cubes to trace

COVID-19 requirements.

necessarily remain inside the box, ultimately raising the air
temperature.
Homework problems also provided opportunities to prac-
tice semiquantitative energy tracking. One question, forexample, dealt with air conditioners and heat pumps. We haddiscussed the energy efﬁciency ratio (EER) of an air condi-tioner—the ratio of heat energy removed from the room toelectrical energy used—and found that for a typical windowunit the EER (in dimensionless units—in the U.S., EERs areusually given in BTU/watt-h) was about three. That is, forevery unit of electrical energy used, three units of thermalenergy are transferred from the room to the outside. On thehomework, students were asked to make a diagram (whichcould be, but wasn’t required to be, based on energy cubes),showing a packet of thermal energy being removed from theroom, as a smaller packet of electrical energy is used by the
air conditioner unit. As a model for a heat pump, they were
then asked to draw a similar diagram for the same air condi-tioner unit installed backwards with the cooling side outsidethe room.
Figure 2shows the diagrams submitted by two students.
Student 1 (top) used arrows to show the ﬂow of energy intothe unit. Student 2 used diagrams based on the energy cubesrepresentation before and after the “packet” of thermalenergy is moved. Both representations clearly show threeunits of thermal energy and one of electrical energy cominginto the system and four units of thermal energy beingexhausted. (Student 1 shows this both with the number ofarrows and with written notations; student 2 by the numberof squares.) In their written answers, both students were ableto realize that the coefﬁcient of performance (COP) of theheat pump—the ratio of heat delivered to the interior to elec-trical energy used by the pump—would be equal to the EERof the air conditioner, plus one. They recognized that theydid not need to know the internal mechanisms of the air con-ditioner (see Ref. 13for an analysis of similar diagrams
drawn by K–12 teachers).
A more complex problem asked the students to make dia-
grams tracing the ﬂow of energy when a person (Doug) ridesa bicycle to work—from the time he starts pedaling until hegets to work and stops. Figure 3shows two students’
responses. Student 1 has drawn something akin to an energyﬂow diagram
15using arrows to illustrate the transformations
of energy. It shows awareness that the overall processinvolves a transformation of chemical energy into thermalenergy. This student is focusing primarily on the multipleprocesses involved in that transformation, perhaps workingto clarify in their own mind howit happens that the energy is
ultimately transformed into thermal energy—an aspect of the
process that is not readily conveyed in an energy cubes dia-
gram.
13Kinetic energy is not shown in the diagram, although
motion is mentioned in the written explanation. It appearsthat the arrows, and progression from left to right, representthe ﬂow of energy when the bicycle is moving at steadyspeed (“to support the continued motion of the bike”). It isnot clear what the rectangular boxes represent, or whetherthe widths of the various arrows are intended to representamounts of energy—this difﬁculty in representing quantitycan be a limitation of this type of diagram.
13Student 2 pro-
vided two diagrams. The ﬁrst focuses on the forms of energypresent at different stages of the process. The circles appar-ently represent forms of energy, and it seems likely that thesizes of the circles correspond to amounts of energy. The stu-dent clearly represents a conversion from chemical energy,through kinetic, ultimately entirely into thermal energy. The
second diagram is based on energy cubes and, thus, locatesthe energy in various objects (represented by the large
circles) as well as identifying its forms, indicated by the col-
ors and symbols of the small circles, which presumably rep-resent units of energy. Interestingly, in this representation,the number of energy units ﬁrst increases and then decreases
as we move from left to right, suggesting that this student
was, at least, not attending to energy conservation in drawingthe representation. An advantage of this representation isthat this failure of conservation can be readily detected and
could lead to a discussion with the individual student or with
the class—perhaps by working with physical cubes, wherethe unexplained appearance and disappearance of cubeswould be immediately apparent.
These examples illustrate students using qualitative or
semiquantitative energy tracking representations to work
through their understanding of energy ﬂow in real-worldcontexts. Without either the constraints or the support ofequations, they are wrestling with key issues of energy
reasoning: Where does the energy come from, and where
does it go? How is it that the energy is “used up” if it’sstill there? What are the processes by which energy, inits manifold forms, winds up as thermal energy in the
environment?
While this paper emphasizes the kind of qualitative or
semiquantitative energy tracking shown in these examples,another major theme of the class is that we can’t talk sensi-bly about sustainable energy without making quantitative
comparisons of how much energy is used, or saved, by dif-
ferent activities. (To be sure, there are many other questionsto ask, including who bears the costs or reaps the beneﬁtsof those activities.) The class, therefore, also devotes agreat deal of attention to quantitative, if rough, estimates
about energy. For the biking homework problem above, for
example, students also estimated how much energy, onaverage, Doug would save per day by biking to work(instead of driving) 70% of the time (quite a bit), how much
of that savings would be offset by the energy required to
produce the extra food he’d need to eat (not much)—andhow those numbers compare to the overall energy con-sumption of a typical American (a modest but not insigniﬁ-
cant fraction).
III. ASSESSMENT AND RESULTS
This section presents both quantitative and qualitative
results from students’ responses to three questions on
ungraded pre- and post-instruction surveys. Only students
(N¼16) who completed both assessments are included in
the sample. As all of the students had taken both high schooland college physics courses prior to the start of this course,
the pretest results can be viewed as representing the outcome
of “business-as-usual” physics instruction for these students.
Since these data represent the responses of a small number
of students to just a few questions, in just two instances ofthe same course at a single institution, with a single instruc-
tor, they are presented as illustrative and suggestive, rather
than as generalizable evidence of efﬁcacy, let alone as evi-dence of causality related to any speciﬁc aspect of instruc-tion. There was no comparison, for example, between the
energy cubes representation and others, or between classes
with and without the in-class representational activities.Nevertheless, the results suggest that something changed in
748 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 9, September 2023 R. G. Tobin 748 04 October 2023 22:57:14
the students’ abilities to reason about energy in real-world
contexts, abilities that had not been sufﬁciently developed bytheir prior physics courses.
Question 1 probes students’ abstract knowledge of the
principle of conservation of energy, independent of context:
Q1: Choose what you think is the best answer: Energy is
conserved:
•When there is no friction
•When there are no external forces
•When there are no non-conservative forces
•When there is no net non-conservative work
•When waste is avoided
•Always, under all circumstances
Prior to the course, just under half of the students (44%)
chose one of the other answers. (Again, all had completed atleast one semester of introductory college physics and inmost cases substantially more.) The incorrect responses were
roughly equally divided between “no non-conservativeforces” and “no net non-conservative work,” answers thatecho conditions for conservation of mechanical energy. This
result reinforces the suggestion that conventional instruction,with its strong focus on mechanical energy and its conserva-tion, overwhelms or subsumes, for many students, the muchmore important principle of energy conservation in general.
By the end of the class, 81% of students answered the
question correctly, a substantial improvement—thoughnearly a ﬁfth of the group was still not expressing clarityabout the principle.
Questions 2 and 3 ask the students to apply energy reason-
ing to contexts that, while still somewhat contrived, relate topossible real-world scenarios.
Q2: It’s a hot summer day in Boston. Jamal and Aisha don’t
have an air conditioner in their summer sublet, but they dohave an extra mini-refrigerator that they’re not using.

Before they leave the apartment for the day, they close the
windows and curtains, plug in and turn on the refrigerator,and prop the door open, so the apartment will be cool when
they get home. Compared to what it would have been if
they hadn’t turned on the refrigerator, do you think the tem-perature in the apartment will be:
•Higher (hotter)
•Lower (cooler)
•The same
Why do you think so?
Q3: Hector and Enrique don’t have an extra refrigerator,
but they do have several fans sitting around on the ﬂoor andtables. On the same hot Boston day, before leaving for
work, they close the windows and curtains and plug in and
turn on all the fans. Compared to what it would have been ifthey hadn’t turned on the fans, do you think the temperaturein the apartment will be:
•Higher (hotter)
•Lower (cooler)
•The same
Why do you think so?Figure 4shows the students’ pre- and post-instruction
answers to both questions. Before taking the class, only a
minority of students (correctly) answered “hotter” for either
question, and a few students selected “cooler” in each case.After instruction, a large majority answered “hotter” in bothcases, and no one selected “cooler.”
Beyond the quantitative answers, the nature of their open-
ended explanations also showed an increased use of energy
reasoning at the end of the class. Prior to instruction, none ofthe students explicitly referenced the electricity being usedby the refrigerator or fans as a net energy input to the system
that would necessarily result in a temperature increase.
Several mentioned friction, or general “inefﬁciency.” Post-instruction, however, roughly half the students gave a clear
energy argument involving the electrical energy, such as
“the only energy entering the system is in the form of electri-cal energy through the outlet and into the fridge … all theelectrical energy ends up as thermal energy in the room, so
the room gets hotter.”
As noted above, the students had actually carried out
experiments that are closely related—indeed, from the per-spective of a physicist, nearly identical—to these questions,
Fig. 3. Two students’ diagrams showing their analysis of energy ﬂow when a person bicycles to work, from a homework assignment. The students’ handwrit ten
notations have been transcribed for legibility.

measuring the temperature change in insulated boxes when a
fan and a thermoelectric cooler were operated inside them.
Whether the parallels were apparent to the students, how-
ever, is less clear. A foam box is not an apartment, a thermo-electric cooler bears scant obvious resemblance to arefrigerator, and nothing in the question drew explicit atten-tion to their in-class experiences. Only one student, in fact,referenced that experience in their explanation: “The minicooler we used with the Styrofoam box wound up producingmore heat than it removed due to its electrical consumption.
A refrigerator would behave similarly.” Whether the other
students didn’t make a conscious connection between theclassroom experiment and the real-world scenario, or simplychose to make a more general argument, cannot be deter-mined. It’s possible that the parallel to their experiment withthe fan was more obvious, and that may help account for thevery high percentage of correct answers to Q3 on the post-
test. None of the students, however, referenced the experi-
ment in their explanations.
The refrigerator scenario in Q2 is also closely related to
the homework problem and in-class activities described ear-lier, in which energy ﬂow in an air conditioner was analyzed.However, there are also differences—a refrigerator is not anair conditioner, and we didn’t discuss what would happen ifthe air conditioner were entirely inside the building. In theirsurvey answers, only a few referenced that connection. One
explicitly stated that “the refrigerator acts as an air con-
ditioner.” Another contrasted the fridge with an air condi-tioner “which vents the thermal energy outside the house.” Athird further generalized, describing the refrigerator as
“essentially a heat pump.” Recognizing these similarities is,
arguably, in itself evidence of rather sophisticated energy
understanding. A fourth, however, while correctly answeringthat the room would get hotter, explained “unlike the air con-
ditioner, which moves heat, the refrigerator’s process to cool
is a very inefﬁcient process which has a net output of heatinstead of a net output of ‘coolness.’ ”
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The work described here, while limited in both size and
scope, has possible implications for physics instructors
teaching energy—especially, but not exclusively, if the goal
is that our students should be able to apply their understand-ing of energy as a scientiﬁc idea to the topic of energy as a
societal resource. First, the limited data presented here rein-
force the conclusion of much larger surveys
4that physics
instruction as currently practiced is strikingly ineffective in
developing an understanding of the principle of conservation
of energy, let alone the capacity to use that principle to trackenergy in real-world, dissipative contexts.
First, since students are unlikely to develop facility in
using ideas and skills that they are rarely asked to practice, it
seems plausible that a contributor to the demonstrated inef-fectiveness of conventional physics instruction could be its
heavy focus on mechanical energy, and particularly on cases
that are amenable to straightforward calculation. The factthat the students who answered Q1 incorrectly selected
answers relevant to mechanical energy conservation provides
some support for this speculation.
Second, engaging students in the semiquantitative tracking
of energy in real-world, dissipative scenarios—early, often,
and in multiple contexts—may offer a way to promote a
more holistic understanding of the principle of conservationof energy, while maintaining the key accounting principle
that the energy books must balance at all times. This work
extends that approach from previous interventions withK–12 students and teachers to relatively advanced collegephysics students and suggests that such representations can
bring beneﬁts even to learners who have sophisticated math-
ematical skills.
Finally, representational tools, such as energy cubes, that
focus attention on energy as a quantity, can be helpful in
developing and supporting this kind of semiquantitative
energy tracking. Different representations offer different lim-itations and advantages,
13and there is neither evidence nor
an argument here that energy cubes are in all ways superior.
I do suggest, however, that, for developing an understandingof energy conservation, it is likely to be helpful to include
visual and/or manipulable representations that allow the total
quantity of energy to be accounted for at all stages in the sce-nario under study.
