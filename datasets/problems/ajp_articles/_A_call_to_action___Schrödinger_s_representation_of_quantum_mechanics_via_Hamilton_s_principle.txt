A few years ago, one of the former Editors of this journal launched “a call to action” (E. F. Taylor,
Am. J. Phys. 71, 423–425 (2003)) for a revision of teaching methods in physics in order to emphasize
the importance of the principle of least action. In response, we suggest the use of Hamilton’sprinciple of stationary action to introduce the Schr €odinger equation. When considering the geometric
interpretation of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, the real part of the action Sdeﬁnes the phase of the
wave function exp iS=/C22hðÞ , and requiring the Hamilton–Jacobi wave function to obey wave-front
propagation (i.e., Re ðSÞis a constant of the motion) yields the Schr €odinger equation.

I. INTRODUCTION
The wave mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics
relies on the Schr €odinger equation and the concept of the
wave function.1The Schr €odinger equation is ordinarily intro-
duced without providing much detail on its conceptual foun-
dations, which leads to some dissatisfaction.2Even
Schr €odinger’s original conjecture was heuristic.3Its weak-
ness was underlined by Feynman: “some of the arguments he
used were even false, but that does not matter; the onlyimportant thing is that the ultimate equation gives a correct
description of nature.”4In response, Feynman provided his
own derivation of the Schr €odinger equation that led him to
the path integral formulation of a quantum ﬁeld theory.5,6
Responding to the same stimulus and with the aim of a sound
derivation, others have come up with various proposals over
the last 50 years.2,7–23The approach presented here aims to
be both simple and rigorous; it is based on Hamilton’s princi-
ple of stationary action, where students encounter during
their studies of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.24
This formulation is conceptually similar to Schr €odinger’s
original proposal based on real-valued Hamilton’s functions3
and answers to “a call to action” by one of the formerEditors of this journal emphasizing the action’s paramountimportance in modern physics.
25To better contextualize our
purpose before going into the details, let us make some prelim-
inary remarks on typical approaches to develop Schr €odinger’s
picture of quantum mechanics.
II. APPROCHES TO DERIVE THE SCHR €ODINGER
EQUATION
For context, here we review some familiar approaches to
introduce the Schr €odinger equation that are found in popular
textbooks. The simplest claims that the Schr €odinger equation
is so well known that its derivation can be neglected in favor
of its solutions to fundamental problems.26,27The equation is
simply assumed as a fact or presented as a fundamental pos-
tulate.26,28Such approaches miss an opportunity to provide
insight into the physical meaning of the equation. Other
common presentations draw their inspiration from plausibil-
ity arguments29–32or from linear algebra concepts. These
methods have almost nothing in common with the original
idea developed by Schr €odinger. Within this group, thesuggestion to derive the Schr €odinger equation from the time-
evolution operator is worth mentioning for its close relation-
ship with the Heisenberg representation.33,34Despite their
pedagogical usefulness, such proposals have limitations(e.g., the restriction to a free particle, the assumption of a
constant potential, and the introduction of the composition
property for the time-evolution operator) and, therefore, do
not derive the Schr €odinger equation in the most general
context.
A considerable number of authors have tried to develop an
exact formulation from ﬁrst principles.2,7–23Among these
attempts, the use of the Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) theory24of
classical mechanics has attracted attention because of the
guidance it provided in the discovery of his equation.
However, the HJ theory requires the suppression of trouble-
some nonlinearities (see, for instance, the lengthy procedure
in Ref. 2). On the other hand, the HJ approach is advanta-
geous, because it references the most important concept in
advanced mechanics: the action.24Within the HJ theory,
Hamilton’s principal function Sis equivalent to the action,
and hereafter, the two terms are used as synonyms.
However, a distinction has to be made between the classicalaction S
cland its quantum-mechanical counterpart Sqm.
The former is relevant only in the classical limit /C22h!0.29–35
In order to properly describe quantum phenomena, one needs
the more general action Sqm, which must, therefore, be a
complex-valued function.36This function has the structure
of a wave ﬁeld whose domain includes the nonclassical
regions of space where Im SqmðÞ 6¼0. For instance, if we con-
sider Dirac’s suggestion of a wave function of the type
exp iSqm=/C22h/C0/C1(see Eq. (52) at page 127 of Dirac’s textbook34)
also considered in Bransden and Joachim (see Eqs. (5.398) at
page 258 of Ref. 32), agreement between the Schr €odinger
equation and the HJ equation requires /C22h!0 (see Appendix
A). Remarkably, the situation changes if we introduce the
concept of wave-front propagation of exp iSqm=/C22h/C0/C1in the
conﬁguration space. The constraint of wave-front propaga-
tion of exp iSqm=/C22h/C0/C1entails a new constant of the motion,
i.e., Re SqmðÞ , whereas Im SqmðÞ is unconstrained. (Note that
in Dirac’s suggestion the entire function Sqmis subject to a
stationary condition.) We will prove that, independent of the
actual value of /C22h, the classical action is needed to derive the
Schr €odinger equation. To help the reader gain familiarity

with the concept of wave-front propagation in relation to the
HJ theory, we highlight the reference by Talman35and also
provide a summary of the HJ theory in Sec. III.
III. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE HAMILTON–JACOBI
THEORY
Before discussing how to get from the classical formalism
to the Schr €odinger picture, we summarize the basics of the
HJ theory. Our notation follows that of Goldstein.24
The HJ formulation of classical mechanics has the objec-
tive of ﬁnding the solution Sto the equation

of motion are simple to solve. In other words, Sis the generat-
ing function of the canonical transformation qi¼qiQ;P;t ðÞ and
pi¼piQ;P;t ðÞ such that the mechanical problem based on the
original Hamilton’s equations of motion

reduces to a simpler problem for an analogous set of equa-
tions of motion. The simplest set occurs for a constant trans-
formed Hamiltonian Ksuch that
_Qi¼@K

>>><
>>>:(3)
Equations (3)imply that QiandPiare independent of time, and
the problem becomes extremely easy to solve. It is possible to
prove that the relationship between the old and newHamiltonians is K¼Hþ@S=@tand, for the usual choice of
K¼0, the outcome is the HJ equation Eq. (1)where the substi-
tution of the components of the canonical momentum p
i
¼@S=@qihas been made.24The derivatives of Swith respect
to new canonical momenta give Qi¼@S=@Pi, and the inver-
sion of this relationship for each index icompletes the canoni-
cal transformation q¼qQ;P;t ðÞ andp¼pQ;P;t ðÞ .
The beauty of the HJ approach appears in the reduction of
mechanical (and vectorial) problems with many unknowns
to a differential equation whose scalar solution Scontains all
information about the evolution of the mechanical systemunder examination. However, this elegance is of limitedadvantage, because only a small set of problems can besolved exactly in the HJ context (the harmonic oscillator,Keplerian orbits, and a few more). On the other hand, a fun-
damental property of the action has a more general applica-
tion: the total time derivative of Sis the LagrangianL¼T/C0V(with Tbeing the kinetic energy and Vbeing the
potential energy),
24
dS
dt¼L; (4)
and therefore, a constant action (i.e., Hamilton’s principle)
means that the most probable trajectories should keep thetime integral of the Lagrangian from varying between theinitial and ﬁnal time of the trajectory. The stationary value of
Swas also adopted by Feynman in his path integral
method—a perfect example of an approach, which mixesboth classical and quantum ingredients.
Hamilton’s principle can be regarded as the guiding star of
physics and plays a central role in classical mechanics
24as
well as the two pillars of contemporary theoretical physics:general relativity (see the Einstein–Hilbert action37,38) and
quantum ﬁeld theory.39,40The HJ theory was employed in
the early days of quantum mechanics to tackle the puzzlingphysics of photons and atoms, which led to, as an example,the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule.
The foundation of wave mechanics through the HJ equa-
tion in Eq. (1)begins with Schr €odinger’s original sugges-
tion
3to introduce the wave function Wthrough the
momentum p¼/C0i/C22hrW=W. (Note that, in contrast to
Schr €odinger’s use of Eq. (1), the imaginary unit ihas been
made explicit.) Given that the momentum is proportional tothe spatial derivative of S, Schr €odinger intuited that the vari-
ational method based on Hamilton’s principle should bereﬂected in the stationary value of the spatial integration ofjWj
2(see the ﬁrst paper of Ref. 3). However, Schr €odinger
originally made a mistake by attaching physical meaningonly to the real part of W. The mistake was later corrected in
other communications, and an interesting account of this epi-sode is available in this journal.
41If we include both classi-
cal and nonclassical regions of S(i.e., spatial regions where
Sis purely real or has imaginary contributions), the action is
a complex-valued function, and as argued in Sec. IV,i t
determines Was a propagating wave. Based on this, we
show that one can introduce the Schrodinger equation to stu-dents without departing from the discoverer’s initial proposalto use the action as a fundamental tool. This is then consis-tent with other well-known approaches (see Appendix B
where the Wentzel–Kramers– Brillouin approximation andFeynman’s path integral formulation are discussed).
IV. GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION
OF THE HAMILTON–JACOBI THEORY
AND THE SCHR €ODINGER EQUATION
We begin with the introduction of the HJ wave function
W
HJ¼exp iS=/C22hðÞ that evolves in conﬁguration space. It was
mentioned before that this choice was examined by Diracbut without considering the consequences of a constant valueof Re SðÞ. More recently, the use of W
HJhas been popularized
in the so-called quantum HJ theory suggested by Leacockand Padgett,42,43which focuses on quantum energy levels.
The introduction of the HJ wave function has several conse-
quences. First of all, due to WHJ’s wave nature, it propagates
through spatial regions, where Sis a complex-valued function.
S, therefore, differs from a purely classical action. It is well
known that the opening of non-classical regions of space allowsthe HJ theory to describe matter waves.44,45However, we do
not specify the nature of Sexcept that we maintain p¼rS.

Note additionally that the action unit, /C22h,i nWHJis without
numerical speciﬁcation and, indeed, the actual value of /C22hdoes
not affect the derivation of the Schr €odinger equation. For a
Hamiltonian, which does not depend explicitly on time, we
introduce the Hamilton’s characteristic function W¼SþEt,
w h i c hi sw e l lk n o w nt od e p e n do ns p a t i a lv a r i a b l e sa n ds a t i s ﬁ e sthe reduced HJ equation (i.e., Hq;@W=@q ðÞ ¼E).24Since S
is complex, the following relationships are valid: Re WðÞ
¼ReSðÞþEtand Im WðÞ¼ImSðÞ. After the substitution of
S¼W/C0EtintoWHJ, the wave function can be factorized
according to
WHJ¼wHJexp /C0iEt
/C22h/C18/C19
; (5)
withwHJ¼exp iW=/C22hðÞ . Finally, another consequence of
Dirac’s suggestion to use WHJis the appearance of an imagi-
nary part of p¼rS. The real part of pis expected to be
equivalent to the classical momentum, whereas the possiblynon-zero imaginary part of pis expected to play a fundamen-
tal role in the quantum-classical transition. An example of
how this works for the harmonic oscillator will be given in
Sec. V.
Within the geometric picture of the HJ theory, the wave
front must satisfy the classical wave equation

where vphis the phase velocity. This equation encodes the
laws of motion of the mechanical system in the motion ofthe wave W
HJwith velocity vphcalculated at q. Since the real
part of Sdetermines the phase of WHJ, the surface of constant
phase (whose points satisfy Hamilton’s principle of station-ary action) can be found using the differential
d½ReSðÞ/C138¼r ReSðÞ/C1dq/C0Edt¼0; (7)
where, for time-independent Hamiltonians, E¼/C0@S=@thas
been used. Recalling that the canonical momentum is
p¼rS, Eq. (7)becomes the condition E¼RepðÞ/C1v
ph.I n
the following, we suppose that Re pðÞandvphare parallel.
This is very often the case for purely mechanical systems.(However, it is not the case for systems subjected to mag-
netic forces, because the generalized momentum results
from the two contributions of the mechanical momentumand the magnetic vector potential.) Thus, the time derivativein Eq. (6)can be calculated explicitly thanks to Eq. (5)and,
with the result E¼RepðÞ/C1v
ph, the wave equation becomes
r2wHJþRepðÞ2
/C22h2wHJ¼0: (8)
After the substitution of Re pðÞ2¼2mE/C0V ðÞ that deﬁnes
RepðÞ as the classical momentum, we get the time-
independent Schr €odinger equation
/C0/C22h2
2mr2wHJþVwHJ¼EwHJ: (9)
The time-dependent Schr €odinger equation is just the out-
come of the relationship between wHJand the time derivative
ofWHJcalculated by means of Eq. (5),@
@tWHJ¼/C0iE
/C22hwHJexp/C0iEt=/C22h ðÞ ; (10)
which, incorporated in Eq. (9), gives
/C0/C22h2
2mr2WHJþVWHJ¼i/C22h@
@tWHJ: (11)
Equation (11) demonstrates our thesis and shows the impor-
tance of Hamilton’s principle of stationary action in nonrela-tivistic quantum mechanics. Ultimately, these ﬁndings can
be easily understood by students aware of Hamilton’s princi-
ple and its geometric perspective suggested here. As an illus-trative example, the transition from the classical waveequation to the Schr €odinger equation is demonstrated for the
harmonic oscillator in Sec. V.
One question is yet unanswered. If Re pðÞis the classical
momentum, how do we interpret Im pðÞand its generating
function Im SðÞ¼ImWðÞ? To this end, let us deﬁne /
¼exp iReWðÞ=/C22h/C0/C1
and the amplitude of the wave function
A¼exp/C0ImWðÞ=/C22h/C0/C1
. This choice allows the factorization
ofw
HJin terms of /and A,o rwHJ¼A/. Then, the
Laplacian of wHJis
r2wHJ¼/r2Aþ2rA/C1r/þi
/C22hr2ReWðÞwHJ
/C01
/C22h2rReWðÞ ½/C1382wHJ; (12)
and its use in Eq. (8)yields
/r2Aþ2rA/C1r/þi
/C22hr2ReWðÞwHJ
/C01
/C22h2rReWðÞ ½/C1382wHJþRepðÞ2
/C22h2wHJ¼0: (13)
However, Re pðÞ¼rReWðÞ, and the last two terms of Eq.
(13) cancel each other out. In the end, we get
/r2Aþ2rA/C1r/þi
/C22hA/r2ReWðÞ¼0: (14)
Equation (14) is a differential equation that establishes a
relationship between Re WðÞ and Im WðÞ. In other words,
they are not independent from each other as in the case of ageneric complex-valued function. The search for Im WðÞ and
the calculation of corresponding wave function amplitude isillustrated for the fundamental example of the harmonicoscillator in Sec. V.
V. APPLICATION TO THE HARMONIC
OSCILLATOR
The nonclassical characteristic of the wave function W
HJ
introduced in Sec. IVdepends on the imaginary part of
Hamilton’s functions WandS(ImSðÞ¼ImWðÞ), which dic-
tate the amplitude of wHJ(i.e., the spatial component of
WHJ). On the other hand, Re SðÞregulates the phase of the
wave function which, for the propagating wave front, is sub-ject to the condition given in Eq. (7). In brief, Eqs. (7)and
(14) are two coupled differential equations for the real and
imaginary parts of W. Additionally, we disregard questions
related to the phase. Instead, we dig deep into how the non-classical characteristic of the complex-valued Hamilton’s
112 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 Michele Marrocco 112 04 October 2023 22:49:24
functions can be elucidated in the case of the harmonic oscil-
lator. To this end, we show how Hamilton’s characteristicfunction of the motionless oscillator (which is purely imagi-nary) determines the shape of the wave function for the oscil-lator set in motion.
We begin with a motionless oscillator. No motion implies
zero classical energy, or E
cl
0¼0 and the corresponding char-
acteristic function W0satisﬁes the reduced HJ equation
1
2md
dxW0/C18/C192

2mx2x2¼0; (15)
where xis the oscillator’s displacement from equilibrium.
Equation (15) is just a consequence of the general substitu-
tions E¼/C0@S=@tand @S=@x¼dW=dxin Eq. (1). (Note
that the total derivative of Wis justiﬁed for the current one-
dimensional problem, where Wis a function of xonly.)24
The solution to Eq. (15) is
W0¼6i1
2mxx2: (16)
The ambiguity in the sign of W0disappears at x¼0 when
the two alternatives of Eq. (16) are degenerate and real.
Since Eq. (15) is valid when the oscillator does not move,
this is in perfect agreement with the trivial classical picture
of the oscillator. However, this seemingly trivial solution
reveals its intriguing consequences when WHJis allowed to
traverse the non-classical regions of space where x<0 and
x>0, and W0is purely imaginary. In this case, the substitu-
tion of the real and imaginary parts of W0inw0

with A0¼exp/C0ImW0ðÞ =/C22h/C0/C1
and/0¼exp iReW0ðÞ =/C22h/C0/C1
¼1 gives
w0
HJ¼e/C0mxx2=2/C22hðÞ; (17)
where the choice of the sign of W0has been made to ensure
convergence at large distances. The result of Eq. (17) is
remarkable because, with less effort compared to standardquantum-mechanical procedures, we have produced theground state wave function.
Next, we examine the quantum harmonic oscillator energy
levels E
n¼/C22hxnþ1
2/C0/C1
with the purpose of understanding
their analog in terms of the characteristic function Wused
here to deﬁne the HJ wave function wHJ. The scaling of the
quantum energy levels demonstrates both a vacuum energy(or zero-point energy), as well as excitations above thislabeled by n. The fact that the energy is separable into two
independent contributions suggests that we can treat the fullstate as two noninteracting oscillating “particles” one associ-ated with excitations of energy n/C22hxand one associated with
the vacuum with energy /C22hx=2. The analogous physical sys-
tem within the HJ context of this work generates the factori-
zation of the full wave function into w
HJ¼A0wW, where wW
is associated with excitations above the ground state. Given
the relationship between wHJandW, this motivates the intro-
duction of the total Hamilton’s characteristic function W
¼W0þWexc(i.e., the two oscillators are non-interacting).
After the factorization of wHJ¼A0wWwith A0¼exp iW0=ð
/C22hÞandwW¼exp iWexc=/C22h ðÞ , and making the obvious simpli-
ﬁcation to the one-dimensional problem, the classical waveequation in Eq. (6)and Re pðÞ2¼2mE/C0V ðÞ yieldd2A0

which, up to a normalization factor, is in perfect agreement
with the harmonic oscillator wave functions derived usingstandard quantum mechanical methods.
Despite the nice conclusion of Eq. (20), one detail is still
missing. We should try to understand the energy mismatch
between the choice of E

0¼0 made earlier (see Eq. (15))
and the vacuum energy of E0¼/C22hx=2. The mismatch disap-
pears when the nonclassical regions at x<0 and x>0 are
part of the wave describing the motionless oscillator. In otherwords, if E
cl
0is the classical energy based on the particle-like
understanding of the motionless oscillator, we expect thatthe wave propagation through the nonclassical regionsexplains the mismatch. In such an instance, Hamilton’s prin-ciple applied to the wave-front propagation yields

This is the reduced HJ equation with an extra-term contain-

gous to Eq. (A1) inAppendix A generated from the
Schr €odinger equation. W0was found before in Eq. (16) to be
W0¼imxx2=2 (after the correct choice of the sign) and the
extra-term in Eq. (22) amounts to /C0/C22hx=2. It means that the

so that the choice of the vacuum energy E0¼/C22hx=2 deter-
mines the zero-energy level Ecl
0¼0 used in Eq. (15). In turn,
any other value of the energy must be rescaled accordingly
as in the eigenvalues of Eq. (19). Note that the addition of a
constant value to the energy has no dynamical meaning fromthe point of view of the fundamental classical laws ofmotion. All of them (Euler–Lagrangian equations, Hamiltonequations, etc.) involve derivatives that cancel the /C22hx=2
113 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 Michele Marrocco 113 04 October 2023 22:49:24
contribution coming from the wave picture summarized in
Eq.(6). The energy shift /C22hx=2 accounts for the fact that a
traveling wave cannot be held at rest as in the case of theclassical oscillator of Eq. (15). For this reason, any compari-
son between wave- and particle-like motion should be
accompanied by the energy shift of the zero level.
The conclusion of this short example is that HJ wave prop-
agation of Eq. (6)is compatible with the Schr €odinger picture
if the momentum and wave front phase velocity are parallel,and Hamilton’s principle is assumed.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that the Schrodinger equation can be
obtained from Hamilton’s principle of stationary action. Thestationary action regulates the wave-front propagation of theHJ wave function exp iS=/C22hðÞ . This procedure can be under-
stood by students who have knowledge of Hamilton’s princi-
ple and classical mechanics.

The author has no conﬂicts to disclose.
APPENDIX A: CLASSICAL LIMIT
The classical limit can be readily established after substi-
tution of the wave function exp iS=/C22hðÞ in the Schr €odinger
equation. With the help of the canonical relationshipsp
i¼@S=@qi, the Schr €odinger equation reduces to the
following:
1
2mrWðÞ2þV¼Eþi/C22h
2mr2W; (A1)
where Wis again a complex-valued function according to
Dirac’s suggestion. In the limit of very small /C22h, the term
involving the Laplacian of Wis negligible, and Eq. (A1)
becomes the HJ equation. However, in the available deriva-tion by Bransden and Joachim32(pp. 258–260), the
Hamilton’s functions are tacitly assumed to be real, whichgoes against Dirac’s suggestion. In this case, we would have
a wave function with amplitude equal to one, an unnecessary
oversimpliﬁcation. Despite the complex nature of W, the
classical limit in Eq. (A1) can all the same be established as
long as vanishing /C22hvalues are accompanied by vanishing
ImWðÞ. In the limit with both /C22h!0 and Im WðÞ!0, Eq.
(A1) can be solved for Re WðÞ, which is the classical charac-
teristic function giving rise to the classical motion.24
APPENDIX B: COMPARISONS WITH OTHER
ACTION-BASED METHODS
We conclude our investigation with some comparisons to
other popular methods relying on the action, and we excludethose attempts where other quantum routes are taken toachieve the objective of the Schr €odinger picture. For
instance, the method suggested by Green
47is quite original,
but it relies on the Heisenberg representation and the corre-sponding use of the commutator. Below we discuss twoalternative programs: the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin(WKB) method and the Feynman’s path integral approach.The WKB program consists of searching for an approxi-
mation of the wave function exp iU=/C22hðÞ that solves the one-
dimensional Schr €odinger equation.
27,28,31–33Although this
method is not concerned with the way the Schr €odinger equa-
tion is justiﬁed, the wave function exp iU=/C22hðÞ looks very
similar to the deﬁnition of the HJ wave: wHJ¼exp iW=/C22hðÞ .
Clearly, to establish the relationship between the two wavefunctions, we have to gain some insight into how the Ufunc-
tion relates to the complex Hamilton’s characteristic function
W. We will see that a difference exists and has decisive
implications.
The WKB approach begins with the expansion of the
function Uin powers of /C22hand in the classical limit ( /C22h!0)
the phase of Usatisﬁes the HJ equation. The approximation
applies when only terms up to /C22h
2are used in the expansion
ofU. When this is done, the approximated wave function
depends on the inverse of the square root of the linearmomentum p,
w
WKB/1ﬃﬃﬃppexp6iWcl=/C22h ðÞ ; (B1)
and a more general solution is built on the linear combina-
tion of the propagating and counter-propagating waves gen-
erated by the choice of the sign in Eq. (B1). Notably, the
classical Hamilton’s characteristic function Wclappears in
the WKB wave function, where Wclis a real function in con-
trast to the complex WofwHJ. This fact explains why wWKB
has singular behavior at the turning points where p¼0
whereas wHJof Sec. IVis regular.
Now, we turn to the Feynman’s path integral approach.
Again, we simplify to a one-dimensional mechanical prob-
lem where the path integral approach to the Schr €odinger rep-
resentation “is easily interpreted physically as the expressionof Huygens’ principle for matter waves.”5This amounts to
calculate the wave function at time tþ/C15according to
WFx;tþ/C15 ðÞ /ð
exp iS x;yðÞ =/C22h/C0/C1WFy;tðÞ dy; (B2)
where Sx;yðÞ coincides with Hamilton’s principal function
in the classical limit and WFdescribes the wave front charac-
terizing the Huygens’ surface of constant phase. Expansionwith respect to the time parameter /C15leads to an approximated
result on both sides of Eq. (B2). (The integral is broken into
several contributions arising from the inﬁnitesimal time stepsof duration /C15connecting xandy.) Indeed, recalling Eq. (4),a
small change Sis expected for the time variation /C15during
which the mechanical system goes from xtoy. Then, the
action changes by Sx;yðÞ ¼/C15L
/C15. In addition to the factor /C15,
another parametric dependence appears in the Lagrangian L/C15
as a function of coordinate yand velocity y/C0xðÞ =/C15. Based
on this, the expansions of both sides of Eq. (15) give linear
terms in /C15and, in turn, their equality makes it possible to sort
out the time-independent Schr €odinger equation.
In this very short summary of Feynman’s approach to the
Schr €odinger equation, it is still clear that all the ingredients
of the HJ approach of Sec. IV(wave-front propagation and
Hamilton’s principle) are present here too. Both methods are
rooted in the tools of classical mechanics, which acquire anew meaning when they are extended to the quantum realm.
As Feynman said “there is a pleasure in recognizing old
things from a new point of view.”5
