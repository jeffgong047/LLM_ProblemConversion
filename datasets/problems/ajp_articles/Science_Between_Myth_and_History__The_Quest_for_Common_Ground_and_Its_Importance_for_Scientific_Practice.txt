Scientiﬁc knowledge is constructed by social processes
within creaky institutions that operate through messy politi-
cal negotiations. There is no such thing as a scientiﬁcmethod—a logic of science that is guaranteed to produce
cognitive progress. The stories that scientists tell about their
disciplines are highly selective, often distorted narrativesthat have purposes other than presenting accurate histories.
For most citizens, science is a remote authority, trusted or
distrusted along with other elite institutions.
Such claims have become commonplace within the con-
stellation of disciplines known as science studies. They are
also very likely correct. Scientists rarely react positively tosuch ﬁndings, which seem to impugn the credentials of sci-ence as a truth-producing enterprise. Indeed, during the
Science Wars of the 1990s, many scholars within science
studies endorsed a self-devouring relativism. Scientists werenot impressed.
Science Between Myth and History starts with a foreword
by Trevor Pinch, who, during the Science Wars, ﬂirted withwhat today we would call science denial. In his ﬁrst and last
chapters, Jos /C19e G. Perill /C19an frames his discussion by referring
back to the Science Wars. To scientists, these are not auspi-cious signs. However, Perill /C19an, who has doctorates and fac-
ulty positions both in physics and the history of science, is
well-positioned to bridge the cultural divide. He does notoffer correctives to the internally generated reasons and con-
siderations of evidence that dominate scientiﬁc debates.
Instead, he focuses on the stories scientists tell about the pastof their disciplines. These “myth-histories,” as Perill /C19an calls
them, must serve a purpose, helping communicate ideas both
within a discipline and when facing a larger public. But whatpurpose? And would it help if scientists were to tell stories
that were more accurate?
Perill /C19an approaches such questions through a series of
case studies, illustrating a range of circumstances in which
scientists make use of myth-histories.
His ﬁrst example is the early history of interpretations of
quantum mechanics, which was smoothed over in the later
culture of theoretical physics. While this case certainly
shows distortions of history and mythmaking, it is also unsat-isfying. After all, quantum interpretation is not sensitive to
empirical evidence; indeed, it is hard to see what physicists
should do other than treat their equations pragmatically. Thefutile debate over interpretation mostly illustrates that physi-
cists, no less than philosophers, can be sucked into pointless
quests for the Really Real.Perill /C19an’s next example, where prominent biologists
attempted to shape the perception of the development ofCRISPR by drawing on mythic themes, is more interest-
ing. Myth-history, in this case, became a tool in a nasty
priority and legal dispute. Such an example highlights thesocial and political context in which science operates.
Perill /C19an, however, does not explore the pressures on sci-
ence to become an intellectual property mill, preferring todraw anodyne conclusions about diversity and inclusion
instead.
The second case study from physics in the book includes
some intriguing details of the history of gravitational wave
research, which ended up ignored or sanitized in public pre-
sentations of the background to LIGO. Hagiography aboutEinstein among physicists can be barely above pop-culture
images of the lone genius in terms of intellectual quality;
Perill /C19an hints at how such myths function in bolstering the
authority of scientiﬁc institutions. The ﬂuctuating reputation
of Joseph Weber’s research among physicists also makes for
a fascinating story.
The last case study comes from seismology, centered on
the curious incident of the convictions of Italian scientists
for propagating a false sense of security before a lethal earth-
quake. This was a real failure in the public role of scientiﬁc
institutions, where scientists mishandled their communica-tion of uncertainty. The mythic self-presentation of science
backﬁred. Perill /C19an argues that an overreliance on myth-
history can erode the credibility of scientists. This is plausi-ble enough, but there is little hard evidence to support such a
suggestion. Perill /C19an’s desire to use a more accurate history
of science to improve the public image of scientiﬁc institu-tions is understandable, but we don’t really know if it would
work.
The Science Wars never concluded—the parties
involved lost interest or got exhausted. Many scientists still
distrust science studies, since too many scholars went
beyond correcting an idealized self-image of science, start-ing to portray the intellectual content of science as a reﬂec-
tion of power struggles. The notion that science made no
signiﬁcant contact with nature was absurd, discrediting sci-ence studies among scientists. Therefore, too many scien-
tists have felt free to retain their myths about science as a
heroic enterprise that almost magically homes in on truth.Most research in science studies, however, has been less
grandiose than it seemed during the Science Wars, result-
ing in detailed, plausible pictures of how science producesreliable knowledge while remaining a human, unmagical
process.
Perill /C19an’s book belongs in this more modest current of sci-
ence studies. As such, it has much to offer scientists inter-
ested in a more accurate image of the work of science. The
questions it raises are important, though there is clearly a lot

more to be done. For example, myth-histories are a signiﬁ-
cant component of science education, and none of the case
studies in Science Between Myth and History address an edu-
cational context. But then, the role of this book is to start aconversation, not to present the last word.Taner Edis is a professor of physics at Truman State
University. His research interests have shifted from physics tothe history and philosophy of science, as reflected in his latest
book: Weirdness!: What Fake Science and the Paranormal Tell
Us About the Nature of Science (Pitchstone, 2021).
