In most thermodynamics textbooks, polytropic processes are introduced by deﬁning the process
equation rather than explaining their physical origin. In this paper, we propose a simple model to
realize a polytropic process for an ideal gas. The ideal gas is compressed or expanded quasi-statically while in thermal contact with a ﬁnite reservoir with constant heat capacity, and the entire
system is thermally isolated from the outside environment. We propose an experimental
implementation of our model with realistic parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION
In thermodynamics textbooks, polytropic processes (where
PVn¼constant) are usually introduced as generalizations of
isothermal and adiabatic processes. The polytropic process is
frequently used to model practical engineering thermodynamic
systems, such as compressors.1After studying the isothermal
process equation PV¼constant and the adiabatic process
equation PVc¼constant, it is easy for students to accept that
there may be practical processes with PVn¼constant. Here, P
andVare the gas pressure and gas volume, respectively, cis
the adiabatic exponent or heat capacity ratio, and nis the poly-
tropic exponent.
However, apart from the equation PVn¼constant used to
deﬁne the polytropic process, students are usually provided
with little or no understanding of the origin of such a pro-
cess. It is well known that an isothermal process can be
achieved by quasi-statically expanding or compressing the
ideal gas when it is in contact with a constant-temperature
heat reservoir. When we quasi-statically compress or expand
the thermally isolated ideal gas, the transformation is adia-
batic. With these two typical reversible processes2in mind,
it is, therefore, natural for one to ask what kind of realistic
thermodynamic process can be described by the polytropic
process equation.
In this paper, a simple model is proposed to realize and
interpret the polytropic process physically. We also discuss
the ﬁnite-size effect of the thermal reservoir implied by this
model.
II. QUASI-STATIC ENERGY TRANSFER PROCESS
IN A GAS-RESERVOIR SYSTEM
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the system under consideration,
which is thermally isolated from the outside environment,
consists of an ideal gas with temperature Tgand a ﬁnite-
sized thermal reservoir with temperature Tr. The gas can be
compressed or expanded using a piston.
Usually, the reservoir is assumed to be large enough that
its temperature remains unchanged throughout the process.
However, in our model of a polytropic process, the tempera-
ture of the reservoir varies. In fact, the thermal contact
between the gas and the reservoir is assumed to be prefect,
so that the gas is in thermal equilibrium with the reservoir at
all times: Tg¼Tr¼T. When the gas is quasi-statically
driven (compressed or expanded), energy conservation dur-
ing an inﬁnitesimal process requiresdUg¼/C0PdVþdQg; (1)
where Ugis the internal energy of the gas and Qgis the heat
absorbed by the gas from the reservoir. The change of inter-nal energy U
rof the reservoir is
dUr¼dQr¼CrdT: (2)
Here, Cris the heat capacity at constant volume of the reser-
voir, and we have assumed that no work is applied to the res-ervoir. In the following, we refer to the heat capacity atconstant volume as the heat capacity, for both the gas andthe reservoir.
Because the internal energy change of the ideal gas is
dU
g¼CgdT, with Cgthe heat capacity of the gas, and
dQg¼/C0dQr, we can rewrite Eq. (1)as
dQg¼CgdTþPdV¼/C0CrdT: (3)
The process is reversible since the change in entropy of the
whole system DS¼ÐðdQg=TgþdQr=TrÞ¼0.2By substitut-
ing the ideal gas equation in Eq. (3), we obtain the following
differential equation:
CgþCr ðÞ dT¼/C0PdV¼/C0NkBT
VdV (4)
with the number of gas particles Nand the Boltzmann constant
kB. With the assumption that the reservoir has a constant heat
capacity, the solution of Eq. (4)is straightforwardly obtained
as
TVc/C01ðÞ =1þCr=Cg ðÞðÞ¼constant ; (5)
where c/C171þNkB=Cgis the adiabatic exponent of the ideal
gas. The above equation can be rewritten in terms of PandV
as
PVn¼constant ;n/C17cþCr=Cg
1þCr=Cg: (6)
Hence, the polytropic process equation is derived from our
simple model, and we see that the polytropic exponent nis
determined by the ratio of the heat capacity of the reservoir
to that of the gas. Obviously, the speciﬁc heat capacity of thegas in this process is C
s¼dQg=dT¼/C0Cras implied in Eq.
(3). In this sense, Eq. (6)can also be directly derived by
555 Am. J. Phys. 91(7), July 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 555 04 October 2023 22:53:50
assuming that the speciﬁc heat capacity of the gas is a con-
stant, which is a common practice in thermodynamics text-books (e.g., problem 10 of Ref. 3). The model we present
here provides a realistic physical interpretation of thisabstract assumption.
As an illustration, the P–Vdiagram of the diatomic mole-
cule gas ( c¼1:4) with different C
r=Cgis plotted in Fig. 2(a)
in log-log scale, so that the slope of the curves represents thecorresponding polytropic exponent. From the perspective ofpotential applications, Eq. (6)shows that the heat capacity of
the reservoir C
r¼Cgðc/C0nÞ=ðn/C01Þcan be inferred from n,
which is determined by measuring the P–Vdiagram of the
gas. In Fig. 2(b), we plot the polytropic exponent nas a func-
tion of Cr=Cg. In the limit that the reservoir size tends to
inﬁnity, Cr!1 , so that n!1, and thus, T¼constant. In
this limit, the process is isothermal [red dashed curve in Fig.2(a)]. This result is very intuitive because when the heat
capacity of the reservoir tends to inﬁnity, it becomes a heat
bath with a constant temperature. In the limit of C
r!0, the
reservoir disappears, and the gas becomes an isolated system
with n!c. In this case, Eq. (5)recovers the adiabatic equa-
tion of the ideal gas PVc¼constant, which is represented by
the black solid curve in Fig. 2(a).
Figure 2intuitively demonstrates that the heat capacity
acts as a bridge between the different thermodynamic pro-
cesses of the gas. However, we note that conventional mate-rials generally have a positive heat capacity ( C
r>0) and
thus Cr=Cg2ð0;1Þ. Hence, the polytropic exponent
n2ð1;cÞ, which implies that Eq. (6)cannot describe the
isochoric ( n!1 ) nor the isobaric ( n!0) processes.
However, it is easy to conﬁrm that the equations governing
these two processes can result from Eq. (6)if the reser-
voir’s heat capacity can take negative values. Speciﬁcally,C
r¼/C0 cCgresults in n!0, while n!1 is achieved with
Cr¼/C0Cg. In addition, when /C0cCg/C20Cr/C20/C0Cg, the poly-
tropic exponent nis negative, which leads to an unusual
class of polytropic processes for which the pressure of the
gas increases as its volume expands. The requirement that
the reservoir has a negative heat capacity can be achievedwith unconventional materials
4,5or some specially
designed thermodynamic processes,6–8which will not be
discussed here.
Physically, the ﬁnite reservoir essentially provides the gas
with additional degrees of freedom for storing internal
energy. These degrees of freedom do not participate in the
work of the gas. Therefore, although the entire system is adi-abatic, the gas alone undergoes a polytropic process. The
advantage of using an auxiliary system to provide additional
degrees of freedom of the gas is that the regulation of C
rcan
be achieved independently of the gas state, and thus, the pol-
ytropic exponent can be easily changed.
III. WORK AND HEAT
In a polytropic process, if the volume of the gas with ini-
tial temperature T0is varied from V0toVf, it follows from
Eq.(5)that the ﬁnal temperature of the gas is
Tf¼T0V0
Vf/C18/C19n/C01
/C17T0e/C0kj; (7)
with k¼lnðVf=V0Þand j¼n/C01¼ðc/C01Þ=ð1þCr=CgÞ.
According to Eq. (4), the work done by the gas is
W¼ðVf
V0PdV¼/C0 CgþCr ðÞðTf

¼CgþCr ðÞ T01/C0e/C0kj ðÞ : (9)
In addition, it follows from Eq. (3)that the heat absorbed by
the gas isFig. 2. (a) P–Vdiagram of the gas with different Cr=Cg. The blue dashed-
dotted curve and yellow dotted curve are plotted with Cr=Cg¼5 and
Cr=Cg¼1, respectively. The red dashed curve represents the isothermal
process ( Cr!1 ), while the black solid curve represents the adiabatic pro-
cess ( Cr!0).P0andV0are the initial gas pressure and volume for a given

which is proportional to the work done by the gas. This is in
consistent with a recent study on the polytropic process,9
where the authors deﬁned the energy transfer ratiodQ
g=dW/C17Kand introduced the assumption that Kis a
constant.
The heat absorbed and work done by the gas as functions
ofCr=Cgare plotted in Fig. 3. The corresponding energy DE
is normalized by the work done during the isothermal pro-cess, i.e., W
iso/C17NkBT0lnðVf=V0Þ.10Two special results are
implied in Eq. (10) and observed directly from Fig. 3: (i) in
the isothermal process ( Cr!1 ),W¼Wiso¼Qgwith no
internal energy change of the gas and (ii) in the adiabaticprocess ( C
r!0),Qg!0 and no heat is generated.
When the heat capacity of the reservoir is much larger
than that of the gas, i.e., Cg/C28Cr, keeping to the ﬁrst order
injorCg=Cr, the output work in Eq. (9)is approximated as
W’ðc/C01ÞCg

2k2j/C18/C19
(12)
/C25Wiso1/C0c/C01
2Cr=Cg/C18/C19
: (13)
The second term in Eq. (13) is the correction due to the
ﬁnite size of the reservoir, which will reduce the amount ofwork done compared to W
iso, the work done when the reser-
voir is inﬁnite. This 1 =Crcorrection agrees well with some
recent studies on ﬁnite-system thermodynamics and statis-tics.11–14In fact, this correction reﬂects the back action of
the system on the reservoir. When the reservoir is inﬁnite,the work done W
isois determined only by the changes in the
state of the gas, since its evolution has no effect on the ther-mal bath. In the case of a ﬁnite-sized reservoir, the change inthe gas state affects the temperature of the reservoir, whichin turn affects the heat exchange between the gas and the res-ervoir. The existence of this back action is a good illustrationof how the interaction between the system and the reservoirleads to heat transfer, which is ignored in the limit of inﬁnite
degrees of freedom in the reservoir.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL REALIZATION
In principle, it is feasible to experimentally demonstrate
our model at the undergraduate level. The experimental
design is shown in Fig. 4. Before the start of the experiment,
the material used as the reservoir and a certain amount of gas
are sealed inside an adiabatic cylinder. We emphasize here
that this experiment differs from the usual adiabatic experi-
ment on a gas,
15,16due to the presence of an additional sys-
tem acting as the reservoir. As discussed earlier, the
adiabatic process of a gas corresponds to the special case of
our experiment where the reservoir is removed. We, then,
control the piston to slowly compress or expand the gas, and
theP–Vdiagram of the gas during the whole process can be
obtained by directly measuring the volume and pressure of
the gas via suitable sensors.15–17
As shown in Fig. 4, 10 l of dry air at room temperature
(Cg/C259:3J=K;c/C251:4Þcan constitute the ideal gas. If the
reservoir is 100 ml of dry air (Fig. 4(a),Cr/C250:093 J =KÞ,
according to Eq. (5), the polytropic exponent is n/C251:396,
which is very close to the adiabatic exponent c. If the reser-
voir is water (Fig. 4(b), 200 ml, Cr/C25840 J =K) in a Petri dish
(radius R¼8 cm and depth h¼1 cm), the polytropic expo-
nent is n/C251:004, which means that the designed process is
very close to an isothermal process. If the reservoir is a table-
spoon of sand (Fig. 4(c),2 0 g , Cr/C2520 J=K (Ref. 18)), the
polytropic exponent is n/C251:13.
Apart from ensuring a perfect thermal exchange between
the gas and the reservoir (for instance, by waiting several
times longer than the characteristic time of heat transfer17),
isolating the gas and the reservoir from the outside environ-
ment in the whole process to avoid extra heat dissipation is
the main difﬁculty of this experiment. Here, we present twopossible solutions to overcome this difﬁculty: (i) For ordi-
nary cylinders, the entire cylinder can be wrapped with a low
thermal conductance material (such as aluminum foil coated
EPE foam) and (ii) a simple “insulated cylinder” can be built
based on the double-layer vacuum structure of a thermos bot-
tle or a Dewar ﬂask to create a custom “Dewar cylinder.”Fig. 3. Heat absorbed and work done by the gas as a function of Cr=Cg. The
black solid curve and red dashed curve are plotted with Eqs. (9)and(10),
respectively. In this example, we choose k¼ln 2 and c¼1:4.
Fig. 4. Schematic diagram of the proposed experimental setup. The ﬁnite
reservoir can be (a) air, (b) water, or (c) sand. In case (a), the upper air (sys-
tem) and the lower air (reservoir) are separated by a partition (red plane)
with high thermal conductivity. The entire cylinder is thermally isolated
from the outside.

These two solutions, especially the second one, can provide
good thermal insulation performance for the cylinder withinthe time scale required for the experiment.
In addition, by integrating the measured P–Vdiagram,
one can obtain the work done in the whole process and com-pare it with the theoretical prediction of Eq. (9). Particularly,
in case (b) where water acts as the reservoir, we haveC
r/C25840J=K/C29Cg/C259:3J=K. According to Eq. (13), the
work done in this “quasi-isothermal” process is about 2 :2&
less than that of the corresponding isothermal process.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The simple gas-reservoir model proposed in this paper can
deepen students’ understanding of the polytropic process andcan be directly extended to the van der Waals gas system.19
Thermal reservoirs are generally envisioned as systems
that are at thermal equilibrium and have an inﬁnite numberof degrees of freedom. Their temperature, then, is their onlycharacteristic quantity. Corrections related to the ﬁnitenessof reservoirs in any energy conversion process will lead stu-dents to be aware of thermodynamic effects away from thethermodynamic limit, including their inﬂuence on the perfor-mance of heat engines.
5,20–23
Moreover, ﬁnite-sized reservoirs also build a bridge
between macro- and micro-thermodynamics: As the size ofthe reservoir or system is further reduced to the quantumscale, non-equilibrium thermodynamic phenomena resultingfrom quantum properties or dynamics that cannot bedescribed by classical equilibrium thermodynamics arebecoming more common. This has led to the development ofthe emerging ﬁeld of quantum thermodynamics in recentyears.
24–27When the heat capacity of the thermal reservoir is
temperature-dependent, the solution of Eq. (4)will no longer
satisfy the polytropic process equation, and the difference
between the P–Vdiagram of the gas in this case and the
conventional polytropical curve is worth further exploring.As a ﬁnal remark, without the quasi-static assumption, takinginto account non-equilibrium heat transfers, this model canalso be utilized to study the ﬁnite-time thermodynam-ics
17,28–31of the gas associated with a ﬁnite-sized reservoir.
