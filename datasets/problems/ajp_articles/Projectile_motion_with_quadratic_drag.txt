Two-dimensional coupled nonlinear equations of projectile motion with air resistance in the form
of quadratic drag are often treated as inseparable and solvable only numerically. However, when
they are recast in terms of the angle between the projectile velocity and the horizontal, theybecome completely uncoupled and possess analytic solutions for projectile velocities as a function
of that angle. The equations relating the time and position coordinates to this angle are not
integrable in terms of elementary functions but are easy to integrate numerically. Additionally,energy equations explicitly including dissipation terms can be developed as integrals of the
equations of motion. One-dimensional numerical integrations can be treated in a pedagogically
straightforward way using numerical analysis software or even within a spreadsheet, making thistopic accessible to undergraduates. We present this approach with sample numerical results for
velocity components, trajectories, and energy-balance of a baseball-sized projectile.

I. INTRODUCTION
Projectile motion is central to introduce the concepts of
motion and the foundations of classical mechanics in highschool and ﬁrst-year college physics courses. At this level,the effects of air resistance are usually neglected to be left
for an upper-level mechanics course where linear (Stokes)
and quadratic (Newtonian) drag models are introduced.Although linear drag is completely analytic, it is valid only
at low Reynolds numbers (low speed, small size, or high vis-
cosity). Quadratic drag dominates for many practical appli-cations in air, but only one-dimensional cases, vertical-only
or horizontal-only, are treated in most textbooks and many
classrooms. Two-dimensional quadratic drag is described bya set of coupled nonlinear differential equations that are solv-
able only numerically, see Parker’s treatment.
1Here, we
show that the numerical approach can be combined with aninsightful analytical treatment, resulting in a more compre-
hensive presentation.
Prior treatments of quadratic drag by Parker,1Ray and
Fr€ohlich,2Hayen,3and Mungan4are most relevant to this
presentation. Parker reduced the coupled nonlinear equations
of two-dimensional quadratic drag to a single, time-implicit,
numerically integrable scalar equation from which velocitycomponents and horizontal and vertical displacements werenumerically determined.
1More recently, Ray and Fr €ohlich,
using a similar approach, succeeded in inverting their scalar
equation to obtain a time-explicit solution to the equations ofmotion.2Both approaches are beyond an undergraduate
level.
Hayen took an alternate and less-well-known approach.3
Earlier work (Refs. 2–5 in Hayen’s paper) showed that an
analytic, time-implicit solution for the velocity components
is obtained when the equations of motion are recast in terms
of the angle /¼tan/C01vy=vx/C0/C1; however, this work is also
beyond the undergraduate level. In this paper, we introduce
the/-angle approach at an advanced undergraduate level,
elaborate on the role of energy dissipation by derivingenergy equations as integrals of the equations of motion, and
use this approach to quantitatively describe how quadratic
drag inﬂuences the short-, intermediate-, and long-timeproperties of a projectile trajectory. Mungan treats energy
dissipation, albeit in the vertical direction only;4Hayen also
brieﬂy treats energy dissipation.3
The integrals for time and distance as a function of /must
be done numerically. Our approach, like that of Timberlake
and Hasbun,5is to provide exposure to the underlying algo-
rithms before using commercial numerical analysis software.Spreadsheet applications are well-suited to this purpose. In
the supplementary material, we provide an Excel
VRﬁle for
numerical integration using the fourth order Runge–Kutta
(RK4) method; embedded pdf documents within the Excel
ﬁle introduce the RK4 method for spreadsheets and describe
ﬁve example RK4 integrations.6
In this analysis, we neglect buoyancy effects.7This is jus-
tiﬁed when the projectile density is large compared to the airdensity. Additionally, we neglect the added mass effect8
from projectile acceleration and lift from projectile spin.Erlichson and Davies consider spin and lift in golf-ball tra-
jectories; see Nathan’s website and Clanet’s paper for spin
effects in baseball trajectories.9–12
This paper is organized as follows: The vector relations
that deﬁne the equations of motion are developed in Sec. II,
as well as the analytic parts of the solution and the integrals
for the non-analytic parts. Energy equations are derived in
Sec. III. Numerical results for a smooth, baseball-sized pro-
jectile launched at low-to-moderate velocities and at various
angles of inclination are shown in Sec. IV. Section Vdis-
cusses the numerical results, and Sec. VIis a summary and
conclusion with suggestions on how this approach may be
used in the classroom.

III. ENERGY EQUATIONS
An alternate approach to solve Newton’s second law is to
use the work-energy theorem, which in the present analysis
is used to shed additional light on how projectile motion in
the presence of drag deviates from the familiar parabolic tra-
jectory in the absence of air resistance. Mechanical energy is
progressively converted into thermal energy, leading to a dis-
sipation integral and energy-related constants of the motion.
Multiplying each side of Eq. (4a) bytdtand integrating
yields
mðv
v0vdv¼/C0bðt
t0v3dt/C0mgðt
t0vsin/dt: (12)
We use dt¼dt=d/ðÞ d/and Eq. (5)to change the variable
of integration to /in the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of
Eq.(12). For the second term on the right-hand-side, we sub-
stitute vy¼vsin/;vy¼dy=dtðÞ and change the variable of
integration to y. Integrating, rearranging, and introducing

The terms on the left-hand side of Eq. (13) are the initial
kinetic and potential energy; the ﬁrst two terms on the right-
hand side are the kinetic and potential energy at a point /in
the trajectory, respectively.
The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13)is the posi-
tive work done by the projectile in moving through the air.
The resistive force of the air against the projectile is the drag
force and is anti-parallel to the projectile velocity, as shownin Fig. 1. The force of the projectile against the air is equal
in magnitude and opposite in the direction by Newton’s third
law. The positive work done by the projectile in moving
through a pathlength dsis the force-displacement-product
bv
2ds. Then using ds¼ds=dtðÞ dt;dt¼dt=d/ðÞ d/;and
dt=d/¼/C0v/ðÞ=gcos/from Eq. (6)yields the integrand in
Eq.(13). Since the angle /decreases throughout the motion,
the minus sign in front of the integral makes the work always
positive-valued . That is, there will always be energy loss
throughout the trajectory and, hence, the trajectory will be
asymmetric. This last term in Eq. (13) is not integrable in
terms of elementary functions.
Energy equations are obtained similarly from the x-andy-
direction equations of motion. However, only two of thethree equations in the x-,y-, and t-directions are independent;

Equations (13) and (14) determine two energy-related
constants of the motion. Since tan /¼vy=vx, all of the trig-
onometric functions are simply related to the dynamicalvariables v
xand vy:Thus, Eq. (14) relates v0and /0

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We consider a smooth, spherical, baseball-sized projectile
of diameter 7.5 cm and mass 0.15 kg. Averaging online data
for the drag coefﬁcient of a smooth spherical projectile
within the regime of quadratic drag yields b¼0.0012 kg/m
for the coefﬁcient of the quadratic drag force FD¼bv2.14
Projectile trajectories were calculated within Excel using
the RK4 method; these are plotted in Fig. 2(a)forv0¼40 m/s
and selected values of /0.I nF i g . 2(b), trajectories for /0
¼50/C14and selected v0values are plotted. All trajectories are
observed to be asymmetric about a vertical axis through the
peak. We note three characteristics of these plots. (1) InFig. 2(a), the magnitude of the angle of impact, /
ijj,i s
always larger than /0. In Fig. 2(b),/ijjalways increases
with increasing launch velocities. (2) For any trajectory, at aconstant value of the height y, the magnitude /jjafter the
peak is observed to be larger than /jjprior to the peak. (3) In
Fig.2(a), for launch angles from /
0¼80/C14to 40/C14, the range
increases and the maximum height decreases compared to
trajectories with larger launch angles. However, at /0¼20/C14,
both the range and maximum height are smaller than thosefor the /
0¼40/C14trajectory.
Qualitatively, we can explain the trajectory asymmetries
by noting that since the horizontal velocity component vx
always experiences an antiparallel drag force, it constantly
decreases throughout the trajectory. Conversely, the vertical
component vyalways decreases on the way up and always
increases on the way down.3Quantitatively, the time evolu-
tion of the slopes tan /¼vy=vxof the trajectory curves in

where we used v¼vx=cos/and Eq. (5)ford/=dt. Because
the trajectory asymmetries derive from the vxterm in Eq.
(15), we exhibit these components below and discuss their
properties in Sec. V.
Figure 3shows the horizontal velocity vxfrom Eqs. (9)
and(10);ln v x=vx0 ðÞ is graphed on the vertical axis, time in
seconds on the bottom horizontal axis and in multiples of thetime scale s¼v
t=g¼3:5 s on the top horizontal axis. We
graph ln v x=vx0 ðÞ to show short-time, intermediate, and long-
time approach-to-asymptotic behavior as well as the role of
the natural time constant swhich we discuss in Sec. V.
Figure 3(a)shows ln v x=vx0 ðÞ versus time for v0¼40 m/s and
the same /0values as Fig. 2(a). Figure 3(b)shows ln v x=vx0 ðÞ
versus time for /0¼50/C14and the same v0values as Fig. 2(b).
We note ﬁve characteristics of the plots in Fig. 3. (1) In
Fig. 3(a), all ln v x=vx0 ðÞ curves start at the origin with the
same slope that is initially unchanging in time, regardless oflaunch angle. (2) In Fig. 3(b), all ln v
x=vx0 ðÞ curves start at
the origin with different initial slopes, depending on launchspeed v
0with smaller magnitude slopes for smaller v0:(3)
For both Figs. 3(a)and3(b), effects from the drag force bv2
emerge after about one second with all curves showing a
deviation from the initial slopes. (4) For both Figs. 3(a) and
3(b), the slopes begin to approach a constant asymptotic
value of /C01=s(dashed lines in Figs. 3(a) and3(b)) starting
near 6 s. (5) In the intermediate-time regime, /C241s<t/H113516s ,
the velocity plots show curvatures connecting short-time tolonger-time behavior. We discuss the origin of these charac-teristics in Sec. V. The y-component velocities v
yshow simi-
lar regimes of behavior. The vybehavior is explained once
the origin of the vxvelocities is explained in Sec. V;vy
curves are not plotted.
In Fig. 4, we plot curves for the energy terms in Eq. (13)
for a trajectory of v0¼40 m/s, /0¼50/C14. The curve labeled
1 is the kinetic energy from the x-component of the velocityð1=2Þmv

The curve labeled 2 is the y-direction kinetic energy, ð1=2Þmv2

shows an approach to the asymptotic value of ð1=2Þmv2

that all energy processes are accounted for. Finally, sincethe slope of curve 4 approaches the absolute value of theslope of curve 3, this indicates that the power dissipatedto air resistance asymptotically approaches mgv

V. DISCUSSION
As noted in Sec. IV, the details of the asymmetries in
Figs. 2(a)and2(b)depend on the properties of the vxcompo-
nents that are observed in Figs. 3(a)and3(b)to fall into three
regimes: a short-time regime, 0 <t/H113511 s, an intermediate
regime, 1 /H11351t/H113516 s, and a long-time regime, t/H114076 s. Here,
we discuss the physical origin of these regimes.
We isolate the short-time behavior exhibited in Figs. 3(a)
and3(b) by Taylor-series-expanding Eqs. (5)and(9)using
/¼/0þ/C15, where /C15is small and negative-valued. This
yields /C15’/C0gtcos/0=v0for Eq. (5)and vx’vx0½1þ/C15vx0=ð
vtÞ2sec3/0/C138for Eq. (9)to ﬁrst order in /C15. Using these rela-
tions, we ﬁnd vx’vx01/C0v0=vtðÞ t=s ½/C138 for short times. For
t=s/C281,vxis unchanged from its value in the absence of air
resistance. Drag effects emerge as the quantity v0=vtðÞ t=s
becomes signiﬁcant compared to unity. Thus, the natural
time constant semerges as an indicator of how long it takes
for air resistance to affect the motion. Also, the initial slopesof the graphs in Fig. 3agree with the predictions of the
short-time v
xvstrelation.
The intermediate-time regime occurs over an interval of
about 1–6 s or 0 :3s/H11351t/H113511:7s. In this region, the slope of the
ln v x=vx0 ðÞ curves changes from no noticeable drag effects to
the asymptotic slope of /C01=s. We can explain this using an
integrated form of Eq. (6). Multiplying each side of Eq. (6)
by 1 =mðÞ dt=vxðÞ yields dvx=vx ðÞ ¼/C0 b=mðÞ vdt. Integrating
this equation from time t1tot2yields

the projectile over the interval Dt. For durations Dtwhere the
average velocityÐ2

Eq.(17) indicates that the slopes of the ln v x=vx0 ðÞ curves are
noticeably shallower (more positive) than /C01=s. For exam-
ple, at the trajectory peak of the /¼80/C14plot in Fig. 3(a),
vy¼0 and v¼vx; this corresponds to the minimum magni-
tude average velocity and minimum slope shown at about
s/C251:0. We conclude that the maximum changes in curvature
in Fig. 3(a)occur for the larger launch angle trajectories where
vxis smaller and vis small for longer durations, near the top
of the trajectory. In the long-time regime, vapproaches vt,
and Eq. (17) indicates that the slope approaches /C01=s;t h u s ,

The long-time behavior of vxis veriﬁed using d, the differ-
ence between /and the asymptotic limit of /C0p=2,
d¼/þp=2, as the expansion parameter. We Taylor-series-
expand vxfrom Eq. (9), keeping terms to order d3and ﬁndvx=vt/C24d/C0c1d3. Equation (5),d/=dt¼/C0gcos/=v, simpli-
ﬁes to dd=dt¼/C0gd=vtin this limit; integrating yields

to ﬁrst order in dyields vx/C24e/C0t=s, verifying the result from
theln v x=vx0 ðÞ plots in Figs. 3(a) and3(b). Additionally, we
note vy¼vxtan/and tan /¼sin/=cos//C24ð /C0 1þd2=2Þ=

in this limit. Combining these relations yields
vy/C24vt/C01þd2=6/C0/C1
,o rvyþvt/C24e/C02t=sasymptotically. This
agrees with previous results3,15obtained for a projectile
dropped from a height; this is expected as the trajectory isessentially one-dimensional in this limit.
The last characteristic noted from Fig. 2(a) relates to the
trajectory maximum heights and ranges for launch anglesgreater and less than the launch angle for maximum range.
In Fig. 2(a), the launch angle for maximum range occurs at
about /
0¼40:1/C14. For any /0within 40 :1/C14</0<90/C14, the
horizontal distance at maximum height decreases withincreasing launch angle. For any /
0within 0/C14</0/H1135140.1/C14,
the horizontal distance to the maximum height decreaseswith decreasing /
0. Hayen3gives an exact numerical solu-
tion for the maximum range for quadratic drag and proofsfor several geometric properties of the trajectory.
VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The treatment of projectile motion with quadratic drag
posited here is not completely analytic in terms of elemen-tary functions and so requires numerical analysis. However,it offers the opportunity to introduce a fundamental problemin a new way with beneﬁts for student comprehension andpreparation for more advanced topics. The aspects of this
topic that require a numerical approach can be addressed
using numerical software packages or instructor-developed orstudent-developed spreadsheets for numerical integration. Apremise of this paper is that the students can learn more aboutprojectile motion with dissipation when they are calculatingprojectile trajectories, parameters, and energy quantities. Inthe supplementary material, an Excel ﬁle with example RK4integrations, for example, ﬁrst order equations, the quadratic
drag trajectory formulas developed here, and an RK4 routine
for the time-dependent, coupled second-order x-a n d y-equa-
tions of motion is available for instructor use.

The development of energy equations is a neglected topic
for both linear and quadratic drag, and one- and two-dimensional motion. Since linear drag is completely analytic,the energy-equation approach of Sec. IIIcan be applied with
all results in terms of elementary functions; for one-dimensional quadratic drag, the energy equations are alsocompletely analytic.
16Numerous homework-level problems
investigating energy non-conservation can be developed for
student instruction.
For two-dimensional quadratic drag, checking that the dissi-
pation integral in Eq. (13)quantitatively explains energy non-
conservation also involves accounting for vx,vy, and height y.

culations, perhaps at selected trajectory points such as the

launch parameters, v0and/0. How does /ivary with v0and
/0? Does solving Eq. 11(b) for/¼/iwhen y0andy¼0
explain the dependence? Can one ﬁnd an efﬁcient parameter-ization for /
iin terms of v0and/0? As another example,
Ray and Fr €ohlich2recently published a time-explicit solution
to the quadratic drag problem for the velocities vxand vy.
Does this time-explicit solution work well in the approach-to-asymptotic regime? Does the time-explicit solution pro-vide a better or more efﬁcient way to calculate the projectiletrajectories xtðÞ,ytðÞ?
