The “particle-in-a-box” problem is investigated for a relativistic particle obeying the Klein–Gordon
equation. To ﬁnd the bound states, the standard methods known from elementary non-relativistic
quantum mechanics can only be employed for “shallow” wells. For deeper wells, when the
conﬁning potentials become supercritical, we show that a method based on a scattering expansionaccounts for Klein tunneling (undamped propagation outside the well) and the Klein paradox
(charge density increase inside the well). We will see that in the inﬁnite well limit, the wave
function outside the well vanishes, and Klein tunneling is suppressed: Quantization is, thus,recovered, similar to the non-relativistic particle in a box. In addition, we show how wave packets
can be constructed semi-analytically from the scattering expansion, accounting for the dynamics of
Klein tunneling in a physically intuitive way.

I. INTRODUCTION
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the “particle in a
box,” i.e., when the square well potential is extended to inﬁ-
nite depth, is the simplest problem considered in textbooks,
usually in order to introduce the quantization of energy levels.
In contrast, in the ﬁrst quantized relativistic quantum mechan-
ics (RQM), the situation is not so simple, and the problem isunderstandably hardly treated in RQM textbooks. The reason
is that when the potential reaches a sufﬁciently high value, the
energy gap 2 mc
2separating the positive energy solutions
from the negative energy ones is crossed ( mis the rest mass
of the particle). For such potentials, known as “supercritical
potentials,” the wave function does not vanish outside the
well but propagates undamped in the high potential region, a
phenomenon known as Klein tunneling.1,2Indeed, RQM—
although remaining a single-particle formalism—intrinsically
describes a generic quantum state as a superposition of posi-
tive energy solutions (related to particles) and negative energysolutions (related to antiparticles).
Therefore, for relativistic particles, the particle-in-a-box prob-
lem is not suited to introductory courses. For this reason, only
ﬁnite, non-supercritical rectangular potential wells are usually
presented in RQM classes (see, for example, Sec. 9.1 of Ref. 3
for the Dirac equation describing fermions in a square well or
Sec. 1.11 of the textbook4for the Klein–Gordon equation, spin-
0 bosons, in a radial square well). For a Dirac particle in an inﬁ-
nite well, a “bag” model was developed by not introducing an
external potential, but assuming a variable mass taken to beconstant and ﬁnite in a box, but inﬁnite outside;5,6in this way,
Klein tunneling is suppressed, and solutions similar to those
known in the non-relativistic case can be obtained. This method
was recently extended to the Klein–Gordon equation.7In this work, we show that for the Klein–Gordon equation
in a one-dimensional box, it is not necessary to change themass to inﬁnity outside the well in order to conﬁne the parti-cle. To do so, we shall consider multiple scattering expansionsinside the well. Such expansions were recently employed to
investigate relativistic dynamics across supercritical barriers.

We will see below that Klein tunneling, which is prominent
for a supercritical potential well sufﬁciently higher than theparticle energy placed inside, disappears as the well’s depth V
is increased. In the inﬁnite-well limit, Klein tunneling is sup-pressed, and the walls of the well become perfectly reﬂective,as in the non-relativistic case.
The relativistic bosonic particle in a box is an interesting
problem because it yields a simple understanding, in the ﬁrstquantized framework, of the charge creation property that isbuilt into the Klein–Gordon equation, extending tools (scatter-ing solutions to simple potentials) usually encountered inintroductory non-relativistic classes. Moreover, as we willshow in this paper, time-dependent wave packets can be easilybuilt from the scattering solutions. This is important becausewave packets allow us to follow in an intuitive way thedynamics of charge creation in a relativistic setting. The phys-ics of charge creation in the presence of supercritical poten-tials is much more transparent for the Klein–Gordon equationthan for the Dirac equation, which needs to rely in the ﬁrst
quantized formulation on hole theory (see Ref. 9for a Dirac
wave packet approach for scattering on a supercritical step).
The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst recall in Sec.
IIthe Klein–Gordon equation and address the ﬁnite square
well problem, obtaining the bound-state solutions. In Sec.III, we introduce the method of the multiple scattering
expansion (MSE) in order to calculate the wave functioninside and outside a square well. We will then see (Sec. IV)

that the wave function outside the well vanishes as the well
depth tends to inﬁnity. The ﬁxed energy solutions are similar
to the well-known Schr €odinger ones. Finally, we show (Sec.
V) how the MSE can be used to construct simple wave pack-
ets in a semi-analytical form. We will give illustrations
showing the time evolution of a Gaussian initially inside
square wells of different depths.
II. KLEIN–GORDON SOLUTIONS FOR A PARTICLE
IN A SQUARE WELL
A. The Klein–Gordon equation
The wave function Wðt;xÞdescribing relativistic spin-0
particles is well-known to be described by the Klein–Gordon(KG) equation.3,4In one spatial dimension and in the pres-
ence of an electrostatic potential energy V(x), the KG equa-
tion is expressed in the canonical form and in the minimal
coupling scheme as
i/C22h@t/C0VðxÞ ½/C1382Wðt;xÞ¼ð c2^p2þm2c4ÞWðt;xÞ; (1)
where cis the speed of light in vacuum, ^p¼/C0i/C22h@xis the
momentum operator, and /C22his the reduced Planck constant.
The charge density qðt;xÞ, which can take positive or nega-
tive values associated with particles and anti-particles, is
given by (see, e.g., Refs. 3and4)
qðt;xÞ¼ i/C22h=2mc2/C0/C1

A generic state may contain both particle and anti-particle
contributions, corresponding to positive and negative ener-
gies, respectively [see Eq. (6)below]. The scalar product of
two wave functions WIðt;xÞandWIIðt;xÞis deﬁned as

: (3)B. The finite square well
1. Plane-wave solutions
Before getting to the problem of a particle in an inﬁnite
well, let us address ﬁrst a particle inside a square well of
ﬁnite depth. A square well in one dimension can be
described by the potential,
VðxÞ¼V0hð/C0xÞhðx/C0LÞ; (4)
where hðxÞis the Heaviside step function, V0is the depth of
the well, and Lis its width. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we con-
sider the three regions indicated by j¼1, 2, and 3. In each of
the three regions, the KG equation (1)accepts plane wave
solutions of the form:
Wjðt;xÞ¼ð Ajeipjx=/C22hþBje/C0ipjx=/C22hÞe/C0iEt=/C22h; (5)
where we set Eto be the energy inside the well (region 2).
By inserting those solutions in Eq. (1), one obtains Ein terms
of the momentum inside the well,
EðpÞ¼6ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
c2p2þm2c4p
; (6)
where, for convenience, we put p¼p2. These are the plane
wave solutions in free space known from RQM textbooks.3,4
A plane wave with E(p)>0 represents a particle, whereas a
solution with E(p)<0 represents an antiparticle. We will be
considering situations in which a particle is placed inside the
well, so we will take positive plane-wave solutions in region2. Outside the well (in regions 1 and 3), it is straightforward
to see that W
jðt;xÞis a solution provided p1;3¼qðpÞ, where
qðpÞ¼6ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ðEðpÞ/C0V0Þ2/C0m2c4q
=c: (7)
Note that in the limit of an inﬁnite well ( V0/C29mc2),q(p)
is always real, so that typical solutions Wjðt;xÞin regions
j¼1 and 3 are oscillating. Note also that a classical parti-
cle with energy Ewould have inside the well a velocity
v¼pc2=E(sopandvhave the same sign). Hence, for the
region 2 solutions W2ðt;xÞ;when pis positive, eipx=/C22hcorre-
sponds to a particle moving to the right (and e/C0ipx=/C22hto the
left). However, outside the well, we have
v0¼qc2=ðE/C0V0Þ; (8)
so that for large V0, the velocity and the momentum of a
classical particle have opposite signs.10,11So a plane wave
eiqx=/C22hwith q>0 now corresponds to a particle moving to the
left. This can also be seen by rewriting the plane waves in
terms of the energy outside the well, say exp iðp1x/C0/C22EtÞ=/C22h.
This is tantamount to taking the potential to be 0 in region 1
and /C22V¼/C0V0in region 2 (with V0>0). Since we require
/C22E/C0/C22Vto be positive and smaller than V0(in order to repre-
sent a particle inside the well), we must have /C22E<0. In this
case, a given point xdescribed by the plane wave
expiðp1x/C0/C22EtÞ=/C22htravels to the right if p1is negative.
For instance, the position of an antinode changes by
Dx¼Dt/C22E=p1in the time interval Dt,s oi f /C22E<0, the sign of
Dxwill be opposite to the sign of p1.26
2. Bound states
Bound states are obtained when the solutions outside
the well are exponentially decaying. This happens when q(p)
has imaginary values, that is for potentials satisfying
Fig. 1. A square well with the three regions jconsidered in the text. The
arrows depict the multiple scattering expansion for a wave initially traveling
toward the right edge of the well (see Sec. IIIfor details).

E/C0mc2<V0<Eþmc2. Note that for a particle at rest in
the well frame, E/C25mc2, and the condition for the existence
of bound states becomes V0<2mc2.
In order to ﬁnd the bound state solutions, we employ the
same method used in elementary quantum mechanics for theSchr€odinger equation square well. We ﬁrst set the boundary
conditions on the wave functions (5)accounting for no
particles incident from the left in region 1 nor from the rightin region 3, yielding

We then require the continuity of the wave functions Wjðt;xÞ
of Eq. (5)and their spatial derivatives at the potential discon-
tinuity points x¼0 and x¼L:

W0

2ðt;0Þ;W0

This gives

/C0qB1¼pðA2/C0B2Þ;pðA2eipL/C0B2e/C0ipLÞ¼qA3eiqL:
(11)
By eliminating A3andB1, we obtain a system of two equa-
tions in A2andB2,
ðqþpÞA2þðq/C0pÞB2¼0;
ðq/C0pÞA2eipLþðqþpÞB2e/C0ipL¼0; (12)
where qis given by Eq. (7). This system admits nontrivial
solutions when the determinant of the system (12) vanishes,
ðqþpÞ2e/C0ipL/C0ðq/C0pÞ2eipL¼0: (13)
Nontrivial solutions exist only if qis an imaginary number

solutions:
qra¼ptanðpL=2Þ;
qrb¼/C0pcotðpL=2Þ: (14)

Figure 2gives an illustration for a particle conﬁned in a well
of width L¼10 (we employ natural units c¼/C22h¼e0¼1a s
well as m¼1; the conversion to SI units depends on the par-
ticle’s mass, e.g., for a pion meson pþ, the mass is
139.57 MeV/c2). The energies are inferred from the values of
Pat the intersection points.
III. MULTIPLE SCATTERING EXPANSION
FOR SUPERCRITICAL WELLS
A. Principle
We have just seen that the method depending on matching
conditions jointly at x¼0 and x¼Las per Eq. (10) only
works if q(p) is imaginary, since, otherwise, Eq. (13) has no
solutions. However, as is seen directly from Eq. (7), for sufﬁ-
ciently large V0,q(p) is real. For this case, we use a different
method in which the wave function is seen as resulting froma multiple scattering process on the well’s edges. The well isactually considered as being made out of two potential steps,
and the matching conditions apply separately at each step.
More precisely, consider the following step potentials: a
left step, V
lðxÞ¼V0hð/C0xÞ, and a right step, VrðxÞ
¼V0hðx/C0LÞ. Let us focus on the wave function inside the
well, whose general form is given by W2ðt;xÞ[Eq. (5)]; the
boundary conditions are those given by Eq. (9), meaning no
waves are incoming toward the well. Let us ﬁrst consider aplane wave ae
ipx=/C22hwith amplitude apropagating inside the
well toward the right ( p>0; see Fig. 1). On hitting the right
step, this wave will be partly reﬂected and partly transmitted to
region 3. The part reﬂected inside the well will now traveltoward the left, until it hits the left step, at which point, it suf-fers another reﬂection and transmission. This multiple scatter-
ing process continues as the reﬂected wave inside the well
travels toward the right edge. Similarly, we can consider aplane wave be
/C0ipx=/C22hof amplitude binitially inside the well but
propagating to the left. This wave hits the left step ﬁrst and
then scatters multiple times off the two edges similarly.
Multiple scattering expansions, generally employed when sev-eral scatterers are involved, are also often used in potential
scattering problems in order to gain insight in the buildup of
solutions involving many reﬂections (see Ref. 13for an appli-
cation to plane-wave scattering on a rectangular barrier).
B. Determination of the amplitudes
The coefﬁcients giving the scattering amplitudes due to reﬂec-
tion and transmission at the two steps will be denoted as r
l;rand
tl;r, respectively, where landrindicate the left and right steps,
respectively. In order to calculate those coefﬁcients, one hasto solve the step problem separately for each of the two steps.
The continuity of the plane wave e
ipx=/C22hand its ﬁrst spatial
derivative at the right step ( x¼L) yield the following two
equations:
eipL=/C22hþrre/C0ipL=/C22h¼treiqL=/C22h;
eipL=/C22h/C0rre/C0ipL=/C22h¼q=pðÞ treiqL=/C22h(16)
giving
Fig. 2. The bound state energies of a particle of mass m¼1(L¼10, natural
units are used, see text) are found from the values of P¼pL=ð2/C22hÞat the
intersections of the curves deﬁned in Eq. (15).
299 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 4, April 2022 M. Alkhateeb and A. Matzkin 299 04 October 2023 23:07:18
tr¼2p=pþqðÞ eiðp/C0qÞL=/C22h;
rr¼p/C0qðÞ =pþqðÞ ei2pL=/C22h: (17)
Similarly, in order to calculate the coefﬁcients of reﬂec-
tion and transmission suffered by a plane wave propagatinginside the well toward the left step, one uses the continuityof the plane wave and its space derivative at x¼0 to obtain:
t
l¼2p=pþqðÞ ;rl¼p/C0qðÞ =pþqðÞ : (18)
After the plane wave reﬂects for the ﬁrst time either on the
right or left steps, it will undergo a certain number of reﬂec-tions before being ﬁnally transmitted outside the well. Letae
ipx=/C22hbe the initial wave inside the well moving to the right
(recall B3¼0). After the ﬁrst cycle of reﬂections from both
steps, the amplitude of the same plane wave becomes arrrl;
andaðrrrlÞnafter ncycles of successive reﬂections. This pro-
cess is illustrated in Fig. 1. In addition, an initial plane wave
moving to the left (recall A1¼0),be/C0ipx=/C22h, contributes, after
reﬂecting on the left step, to the wave moving to the right,ﬁrst with amplitude br
land then multiplied by ðrrrlÞafter
each cycle of reﬂections. The amplitude of the plane wavee
ipx=/C22hin region 2 is the sum of these contributions, namely,
ðaþbrlÞP
nðrrrlÞn. We can identify this term with the
amplitude A2in region 2, Eq. (5)(recall we have set p/C17p2).
Along the same lines, we identify B2in Eq. (5)with the
amplitude of the term e/C0ipx=/C22hinside the well resulting from
multiple scattering as well as B1in region 1 and A3in region
3. The result is
B1¼tlðarrþbÞX1
n¼0ðrrrlÞn;
A2¼ðaþbrlÞX1

B2¼ðarrþbÞX1
n¼0ðrrrlÞn;
A3¼trðaþbrlÞX1
n¼0ðrrrlÞn;
A1¼B3¼0: (19)
The behavior of the seriesP
n/C210ðrlrrÞnis interesting as it
is related to charge creation. The term
jrlrrj¼j p/C0qðÞ =pþqðÞ j2(20)
can, indeed, be greater or smaller than 1, corresponding,
respectively, to a divergent or convergent series. As followsfrom Eq. (8), for a supercritical potential ðE/C0V
0Þ<0, so
the direction of the motion is opposite to the direction of themomentum. Hence, given the boundary conditions A
1¼B3
¼0, we see that we must set q<0 in order to represent out-
going waves in regions 1 and 3 (moving in the negative andpositive directions, respectively). We conclude that forsupercritical wells, jr
lrrj>1 and the amplitudes (19)
diverge. The physical meaning of a diverging series is bestunderstood in a time-dependent picture, as we will see inSec. V. The nth term of the series will be seen to correspond
to the nth time the wave packet hits one of the edges, each
hit increasing the wave packet’s amplitude.
Note that for q<0, both jr
lj>1a n d jrrj>1. This is an
illustration of bosonic superradiance at a supercritical potentialstep: For a given plane-wave incoming on the potential step
(here the left or right steps), the reﬂected current is higher than
the incoming one.14,15This phenomenon, that at ﬁrst sight
appears surprising, became known as the “Klein paradox.”
IV. THE INFINITE WELL
As we have just seen, one of the signatures of the
Klein–Gordon supercritical well—a feature unknown in non-relativistic wells—is that the amplitudes outside the well, B
1
andA3, are not only non-zero, but grow with time. Each time
that a particle hits an edge of the well, the reﬂected wave has
a higher amplitude, but since the total charge is conserved,antiparticles are transmitted in zones 1 and 3.
However, it can be seen that as the depth of the supercritical
well increases, the amplitudes of the wave function transmit-
ted outside the well decrease. Indeed, the step transmissioncoefﬁcients t
randtlg i v e nb yE q s . (17) and(18) are propor-
tional to 1 =V0. Hence, in the limit of inﬁnite potentials,
V0!1 , the transmission vanishes. We also see from
Eqs. (17)and(18)thatrl!/C0 1;rr!/C0 e2ipL=/C22h,a n dP
nðrrrlÞn
is bounded and oscillates. Hence, from Eq. (19),i nt h i sl i m i t ,
A3!0a n d B1!0. This implies wðx¼0Þ¼wðx¼LÞ¼0,
and these conditions can only be obeyed provided
p¼kp/C22h=L; (21)
where kis an integer; we also then have B2¼/C0A2. The
unnormalized wave function inside the well takes the form:
W2ðt;xÞ¼2iA2sinkp
Lx/C18/C19
e/C0iEkt=/C22hðÞ; (22)
while the amplitudes outside the well obey B1!0 and
A3!0 (although for p¼kp/C22h=L;P
nðrrrlÞndiverges). This
can be seen by remarking that when Eq. (21) holds, rrrl¼1;
andB1can be parsed as
B1¼tlðarrþbÞþtlðarrþbÞþ/C1/C1/C1 : (23)
Since tl!0a s V0!1 ;the wave function in region 1 van-
ishes in this limit. A similar argument holds for A3.
Note, however, that A2(and B2Þbecome formally inﬁnite,
given that the seriesPnmax
ne2inpL=/C22h¼nmaxþ1 is unbounded
when Eq. (21)holds as nmax!1 . Since the total charge must
be conserved (and cannot change each time nmaxincreases),
the wave function inside the well should be renormalized to
the total charge. Unit charge normalization corresponds to

In the non-relativistic limit, the kinetic energy is small rela-
tive to the rest mass, yielding
E/C25ENR
k¼mc2þk2p2/C22h2=2mL2(26)
recovering the non-relativistic particle in a box energy (up
to the rest mass energy term). Equation (25) is the same
result obtained recently by Alberto et al. ,7who employed a

bag-model (taking the mass to be inﬁnite mass in regions 1
and 3) in order to ensure the suppression of Klein tunneling.
In a real situation, neither V0nor the number of reﬂections
(corresponding to the time spent inside the well) can be inﬁ-nite. Given a ﬁnite value of V
0;a particle placed inside the
well is represented by a wave packet that will start leakingafter a certain number of internal reﬂections, as we discussin Sec. V. This shows that although quantization for inﬁ-
nitely deep wells looks similar to the corresponding non-relativistic well, the mechanism is very different, as in thelatter case, we have exponentially decreasing solutions thatvanish immediately outside the well, whereas in the presentcase, we have oscillating solutions that are suppressed.
Note that although quantization only appears in the limit
V
0!1 , for high but ﬁnite values of V0, resonant Klein
tunneling (e.g., Ref. 16) takes place: The amplitudes (19)
peak for energy values around Ekgiven by Eq. (25). This can
be seen by plotting the amplitudes as a function of Eorp.
An illustration is given in Fig. 3, showing B1ðpÞandA2ðpÞ
for different values of V0. It can be seen that the amplitudes
are peaked around the quantized pvalues [Eq. (21)] while
concomitantly decreasing as the well depth increases.
For completeness, let us mention that the square well bound
states of Sec. II B 2 can also be recovered employing the
MSE. Indeed, for bound states, the wave function must be astanding wave. Given the symmetry of the problem, the wavefunction is either symmetric or anti-symmetric with respect tothe center of the well, x¼L=2. In the symmetric case, the
standing wave is, thus, given by Ccos½pðx/C0L=2Þ=/C22hÞ/C138.
Matching this form to W
2ðxÞ¼A2eipx=/C22hþB2e/C0ipx=/C22hleads to
A2=B2¼e/C0ipL=/C22h: (27)
The anti-symmetric standing wave is of the form
Csin½pðx/C0L=2Þ=/C22hÞ/C138, which is equated to W2ðxÞto obtain
A2=B2¼/C0e/C0ipL=/C22h. Replacing A2andB2by their respective
MSE expansion given by Eqs. (19), therefore, leads to
aþbrl ðÞ =arrþb ðÞ ¼ 6e/C0ipL=/C22h: (28)
Using rr¼rle2ipL=/C22hfrom Eqs. (17) and(18) and keeping in
mind that aandbare arbitrary complex numbers, Eq. (28)
becomes
rl¼6e/C0ipL: (29)
Now, using rl¼ðp/C0qÞ=ðpþqÞfrom Eq. (18) and squaring
both sides of this equation lead to Eq. (13) and, hence, to the
quantization conditions obtained above in Sec. I IB2 .Note that these bound states are obtained when the solu-
tions outside the well are exponentially decaying. In thiscase, the seriesP
nðrrrlÞnis bounded and oscillates, whereas
in the supercritical regime, this series was seen to be expo-
nentially divergent. When the MSE diverges, applying jointmatching conditions of the type given by Eq. (10) is incor-
rect and leads to unphysical results (for instance, in the scat-tering of Klein–Gordon particles on a barrier, doing so leads
to acausal wave packets and superluminal barrier traversal
times
17,18).
V. WAVE PACKET DYNAMICS
A. Wave packet construction
Since the solutions Wjðt;xÞof Eq. (5), with the amplitudes
given by Eq. (19), obey the Klein Gordon equation inside
and outside the well, we can build a wave packet by super-
posing plane waves of different momenta p. We will follow
the evolution of an initial Gaussian-like wave function local-ized at the center of the box and launched toward the rightedge (that is with a mean momentum p
0>0). We will con-
sider two instances of supercritical wells: one with a
“moderate” depth displaying Klein tunneling and the other
with a larger depth in which Klein tunneling is suppressed.
Let us consider an initial wave packet
Gð0;xÞ¼ð
dpgðpÞðA2ðpÞeipx=/C22hþB2ðpÞe/C0ipx=/C22hÞ (30)
with
gðpÞ¼e/C0ðp/C0p0Þ2=4r2
pe/C0ipx0: (31)
We will choose x0to be the center of the well and take p0as
well as all the momenta in the integration range in Eq. (30)
positive. We, therefore, set b¼0 in the amplitudes (19) and
choose ain accordance with unit normalization for the wave
packet. r2
pﬁxes the width of the wave packet in momentum
space (ideally narrow, though its spread in position spaceshould remain small relative to L). Finally, the sumPðr
rrlÞn
is taken from n¼0t onmax, where the choice of nmaxdepends
on the values of tfor which the wave packet dynamics will
be computed. Indeed, each term ðrrrlÞntranslates the wave
packet by a distance 2 nL, so this term will only come
into play at times of the order of t/C242nL=v, where
v/C24p0c=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
c2m2þp2
0p
is the wave packet mean velocity.
Fig. 3. The amplitudes jB1jandjA2jcalculated using the MSE relations Eq. (19) with nmax¼10,a¼1, and b¼0 are shown for different values of the super-
critical well depth V0¼5;20;and 50 ( pis given in units of 1 =Landc¼/C22h¼1). Inside the well, the resonant structure of jA2jis not much affected as V0
changes (the curves nearly superpose), but the amplitude jB1joutside the well, indicative of Klein tunneling, is seen to decrease as V0increases.

Note that in position space, G(0,x) is essentially a Gaussian
proportional to e/C0ðx/C0x0Þ2=4r2
xeip0x.27
Following Eq. (5), the wave packet in each region is given
by
Gjðt;xÞ¼ð
dpgðpÞWjðt;pÞ (32)
where the amplitudes AjðpÞandBjðpÞare obtained from the
MSE. For supercritical potential wells, we have to take q<0
in the MSE amplitudes. The charge qðt;xÞassociated with
the wave packet in each region is computed from Gjðt;xÞby
means of Eq. (2).
B. Illustrations
We show in Figs. 4and6the time evolution of the charge
corresponding to the initial wave packet (30) in supercritical
wells. The only difference between both ﬁgures is the welldepth, V
0¼5mc2in Fig. 4andV0¼50mc2in Fig. 6. The
calculations are semi-analytical in the sense that the integra-
tion in Eq. (32) must be done numerically for each space-
time point ( t,x).
ForV0¼5mc2, Klein tunneling is prominent: The positive
charged wave packet moves toward the right, and upon reach-
ing the right edge, the supercritical potential produces negativecharge outside the well (corresponding to antiparticles) andpositive charge inside. The reﬂected charge is higher than
the incoming charge—this is a time-dependent version ofKlein’s paradox—but the total charge is conserved. Thereﬂected wave packet then reaches the left edge of the well,resulting in a transmitted negatively charged wave packetand a reﬂected wave packet with a higher positive charge,now moving to the right inside the well. We have also dis-played (Fig. 5) results obtained from solving numerically
the KGE equation through a ﬁnite difference scheme. Thenumerical method employed is described elsewhere
8—here
its use is aimed at showing the accuracy of our MSE basedwave packet approach.
For a higher conﬁning potential (Fig. 6), transmission out-
side the well is considerably reduced: The wave packet isessentially reﬂected inside the well. This is due to the fact,noted above, that the plane-wave transmission amplitudesfrom which the wave packet is built are proportional to1=V
0. Hence in the limit V0!1 , Klein tunneling becomes
negligible. We recover a behavior similar to the one familiar
for the non-relativistic inﬁnite well wave packets.19
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this work, we studied a Klein–Gordon particle in a deep
(supercritical) square well. We have seen that the methodbased on connecting the wave function at both potential dis-continuities, employed for non-relativistic square wells, only
Fig. 4. The charge qðt;xÞassociated with the wave packet given by Eq. (32) for a particle of unit mass is shown for different times as indicated within each panel.
The parameters are the following: L¼400 and V0¼5mc2for the well, x0¼200;p0¼1;andrp¼0:02 for the initial state, a¼1,b¼0, and nmax¼10 for the
MSE series (natural units c¼/C22h¼1 are used). The change in the vertical scale is due to charge creation (no adjustment or renormalization has been made).

works for non-supercritical wells. For supercritical wells, a
divergent multiple scattering expansion was introduced toobtain the solutions. This expansion accounts for Kleintunneling and for the Klein paradox. In the limit of an inﬁ-nitely deep well, the amplitudes obtained from the expansionshow that Klein tunneling is suppressed. The quantized parti-
cle in a box similar to the non-relativistic one is then recov-
ered, although contrary to the non-relativistic case, thishappens by oscillating Klein tunneling solutions becomingnegligible (rather than through exponentially decaying wavefunctions becoming negligible outside the well). We havealso seen how these amplitudes can be used to build time-dependent wave packets.The methods employed here to study the square well for a
relativistic spin-0 particle can be understood readily from theknowledge of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Thesemethods have allowed us to introduce in a simple way spe-ciﬁc relativistic trait, such as charge creation (that in theKlein–Gordon case already appears at the ﬁrst quantized
level) or Klein tunneling and the Klein paradox. In particu-
lar, the wave packet dynamics give an intuitive understand-ing of these phenomena that are not very well tackled in astationary approach.
The framework employed in this paper—that of relativis-
tic quantum mechanics (RQM)—lies halfway between stan-dard quantum mechanics and the relativistic quantum ﬁeld

theory (QFT). Indeed, RQM describes formally a single par-
ticle wave function with a spacetime varying charge, while
the physically correct account afforded by QFT involves cre-
ation and annihilation of particles and their respective anti-particles. The correspondence between the RQM and QFT
descriptions for a boson in the presence of a background
supercritical potential has been worked out in detail
20for the
case of the step potential discussed in Sec. III A . According
to QFT, the potential spontaneously produces particle/antiparticle pairs, a feature that is absent from the RQM
description. For a Klein–Gordon particle, the RQM wave
function correctly represents the incoming boson as well asthe QFT enhancement to the pair production process; the
enhancement results from the interaction between the incom-ing boson and the supercritical potential (this is the charge
increase visible in Fig. 4). This correspondence can be estab-
lished in a time-independent approach,
14,21or more conclu-
sively by employing space-time resolved QFT
calculations.15From an experimental viewpoint, direct pair
production from a supercritical background ﬁeld hasremained elusive up until now, though the current develop-
ment of strong laser facilities could lead to an experimental
observation (for the fermionic electron–positron pair produc-tion) in a foreseeable future.
22The bosonic supercritical well
and the conditions under which quantized energy levels
could be observed are not at present experimentally on the
table.
Note ﬁnally that the disappearance of Klein tunneling in
the inﬁnite well limit should be of interest to recent works
that have studied the Klein–Gordon equation in a box with
moving walls23–25(the special boundary conditions chosen
in these works were, indeed, not justiﬁed). The method
employed here for spin-0 particles obeying the
Klein–Gordon equation is also suited to treat a spin-1/2 parti-cle in a square well obeying the Dirac equation. The scatter-
ing amplitudes in the Dirac case will, however, be different,
and the results obtained here for spin-0 particles regardingthe suppression of Klein tunneling in inﬁnite wells will not
hold.

27Strictly speaking, a Gaussian in position space would have negative energy
contributions not included in Gð0;xÞgiven by Eq. (30). Such contributions
are negligible in the non-relativistic regime and become dominant in theultra-relativistic regime. For more details in the context of barrier scattering,
see Ref. 18.
