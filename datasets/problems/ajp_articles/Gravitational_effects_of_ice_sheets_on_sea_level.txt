When ice melts from a large ice sheet and the melt water runs into the ocean, global-mean sea level
rises but, surprisingly, local sea level near the ice sheet may well drop. This is largely because theloss of mass reduces the gravitational pull of the ice sheet. We present a simple, analytically
tractable model to illustrate this effect. We look ﬁrst at a ﬂat earth with a circular continent
containing an ice sheet that is modeled as a point mass at its center and then extend the calculation
to a rigid spherical non-rotating earth. With a bit more mathematical sophistication, we then carry
out calculations for somewhat more realistic ice distributions and include the additional gravitationof the mass of displaced sea water. We give numerical results for the “ﬁngerprint” of sea level
change resulting from a 1000-Gt (10
15-kg) loss of ice on a rigid, non-rotating earth, with parameter
values appropriate to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. #2022 Published under an exclusive license

I. INTRODUCTION
In the present time of rapid climate change, much atten-
tion has been given to sea level rise driven by global warm-
ing. Two processes contribute to this rise: thermal expansionof sea water (the thermosteric1contribution) and melting of
land-based ice with the melt water ﬂowing into the ocean
(the manometric contribution). It is well known that com-
plete melting of the Greenland ice sheet would, by itself,raise global-mean sea level by 7.42 60.05 m,2while melting
of the entire Antarctic ice sheet would cause a rise of
57.960.9 m.3It is perhaps less well known that this rise
would not be uniform around the globe. Counterintuitively,melting ice from Greenland lowers sea level atthe
Greenland shore, while far from Greenland it raises local sea
level by more than average.
Prominent among the causes of this nonuniformity in
sea-level change—as was recognized and systematicallyinvestigated as early as the 1880s
4–6—is the change to the
gravitational ﬁeld of the ice sheet itself. A massive ice sheet
attracts sea water, raising a mound in sea level around the
land on which the ice rests. When ice melts from the sheetand the melt water ﬂows into the ocean, the addition of waterto the ocean raises global-mean sea level, but the removal of
ice mass weakens the gravity of the sheet, and so lowers the
mound. Depending on the geometry of the situation, the low-ering of the mound height may be greater than the rise inglobal-mean sea level; if so, local sea level near the ice sheet
drops. In this paper, we will look at some very simple models
of this effect and explore a few of the complications thatarise when we try to make the models a bit more realistic.
Rearranging mass on the earth’s surface, such as by melt-
ing ice from an ice sheet and returning the water to the
ocean, has two other effects that can be comparable to that
of the gravitational change. First, it changes the earth’s (ten-sor) moment of inertia. To keep the earth’s angular momen-tum constant, then, the magnitude and/or direction of its
angular velocity must change in response. Second, it changes
the pattern of mechanical loading on the earth’s crust.Locations that see an increase in loading will then sink elas-tically, while locations where the loading decreases will
rebound upward. These Gravitational, Rotational, and
Deformation effects on sea level are collectively referred toasGRD-induced relative sea level change . (“Relative” here
means relative to the sea ﬂoor.)
The sea surface, in equilibrium, would coincide with the
geoid , which is a particular surface of constant geopotential.
Geopotential is the sum of gravitational potential and an
effective centrifugal potential due to the earth’s rotation. Arearrangement of water mass directly changes its contribu-tion to the gravitational potential, and any resulting deforma-tion of the solid earth changes itscontribution to the
gravitational potential, while the rotational effect changes
the effective centrifugal potential. Thus, all three effects
interact by modifying the geoid, which results in further rear-rangement of sea water with its own attending gravitational,rotational, and deformation effect.

The effects of transferring mass between an ice sheet and
the ocean are proportional to the amount of mass transferred,as is the resulting change in global-mean sea level (called
thebarystatic sea-level change). Thus, it makes sense to talk
about the ocean-wide pattern of local sea-level change perunit mass transferred, which is called the barystatic-GRD ﬁn-
gerprint . Conventionally, the mass unit is taken to be 1000
Gt (10
15kg), which is commensurate with a few years’ mass
loss from Greenland (an average of 222 630 Gt/yr in
2013–2017)8or Antarctica (219 643 Gt/yr in 2012–2017).9
Melting 1000 Gt of ice adds 1000 km3of fresh water to the
ocean; dividing this by the area of Earth’s oceans, 3 :625
/C2108km2,10gives a global-mean sea-level rise of 2.76 mm,
so local sea-level changes are also likely to be on the order
of millimeters. In this paper, we will express the numerical
results of our simple models in terms of this ﬁngerprint,although we will restrict our attention to an earth that is rigidand non-rotating, and so automatically exclude rotationaland deformation effects.
GRD effects play a crucial role in glacial isostatic adjust-
ment, which is the ongoing response of the shape of the earth
to the melting of the Pleistocene glaciers from about 21 000
to about 8000 years ago. The elastic deformation of the crust,referred to above, is inevitably followed by a much slowerviscoelastic adjustment in the mantle below the crust, ontime scales of millennia. Thus, the earth’s response to the
melting of the glaciers is still in progress. A theory of glacial
isostatic adjustment requires a model of the viscoelasticproperties of the mantle; it also requires accurate modeling

of the surface loading, including the distribution of both
land-based ice and sea water. The sea-water component ofthe loading is described by the sea level equation , which
expresses the local depth of sea water as the difference
between the levels of the sea surface and the sea ﬂoor.11
GRD effects must be properly accounted for to calculate the
changes to both, and the resulting changes to the sea-water
loading then feed back into the adjustment process.12For
details of the theory, see recent reviews by de Boer et al. ,13
Spada,14and Whitehouse.15Whitehouse, in particular, gives
an interesting historical overview of the subject.
Strong observational evidence for this picture comes from
measurements of the time-varying direction of the earth’saxis of rotation, which can be determined to a precision ofbetter than a millisecond of arc.
16The observed variation
includes a secular drift that can be attributed to glacial iso-
static adjustment, plus more rapid variations on a time scaleof several years. Much of this faster variation can beexplained quantitatively as the consequence of changes in
the distribution of water on the earth’s surface, including
melting from ice sheets. To carry out this calculation,changes in the distribution of water and ice on land are deter-mined using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate
Experiment (GRACE) mission. Changes to the distribution
of water in the oceans, however, must be inferred—in a man-ner which must incorporate the gravitational changes due tothis redistribution in order to match the observed variation of
the pole.
While all these effects are important for the real earth, our
purpose here is to model the gravitational effect only, inways that may be accessible at an undergraduate level. Webegin, in Sec. II, by introducing our simplest model: a ﬂat,
rigid earth with an annular ocean surrounding a circular con-
tinent, at the center of which is a point mass representing theice sheet. We will choose numerical parameter values tomimic the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and the ocean
of the actual earth. Crucially, we ﬁnd that the gravitation of
the ice sheet can be treated as a small perturbation to theearth’s gravitational ﬁeld, small enough that a leading-order
approximation to the exact model equations gives numerical
results that are as precise as one might reasonably wish. InSec. III, we make the model earth spherical (and hence non-
rotating) and ﬁnd that many of the results of Sec. IIcarry
over directly to that apparently more complicated geometry.
We then look brieﬂy at some changes that might arise if weallow our spherical earth to have additional continents. InSec. IV, we use some more sophisticated mathematics to go
beyond modeling the ice sheet as a point mass, allowing an
azimuthally symmetric distribution of ice on the polar conti-nent. With only a little extra effort, we are also able toaccount for the additional gravitational effect of the dis-
placed sea water itself. We discuss the results in Sec. V.
II. FLAT EARTH MODEL
Consider ﬁrst a ﬂat world, depicted in Fig. 1(a), whose
topography consists of a single circular continent of radius R
in an annular ocean of outer radius R
0(perhaps held in place
by massless walls). The continent has an ice sheet of massM, which we model as a point mass at its center. We will
take the area Aof the ocean to be the area of earth’s oceans,
A¼3:625/C210
8km2. To model Greenland, whose area
is 2:17/C2106km2, we would then take R¼830 km and
R0¼10 800 km; the ice sheet mass is M¼2:74/C21018kg.2For Antarctica (area 1 :39/C2107km2, including ice shelves),17
we would have R¼2100 km and R0¼11 000 km, with
M¼2:38/C21019kg.3As illustrated in Fig. 1(b),w ed e ﬁ n e
the reference height z¼0 to be where sea level would be if
the entire ice sheet were melted and the melt water returnedto the ocean and denote the actual sea level at a distance r
from the ice sheet by z¼z
sðrÞ. The point-mass ice sheet is
also located at z¼0.
Equilibrium sea level must be a gravitational equipoten-
tial, since otherwise, water would always ﬂow downhill fromhigher-potential locations to lower. Given the above geome-try, the gravitational potential Uat height zand horizontal
distance rfrom the center of the continent is

The constant value Usof the gravitational potential on the
sea surface has a direct physical signiﬁcance. Setting z¼0i n
Eq.(1)yieldsUðr;0Þ¼/C0 GM=r, so the distance from the
ice sheet at which local sea level is zs¼0—which we will
call the “neutral” distance r0—is given byFig. 1. Geometry of the ﬂat-earth model. (a) The ice sheet is modeled as a
point mass Mat the center of a circular continent of radius R, centered in an
annular ocean of outer radius R0. (b) Height z¼0 is sea level before the
mass Mwas removed from the ocean to form the ice; after this removal,
global-mean sea level is at z¼/C0M=qA, where qis the density of fresh
water and Ais the surface area of the ocean. The point-mass ice sheet at the
origin is also at height z¼0. Local sea level at a distance rfrom the ice sheet
is at zsðrÞ. The distance r0is where sea level is at zs¼0.

r0¼/C0GM=Us: (2)
This is where the mound height raised by the gravitation of
the sheet exactly compensates the lowering of global-mean
sea level by removal of the water that forms the sheet, so that
melting the ice sheet would not change sea level there.
Equation (2)suggests that Usshould be negative, and this
is indeed the case. Gravitational potential increases as we
move away from the earth, and we have deﬁned the equipo-
tentialU¼0 to be the surface that encloses the entire volume
of the oceans before water is removed to form the ice sheet.
After that water is removed, the now-smaller volume of the
ocean is bounded by the equipotential U¼Us, which must
lie below the U¼0 surface.
To get an order-of-magnitude idea of the size of the gravi-
tational effect, suppose for a moment that the model ocean
were inﬁnite. Global-mean sea level would then be z¼0,
because removing any ﬁnite volume of water to form the ice
sheet would not affect the average level of an inﬁnite ocean.
Moreover, sea level must approach that global-mean value
forr!1 , where the gravitational potential due to the ice
goes to zero. From Eq. (1), then, the potential Uson the
ocean surface would be zero. Setting U¼0 and solving for zs
gives

The height of the water mound at the shore of the continent,
zsðRÞ, comes out to be 22 m for Greenland and 77 m for
Antarctica. In both cases, this is well above the global-meanlowering of sea level due to the removal of the mass Mof
water from the earth’s (ﬁnite!) ocean, which suggests that
melting ice from either continent might well lower sea level
at the continent’s shore.
For a ﬁnite ocean, the gravitational potential U
sat the sea
surface will not be zero. To determine it, we use the fact thatin order to form an ice sheet of mass M,av o l u m e M=qof
water must be removed from the ocean, where q¼1000 kg/m3
is the density of fresh water. This volume can be expressed in
terms of zs, which is the difference between local sea level
with and without the ice in place,

RzsðrÞ2prd r: (4)
In our model, this integral can in fact be evaluated analyti-
cally, e.g., by changing variables from rtozsusing Eq. (1),
thus yielding an expression for Usin terms of the sea level
heights zsðRÞand zsðR0Þat the near and far shores. This
expression and Eq. (1)applied at r¼Randr¼R0then form
a closed set of three algebraic equations for the three
unknowns zsðRÞ;zsðR0Þ, andUs. While in principle it should
be possible to solve this system of equations exactly, in prac-
tice it is not analytically tractable.
We can make progress, however, by exploiting the fact
that the gravitational ﬁeld due to the ice sheet is small com-
pared to the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, whose magnitude is
equal to g. Speciﬁcally, where the ﬁeld due to the ice is
strongest—at the nearest point of the ocean, r¼R—the ratio
of that ﬁeld to the earth’s ﬁeld,
l/C17GM=R2g; (5)is 2:7/C210/C05for Greenland and 3 :7/C210/C05for Antarctica.
In terms of this ratio, Eq. (1)applied at the ocean surface
becomes

When there is no ice sheet, so that M¼0 and l¼0, we have
zs¼0, by our deﬁnition of z, and so Us¼0. For small l,
then, both UsandzsðrÞmust be of order l. Consequently, the
z2
sin the radicand is always smaller than the r2by at least
nine orders of magnitude and can safely be ignored. This
reduces Eq. (1)to a simple explicit expression for the sea
level height

Substituting this into Eq. (4)and integrating then yield

: (8)
Note that the neutral distance r0¼/C0GM=Usis independent
of the mass of the ice sheet, depending only on the sizes of
the continent and ocean. It is always less than the distance
ðR0þRÞ=2 to the midpoint of the ocean and also less than
the ﬁxed distance GqA=g¼2470 km. For Greenland, we
ﬁndr0¼1700 km, and for Antarctica, r0¼1800 km.
Remarkably, for Antarctica, the r0is less than R, which is
2100 km. This means the continent is so large that the gravi-tational ﬁeld at its shore due to ice at its center would not be
strong enough to attract enough water to compensate the sea
level drop caused by removing the water that forms that ice.
According to this model, then, melting ice from Antarctica
would raise sea level even at the Antarctic shore. However,
we will see in Sec. IVthat relaxing the assumption that the
ice sheet is a point mass can reverse this prediction.
Substituting Eq. (8)back into Eq. (7)gives our ﬁnal result

The last term is the barystatic sea-level change, i.e., the global-
mean lowering of sea level due to removal of water from theocean to form the ice sheet. The rest of the right side describes a
rearrangement of the remaining volume of water by the gravita-
tion of the ice. The second term in the parentheses is the average
of the ﬁrst over the ocean surface; there is a net displacement of
water to locations within a distance ðR
0þRÞ=2 of the continent
from locations farther away. If we integrate the rearrangement
term in Eq. (9)over the sea surface only from RtoðRþR0Þ=2,
we ﬁnd that the volume of sea water displaced is a fraction
ðGqA=2gÞðR0/C0RÞ=ðR0þRÞ2of the volume M=qof fresh
water removed from the ocean to form the ice sheet. For
Greenland, this fraction is about 9%, and for Antarctica 6–1/
2%. Thus, the gravitation of the displaced mass of water might
itself make a modest but nontrivial contribution to the gravita-tional potential, amplifying the effect of the ice sheet gravitation
and displacing even more water. Accounting for this is beyond
the scope of our simple model, but we will return to this point in
Sec.IV.
353 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 5, May 2022 Douglas A. Kurtze 353 04 October 2023 23:08:22
For Greenland, Eq. (9)gives zsðRÞ¼11:7ma n d zsðR0Þ
¼/C09:0 m, while for Antarctica, it gives zsðRÞ¼/C0 13:4m( t h e
negative sign consistent with r0being less than R)a n d zsðR0Þ
¼/C075:7 m. It is worth noting, however, that the numerical
values of the global-average term M=qAin the expression for
zsðrÞ, which are 7.56 m for Greenland and 65.7 m for
Antarctica, disagree with the ﬁgures 7.42 m and 57.9 m in theliterature for the actual global-mean sea level rise that wouldresult from completely melting either ice sheet. The main rea-son for this discrepancy is that some of the ice in both icesheets is below sea level. Were all the ice in the sheet to melt,
some of the melt water would replace this volume of ice
instead of contributing to a rise in sea level. In addition, such alarge change to the volume of the ocean could i nundate enough
dry land that the ocean area Awould change signiﬁcantly.
However, these considerations only come into play after a sub-stantial fraction of the ice is melted. Before that point, ourresults unambiguously describe the change in local sea level in
response to a change in the mass of the ice sheet, i.e., the ﬁn-
gerprint of sea level change due to changes in the ice sheet. To
eliminate any possible ambiguity, when giving numericalresults we will henceforth interpret Mas a change in ice sheet
mass, and z
sas the resulting change in sea level. As mentioned
in the Introduction, we will use a standard mass changeM¼–1000 Gt, which results in a barystatic rise in global-mean
sea level of jMj=qA¼2:76 mm. A loss of 1000 Gt from the
Greenland ice sheet, according to Eq. (9), then gives a sea level
drop of 4.26 mm at the near shore ( R)a n dar i s eo f3 . 3 0m ma t
t h ef a rs h o r e( R

cause a rise of 0.57 mm at the near shore and 3.18 mm at thefar shore.
III. SPHERICAL EARTH
Results coming from a ﬂat-earth model, of course, cannot
be trusted, especially when they involve distances compara-ble to the earth’s radius. Fortunately, setting our model on a(rigid) spherical non-rotating earth turns out to present nodifﬁculties. As shown in Fig. 2, we use spherical coordinates
with the origin at the center of the earth and model the icesheet as a point mass at the pole h¼0. The continent bearing
the ice sheet extends to colatitude h¼H, and the ocean
extends from there to h¼H
0. The radius of the earth isRE¼6371 km, and we take the surface r¼REto be sea level
when there is no ice sheet. With the ice sheet in place, equi-librium sea level (the geoid) is given by r¼R
EþzsðhÞ. This
model is a slight generalization of the model presented by
Vermeersen and Schotman, who took H¼0 andH0¼180/C14,
i.e., a world completely covered by ocean, and followed asomewhat different route through the calculation than ours.19

pole to colatitude his

which, remarkably, is equal to the area of a circle whose
radius is the straight-line distance 2 REsinðh=2Þfrom the
pole to the edge of the cap. It follows that HandH0are
related to the RandR0from Sec. IIby
2REsinðH=2Þ¼R;2REsinðH0=2Þ¼R0: (11)
Since our model earth does not rotate, there is no centrifu-
gal contribution to the geopotential, so the geoid is a surface
of constant gravitational potential. This is given by the gen-
eralization of Eq. (1)to our spherical geometry,

As in Sec. II, we can argue that Usandzsmust be of order

RE. To four- or ﬁve-digit precision, then, we may approxi-
mate the gravitational potential due to the ice on the sea sur-face by the potential at z¼0. Solving for z

The neutral point would be where 2 REsinðh0=2Þmatches
the value of r0from Sec. II. The distance from the pole to
this point along the surface, 2 REsin/C01ðr0=2REÞ, is only about
6 km more than r0itself for both Greenland and Antarctica.
The real earth, of course, has continents between colati-
tudesHandH0. Real-world continents have signiﬁcant,
complex effects on the sea surface proﬁle, among which are
the gravitational effect of their mass distribution and theboundary conditions they place on ocean circulation on the
rotating earth. In our model, we can account for only one of
these effects: continents occupy space that would otherwise
be covered by ocean. To incorporate this into the model, let
fðhÞbe the fraction of the circle at colatitude hthat is cov-
ered by ocean, the rest being dry land. Heretofore, we have
been taking f¼1 for colatitudes between HandH0, but now
we allow a less trivial function fðhÞ. In any case, His ﬁxed

Again, the second term in the square brackets is the average

To get some idea of how this change affects our results, con-
sider the simplest possibility: a constant f. The explicit factors
offin the expressions for UsandzsðhÞare then cancelled by
the factor fin the expression for A, so the new analytical results
are in fact identical to the old ones. The numerical results
dochange, however, because H0changes. In the extreme case
w h e r ew et a k e fðhÞto be constant all the way to the pole at
H0¼180/C14, we ﬁnd that the changes due to accounting for con-
tinents are quite modest: melting 1000 Gt of ice from
Greenland would cause a drop in sea level of 4.43 mm at the
near shore and a rise of 3.23 mm far away, compared to4.26 mm and 3.30 mm with f¼1; for Antarctica, there would
be a rise of 0.44 mm at the near shore and 3.14 mm far away,
compared to 0.57 mm and 3.18 mm.
IV. MASS DISTRIBUTION OF ICE AND DISPLACED
WATER
As is so often the case, the very ingredient of our model that
makes all the calculations analytically tractable—representingthe ice sheet by a point mass—is among its most unrealistic
features. However, if we allow ourselves to use somewhatmore sophisticated mathematics than we have so far, we cancalculate numerically the sea level proﬁle due to an arbitrary
distribution of ice, at least within the leading-order approxi-
mation we have been using. With but little extra effort, wecan also calculate the additional gravitational effect of thedisplaced sea water itself. In the spirit of keeping the modelas simple as possible, we present the calculation only forthe spherical-earth model—it is actually more difﬁcult forthe ﬂat earth—and only for azimuthally symmetric ice
distributions.
We begin with the usual steps. The appropriate generaliza-
tion of Eqs. (1)and(12)is
UðR
Eþz;hÞ¼gzþdUðREþz;hÞ; (21)
where dUis the contribution to the gravitational potential
from the ice and displaced sea water. As in our earlier calcu-lations, both the sea surface height z
sand the constant gravi-
tational potential Uson the sea surface are small of order l,
so we can approximate dUatREþzsto four- or ﬁve-digit
precision by its value at RE. This gives us
zsðhÞ¼/C0dUðRE;hÞ
gþUs
g; (22)
which we can then substitute into Eq. (14)to determine Us—
once we have determined dUðRE;hÞ.
In principle, we could calculate dUby integrating over the
distributions of ice and displaced sea water. In the integrals,the vertical coordinate for the displaced sea water runs from0t o z
sðhÞ, and for the ice it runs to hðhÞ, the depth of ice at
colatitude h. We already know that zsgets no larger than a
few dozen meters. The average ice depth M=pR2qi, with
qi¼917 kg/m3being the density of ice, is only 1–2 km for
both Antarctica and Greenland. Thus, to perhaps three-digitprecision, we can approximate the mass distributions asbeing two-dimensional, with surface densities q
ihðhÞfor the
ice and qswzsðhÞfor the displaced sea water. Here, qswis the
density of sea water, which ranges from about 1020 to1030 kg/m3, depending on salinity.
With this approximation, we can evaluate dUby solving
the Poisson equation that it satisﬁes
r2dUðr;hÞ¼4pGqihðhÞþqswzsðhÞ ½/C138 dðr/C0REÞ:(23)
The calculation is standard: we write the general solutions for
r<REand r>REas expansions in Legendre polynomials
P‘ðcoshÞand then evaluate the coefﬁcients by matching at
r¼RE.20Away from r¼RE, the right side of the equation is
zero, so dUis a solution of the Laplace equation r2dU¼0.
The general solution of the Laplace equation is a linear combi-
nation of r‘P‘ðcoshÞand r/C0ð‘þ1ÞP‘ðcoshÞfor non-negative
integers ‘.20To prevent the solution blowing up, the coefﬁcients
of the negative powers of rin the interior solution and the posi-
tive powers in the exterior solution must be zero, so we have

r¼RE, the potential must be continuous, so we immediately
ﬁndW‘¼U‘for all ‘. The r-derivative of dU, however,
must have a discontinuity of 4 pG½qihðhÞþqswzðhÞ/C138at
r¼RE, as we can see by integrating Eq. (23)at ﬁxed hfrom
just below r¼REto just above (or, equivalently, by con-

applying the divergence theorem). Imposing this condition

If we know the coefﬁcients h‘in the Legendre polynomial

As before, we can evaluate Usby substituting this result into
Eq.(14) and carrying out the integrations. The indeﬁnite

for‘/C211 (the left side for ‘¼0 being trivially equal to
/C0P1). Substituting the resulting expression for Usinto Eq.
(29) yields a result that is somewhat cumbersome, so we do
not reproduce it here.
Again, we will interpret Mas a change in the mass of the
ice sheet and zsas the resulting sea level change. Unlike in
our previous calculations, in which we modeled the ice sheetas a point mass, here the ﬁngerprint of sea level change will
depend not only on the total mass change Mbut also on
the proﬁle hðhÞof that change. The point-mass model from
Sec. IIIrepresents a loss coming only from the center of the
continent. In addition to this, we will carry out calculations
for four proﬁles hðhÞfor which the expansion coefﬁcientsh
‘can be written down analytically, namely, hðhÞ/ð cosh
/C0cosHÞnwith n¼1;1=2;0 (a uniform loss), and /C01=2.
These four proﬁles are plotted in Fig. 3with the proportion-
ality constants chosen so that each represents a loss of 1000Gt of ice in total. Lowering the power ndecreases the
amount of loss coming from the interior of the continent andincreases the amount lost from near the margin. Since much
of the ice loss from Antarctica in recent decades has come
from near the edges of the ice sheet, the n¼/C01=2 function,
of the four, most closely resembles the actual ice loss proﬁle,while the positive- nfunctions would be better caricatures of
the existing ice sheet.
22
Figure 4shows the calculated change in local sea level for
a 1000-Gt loss of ice with parameter values relevant forAntarctica for these ﬁve proﬁles of ice loss. The topmostcurve, showing the weakest gravitational effect, is for theoriginal point-mass distribution, corrected for the effect ofdisplaced sea water. The other four, in order from top tobottom, are for hðhÞproportional to ðcosh/C0cosHÞ
nwith
n¼1;1=2;0;and/C01=2. For all but the ﬁrst and last, the
series in Eq. (29) are evaluated using the Clenshaw recur-
rence relation.23For the point-mass and n¼/C01=2 proﬁles,
the ice contributions to zsðhÞare calculated analytically, and
the seawater corrections are evaluated as the differencebetween the series and the same series with c
swset to zero.
In all cases, the maximum ‘in the sums is 512; halving this
changes none of the results by as much as 0.1%.
The change of sea level near the shore depends strongly
on the proﬁle of ice loss. In fact, for Antarctica (unlikeGreenland), whether sea level rises or falls at the shoredepends on where the ice melts from. Proﬁles hðhÞwith
more ice loss coming from nearer the shore lead to greaterlowering of sea level near the shore. It is in fact mathemati-
cally possible to make the calculated sea level drop at
the shore of the continent as large as we wish by making ajudicious choice of loss proﬁle. For hðhÞproportional

the proﬁles are proportional to ðcosh/C0cosHÞn, with n¼1 (dashed red
curve), 1/2 (dotted blue), 0 (solid green), and /C01=2 (dashed-dotted
magenta). The proportionality constants are chosen so that each represents a
total ice loss of 1000 Gt.

loss—neglecting the ampliﬁcation due to sea water
displacement—can be calculated analytically. The resultcomes out in terms of an elliptic integral and diverges (loga-
rithmically) for h!h
0. Thus, by choosing h0close enough
toH, we can make the calculated sea level drop at the shore
arbitrarily large. Clearly, ice loss near the margin of the con-
tinent has a crucial effect on sea level just off the shore, and,
consequently, realistic quantitative predictions of sea levelchange near the shore require accurate knowledge of theactual loss proﬁle.
Beyond the range plotted in Fig. 4, all ﬁve curves reach
the global-mean sea level change, þ2.76 mm, in the vicinity
ofh¼60
/C14. The curves cross each other, as they must if the
global-mean sea level change is to be the same for all of
them. However, they remain quite close after that: the values
for all ﬁve at h¼H0are within 1% of þ3.34 mm. Thus,
local sea level change farfrom the continent depends mostly
on the total amount of ice loss but is not very sensitive to the
lossproﬁle .
Figure 5shows the contribution made by displaced sea
water to the change in local sea level plotted in Fig. 4, found
by subtracting the ice contribution (calculated by setting
csw¼0) from the total. Results for all ﬁve ice proﬁles are
shown, but they are too close together for the differences to
be visible. This is because the ﬁve sea level ﬁngerprints
shown in Fig. 4actually differ very little, except quite close
to the shore of the continent. As expected, the gravitation of
the displaced water ampliﬁes the effect of the gravitation of
the ice, accounting for roughly 5%–15% of the total sea levelchange.
V. DISCUSSION
As we have seen, the gravitation of a major ice sheet has
effects on sea level that are spatially heterogeneous and some-times counterintuitive. Melting some of the ice from the sheet
and letting the melt water run off into the ocean will raise
global-mean sea level, but there is a nontrivial “ﬁngerprint” oflocal sea level change because the loss of ice mass weakens the
gravitational attraction of the ice sheet. In particular, sea level
near the edge of the sheet may well drop.We have presented models to illustrate this effect that are
suitable for undergraduate courses, and some perhaps simpleenough for introductory courses; the more sophisticated ones
in Sec. IVmake for a nice non-electromagnetic application
of the Poisson equation, potentially useful in any course thatcovers expansions in Legendre polynomials. The simplermodels, which treat the ice sheet as a point mass, are capableof giving order-of-magnitude results, and even give ratherrobust numerical results sufﬁciently far from the ice sheet.
On the other hand, they seriously underestimate the effect of
ice-sheet gravitation near the shore of the ice-bearing conti-nent; as the models with less-trivial distributions of ice masssuggest, the quantitative effect near the shore is quite sensi-tive to where on the continent the ice melts from. For a conti-
nent the size of Antarctica, for example, the simplest model
has sea level rising near the shore when ice melts, while the
more sophisticated model can have it rising or falling,depending on the spatial proﬁle of the ice loss. Clearly, care-ful modeling of the distribution of ice loss is needed if reli-able predictions of sea level change near the continent are tobe made.
Since melting ice from different sites results in different
ﬁngerprints of sea level change, it follows that at any particu-
lar location of interest—say, a coastal city, where under-
standing the prospects for local sea level change is a matterof immense practical importance—sea level is affected dif-ferently by ice melt from different sites. Sea level change atsuch a location due to ice melt is then a convolution of theactual proﬁle of ice loss around the globe with a kernel thatquantiﬁes how strongly each loss site affects sea level at the
target location. Such kernels have been calculated using
models that incorporate the gravitational, rotational, anddeformational effects of melting ice and returning the meltwater to the ocean.
24,25General features of the results tally
with those of the highly simpliﬁed calculations, of the gravi-tational effect only, that we have presented here. Melting
sites far from the location of interest have an effect on sea
level there that is large—typically greater than its contribu-tion to global-mean sea level—but not very sensitive to theprecise position of the melting site. Contributions from lessFig. 4. Sea level change at colatitude hfor a 1000-Gt loss of ice with param-
eters relevant to Antarctica. The topmost (solid black) curve is when all loss
is from the center of the continent; the others are for proﬁles of ice loss pro-
portional to ðcosh/C0cosHÞn, with n¼1 (dashed red), 1/2 (dotted blue), 0
(solid green), and /C01=2 (dashed-dotted magenta), from highest to lowest.Fig. 5. Contribution to the sea level ﬁngerprints of Fig. 4speciﬁcally due to

curves, for the ﬁve ice loss proﬁles, are indistinguishable on the scale of theﬁgure.

remote sites are smaller, but more sensitive to the position of
the site. Melting from sites that are sufﬁciently close to thelocation of interest can make negative contributions, lower-ing sea level locally despite raising it globally.
