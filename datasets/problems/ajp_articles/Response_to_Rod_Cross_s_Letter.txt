I once read that a theoretical physicist is someone who
will approximate a four-legged table as one with either oneor two legs to simplify the problem and will then concludethat it is unstable. I was reminded of that quote when I readthe paper by Rostamian et al. in this journal.
1They consid-
ered a point mass projectile bouncing up an incline, assum-ing that the projectile and the surface were both idealrather than physical objects. It is standard if not universalpractice to make simplifying assumptions when developinga physical model, but sometimes it can be taken too far. Itried the experiment using a real ball on a real surfaceand found that none of their assumptions or conclusions
were valid. The time intervals between successive bounces
were not equal, the rebound velocity was not equal for allimpacts, the angle of incidence to the normal was not equal
to the angle of reﬂection, the friction force was not negligi-
ble, the downhill path did not coincide with the uphill path,
the ball rolled rather than bounced down the incline, thespin of the ball played a major role, and the number of
uphill bounces could not be made arbitrary large. The
maximum number of uphill bounces I observed was ﬁve. Ithink that purely mathematical papers published in
The American Journal of Physics should come with a
warning that any resemblance to the real world is likely to
be coincidental.

One is never certain who, if anyone, will read an article
that one publishes. I am happy to see that Rod Cross not onlyhas read our paper but also was interested enough to performexperiments to test its conclusions. He reports that hisexperiments have failed to reproduce those conclusions. Ofcourse! The paper’s opening paragraph sets the stage bydescribing explicitly and precisely the assumptions built into
the analysis: point-mass projectile, no air resistance, noenergy loss, and no surface friction. From what Dr. Crosshas described, his equipment certainly does not meet thosecriteria. Any resemblance of his experimental observationsto what is described in that article is entirely coincidental.

Breakdown of a misinterpretation of Noether’s theorem

A recent paper by Lemos titled,1“Breakdown of the con-
nection between symmetries and conservation laws for semi-holonomic systems,” may unintentionally lead the reader tosuppose that Noether’s theorem suffers a “breakdown” in theexample of a mass that slides without friction inside a cylin-der that rolls without slipping on a horizontal plane.
In classical mechanics, Noether’s theorem
2is a restate-
ment of an insight of Lagrange that if the Lagrangian Lof a
system is invariant under coordinate q(that is, independent
ofq), then the CANONICAL (or generalized) momentum
pq¼@L=@_qis a constant of the motion (i.e., a conserved
quantity). Unfortunately, this theorem is often misinter-preted/oversimpliﬁed to mean that if the Lagrangian of asystem of total mass Mis independent of the spatial coordi-
nate x, then the total LINEAR momentum M_xis conserved.
However, the linear momentum is conserved only ifp
x¼@L=@_x¼M_x.
In the example of Lemos, the Lagrangian is independent
of the horizontal coordinate xof the center of the cylinder,
but px¼@L=@_x6¼M_x. Although pxis a constant of the
motion in this example, Lemos’s paper suggests that this is abreakdown of Noether’s theorem because p
xdoes not equal
M_x. This inference is a disservice to Lagrange and to
Noether, as a conserved momentum related to an invariance/symmetry does exist in Lemos’s example, exactly in accor-dance with Noether’s theorem.
Lemos cited Noether’s theorem in the Introduction to his
paper, and immediately afterwards wrote,
1,3“The conserva-
tion of linear momentum, angular momentum, and energyfor many-particle systems is associated with invariance ofthe action under translations, rotations, and time displace-ments, respectively.” In that context, readers might assumethat the quotation isNoether’s theorem, although it is rather
only an important special case of it. Lemos then went on toshow that this statement does nothold for his example of the
rolling cylinder, because, as is shown in his textbook,
4this
statement holds only for “proper” holonomic mechanicalsystems (as well as for ones with no constraints), but not for
semiholonomic systems or for nonholonomic systems.5
According to the narrow but popular view of the association/
connection between conservation laws and invariance statedin the above quote from Lemos’s paper, its title, “Breakdownof the connection between symmetries and conservation lawsfor semiholonomic systems,” is valid. But, the wording ofLemos’s paper may lead readers to think that Noether’s theo-rem suffers a breakdown for semiholonomic systems. Thisletter afﬁrms that the full power and validity of Noether’stheorem, for any and all systems describable by aLagrangian, is unaffected by Lemos’s result.

2See, for example, Sec. 13.7 of Ref. 1of Lemos’s paper, H. Goldstein, C. P.
Poole, Jr., and J. L. Safko, Classical Mechanics , 3rd ed. (Addison Wesley,
San Francisco, 2001). Noether wrote about “invariance” rather than
“symmetry” (mainly in the context of general relativity), although the term
symmetry is now popularly associated with her theorem.
3For systems with constraints, the term “action” (used, but not deﬁned inLemos’s paper) can be construed to mean (in the context of Lemos’s paper)
the “extended” Lagrangian Ldeﬁned in his Eq. (25), which includes the
constraints via a Lagrange multiplier.
4The only previous demonstration of this fact may be that on p. 69of Lemos’s book, Analytical Mechanics (Cambridge U. P., Cambridge,
2018).
5The terms “holonomic” and “semiholonomic” are discussed on p. 264 ofRef. 9 of Lemos’s paper, J. G. Papastavridis, Analytical Mechanics (World
Scientiﬁc, Singapore, 2014). Holonomic systems have constraints of the
form f
iqjfg ;t ðÞ . Semiholonomic systems have velocity-dependent con-
straints of the form giqj;_qj/C8/C9;t/C0/C1that can be integrated to the holonomic
form, but which include constants that depend on the initial conditions.
Hence, semiholonomic systems are a subset of holonomic ones. A distinct
subset of holonomic systems is sometimes called proper, for which con-
stants in the constraints of these holonomic subsystems are independent of
the initial conditions. The term “holonomous” ¼integral (;/C19oko1) laws
(/C23ol/C19o1) was introduced by H. Hertz in Sec. 123, p. 80 of The Principles of
Mechanics (Macmillan, New York, 1899); see also p. 91 of the original
German edition (Barth, Leipzig, 1894).

Talking ’bout misinterpretation

I’m afraid my paper1has been misunderstood by Professor
K. T. McDonald. He puts words in my mouth that I neversaid. The phrase “breakdown of Noether’s theorem” is neverto be found or suggested in my paper. Nor do I ascribe thissupposed breakdown of Noether’s theorem to the fact that p
x
does not equal M_xin my example. In the Introduction, I say
that “Noether’s theorem establishes the most general corre-spondence between invariance under continuous transforma-tions and constants of the motion.” Next, I mention thatconservation of linear momentum, angular momentum, andenergy are associated with “invariance under translations,rotations, and time displacements, respectively.” Theseresults are, obviously, particular cases of Noether’s theorembecause translations, rotations, and time displacements arenot the most general continuous transformations. In no waywhatsoever have I suggested that these particular results are
Noether’s theorem. McDonald has misread my paper.
LetL¼T/C0Vbe a standard Lagrangian, where Vdoes
not depend on velocities. When all constraints are holo-nomic, invariance of both the Lagrangian and the con-straints under translations implies conservation of the totallinear momentum, which turns out to coincide with thecorresponding total canonical momentum.
2Velocity-
dependent integrable constraints, which are said to be semi-holonomic, seem completely equivalent to holonomicconstraints because, in their integrated form, they restrictcoordinates alone. So, it came to me as a surprise that semi-holonomic constraints are not equivalent to holonomic con-straints as regards the connection between symmetries and
conservation laws. My example shows that the Lagrangian
is invariant under translations but the correspondingconserved canonical momentum is not the total linear
momentum, which is not conserved. In short, contrary to
expectations, the conserved quantity associated with trans-
lation invariance is not the total linear momentum.
According to McDonald, I misinterpret Noether’s theorem
by stating or intimating that it provides a connection between
symmetries and conservation laws only for standard
Lagrangians and holonomic systems. But this is nowhere to
be found in my paper. The connection between translation
invariance and conservation of the total linear momentum
for a holonomic system with a standard Lagrangian is a par-
ticular case of Noether’s theorem because, for transforma-
tions that leave time unchanged, the invariance of theLagrangian is equivalent to the invariance of the action.
Never do I hint that the case of standard Lagrangian and
holonomic constraints is the only instance of a connection
between symmetries and conservation laws.
Finally, McDonald incorrectly states that “semiholonomic
systems are a subset of holonomic ones.” If this were true,
one would face the contradiction of a result that holds for all
members of a set Abut does not hold for members of a sub-
set of A. It’s just the other way around, holonomic systems
are a subset of semiholonomic systems.
I ﬁnd McDonald’s criticism unwarranted because it rests
on a misinterpretation of my paper.
