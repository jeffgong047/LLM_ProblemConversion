We present an alternative derivation of the relation between temperature and volume for a
reversible, adiabatic process involving an ideal gas. The derivation for a monatomic gas starts with
the Sackur–Tetrode equation and takes only one step. We also address the extension to diatomic
gases.#2023 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

The relations between state variables (pressure P,v o l u m e V,
and temperature T) in an adiabatic process involving an ideal
gas are essential for the analysis of thermodynamic engines,
including the Carnot, Diesel, Otto, and Rankine cycles as well
as real refrigerator cycles, all of which include adiabatic com-pression or expansion strokes. Standard expressions for such
relations can be derived starting with the ﬁrst law of thermody-
namics for an adiabatic process (where the energy transferredas heat is Q¼0), which becomes dU¼d-W,o r

which upon integration between an initial state and a ﬁnal
state results in VTf/2¼constant. This calculation is pre-
sented in most thermodynamics textbooks (see Ref. 1, for
example). Using the ideal gas law to eliminate Tgives the
expression PVc¼constant, where c¼CP/CV.(CPandCV
are, respectively, the heat capacities at constant pressure and
volume, and cis often called the adiabatic constant). This
last form is particularly useful for cycle analysis in PVdia-
grams. We refer to both the V-TandP-Vrelations as the adi-
abatic equations for the ideal gas.
The initial objective of this Note is to rederive the equa-
tionVTf/2¼constant for the special case of a classical mon-
atomic ideal gas using (1) the fact that adiabatic, reversible
processes are isentropic (adiabatic, irreversible processes,
which include free expansions, are outside the scope of this
Note), and (2) the Sackur–Tetrode equation,2–7a well-
known result in statistical physics. This equation, originallyderived by Otto Sackur and Hugo Tetrode in 1911–1913,
expresses the entropy of a monatomic ideal gas in terms of
several combinations of variables. Here, we use the form

Using fact (1)above, for an isentropic compression or
expansion process of a parcel of gas in a piston, the argument
of the logarithm in the Sackur–Tetrode equation must be
constant. Substituting Eq. (4)into Eq. (3), it follows that
VT3/2must also remain constant. This is nothing other than
theV-T adiabatic equation for three degrees of freedom—
those of the monatomic ideal gas! Another version of the
Sackur–Tetrode equation is

which leads exactly to the same result since Uis proportional
toT.
The above derivation does not generate a new result.
Instead, it conﬁrms the adiabatic equation through a very dif-
ferent route from the one that students usually learn. Theroute here comes from statistical mechanics, while the usual
one is strictly thermodynamic. Such alternative derivations
strengthen the connections within, and the consistency of
thermal physics, for the beneﬁt of the students. Despite the
disparity of both methods, we remark that the power of 3 inthe Sackur–Tetrode equation is directly associated with the
three (translational) degrees of freedom of the monatomic
ideal gas.
The second, and ﬁnal purpose of this Note is to extend the
result to the more common diatomic gases. In this case, inter-
nal types of motion need to be taken into account. The mon-
atomic partition function is multiplied by that of the internaldegrees of freedom, Z
int. In the high-temperature/classical
limit, for each internal degree of freedom, Zint/C24kT/E , where
Eis some characteristic energy spacing ( /C22h2/2Ifor the rotation
of a molecule of moment of inertia Iand/C22hxfor vibration of
frequency x). Thus, the argument of the logarithm in Eq. (3)
will be multiplied by a factor kT/E for each degree of free-
dom, as shown in Ref. 1, p. 255. This bumps up the argument
of the logarithm to VT5/2andVT7/2, consistent with f¼5and
f¼7, for diatomic gases, respectively, as these types of inter-
nal motion become active. This result agrees with the expres-
sions derivable by classical thermodynamics.
