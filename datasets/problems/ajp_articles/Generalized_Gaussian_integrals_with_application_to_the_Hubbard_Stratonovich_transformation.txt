We analyze a variety of Gaussian integrals with the aim of revisiting the derivation of the
Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation as given in standard graduate-level textbooks and provide an
overview of its applications. We pinpoint problematic steps in the usual discussions and propose
careful derivations of the Hubbard–Stratonovich identity pertinent to a variety of situationsrelevant to statistical physics and quantum ﬁeld theory. These derivations are based on direct use of
either a resolution identity or a series expansion. A few homework problems for students are
suggested.

I. INTRODUCTION
Gaussian integrals are ubiquitous in the analysis of a broad
range of physical systems and are amply discussed in physicstextbooks. However, some care is necessary in their evaluation
in situations where the parameters appearing in the integrand
are not real or complex numbers, but operators or Grassmannnumbers. Such situations arise in particular when performingthe Hubbard–Stratonovich (HS) transformation,
1,2which
counts among the standard tools of theoretical many-body
physics, because it establishes c onnections between micro-
scopic statistical physics models (both quantum and classical)and effective ﬁeld theories in a controllable way. It provides aframework for treatment of a variety of systems at the mean-ﬁeld level and a systematic incorporation of ﬂuctuation effectsboth within and beyond the Gaussian approximation. Despite
its importance, we ﬁnd that a general, detailed, and careful deri-
vation of the transformation, in particular, in the operator cases,is absent in standard academic textbooks.
3–9The purpose of
this note is to provide a thorough discussion of this aspect, cov-ering a range of relevant cases.
In a statistical physics treatment of interacting models, the
Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation is devised to eliminate
an interaction term (below denoted symbolically as b2)f r o m
the partition function. Conceptually, the Hubbard–Stratonovichtransformation relies on the Gaussian integral identity

valid for Re(a)>0. For the presently discussed purposes, it
sufﬁces to consider a2Rþ.
The quantity bmay be represented by different mathemat-
ical objects (numbers, operators, Grassmann variables)depending on the particular problem under study. In the sim-plest situation, bis a real number. For this case, the identityis straightforwardly proven by completing the square of the
argument of the exponential in the integrand

which immediately allows for transforming the integrand on

The generalization to the case b2Cinvolves a contour inte-
gral in the complex plane and a simple application of the res-
idue theorem.10
The actual goal of the transformation is to eliminate the
troublesome quantity b2, which is achieved at the cost of
introducing an integration over an auxiliary variable x,t o
which the dynamical variable blinearly couples.
In numerous relevant situations, the quantity bis, how-
ever, an operator (or other non-numerical object), such that
Eq.(1)becomes

where^1is the identity operator. The exponential of an oper-
ator is deﬁned by the series expansion

In the context of many-body physics, the quantity ^B2is most
often related to two-body interactions and, for quantum
840 Am. J. Phys. 91(10), October 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 840 04 October 2023 22:58:22
systems, is quartic in creation/annihilation operators (such
that ^Bis quadratic). The identity of Eq. (4)is then used in an
inﬁnite dimensional variant as a functional integral.3–9The
beneﬁt from its application amounts to decoupling the inter-
action such that ^Bappears only in ﬁrst power. This is
achieved in full analogy to Eq. (1)at the cost of introducing
an additional integral, which for the many-body problem is
in fact a multidimensional (functional) integral. In a some-
what loose description, the Hubbard–Stratonovich transfor-
mation allows for rewriting the interacting many-body
problem as a problem of free particles propagating in an
effective external ﬁeld. All admissible conﬁgurations of this
ﬁeld must be taken into account, which is reﬂected by the
presence of the integral.
It is obvious that the simple derivation of Eq. (1)presented
above does not apply to the operator case of Eq. (4), since
after the integration variable shift, the operator ^Bwould
appear in the integration limits, which makes no sense. The
same concerns the case of problems involving fermions,where bmay correspond to a Grassmann variable.
Somewhat surprisingly, for the above operator/Grassmann
cases, we were not able to locate a careful derivation of the
HS identity in the available literature.1–9This fact may pose
an obstacle for lecturers or students in presenting or under-
standing how the HS transformation works in detail. One of
the major purposes of this note is to clarify this point.
We note here that the quantum many-body problem may
be formulated either in the more traditional operator lan-
guage or via the coherent-state path integral.3While intro-
ducing the HS transformation in the former situation one
deals with the necessity of handling operator Gaussian iden-
tities as in Eq. (4). In the latter case, the general expressions
for the partition function and the correlation functions
involve no operators but functional integrals over complex
(for bosons) or Grassmann-valued (for fermions) ﬁelds. As
examples illustrating the HS transformation in the operator
and coherent-state path integral formulations, one may con-
sider the BCS problem analyzed in the operator formalism inRef. 12and the functional integral framework in Ref. 6.
We also point out that, for the majority of quantum many-
body systems, the Hamiltonian comprises an interaction part
^H
I(corresponding to the quantity ^B2above) and a kinetic
contribution ^H0. Since these two typically do not commute,
it is not legitimate to replace e/C0bð^H0þ^HIÞbyeb^H0e/C0b^HI. (Here,
b/C01¼kBT,Tis the temperature, and kBis the Boltzmann
constant.) In evaluation of the partition function using the
operator formalism, a step is required which amounts to
splitting the interval ½0;b/C138into inﬁnitesimal slices. This step
is well described in the literature.12
II. ONE-DIMENSIONAL CASE
In this section, we present derivations of the HS identity
in the case of one-dimensional integrals over real, complex,
and Grassmann variables.
A. Derivation using a resolution of identity—Real
integration variable
The integration shift method discussed in the Introduction
can be generalized to the operator case of Eq. (4)whenever
the eigenstates of ^Bprovide a complete set of states that
allow a resolution of identity^1¼Xbjbihbj; (6)
where fjbigconstitutes the set of eigenstates of ^B,
^Bjbi¼bjbi: (7)
This is, in particular, the case for ^Brepresenting a Hermitian
operator (i.e., ^B†¼^B). Equation (6)encompasses both the
cases of continuous and discrete spectrum of ^B, utilizing the
symbol Xb. The mathematical nature of the eigenvalues { b}
is not relevant here. Whenever Eq. (6)holds, one may gener-
alize the integration shift method to the operator case repre-sented in Eq. (4). Indeed, inserting Eq. (6)into the right hand
side of Eq. (4), we obtain

/C01e/C0ða=2Þx2þbxdx (9)
¼Xbjbihbjeb2=2a¼e^B2=2aXbjbihbj (10)
¼e^B2=2a: (11)
Between lines (8)and(9)and(10) and(11), we used the
eigenequation (7)to replace the operator ^Bby its eigenvalue
band vice-versa. In lines (9)and (10), we computed the
Gaussian integral by the shift transformation in the integra-tion variable as in the example from the Introduction. Such a
proof of the HS identity was discussed in Ref. 11, where the
eigenbasis of the particle number operator for bosons wasused explicitly.
The proof presented above uses the resolution of identity
in terms of eigenstates of ^Band is, therefore, restricted to a
certain class of operators ^B(including Hermitian operators).
This does not exhaust the range of physically interestingcases. In particular, in certain situations, one needs to apply
the HS transformation to treat an operator exp ½/C0^B
†^B=ð2aÞ/C138,
where ^Bis not Hermitian ( ^B6¼^B†). As an example, we
invoke the superconductivity problem where ^B¼^w"^w#rep-
resents an annihilation operator of a Copper pair made of
two fermions.12A construction of a generalized, overcom-
plete coherent state base for the Cooper pair operator wouldbe necessary in this case.
B. Derivation using a series expansion— Real integration
variable
In what follows, we demonstrate the HS identity (4)with-
out making any reference to the resolution of identity (6)and
the eigenstates (7)of the operator ^B. For this purpose, we
expand the right hand side of Eq. (4)in the Taylor series

and integrate the result term by term (for each n). Above and
hereafter, we omit the symbol^1to simplify notation. Above
we also used the fact that e^Aþ^B¼e^Ae^Bfor commuting oper-
ators ^Aand ^B. Terms involving odd nin Eq. (13) vanish
since the corresponding integrand is an antisymmetric func-
tion. For even n¼2m, we substitute t¼ða=2Þx2and obtain

forward calculation leads to

which is the left hand side of the identity (4).
The above reasoning constitutes a general proof of the iden-
tity of Eq. (4)invoking no restrictions whatsoever on the opera-
tor ^B. As a matter of fact, surveying the literature we found
that such a proof was described “in words” for the Cooper pair
operators in Ref. 14; however, no details were published.
C. Derivation using a series expansion— Complex
integration variable
In this subsection, by means of the power series expansion
method, we demonstrate the complex variant of the operator
Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation. Namely, we showthat
e^B†^B=a¼eð^B†^Bþ^B^B†Þ=2a¼a

provided that ½^B;^B†/C138¼0, which, in particular, holds true if
^Bis Hermitian. The symbol z¼xþiy, with x;y2R, repre-
sents a complex variable, z/C3its complex conjugation, and
dz/C3dz¼2idxdy . We consider the right-hand side of Eq. (17)
and compute

/C01dy e/C0ay2þiyð^B†/C0^BÞ:(21)
Between lines (20) and (21), we used the assumption that
½^B;^B†/C138¼0. Each of the one-dimensional integrals can now
be evaluated using the power-series expansion discussed in
the real variable case, which leads to the result^R¼eð^B†þ^BÞ2=4ae/C0ð^B†/C0^BÞ2=4a¼e^B†^B=a; (22)
that demonstrates Eq. (17).
For an arbitrary operator ^B, the HS identity with complex
integration variable would have the form
e^B2=a¼a
2pið
dz/C3dz e/C0z/C3azþ^Bðz/C3þzÞ; (23)
which can be directly proven as in the real variable case.
D. Derivation using a series expansion— Grassmann
integration variable
The above analysis is naturally generalized to Grassmann
variable integrals, pertinent, for example, in extensions ofdynamical mean-ﬁeld theory for interacting Fermi systemsvia the dual fermion approach.
15In the simplest case, the
integral in question takes the form
eð^B†^B/C0^B^B†Þ=2a¼1
að
dg/C3ð
dge/C0g/C3agþ^B†gþg/C3^B; (24)
where ^Bis an operator such that ^B2¼ð ^B†Þ2¼0 while gand
g/C3are Grassmann (anticommuting) variables. In particular,
gg/C3¼/C0g/C3g and g2¼ðg/C3Þ2¼0. Integration over
Grassmann variables is deﬁned symbolically byÐdg1
¼Ðdg/C31¼0 andÐdgg¼Ðdg/C3g/C3¼1, and the notion of
integration limits is meaningless. Any function of
Grassmann variables is formally deﬁned in terms of a powerexpansion series. Indeed, expanding the right-hand side ofEq.(24), we ﬁnd the exact representation of the integrals

2að^B†^B/C0^B^B†Þ/C20/C21
(27)
¼eð^B†^B/C0^B^B†Þ=2a; (28)
where the term 1 =2ð^B†gg/C3^Bþg/C3^B^B†gÞin Eq. (26) arises
from the quadratic power contribution and any higher
powers of gorg/C3vanish. In the last line, we utilized the
property that ^B2¼ð ^B†Þ2¼0. The exponential representa-
tion of Eq. (27) completes the proof of the HS identity (24).
As a matter of fact, since Grassmann variable analysis isbased directly on the power series expansions, the proof ofthe HS identity for the operator ^Bis indeed simple in com-
parison to real or complex variable integrals. Note that if we
replace the operators ^Band ^B
†by the Grassmann variables b
andb/C3, respectively, then the HS identity (24) reduces to the
well-known Gaussian integral,3i.e.,
eb/C3b=a¼1

which in the functional integral case is used in the dual-
fermion method for correlated lattice fermions.15
Finally, we observe that for fermionic operators which ful-
ﬁll the anticommuting rule ^B^B†þ^B†^B¼1 together with
^B2¼ð ^B†Þ2¼0, the HS identity reads
e^B†^B=a¼e1=2a

III. MULTIDIMENSIONAL CASES
We ﬁnally discuss the multidimensional cases, which
from the conceptual point of view does not bring in manynew elements. However, it is worthwhile to discuss them for
completeness of the paper and convenience of the reader.
A. Multidimensional real variables Gaussian integral

where xandbare real n-dimensional “column” vectors, xTand
bTtheir transpose (i.e., “row” counterparts), and Adenotes an
n/C2nsymmetric matrix, assumed positive deﬁnite (i.e., featur-
ing only positive eigenvalues). For n¼1, we immediately
recover Eq. (1). Whenever it makes sense (i.e., for brepresent-
ing vectors of numbers), one may prove Eq. (31)by implement-
ing the variable shift method. By subs tituting
x¼A/C01bþy; (32)
we obtain
ð
dnxe/C0ð1=2ÞxTAxþbTx¼eð1=2ÞbTA/C01bð

(33)
The remaining standard Gaussian integral is evaluated by
noting that a real symmetric matrix Acan be diagonalized
with an orthonormal transformation (rotation) O,s u c h

where diare the corresponding eigenvalues. The remaining
integral factorizes and is evaluated using Eq. (1). Noting that

Using the resolution identity
Xjb1;…;bnihb1;…;bnj¼^1; (38)
the proof of the HS identity (36) is straightforward since we
can write

¼Xjb1;…;bnihb1;…;bnjð
dnxe/C0ð1=2ÞxTAxþbTx
(39)
and proceed as in the multidimensional Gaussian integral
case discussed above. We observe that the property of van-
ishing commutators is not emphasized in the literature, e.g.,
Ref. 3, p. 333, but seems to be necessary in the derivation.
C. Proof using a series expansion— Real integration
variables
For completeness, we present a detailed derivation of the
HS identity in the case of real variables. We start from theGaussian integral with an operator valued linear term

The n-dimensional Gaussian integral (40) factorizes, owing

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER PROBLEMS
FOR STUDENTS
In this paper, we have discussed in detail two methods of
deriving the HS identities. When the HS identity contains a
non-number term, like Grassmann variable or an operator, a
standard derivation adopting a shift of the integration vari-able is confusing and formally incorrect. The problem occurs
because the integral limits would be shifted by a non-number
terms making such integral ill-deﬁned.
To solve the problem, one can apply the resolution of
identity if the operator-valued term makes it possible, as we
discussed here. The other method uses a series expansion of
the exponential function of an operator valued term, integrat-ing term-by-term, and resumming back to the exponential
function. To our knowledge, this method is discussed here
for the ﬁrst time in detail. Although we have not presented acomplete rigorous proof, the derivation here should satisfy
teachers and students accustomed to standard mathematical
methods that are accepted in theoretical physics.Since the HS identity is commonly used in quantum
many-body mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory, or in statistical
physics of phase transitions, we hope that our detailed dis-
cussion will be incorporated into corresponding lectures andtutorial classes.
As homework problems for students, we suggest deriving
HS identities using a series expansion in the following cases:
(1) Multidimensional complex variable Gaussian integral.
(2) Multidimensional Grassmann variable Gaussian integral.
(3) Inﬁnite dimensional real variable Gaussian integral.
(4) Inﬁnite dimensional complex variable Gaussian integral.(5) Inﬁnite dimensional Grassmann variable Gaussian
integral.
In problems (1)and(2), all necessary ingredients are pro-
vided in our paper. The derivations seem to be straightfor-ward exercises in linear algebra of complex and Grassmann
variables. Problems (3)–(5) are more conceptually involved
since they deal with functional integrals. Students shouldunderstand the concept of functional integrals and know that
in practice one has to consider discrete versions of them and
after carrying out multidimensional Gaussian integrals theprocedure of taking an inﬁnite limit is performed. These
steps are discussed in Ref. 3in detail. The proposed prob-
lems might provide an excellent illustration after the func-tional integrals are introduced during a lecture.

we invoke the solution of the anharmonic fermionic oscilla-
tor

sentation17and the HS transformation implemented in a
mathematically correct way. The anharmonic fermionic oscil-
lator is represented by the Hubbard Hamiltonian in the atomiclimit

where r2f " ;#grepresents the possible spin projections for
spin 1/2 fermions, /C15is the single particle (atomic) energy,
and U>0 is the interaction energy, when two fermions
occupy the same atomic orbital. In the atomic limit, there isno coupling between different orbitals. The quantity ^n
rrep-
resents the fermionic number operators with eigenvalues
nr¼0 or 1 depending on whether the orbital is unoccupied
or occupied, respectively.

partition function is easily computed using the above basis,yielding the result

starting from the functional integral representation of the
partition function and implementing the HS transformation.
The model is very simple and, as shown above, its solution isstraightforward. Our present aim is to pinpoint the variableshift issue discussed in the body of the paper. This is also
pertinent to other interacting many-body systems, which can-
not be handled exactly.
Using the creation/annihilation operators and the fermi-
onic anticommutation relations, the Hamiltonian of Eq. (A1)
is written as

Planck constant /C22h¼1 and explicit sdependence is omitted
for convenience. The fully precise meaning of Eqs. (A5) and
(A6) is explained in Ref. 3. The functional integral is not
Gaussian due to the anharmonic quartic term involving theinteraction U. However, it turns out that by linearizing this
quartic term by a direct employment of the HS transforma-
tion, all functional integrals can be performed yielding theprevious result for the partition function.

The spinors obey antiperiodic boundary conditions, i.e.,

term is quadratic on the right hand side but coupled linearly
to the real auxiliary ﬁeld /ðsÞ. This Hubbard–Stratonivich
ﬁeld obeys periodic boundary conditions /ðsþbÞ¼/ðsÞ.
In order to demonstrate the above identity, we ﬁrst analyze
the denominator. We Fourier-expand the auxiliary ﬁeld

where J¼jDetð@/ðsÞ=@/nÞjis the Jacobian of the Fourier
transformation. One does not need to bother if the expression
is ﬁnite, since it will cancel with an analogous term in thenumerator of Eq. (A9) .
To compute the numerator of Eq. (A9) one might, follow-
ing the standard text books,1–9try to perform a shift of varia-
bles ~/ðsÞ¼/ðsÞ/C0aðsÞ=Uand ﬁnd Gaussian integrals
directly. However, each of the Fourier mode integrals is

where anare Fourier components of aðsÞ¼iU/C22ggmade of
two Grassmann variables. To avoid an embarrassing situa-tion that we do not know how to perform that integration and
necessity of using non-rigorous hand waving arguments, we
propose to use our method discussed in Sec. II Cin this arti-
cle. Namely, perform a Fourier decomposition as in the case
of the denominator, i.e.,

The Fourier decomposition of aðsÞ¼ð 1=bÞP

xn¼2nðp=bÞeven (bosonic) Matsubara frequencies, because
the ﬁeld aðsÞcontains two anti-periodic Grassmann func-
tions.19In the next step, we need to Taylor expand terms with
an(not numbers!) and perform term by term real Gaussian inte-
grals. Using directly techniques from Sec. II Bafter a series

ressumation, we obtain the HS identity (A9). Note that undeter-
mined Jacobian Jin the nominator and denominator as well as
undetermined inﬁnite products are canceled out.
After applying the HS transformation, the partition func-
tion reads

Grassmann functions is now Gaussian and is performed
analytically.3,17
We refrain from discussing the subsequent steps leading to
the result of Eq. (A3) via the functional integral method,
which are well described in the literature (and somewhattedious). They involve performing the Gaussian functionalintegral over the Grassmann ﬁelds fg
/C3
r;grg(which is done in
full analogy to non-interacting Fermi systems) evaluating asummation over the Matsubara frequencies, and Gaussianintegration over the /ﬁeld.
20–22The major purpose of this
Appendix is to point out that the subtlety related to perform-
ing the integration variable shift in the Hubbard–Stratonovichprocedure, as discussed in the main body of the presentpaper, is also pertinent to the coherent-state path-integral forFermi systems. We have used the present exactly solublemodel
18for illustration; however, the discussed issue is
generically pertinent to interacting Fermi systems, such asBCS problem of superconductors, often discussed in terms ofpath-integrals.
