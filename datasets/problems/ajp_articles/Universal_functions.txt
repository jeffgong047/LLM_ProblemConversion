A pendulum, no matter the gravitational strength ( g) or the
length of the string ( l), ﬁnds its north star in the dimension-
less oscillation period: T=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
l=gp
is always 2 p. In understand-
ing this statement, students seem to pass through similar
stages as I did. First, I didn’t even understand the claim.
Second, I understood it only symbolically, as I would on
hearing that my child was running a fever of 40/C14C: “Yes,
and?” Third and ﬁnally, I felt its force, as I would on hearing
that the fever was 104/C14F: “Oh, damn, that’s dangerous!” I
became amazed that I could swing my key chain from a
string, measure the period, compute T=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
l=gp
, and get a num-
ber valid for pendula everywhere and of all lengths.
This lengthy process of understanding happened for a
dimensionless constant, a zero-parameter universal or
dimensionless function. Still harder to grasp is the next-
simplest kind of universal function, a one-parameter dimen-
sionless function. A famous example, featured in many
treatments of dimensional analysis, is Taylor’s analysis of
the Trinity atomic-bomb test.1
A less warlike example hides among the motion of the
planets. Take the orbital data in Table Ithat include perihe-
lion ( rmin) and aphelion ( rmax) distances. The data could
serve for a course that I’ve long wanted to teach: “Patterns in
nature as seen in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics .” If the mask …2… lifts, I might even teach such a
course in person. Each lecture would begin with CRC data
on one topic—perhaps the boiling points of long-chainhydrocarbons, the temperature versus height in the atmo-
sphere, or the thermal conductivity of several materials—
and explain the trends qualitatively and quantitatively,
approximating as needed.
In these orbital data, Vis the planet’s effective potential:
its effective potential energy, U
eff, divided by its mass, m.
Ueffitself is most evident in the total energy written in polar
coordinates:E¼1

If the orbital data are plotted with Von the vertical axis
and distances ( rminandrmax) on the horizontal axis, the result
is a mess with no interesting pattern (Fig. 1). Sure, the outer
planets are nearer the horizontal axis than are the inner plan-
ets, and all the points lie near a curve that might beV//C01=r. But this pattern arises from the form of the gravi-
tational potential energy, /C0GMm =r, so it’s not news.
But let’s replot the data in dimensionless form. To rescale
the horizontal axis, we need a length scale. The best scale is
r
0/C172rminrmax
rminþrmax; (3)
the harmonic mean of rminandrmax. (We’ll return to why we
should form that particular length.) The rescaled horizontalaxis is then /C22r/C17r=r
0.
For rescaling the vertical axis, we need a speciﬁc energy
(energy per mass). A quantity with these dimensions andbased on the chosen length scale is GM =r
0. Thus, the
rescaled vertical axis will be /C22V/C17V=ðGM =r0Þ.
The resulting dimensionless plot (Fig. 2) is cleaner than the
preceding unscaled graph. The data now lie on the decent curve
Table I. Orbital data for the planets. Vis the effective potential: the effective
potential energy, Ueff, divided by the planet’s mass. rminandrmaxare the
perihelion and aphelion distances, respectively.

Fig. 1. Orbital data from Table I. Each planet gets one point for rminand
another for rmax. Both points lie on a horizontal line due to conservation of
energy. For at the extremes of the orbit, _r¼0. So, from Eq. (1),E¼Ueff,
meaning that Ueff, and thus V, cannot vary from one point to the other. (For
the Earth and Venus, the inner planets with nearly circular orbits, the two
dots almost blend because of the huge distance range on the raxis.)

As promised, let’s return to the choice of length scale:
Why is the harmonic mean, r0, the correct length scale?
Other natural length scales include the semi-major axis, a,
and the semi-minor axis, b; see Fig. 3, taken with minor
changes from my column on zeroth powers.3
One reason not to choose the semi-major axis as the length
scale is that the resulting plot is tooregular. The total energy
in a Newtonian-gravitational or Kepler orbit turns out to be
E¼/C0GMm
2a: (5)
At the orbital extremes (where _r¼0), Eq. (1)shows us that
E¼Ueff. Then,
V/C17Ueff
m¼E
m¼/C0GM
2a: (6)
Thus, at the extremes, any planet has V=ðGM =aÞ¼/C0 1=2,
placing all the data on one horizontal line (with this choiceof length scale).
Meanwhile, the semi-minor axis and indeed all length
scales except r
0are disfavored for a physical reason. The
orbital energy, Eq. (1), depends on rand _h. In using energy
conservation to ﬁnd the orbital shape, we would get a two-variable differential equation (from dE=dt¼0), far more
than twice as difﬁcult as a single-variable differential equa-
tion. Fortunately, the energy’s joker term, mr
2_h2=2, which
ropes in the second variable, can be rewritten using the otherconserved quantity in a Kepler orbit, the angular momentum
L/C17mr
2_h: (7)
Thus,
1
2mr2_h2¼L2
2mr2(8)
and voil /C18a: The _hhas gone, making the effective potential a func-
tion now only of r(and ostensibly of L, but it’s a constant).V¼ðL=mÞ2
2r2/C0GM
r: (9)
This rewriting helps us because r0, unlike other length
scales, is a function just of L(and physical constants). In a
Kepler orbit, it turns out that
r0¼ðL=mÞ2
GM: (10)
If we wisely choose r0as our length scale, the dimensionless
plot in Fig. 2becomes an analog computer that implicitly
incorporates the conservation of angular momentum.
Let’s put the plot and the curve Eq. (4)to a moderate test
by using an orbital extreme case—Halley’s comet.4Here are
its orbital data:
rmin¼8:7874/C21010m;
rmax¼5:2378/C21012m;
V¼/C02:4926/C2107m2s/C02:(11)
Do its two points lie on the dimensionless curve of Eq. (4)?
Numerically,
rmin
r0¼0:508 388 ;rmax
r0¼30:303 030 : (12)
For /C22r¼rmax=r0, Eq. (4)predicts
/C22V¼1
2/C1ð30:303 0302Þ/C01
30:303 030¼/C00:032 454
(13)
and the /C22Vcalculated from Eq. (11) is almost identical,
/C00.032 456. (The reader is invited to conﬁrm that the closest
approach, where /C22r¼0:508 388, also works.) In Newtonian
gravity, any planet orbiting around any sun is described byone universal function.
Having passed through the stages of understanding a zero-
parameter universal function and having thought for a while
about the orbital one-parameter function, I feel myself near-ing the ﬁnal, third stage of understanding and my amazementgrowing.
