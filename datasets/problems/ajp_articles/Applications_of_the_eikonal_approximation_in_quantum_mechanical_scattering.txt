Scattering is an important component of any quantum mechanics course. However, the scattering
amplitude in the case of a general potential is often calculated using the simple Bornapproximation, which does not embed general properties such as unitarity or analyticity. We show
that a relatively simple extension, the eikonal approximation, offers a signiﬁcant improvement and
demonstrate this in the case of the electromagnetic and gravitational interactions.

I. INTRODUCTION
A section on scattering is an important component of any
quantum mechanics course, whether at the undergraduate or
graduate level. By examining the asymptotic behavior of
scattering solutions to the Schr €odinger equation wðþÞ
kiðrÞfor a
particle of mass minteracting with the potential V, one
extracts the scattering amplitude as1
fðkf;kiÞ¼/C0m
2ph/kfj^VjwðþÞ
kii; (1)
whose square is the differential scattering cross section
dr
dX¼jfðkf;kiÞj2: (2)
An exact solution is not generally possible, so one often uses
the simple Born approximation, wherein the scattering solu-
tionjwðþÞ
kiiis replaced by a plane wave j/kii, i.e.,
fBornðkf;kiÞ¼/C0m
2ph/kfj^Vj/kii: (3)
Since the Born amplitude in the case of an isotropic interac-
tion VðjrjÞ, such as the familiar Coulomb or Newtonian
potential, is simply a real number, it does not manifest gen-
eral properties such as the optical theorem and analytic
behavior that are required of the full scattering amplitude.
However, by making a modiﬁcation to the plane wavepicture—the eikonal approximation—one can generate an
improved scattering amplitude that does satisfy some of the
desired properties. Here, “eikonal” is the German form of
the Greek word /C15ijxv, meaning likeness or image. Although
well-known and studied in the research literature,2the eiko-
nal technique is not generally discussed in the standard quan-
tum mechanics texts. Exceptions are those by Schiff,3by
Landau and Lifshitz,4and by Sakurai and Napolitano,5but
even here, although the method is presented, applications are
generally thin. The purpose of this article is to provide a fewsuch applications.
In Sec. IIthen, after a brief review of scattering, we derive
the eikonal form of the scattering amplitude using methods
due to Schiff.3In Sec. III, we show how eikonal methods can
be used to study the electromagnetic interaction, while in
Sec. IV, we consider the case of gravity. Possible extensions
are discussed in Sec. V, followed by a brief concluding
section.II. THE EIKONAL APPROXIMATION
A discussion of scattering involves determination of the
scattering solution to the Schr €odinger equation jwðþÞ
kiiwhich,
for a system of mass mand potential ^Vobeys the equation4
ð^H0þ^VÞjwðþÞ
kii¼EijwðþÞ
kii; (4)
where ^H0¼^p2=2mis the free Hamiltonian and Ei¼k2
i=2m
is the incident energy. Note that we employ units wherein /C22h
andcare both set equal to unity. A formal solution to Eq. (4)
is provided by the integral equation
jwðþÞ
kii¼j/kiiþ1
Ei/C0^H0þi/C15^VjwðþÞ
kii; (5)
where j/kiiis a solution of the free Schr €odinger equation
^H0j/kii¼Eij/kii: (6)
Then hrjwðþÞ
kii/C17wðþÞðrÞhas the asymptotic form as

and an exact solution for the scattering amplitude fðkf;kiÞis

Generally, one cannot determine an exact solution for the
scattering amplitude and must be content with an approxi-
mate form. A common approach is to use the Born approxi-
mation, obtained by replacing the scattering solution in Eq.(9)by its leading order (plane wave) contribution,

amplitude in the case of an isotropic potential VðjrjÞis a real
number and, hence, cannot satisfy the optical theorem

so that unitarity is satisﬁed, at least perturbatively. However,
even with this correction, the scattering amplitude does notsatisfy the analyticity requirement that, under the continua-
tion k
i!ijand eikir!e/C0jr;fðkf;kiÞhas a pole at the
bound state energy EB¼/C0j2=2m.6The existence of a bound
state requiresÐ
d3rjwðrÞj2to be ﬁnite, so that the wavefunc-
tion decreases rapidly as jrjincreases and must vanish at
inﬁnity. Achieving this condition requires an approach
involving inclusion of the potential to all orders; a perturba-
tive calculation of the scattering amplitude cannot satisfy
this stricture.
An improvement to the perturbative approach is the use of
the eikonal approximation,

where vi¼ki=mis the incident velocity, which has a semi-
classical interpretation in terms of a particle moving as a
plane wave but with an evolving phase on account of interac-
tion with the potential.
A nice derivation of this result is that of Schiff,3who
begins by writing the scattering wavefunction in exponential
form as wðþÞðrÞ¼exp½i=/C22hSðrÞ/C138, with
1
2m$S/C1$S/C0i/C22h$2S ðÞ þV¼Ei; (16)
and we have temporarily included the explicit /C22hdependence.
Readers will recognize this exponential representation of the
wavefunction to be similar to that used the derivation of theone dimensional WKB approximation
1,5and indeed the eiko-
nal method represents its three-dimensional counterpart. The
use of three-dimensional WKB and the eikonal to study the
near-forward component of the scattering amplitude was pio-
neered many years ago by van Horn and Salpeter7and
involves the wavefronts, ray vectors, etc., used in geometri-
cal optics. As is typical in a WKB calculation,1,5we assumethat signiﬁcant changes of the potential are relatively slow,
occurring over multiple wavelengths. Equivalently, we imag-ine a semiclassical limit, wherein /C22h!0. In either case, we
havej/C22h$
2Sj/C28$S/C1$Sso that $S/C1$S’2mðEi/C0VÞ;and
the phase Sis seen to be Hamilton’s principal function.
Returning to /C22h¼1 units, we note that for a plane wave ini-
tially incident along the z-direction, we can write
$S’^zk i/C01

; (17)
for which
$S/C1$S¼2mE i/C0V1/C0V

Thus, in the high energy limit where V/C28Ei, we have $S/C1
$S/C252mðEi/C0VÞand can write the approximate scattering
wavefunction in the form of Eq. (15). Substitution into Eq.
(9)then yields the scattering amplitude

The fact that this approximation is valid when Ei/C29Vsuggests

We note also that although the Born approximation is the
result of a perturbative expansion in Vand is, therefore,
relevant only for relatively weak potentials, the eikonalamplitude, as suggested by its equivalence to WKB, is
valid for any ﬁnite range potential whenever the deBroglie
wavelength is smaller than a typical distance over whichthe potential changes. In the case of an inﬁnite range
potential such as occurs in the Coulomb or gravitational
case, the eikonal form is valid when the deBroglie wave-length kis small compared to the scattering impact param-
eterb.

III. ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING
As a test case of the eikonal approximation [Eq. (45)], we
can use Coulomb scattering, for which the exact solution canbe found. For a system with opposite charges eand – e, the
potential is VðrÞ¼/C0 a=r, where a¼e
2=4pis the ﬁne struc-
ture constant, and the exact scattering amplitude is known tobe
4

where g¼ma=kiand mis the reduced mass of the two
charges. Of course, because of the long range characteristic
of the Coulomb interaction, the asymptotic form of the scat-tering wavefunction as jrj!1 isnotgiven in Eq. (7)but
rather by

but this difference is not relevant to our discussion. In our
case, the Born amplitude is

fexact
Cðkf;kiÞ¼fBorn
Cðkf;kiÞCð1/C0igÞ
Cð1þigÞeigln sin2ðh=2Þ:(27)
Thus, the exact and Born amplitudes differ only by a phase,
meaning that the exact and Born cross sections are identical.Because of the proportionality of the scattering amplitude to
1=q
2, the total cross section diverges and the optical theorem
is not applicable. However, CðzÞis an entire function with
no zeros but with poles when zis zero or a negative
integer.11Thus, under the continuation ki!ij, we ﬁnd
g!/C0 ima=jsoCð1/C0igÞ/C0 !ki!ijC1/C0ma

when ma=jn¼n;n¼1;2;3;…:That is, there exist
poles corresponding to bound states when En¼/C0j2
n=2m
¼/C0ma2=2n2, which are the usual Coulomb bound state
energies. On the other hand, if we use the repulsive poten-
tialVðrÞ¼a=rcorresponding to the same-charge scatter-
ing, the factor Cð1/C0ðma=kiÞÞbecomes Cð1þðma=kiÞÞ,
which has no poles and, therefore, no bound states, as
expected.
We see then that the simple Coulomb Born amplitude,
while giving the proper value for the cross section, is unsatis-
factory. The existence of a nonzero phase is essential in
order to satisfy the requirements of analyticity. Such phasesare provided by the eikonal approximation. Writing the
Coulomb potential as

An alternative way to understand this result is to look at
the problem semiclassically, as a series of small-angle scat-
terings. That is, we assume the incident trajectory to be inthez-direction with momentum k
iand impact parameter b.
The dominant effect is then linear motion with qz’0, i.e., a
straight line trajectory parallel to the z-axis. However, due to
the presence of the Coulomb potential there exits also a

While this procedure gives the correct result for a 1 =rpoten-
tial, the agreement is accidental, as can be seen by using a
potential of the form 1 =rnwith n6¼1. The eikonal method is
valid, however, for any n.
IV. GRAVITATIONAL SCATTERING
For a system consisting of a small mass mand large mass
M, low energy electromagnetic and gravitational interaction
results are related by the simple substitution a!GMm .
However, this replacement must be done judiciously. Thus,
if one considers, for example, a neutron in the gravitational
ﬁeld of the earth, one cannot use this simple substitution to
predict the bound state energy since a “point particle” picture
of the earth clearly breaks down for distances r<RE. Such
neutron-earth gravitational bound states do exist and haverecently been observed, but predicting the binding energy
requires a more careful analysis.16
Nevertheless, in the case of gravity, we canuse eikonal
methods to study two classical general relativity tests: light
bending and Shapiro time delay.8However, since both
involve massless particles—photons—in the expression forthe effective gravitational potential, the small mass mshould
be replaced by the photon energy xand the incident velocity
v
i¼ki=xibecomes unity. In addition, there is also the well-
known factor of two between Einstein and Newtonian grav-
ity due to spatial curvature.17That is, the potential that
should be used is
VðrÞ¼/C02GMx
jrj: (45)
382 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 5, May 2023 Barry R. Holstein 382 04 October 2023 22:52:14
In order to see quantitatively how Eq. (45) comes about
we use the feature, shown above in the electromagnetic case,
that the interaction potential is the Fourier transform of the
scattering amplitude. For the latter, we evaluate the graviton
exchange amplitude between spinless systems, one of which
is massless while the other is massive. (The photon, of
course, carries unit spin. However, the equivalence principlerequires that an identical trajectory—a geodesic—must be
traversed by a massless scalar particle, at least at the classical
level, so we utilize this calculationally much simpler case.)

for additional study are outlined in the Appendix .
V. CONCLUSIONS
The eikonal approximation is well known in the realm of
optics, where it was introduced long ago by Ham ilton and leads
to the well-known ray (geometrical) optics approach.
24In this
note, we have looked at quantum mechanical scattering andhave seen how the eikonal approximation can be applied to the
Schr €odinger equation and used to generate a well-motivated
correction to the familiar Born approximation. If one is inter-ested only in ﬁnding the scattering cross section then the Bornamplitude can be a reasonable estimate, as found in the simpleCoulomb and Newtonian cases. However, as can be seen in Eq.(15), the eikonal approximation modiﬁes the phase of the scat-
tering wavefunction w
ðþÞ
kiðrÞwith respect its plane wave coun-
terpart /kiðrÞ, and we have demonstrated above that inclusion
of this phase information can be used in the case of the electro-magnetic interaction to demonstrate the classical scatteringangle together with the existence and energies of Coulomb
bound states, and in the gravitational case to derive the classical
general relativity tests involving light bending and Shapiro timedelay. The electromagnetic example can straightforwardly beincluded in a quantum mechanical scattering presentation ineither an undergraduate or graduate course as an improvementto the Born amplitude. The feature that one can reproducefamiliar results by unusual means makes this an attractive addi-tion. The extension to the case of gravity might also generateinterest by deriving well established general relativistic resultsin an unexpected fashion. The cost is the use of the Einstein
equation in order to develop the effective gravitational potential
for a massless system, which is somewhat more challengingthan its electromagnetic analog, but again can be presented aftera Born amplitude calculation of gravitational scattering.
Both of these applications involve only lowest order (“tree
level”) interactions, but in the Appendix we also examined
an extensions of these ideas that can be studied by going tosecond order (“loop level”) in the gravitational interaction,generating intriguing deviations from the na €ıve equivalence
principle prediction, which could be used as a moreadvanced presentation in a graduate course/seminar or evento act as a stepping off point for a possible student research
project. It is important to note that none of these applications
would be possible if only the Born term were to be used asinput. The existence of a phase-modiﬁed plane wave, asarises in an eikonal treatment, is essential. In any case, theaddition of the eikonal approximation to a quantummechanical scattering discussion opens a new and
exciting spectrum of possibilities for applications and for
exploration.

APPENDIX: HIGHER ORDER GRAVITATIONAL
SCATTERING
A more advanced but particularly interesting eikonal
application is found by looking at the full second order gravi-
ton exchange contribution, which has been calculated by sev-eral groups and yields a result for spinless massive-masslessgravitational scattering,

Comparing with Eq. (26) and making the substitution
g¼a=vi!2GMx, we see that Eq. (A3) simply represents
the gravitational phase contribution to the scattering ampli-
tude. Another piece of Eq. (A1) which has a simple interpre-
tation is the ﬁrst term, which can be used to generate asecond order eikonal phase contribution

The second order time delay increase is not generally dis-
cussed, but the correction to the light bending angle is inagreement with the well-studied post-Newtonian value.23
The remaining terms in Eq. (A1) signify tiny quantum
mechanical corrections and are proportional to /C22h. They gen-
erate negligible numerical modiﬁcations to the quantities dis-cussed above, but the logarithmic piece proportional to bu

deserves comment, since it has different values for massless
spin zero, one, and two projectiles. The consequences can beseen by converting to an effective second order eikonalphase

Because they are second order in Gand proportional to /C22h,
both results are numerically negligible and probably experi-mentally unobservable. Nevertheless, each would appear toviolate the simple equivalence principle, which demands allmassless particles to traverse the same geodesic with identi-cal transit times. Of course, since a quantum system ofnecessity has a nonzero wavelength, it cannot be representedby a point particle and consequently there must exist tidalforces. There is, thus, presumably no bona ﬁde equivalenceprinciple violation here, but this is a point certainly worthyof further consideration.
