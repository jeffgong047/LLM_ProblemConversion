These brief summaries are designed to help readers easily
see which articles will be most valuable to them. The online
version contains links to the articles.
Regular readers will note the temporary increase in the
length of the journal as we try to decrease the backlog of
manuscripts.
Online administration of research-based assessments
Ben Van Dusen, Mollee Shultz, Jayson M. Nissen, Bethany
R. Wilcox, N. G. Holmes, Manher Jariwala, Eleanor W.
Close, H. J. Lewandowski, and Steven Pollock
89(1) p. 7
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0002888This guest editorial informs readers that using online ver-
sions of research-based assessments removes many of the
administrative barriers associated with paper-based versions.
Letters to the editor

The letters-to-the-editor section returns after a too-long
absence. Readers: keep sending contributions!
An optical n-body gravitational lens analogy
Markus Selmke
89(1) p. 11
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0002117A scheme is presented to use lensing by liquid menisci
around small objects as an analog of gravitational lensing by
multiple objects. The article is at the level of 2nd year phys-ics and can be used for labs, outreach, or teaching optics.
Sun glints and luminous wriggles by the seashore
R. De Luca
89(1) p. 21
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001882The seashore observations of wriggles and dancing spots
of light are used as illustrations of the application of under-
graduate-level optics. The link above will also take the
reader to the article’s video abstract.
Rabi oscillations, Floquet states, Fermi’s golden rule, and
all that: Insights from an exactly solvable two-level model
R. Merlin
89(1) p. 26
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001897Rabi oscillations occur when a few-level quantum system
is submitted to a periodically time-varying ﬁeld. Floquet
states are stationary solutions of a quantum system subjected
to a periodic time-dependent perturbation. This paperdiscusses the connection between the two problems through
the study of a two-level quantum system coupled to both acontinuum and a periodically oscillating external ﬁeld. The
comparison between the exact solutions and those from per-
turbation theory leads to an in-depth discussion of the subtle-
ties of these phenomena, including their relation with
Fermi’s golden rule. Appropriate for advanced undergradu-ate or graduate students.
Calculating spin correlations with a quantum computer
Jed Brody and Gavin Guzman
89(1) p. 35
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001967The basics of two-state systems and correlations of two-
particle and three-particle combinations of such systems.
The paper includes speciﬁc examples and exercises that use
the IBM Quantum Experience. The material is best suited forundergraduates who have some experience with quantum
spin.
Equilibrium probability distribution for number
of bound receptor-ligand
Tuhin Chakrabortty and Manoj M. Varma
89(1) p. 41
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001898The equilibrium probability distribution for the number of
bound receptor-ligand complexes is derived using a partition
function obtained from the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution.
This allows one to calculate the ﬂuctuation in the number ofbound molecules, which cannot be obtained from the stan-
dard rate balance equation. A nice application of statistical
physics to a biological problem.
Six textbook mistakes in computational physics
Alexandros Gezerlis and Martin Williams
89(1) p. 51
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001945An effort to correct common mistakes: This paper identi-
ﬁes and corrects errors that have been propagating in compu-tational physics textbooks. Essential reading for instructors
in this ﬁeld, but surprisingly readable to anyone who even
occasionally uses computations.
Teaching college writing from a physicist’s perspective
Kristen L. Thompson, Anthony N. Kuchera, and John N.
Yukich
89(1) p. 61
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0002179The authors share experiences teaching in their college
writing program for ﬁrst-year students. Their courses
emphasize critical thinking and sound argumentation, and
also review basic writing skills. The course topics focus on

particular areas of physics such as astrobiology, but no phys-
ics background is required, and students with a wide variety
of academic interests enroll in them.
A vertical race up and back down with and without drag
Carl E. Mungan, Seth T. Rittenhouse, and Trevor C. Lipscombe
89(1) p. 67
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001893Two balls are thrown straight up, with one subject to a
drag force proportional to the nth power of the instantaneous
speed, and the other not subject to any drag. Which one will
return to the starting point ﬁrst? This paper, which is appro-priate for discussion in both introductory and more advanced
mechanics classes, analyzes this question as a function of the
power n. The answer may surprise you.
High-speed escape from a circular orbit
Philip R. Blanco and Carl E. Mungan
89(1) p. 72
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001956A rocket in a circular orbit can escape to inﬁnity by eject-
ing fuel in just one impulsive thrust, or in two or three. The
resulting saving in fuel and inﬂuence on the travel time to adistant location is an example for students of unexpected out-
comes in introductory mechanics. The link above will also
take the reader to the article’s video abstract.
Of balls, bladders, and balloons: The time required to
deflate an elastic sphere
Don S. Lemons and Trevor C. Lipscombe
89(1) p. 80
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001998How long does it take for a party balloon to deﬂate? A
straightforward analysis is presented and veriﬁed by a simple
experiment employing a smartphone app. The topic is rele-
vant to medical physics, and the approach is suitable forintroductory students.
Chaos in the monopole ion trap
Edgar Perez and John Essick
89(1) p. 84
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001958The monopole ion trap described can give undergraduates
direct laboratory experience with simple electrically drivenmotion of a charged particle, and also introduces the onset of
period doubling and chaos in that motion.Modeling and measuring the non-ideal characteristics of
transmission lines
J. S. Bobowski
89(1) p. 96
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001896The frequency response of a transmission line is studied
from 1 to 2000 MHz to determine not only its characteristicimpedance but also its losses. This study nicely complementstraditional undergraduate labs on the subject, which usuallyfocus on ideal (lossless) lines.
Standing waves in a coaxial cable: A simple and low-cost
experiment for an instructional wave laboratory
Vin/C19ıcius M. Lenart, Romeu M. Szmoski, Rozane F.
Turchiello, and Sergio L. G /C19omez
89(1) p. 105
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0001927Theory and experimental details are given for experiments
that teach about electrical standing waves with MHz wavesin a coaxial cable. The theory is well suited for studentsbeyond the ﬁrst year.
A demonstration of quantum key distribution with
entangled photons for the undergraduate laboratory
Aayam Bista, Baibhav Sharma, and Enrique J. Galvez
89(1) p. 111
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0002169The theory is sketched of quantum communication with
detection of eavesdropping, along with instructions of how
to build a relatively inexpensive laboratory realization.
