Power-law distributions are observed to describe many physical phenomena with remarkable
accuracy. In some cases, the distribution gives no indication of a cutoff in the tail, which posesinteresting theoretical problems, because its average is then inﬁnite. It is also known that the
averages of samples of such data do not approach a normal distribution, even if the sample size
increases. These problems have previously been studied in the context of random walks. Here, wepresent another example in which the sample average increases with the sample size. In the
Gutenberg–Richter law for earthquakes, we show that the cumulative energy released by
earthquakes grows faster than linearly with time. Here, increasing the time span of observationcorresponds to increasing the sample size. While the mean of released energy is not well deﬁned,
its distribution obeys a non-trivial scaling law.

I. INTRODUCTION
Very diverse physical, biological, and social phenomena
display distributions that obey a power law with remarkable
accuracy and over several orders of magnitude.1In some
cases, the power law holds true without any sign of a cutoff,
which would indicate that the distribution has no ﬁnite mean.
From a purely theoretical perspective, theorems and limit dis-
tributions for such cases are known in mathematics.2–5From
a practical or physical standpoint, however, measurable impli-
cations caused by the peculiar properties of power law distri-
butions have attracted little attention until recently.6The
mathematics of probability distributions with inﬁnite means
was investigated by Paul L /C19evy in the 1930s.2,4Several deca-
des later, L /C19evy’s results were applied in physics to explain
phenomena related to random walks, e.g., anomalous diffu-
sion in disordered conductors.7–10 ,15In recent years, this sub-
ject has become popular and found applications to numerousphysical systems from laser cooling to aging.11–14
The absence of a well-deﬁned average requires that the
probability of a variable xbehaves as PðxÞ/1=ðx1þaÞwith
a>0 in the limit of x!1 . In laser cooling of atomic
gases, for instance, the lifetime of atoms in a given momen-
tum state follows this type of distribution.14A divergent life-
time signiﬁes that the system is experimentally unable to
reach a steady state despite the experimental time scale being
signiﬁcantly larger than the microscopic one.
Another example is the law of large numbers. For the sum
SNofNindependent and identically distributed random vari-
ables, it is often taken for granted that the average SN=N
approaches a ﬁnite value /C22lasNincreases. This is the (weak)
law of large numbers, which underlies the inference in phys-
ics experiments that the true value of the observable is /C22l.I fthe variable has a ﬁnite variance, r2, then the sum SN
approaches the normal distribution with mean N/C22land vari-
ance Nr2. This is the central limit theorem.
However, it is possible to imagine anomalous cases for
which the limit /C22ldoes not exist or is ill-deﬁned. To deal
with these phenomena, the usual method, which underliesthe mean ﬁeld theory, of considering the average value of aphysical observable separately from its ﬂuctuations is of nohelp. L /C19evy derived the probability distribution for such cases
in terms of the Fourier transform of the probability densityfunction.
2Phenomena such as random jumps of a state vari-
able, e.g., position or displacement in a random walk, arenatural applications of L /C19evy’s results. Atomic momentum in
subrecoil laser cooling is also a good example.14However,
practical applications can also be found elsewhere in entirelydifferent contexts.
In the eighteenth century, Nicolas Bernoulli posed a para-
doxical problem now known as the St. Petersburg paradox.16
It is based on a theoretical lottery game that leads to a ran-dom variable with inﬁnite average. This game entails ﬂip-ping a coin. If heads comes up in the ﬁrst toss, the playerwins one coin. If tails comes up, the player is allowed to ﬂipthe coin again, until heads comes up. The prize 2
Nis deter-
mined by the number Nof tails the player has drawn before
obtaining a heads. The paradox is that the mean winning(1/C2
1
2þ22/C21
4þ23/C21
8þ/C1/C1/C1 ) is inﬁnite, so that we cannot
determine a fair ante to enter the game, and the bankershould have inﬁnite resources to cover the expected loss.
Feller took up this problem in a classic book on probability
theory,4where he showed that, when the game is repeated n
times, the accumulated winning converges to nlog2nasn
increases.5This superlinear behavior implies that the distri-
bution does not have a ﬁnite mean, since a ﬁnite mean would

require the accumulated sum to vary linearly with n. Thus,
the absence of a well-deﬁned mean does not imply theabsence of any rule. Instead, for a large number of games,the probability distribution of the overall winning should dis-
play the universal scaling property expected from L /C19evy’s
mathematical results.
2This point hints at possible physical
systems that exhibit a distribution without a ﬁnite mean. Inthis paper, we present a particular example of such a system:the power law distribution of earthquakes.
II. POWER-LAW DISTRIBUTION
OF EARTHQUAKE ENERGIES
The Gutenberg–Richter law of earthquake size distribution
is of fundamental importance not only in seismology but
more generally in physics of self-similar phenomena.
17–19
The famous Gutenberg–Richter relation states that log PðMÞ
¼a/C0bMwith b’1 for the cumulative number P(M)o f
earthquakes with a magnitude larger than M.20Combined
with the equation connecting the earthquake’s magnitude M
and its energy E,17logE¼1:5Mþconst., we have PðEÞ
/E/C0bGRwith bGR¼b=1:5. Then, if f(E) is the probability of
an earthquake having an energy E,PðEÞ¼Ð1
EfðEÞdEor
fðEÞ¼/C0 dP=dE, and we have fðEÞ/E/C01/C0bGR. Although
slightly different from the original formulation, this power-
law relation is commonly called the Gutenberg–Richter lawtoday. It was actually originally formulated by Wadati asfðEÞ/E
/C0wwith wð¼1þbGRÞ’5=3.21The exponent bGR
has been found to be universal with a value close to 2/3
(Fig. 1).1The power-law distribution suggests that it origi-
nates from a critical branching process or from self-organizedcriticality.18,22In addition, we study the power-law distribu-
tion of the earthquakes’ energy Einstead of their magnitude
scale M.
While the simple law provides remarkably good one-
parameter ﬁts of available data,23it poses theoretical prob-
lems caused by the divergence of the moments hEni
ðn¼1;2;3;…Þ, including the mean value hEi.1To avoid
this difﬁculty, additional parameters are introduced to cut offthe heavy tail of the distribution for large E.24,25In fact, the-
oretically, the power law cannot be true without limit
because the planet is ﬁnite. Observationally, however, nosigniﬁcant deviation from the power law has been measured,so that any energy cut-off would occur at an energy largerthan that of the greatest known earthquake.
25–28While prac-
tical studies for verifying the validity of the power lawshould remain important, it is not only equally important butof physical signiﬁcance to investigate the theoretical conse-
quences of having an inﬁnite mean for this power-law distri-bution, which holds insofar as the Gutenberg–Richter law is
obeyed. It should be remembered, however, that deviations
from this law may be found in the future.

parameters aandbGRare assumed constant. We are inter-
ested in the t-dependence of the average
hEit¼1
tE1þ/C1/C1/C1þ Et ðÞ ; (2)
where Ekðk¼1;2;…;tÞis a random variable. Mathematically,
the average hEitshould approach a L /C19evy distribution in the
limit of t!1 .2In practice, however, the manner in which
the convergence is achieved can only be investigated
numerically.
For the purpose of illustration, ﬁrst we present numerical
results for hEitevaluated from t¼100 random numbers ( Ek
fork¼1;2;…;100) that obey the distribution in Eq. (1).
Figure 2shows the distribution of hEitobtained from
100 000 numerical simulations. Since the probability distri-
bution of hEitdoes not have a ﬁnite mean, the median pro-
vides a better indicator of the central tendency.31The nth
quartile En=4is deﬁned as the energy separating the n=4 data
of lowest energy from the highest ð4/C0nÞ=4(n¼1, 2, 3).
The median is the second quartile: E2=4¼E1=2(Fig. 2).
In our case, the sample size tcorresponds to the time span
of observation of earthquakes. As the number of time win-
dows tincreases, E1=4;E1=2, and E3=4rapidly become propor-
tional to tð1/C0bGRÞ=bGR(Fig. 3). Such a power-law asymptotical
behavior implies self-similarity.18,21As a matter of fact, hEit

the global centroid-moment-tensor catalog (2006–2017, depth <70 km)

is proportional to E/C0bGR, which is indicated by a solid line.

indicated by an arrow labeled with En=4(n¼1, 2, 3). The average hEit
shows a long tail as its component Eidoes. However, the former distribution
does not depend on the speciﬁc details of the latter distribution. Note that
the exponent bGRgoverning the tail of the Eidistribution is of primary
importance.

scaled by tð1/C0bGRÞ=bGRconverges to a universal distribution
(Fig. 4). By contrast, in the case of a distribution with a ﬁnite
mean, the typical value E1=2and the width E3=4/C0E1=4of the
distribution converge, as tincreases, to expected value /C22land
zero, respectively, so that the average Etconverges to /C22lwith
certainty. The certainty and constancy are both not achievedin the present case. In another case, certainty holds truewhile constancy is violated.

distribution of hEitis L /C19evy’s distribution. In the present
case, the scaled average hEit=tð1/C0bGRÞ=bGRobeys the distribu-
tion Sðx;bGR;1;c;0Þ, so that the median of hEitvaries as
4:07atð1/C0bGRÞ=bGRwith bGR¼2=3 in the t!þ 1 (see the
Appendix for the meaning of the L /C19evy distribution variable).
This theoretical result is plotted with a dashed line in Fig. 3.
To compare the above results with empirical data, shallow
earthquakes (i.e., of depth <70 km) in the global CMT
(Global Centroid-Moment-Tensor Project) catalog coveringthe period 1977–2017 were analyzed.29,30,41The total num-
ber of events is 40 390. Dividing the period of 41 years
(14 984 days) into consecutive tdays, we evaluated theaverage hEitin Eq. (2)by regarding Ekas the energy released
in day k.F i g u r e 5is the t-dependence of the median of this
average. As can be seen, the median and therefore hEit,
increases as tgrows larger. Although it may seem counter-
intuitive, Fig. 5shows that the rate of energy release depends
on the width of the considered time window. This is an imme-diate consequence of the fact that there is no upper cut-off for
the power-law distribution. When the average is ill-deﬁned,
owing to the long tail of the power-law distribution, it shouldstrongly depend on the presence or absence of outliers on thetail, i.e., extremely large events of extremely rare occurrence.
It, thus, varies with the width of the observation window,
because wider time frames are more likely to contain outliers.
IV. DISCUSSION
It is often stated that the power-law distribution of earth-
quakes indicates the absence of a characteristic scale. An
upper bound scale is introduced only if the ﬁnite size of thesystem, the Earth’s crust, is taken into consideration.However, the expression of the median of the probability dis-
tribution provides a characteristic scale that is almost inde-
pendent of the upper bound scale. The median of theprobability distribution in Eq. (1)isE
1=2¼21=bGRa’2:8a.Fig. 3. Quartiles E1=4;E1=2and E3=4of the hEitdistribution are plotted
against t(bGR¼2=3 and a¼1). The almost linear dependence in the
log–log plot indicates that the quartiles vary according to a power law of the
number of samples t. This behavior is contrasted with the usual behavior of
distributions converging towards a constant value (mean). A dashed line
shows the theoretical limit E1=2’4:07tð1/C0bGRÞ=bGRast!þ 1 .

fort¼100, 1000, and 10 000 ( bGR¼2=3 and a¼1). Each of these distribu-
tions is numerically obtained from 100 000 simulations. For comparison, the
solid curve corresponds to a L /C19evy distribution (see the text).
Fig. 5. The median E1=2of the t-day average hEitof earthquake energy is plotted against t(Refs. 29,30, and 41). A steady increase in the median E1=2, and
therefore of hEit, shows the absence of an upper cutoff in the power-law tail of the earthquake size distribution. The left panel is a normal plot. The right panel
is a log–log plot of the same data, where a dashed line shows E1=2/tð1/C0bGRÞ=bGR. It should be remarked that the lower cutoff is provided by practical incom-
pleteness of the data catalogue (Refs. 29,30,32, and 41).

Similarly as for the upper limit, the attempts to ﬁnd the lower
limit ahave not yielded reliable results. Indeed, the lower
limit can be extremely small: molecular dynamics simula-
tions33and laboratory experiments34suggest that the self-
similarity extends to the molecular scale. The present results
should open a new way for investigating elusive boundary
scales at both ends.
More generally, the example of earthquakes’ sizes shows
that we should not ap r i o r i assume that a distribution has a
ﬁnite mean (expected) value. This implicit assumption comes
from our everyday experiences. In most cases, the signiﬁcanceof expected value is warranted by the law of large numbers,which allows us to ignore the distinction between the measured
result of a given sample (the average) and the theoretical
property of a probability distribution (the expected value).However, an inﬁnite or undeﬁned expected value, when it
occurs, does not necessarily cause a practical difﬁculty. It does
not necessarily mean that each realization has an inﬁnite orindeﬁnite result. In fact, there are abundant interesting statistics
in which the mean value is not a valid indicator of the typical
outcome.
1,31In this respect, it should be remembered that the
power-law distribution, also known as the Pareto distributionin economy and sociology, was originally discovered in study-
ing the distribution of wealth in a society, i.e., a large portion
of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population.35
Power-law distributions occur in a diverse range of natural
phenomena, including the sizes of earthquakes, moon craters,36
solar ﬂares,37and rainfall depths.38The recent surge of interest
in scale-free networks shed a new light on the power-law dis-
tributions in the number of citations of scientiﬁc papers,39the
number of hits on web pages,40and other network-related
phenomena.
V. CONCLUSION
While we took earthquakes as an illustrative example, simi-
lar applications may be found in many other power-law phe-nomena. For distributions with an undeﬁned mean, the median
provides a well-deﬁned measure of a typical outcome.
Accordingly, it is a good practice to monitor whether and howmedian varies as the sample size grows. In so doing, we ﬁnd
pedagogical value especially in taking a critical view on a non-
trivial assumption that the average of sample data shouldapproach to a deﬁnite value as sample size increases indeﬁ-
nitely. The present study shows that the violation of the law of
large number does not mean the absence of any rule, while itsempirical veriﬁcation may require to collect a large set of data.It is generally a formidable task to show unequivocally that the
underlying distribution obeys a power law, because it requires a
signiﬁcant amount of data ranging over several orders of mag-nitude. Still, it is straightforward just to ﬁnd an indication of the
absence of a well-deﬁned mean. Thus, it is instructive to remind
that the long tail of the underlying distribution is predicted fromthe manner in which the median varies.
