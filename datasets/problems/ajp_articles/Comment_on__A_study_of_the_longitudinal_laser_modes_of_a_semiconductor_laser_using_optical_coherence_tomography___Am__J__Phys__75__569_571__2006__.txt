Although the longitudinal mode spacing and longitudinal mode widths of a typical laser diode can,
in principle, be determined from an optical coherence tomography signal, the values presented byPoddar et al. [Am. J. Phys. 75, 569–571 (2006)] do not agree with the Fourier transform theory.
Also, the mode spacing is inconsistent with the peak separation in the interference signal.
Moreover, the laser cavity mirror reﬂectivity calculated from the laser spectrum is incorrectbecause it ignores the gain and the loss within the laser cavity. This Comment aims to help readers
who may struggle to understand that paper or to reproduce its results.

Poddar et al. published a paper in this journal about using
optical coherence tomography to study the longitudinal
modes of a diode laser.1However, the paper lacked sufﬁcient
detail to help readers understand how to implement similarmeasurements in their own labs and may have containedsome errors in measurement or analysis. Toward the goal ofhelping the reader avoid possible mistakes in similar setups,this article comments on three topics presented in the paper:
obtaining a resolved spectrum for the longitudinal modes of
the laser, measuring the power–current curve of the laser,and extracting reﬂectivity of the cavity mirrors from thewidth of a longitudinal mode spectrum.
An optical coherence tomography apparatus is usually
used for imaging. It employs a Michelson interferometerwith a broadband light source such as a superluminescent
diode. In a Michelson interferometer, an incoming light
beam from a light source is split into two beams that arereﬂected back by two mirrors to recombine at the beam split-ter and interfere. The optical path difference between thetwo interfering beams can be adjusted by translating eitherof the two mirrors. Since the light beam passes twice in each
arm, the optical path difference is twice the length difference
between the two arms. The broadband light source has ashort longitudinal coherence length, and the Michelson inter-ferometer produces an interference signal only when its twoarms differ in length by less than a few coherence lengths. Intime-domain optical coherence tomography, a sample repla-ces the mirror in one arm of the interferometer, and the
length of the other arm is varied to image the sample. A
reﬂecting layer in the sample that makes the two arms almostequal in length causes variation in the interferometer’s out-put signal.
To study the longitudinal modes of a diode laser, the
experimental apparatus described in Ref. 1replaced the
broadband light source with a diode laser and the sample
with a mirror. The interference signal was measured over
16 mm of translation of the mirror of the reference arm ofthe interferometer. According to the inset in Fig. 5 of thatpaper, the full width at half maximum of a longitudinal
mode is 0.3 GHz, and the difference between two adjacentdata points in the frequency domain is 0.03 GHz. However,these numbers contradict the Fourier transform theory, whichdictates that the minimum separation between two adjacentpoints in the frequency domain is Df¼c=2Dx
m, where c is
the speed of light and 2 Dxmis the maximum optical path dif-
ference between the two interfering beams. Hence, for2Dx
m¼2/C216 mm, Df¼9 GHz. To obtain Df¼0:03 GHz,
the interference signal should be collected at least over 5 mof translation of the mirror of the reference arm.
Reference 1provides no details about how the position of
the translating mirror shown in the inset e of Fig. 2 is trans-
formed into the frequency domain of Fig. 3. When carefully
examining the two ﬁgures, it appears that the spectrum hasthe same shape as the coherence tomography signal, exceptﬂipped horizontally. Also, Figs. 3 and 5 in Ref. 1, presum-
ably using the same data points, have different frequencyscales. The frequency scale of Fig. 3 is inconsistent with thequoted values for the stated width of curve b (48 GHz) andthe mode spacing (14.3 GHz).
The multiple peaks in the interference signal are due to
the equally spaced modes of the laser, but they are not themodes in themselves. A spectrum with equally spaced peaksseparated by f
fsrproduces peaks in the interference signal
both when the arms are equal and when they differ by aninteger multiple of c=2f
fsr.2
In the following, the output signals of a Michelson inter-
ferometer due to a light source with a smooth spectrum andone with equally spaced peaks are modeled and compared.
For an input light source that is monochromatic with fre-
quency fand intensity I

the intensity of the output signal of the interferometer is

Figure 1(a) shows a simulated smooth spectrum with a
width of Dfand central frequency f0, while Fig. 1(d) shows a
spectrum obtained by multiplying that of Fig. 1(a)by equally
spaced identical narrow spectral lines, each of width df, sep-
arated by ffsr. The spectrum of Fig. 1(d) is like a spectrum of
a multi-longitudinal mode laser, with the separation between
two adjacent modes given by the free spectral range of the
laser Fabry–P /C19erot cavity ffsr¼c=2L, where Lis the cavity’s
optical length. Equation (2)can be solved analytically using
a Gaussian function for the narrow spectral lines. Figure 1(b)
shows the resulting interference pattern when using the spec-
trum in Fig. 1(a), and Fig. 1(e)shows the interference pattern
when using the spectrum in Fig. 1(d). Figure 1(b) shows that
for the smooth spectrum, interference occurs only near zero
optical path difference with a width of about c=Df. In the
interference region, the intensity has a modulation wave-
length of about 2 Dx/C25k0¼c=f0, but the sinusoidal variation
cannot be resolved using the scale used in the ﬁgure. Hence,
the interference region appears as a solid painted area.
Figure 1(e) shows that for the equally spaced multipeak
spectrum of Fig. 1(d), interference not only occurs at zero
optical path difference but also for optical path length differ-
ences that are integer multiples of c=ffsr. As in Fig. 1(b), the
width of the individual interference regions is about c=Df.
As indicated by the dashed curve in Fig. 1(e), the extent of
optical path differences over which interference can occur is
inversely proportional to the spectral width of the individual
spectral peak, and it is about c=df.
In a typical time-domain optical coherence tomography
setup, the reference mirror moves at a constant speed v. The
motion of the mirror causes the frequency fof the laser
beam to be Doppler shifted. If the mirror moves toward thedetector, the frequency of the light reﬂecting from the
moving mirror becomes f0¼1þv=c ðÞ =1/C0v=c ðÞ ðÞ f
/C251þ2v=cðÞ ðÞ f¼fþ2v=k. A superposition of the beam
reﬂected by the stationary mirror and the beam reﬂected by
the moving mirror produce a beat whose beat frequencyequals the difference between the frequencies of the twobeams, 2 v=k. Since the response of optical detectors is much
slower than the optical frequencies, their output is propor-tional to the square of the envelope of the beat signal. Hence,
the output signal for the Michelson interferometer has modu-
lation at a frequency of about 2 v=k
0. Heterodyne detection
uses this modulation to extract the envelope shown in Figs.1(c) and1(f), from the signals in Figs. 1(b) and1(e). The
detected signal is band-passed by a ﬁlter whose center fre-
quency is the Doppler shift frequency 2 v=k
0. The output sig-
nal is then rectiﬁed and low-pass ﬁltered.3In Ref. 1, the
speed of the translation stage is 0.6 mm/s, and the wave-length of the laser is 670 nm, so the Doppler shift should be1.8 kHz and not the quoted frequency of 1.4 kHz. For a speedof 0.6 mm/s, a laser with a wavelength of 850 nm would give
a Doppler shift of 1.4 kHz.
There is an inconsistency in Ref. 1between the spacing
between peaks in the interference signal and the frequencydifference between adjacent laser modes. From the inset ofFig. 2 in Ref. 1, the spacing between peaks in the interfer-
ence signal is Dx¼1:3 mm or an optical path difference of
2Dx¼2:6 mm. Thus, the frequency difference between two
adjacent laser modes should be f
fsr¼c=2Dx¼115 GHz.
Reference 1, however, ﬁnds it to be 14.3 GHz from its Fig. 5.
There is also an inconsistency between the spacing of the
laser modes and the calculated laser length. The two facetsof a diode laser form a Fabry–P /C19erot cavity, and hence, the
spacing of its modes f
fsris related to its optical length L by

In the aforementioned formula, the variation of the refractive
index with frequency is ignored. Thus, the optical length ofthe laser when 14.3 GHz is used for the mode spacing should

The optical length corresponding to correct mode spacingf

Here, ng¼nþfdn=df¼n/C0kdn=dkis the group index of
refraction and lis the physical length of the laser cavity.4
Using Eq. (4)and the physical length 335 lm obtained from
the optical microscope image in Ref. 1give a group index of
refraction ng¼3:9. A 670 nm diode laser is usually made
from GaInP/AlGaInP semiconductors.5However, since the
laser structure and composition are not known, it is difﬁcultto compare the calculated group index of refraction 3.9 withone from literature. For example, the group index of refrac-tion for Al
xGa1/C0x ðÞ0:5In0:5P is from 3.9 to 4.8 for xfrom 0.9
to 0.1.6
Figure 2 in Ref. 1shows the power vs the injection cur-
rent. The power is constant at 40 a.u. for currents below6 mA, increases linearly between 6 and 30 mA, then becomesconstant at 260 a.u. for currents above 30 mA. It appears thatthe detection system is fully saturated beyond an injectioncurrent of 30 mA. Although it is clear from the ﬁgure that thelaser threshold current occurs at 6 mA, Ref. 1states that the
threshold current is beyond 25 mA, close to the current forwhich the detection system saturation may start to occur.
Also, below the threshold current, the optical power should
be practically zero compared to the lasering output power.However in Ref. 1, the power below the threshold current is
very high. It is 40 a.u. compared to the full scale 260 a.u.,which indicates either the detector is not shielded well fromthe ambient light or the detection system has a dc offset.
If the detection system is sensitive enough, interference in
the optical coherence tomography signal should be observedeven below the threshold current. For currents well belowthreshold, the spontaneous emission spectrum of the diodelaser is smooth, and it is typically a few nanometers in width.In this case, a peak in the optical coherence tomography sig-nal is observed when the two arms of the Michelson interfer-ometer are equal. For higher currents, but yet below thethreshold current, the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission causes thelaser spectrum to be modulated by its cavity’s longitudinalmodes spacing.
7In this case, peaks in the optical coherence
tomography signal can be observed when the two arms of theMichelson interferometer differ by an integer multiple of c=2f
fsr.
A superluminescent diode, typically used in optical coher-
ence tomography, generates light through ampliﬁed sponta-neous emission. The reﬂectivity at its facets is minimized toprevent stimulated emission. Unlike a diode laser, its cav-ity’s longitudinal modes cause much smaller modulations inits spectrum. The suitability of a superluminescent diode foroptical coherence tomography is determined by the height ofthe principal peak occurring when the path difference is zero
to the two small side peaks caused by the small modulation
in its spectrum. These two side peaks are called secondary
coherence subpeaks, and they should be negligible comparedto the principal peak. They are observed when the optical
path difference is c=f
fsr.8
Reference 1uses the spectral width of a lasing longitudi-
nal mode to directly calculate the reﬂectivity of the cavitymirrors to be R¼0:994, ignoring the gain and the loss
within the cavity. The spectral width should be related to
Re
g/C0aintðÞ linstead of Ronly. Here, gis the gain coefﬁcient,
andaintis the internal loss coefﬁcient, which has a value
comparable to the mirror loss coefﬁcient am¼lnð1=RÞ=l.4
Without knowing the gain and loss coefﬁcients within the
laser, it is impossible to estimate the reﬂectivity of the cavitymirrors correctly. Diode lasers have very high gain coefﬁ-
cients, and, usually, the uncoated laser cavity facets are sufﬁ-
cient.5The reﬂectivity can be found from the Fresnel
reﬂection at the semiconductor–air interface for uncoatedfacets. For a typical refractive index n¼3:2, the reﬂectivity
at the interface is n/C01ðÞ2=nþ1ðÞ2¼0:27. Even with the
gain and the internal loss ignored, the quoted reﬂectivity inRef. 1does not agree with Fig. 5. The width of the peak in
