Sarah Frances Whiting, pioneer of laboratory instruction
in astronomy
Joanna Behrman
91(6), p. 417
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0131617It is hard to imagine teaching physics or astronomy with-
out a laboratory component, but that was the common stateof affairs in the late 19th century in the United States. SarahFrances Whiting was among the ﬁrst educators to make labwork central to the teaching of astronomy. This article dis-cusses the inﬂuences on her work, the challenges she faced,and the “hands-on” teaching philosophy she adopted as she
launched laboratory instruction at Wellesley College.
Optimal trajectories for symmetric turns
Stephen Kaczkowski
91(6), p. 425
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0114235Say that you’re traveling along a wide, straight road and
suddenly realize that you want to be going the other direc-tion. What’s the fastest way to turn around, if you’re con-strained by the maximum acceleration due to friction with
the road? This sort of constrained motion problem has a long
history in physics. The solution, which shows the importanceof choosing the right variables, could make a good startingpoint for student projects in mechanics.
Investigating the magnetic field outside small accelerator
magnet analogs via experiment, simulation, and theory
Kelley D. Sullivan, Antara Sen, and M. C. Sullivan
91(6), p. 432
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0068701In upper-level electromagnetism, multipole expansions
are one of the standard tools used to solve Laplace’s equa-tion. However, it’s hard to gain a physical intuition for thehigher order multipoles. This paper shows how students can
gain understanding of multipole ﬁelds, while also gaining
skills in numerical computation, simulation, data collection,and analysis, by measuring and modeling the magnetic ﬁeldsof conﬁgurations of commercially available magnets. Themeasurements can be made using a smartphone sensor, andthe open-source Python library Magpylib can be used to sim-
ulate the ﬁelds. The modular organization allows instructors
to pick and choose among multiple activities according tothe ability and interest of their students.
A magnet falling inside a conducting pipe: Dependence of
the drag force on the magnet orientation
Chang Hyeon Lee and Byung-Yoon Park
91(6), p. 440
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0062860Dropping a magnet in a conducting pipe to visualize the
eddy current-induced braking is a classic classroom demon-
stration of induction. Usually, the magnet is dropped in such
a way that its magnetic moment is vertical. Here, the authorsexplore what happens if the magnetic moment is horizontal.
Then, the eddy currents are not of cylindrical symmetry, so
that things get more complicated. Rather than solvingMaxwell’s equations numerically, the authors show that the
problem is equivalent to having the magnet fall in a quadru-
polar magnetic ﬁeld. They can then derive the expression ofthe drag force for various magnetic moment orientations.The model is validated through experiment. All or part of
this combination of classical electromagnetism, modeling
and experiment could be used as an undergraduate exercise,a student project, or a numerical physics problem.
Beyond the ABCDs: A better matrix method for
geometric optics by using homogeneous coordinates
Theodore A. Corcovilos
91(6), p. 449
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0083069This article presents a mathematical technique that can
alter the direction of the optical axis for compound optical
systems while still retaining the small angle approximation.
The use of the homogeneous coordinates furthermore deliv-ers a simpliﬁed procedure for computing image points for
these compound arrangements. This can be of use both in
undergraduate instruction and in the laboratory.
Endless fun in high dimensions—A quantum card game
Lea Kopf, Markus Hiekkam €aki, Shashi Prabhakar, and
Robert Fickler
91(6), p. 458
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0062128It’s notoriously difﬁcult to develop intuition for quantum
mechanical systems, but the need to train students to contrib-
ute to quantum technologies inspires us to try new
approaches. This paper presents a card game that can beused to learn about basic quantum mechanical concepts such
as randomness, superposition, interference, and entangle-
ment while manipulating the quantum state of a virtual

quantum computer. The game can be played by students at a
wide range of levels and even by the general public.
Free expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket using operator
manipulations
Alessandro M. Orjuela and J. K. Freericks
91(6), p. 463
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0083964The spreading of a free Gaussian wavepacket as it evolves
in time is a familiar problem to quantum mechanics instruc-tors. But as is frequently the case, revisiting this problemwith a different approach can yield signiﬁcant new insights.This paper shows how the problem can be solved by map-
ping it onto the application of a squeezing operator on a
simple-harmonic-oscillator ground state, providing studentswith a solution that uses very little calculus while alsoemphasizing the use of operators. This approach will be par-ticularly useful in courses that emphasize quantuminformation.
Cost-effective measurement of magnetostriction in
nanoscale thin films through an optical cantilever
displacement method
David L. Tran, Paymon Shirazi, Mohanchandra K.
Panduranga, and Gregory P. Carman
91(6), p. 470
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0134187This article presents the design of a cost-effective appa-
ratus for magnetostrictive measurements on nanoscale thin-ﬁlm samples. Magnetostriction is a property of magneticmaterials that causes them to expand or contract during theprocess of magnetization. The measurement capability of
the apparatus is investigated via the measurements on anamorphous 200-nm-thick Terfenol-D sample, where mag-netostriction values up to approximately 100 parts per mil-lion are obtained. In addition, it is demonstrated that theacquired magnetostriction data can be used to produce aplot of the sample’s normalized magnetization as a functionof applied magnetic ﬁeld. The article will be of especialinterest to those teaching a magnetic materials and devicescourse.
Simulating gravitational motion, gas dynamics,
and structure in the cosmos
J. W. Powell, L. Caudill, and O. Young
91(6), p. 478
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0144906Just as many experimentalists use sophisticated hardware
to aid their research, computational physicists use efﬁcientand complex software that has been developed by manypeople. However, it is important to have some insight intohow the algorithms underlying the software work. Thispaper provides important insights into the nature ofChaNGa, which can be used to simulate the motion of grav-itationally interacting sources and gas dynamics in
cosmology.
