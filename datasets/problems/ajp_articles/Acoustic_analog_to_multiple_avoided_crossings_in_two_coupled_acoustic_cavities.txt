A closed cylindrical pipe with an inner partition wall forms two one-dimensional cavities. These
each exhibit acoustic modes at certain well-deﬁned frequencies. A partial transmission through the
partition leads to interactions between the two cavities’ modes, and hence to avoided crossingsbetween modes’ frequencies. This acoustic system is analogous to a quantum system that has two
multi-level interacting sub-systems and, thus, exhibits multiple avoided crossings. Such an acoustic
analog is realized and studied by measuring sound transmission as a function of frequency througha pipe with a partially transmitting and movable partition. An excellent agreement is obtained
between the experimental results and a simple model based on wave transmission and reﬂection at
different interfaces.

INTRODUCTION
When two quantum systems interact with each other, their
energy levels are modiﬁed. In particular, when the two sys-tems have degenerate energy levels, the degeneracy is lifted.If varying an external parameter modiﬁes the energy levelsso that they cross each other, the suppression of the degener-
acy manifests itself as an avoided crossing. Many physics
phenomena are driven by avoided crossings including birds’navigation
1and quantum dynamics.2,3It is also instrumental
in the manipulation of quantum states in atoms,4in control-
ling entanglement between magnetic molecules,5and in
enhancing the Faraday effect in plasmonic systems.6
Similar behavior occurs in classical systems, such as cou-
pled oscillators or wave-media,7providing classical analogs
to quantum systems. Several classical physics experiments,
involving acoustic waves,8–10electromagnetic-waves,11,12
and classical oscillators,13–15have, thus, been reported in
the recent past. These illustrate the physics of avoidedcrossing8,13,14or Kronig-Penney-like band formation.9,10
The Fano resonance asymmetric line-shape has also been
reproduced15in a classical system where waves transmitted
through two different modes interfere.16In that case, one of
the modes displays a sharp resonance leading to a p-phase
change in the transmitted wave over a narrow frequency
range, while the other one is a broad mode with little phasechange over this frequency range.
Newman et al.8demonstrated an avoided crossing
between the fundamental acoustic modes of two cylindricalcavities created in a pipe using a moveable end-cap and aﬁxed partition wall. A hole was drilled in the ﬁxed partitionto couple the two cavities. The allowed modes’ frequencieswere investigated by studying the frequency-dependenttransmission of sound, which exhibits sharp resonance
peaks.
In this paper, we report a systematic study of sound trans-
mission through a pipe with a partially transmitting movablepartition. The transmittance as a function of frequencyexhibits sharp peaks at certain frequencies that are describedby a series of avoided crossings when the frequency of thetwo cavities’ modes coincides. A simple model, similar tothe steady-state solution of the Schr €odinger equation in a 1D
potential or the description of multiple reﬂections in opticalthin ﬁlms is discussed in detail to understand the experimen-
tal observations.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
To create the acoustic cavities, we use a PVC pipe of total
length L
0¼24:0 cm, internal diameter b¼2.4 cm, and outer
diameter 3.3 cm. The end caps and middle partition that
deﬁne the two cavities are made of a sheet of the high den-
sity polymer foam of thickness d¼0.8 cm that ﬁts tightly
into the pipe and can be positioned as desired. The corre-
sponding two one-dimensional acoustic cavities, of respec-
tive lengths L1and L2, are schematically depicted in
Fig. 1(a). The end caps have machined holes to ﬁt either a
small headphone speaker, commonly used with smartphones,
or a collar microphone receiver. A picture of these compo-
nents is shown in Fig. 1(b).
A typical microphone receiver converts a sound vibration
signal into an oscillating voltage, which is digitized by a
sound card at a 440 kS/s sampling rate. A python program17
was made to ramp the sound frequency and to measure the
microphone signal’s mean-squared value. The sound inten-
sity is proportional to this mean squared amplitude signal.
The frequency was ramped from 500 Hz to about 8 kHz, over
several tens of seconds, and the mean-square-amplitude sig-
nal, averaged over a 1 Hz frequency window, was acquired
as a function of frequency. Such frequency scans wereobtained for L
1varying from 4.5 to 18.5 cm in steps of
0.5 cm. The whole set of data was repeated for a total of
three different values of the hole diameter in the partition-
disk, namely, a¼0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 cm, to study the effect of
the magnitude of the coupling between the two cavities.
THEORY
Often, Schr €odinger’s wave equation and other postulates
of quantum mechanics are taught using the understanding
students have of classical waves and their analogy to matter
waves.18In fact, the time independent Schr €odinger equation

for a free particle has the same mathematical structure as the
classical wave equation. This leads to identical spatial solu-tions for the two cases whenever the boundary conditions areidentical. Such a common solution then describes an eigen-mode for both the classical and quantum problems, fromwhich one can derive either the energy of the quantum stateor the frequency of the classical wave. Moreover, the trans-mission of waves incident on such systems is permitted onlythrough such resonant modes, leading to sharp peaks in thetransmittance as a function of frequency (for the classicalsystem) or energy (for the quantum system).
The acoustic modes in a closed cavity of length Lare gov-
erned by the existence of pressure antinodes, or, equiva-lently, of displacement nodes, at the two closed ends.
19
These modes have a wavelength kn¼2L=nand a frequency
/C23n¼n/C230with /C230¼vs=2Land vsbeing the speed of sound.
A pipe of length Lwith a solid partition at a distance L1
from one end contains two decoupled (non-interacting)cavities, each having acoustic modes independent of the other.
The frequency of these modes is given by /C231n¼nvs=2L1
¼n/C230=xand /C232m¼mvs=2L2¼m/C230=ð1/C0xÞ.H e r e , x¼L1=L.
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the frequencies of the modes in both
cavities exhibit multiple crossings as a function of the partition
position (black lines). For instance, for a symmetric partitionposition, i.e., x¼0.5, the two cavities have acoustic modes of
identical frequencies 2 n/C23
0. For a given rational x¼n=ðnþmÞ
(mandnare non-zero positive integers), the frequencies of the
nthmode of one cavity and of the mthmode of the other will
coincide and so will their higher harmonics. This is the case
when the partition is solid, allowing no interaction between thewaves of the two cavities. If the partition allows some trans-mission, these frequency crossings become avoided crossings,as discussed below.
We ﬁrst discuss the transmission through a single 1D cav-
ity using two different methods. The ﬁrst method consists ofkeeping track of all the reﬂected and transmitted waves at
the two interfaces deﬁning the cavities’ ends. This is similar
to the derivation used in wave optics for anti-reﬂectioncoatings.
20The second method is more akin to that used in
quantum mechanics18where one works out the position-
dependent wave-function by solving the time-independentSchr€odinger equation for a given energy. One can, thus, ﬁnd
the transmittance and reﬂectance in simple or complex 1D
potentials.
21
Here, we solve the time-independent wave equation for a
given frequency /C23¼vsk=2p, where vsis the sound speed and
k¼2p=kis the wave-vector. A plane wave eikxentering a
cavity with two partially reﬂecting ends (referred to as inter-faces) is transmitted and reﬂected at the ﬁrst interface. The
transmitted wave undergoes reﬂection and transmission at
the second interface, and this reﬂected wave propagates backto the ﬁrst interface to again get reﬂected and transmitted,and so on. We deﬁne r
iand tias the complex amplitude
reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients when the sound prop-agates from the inside to the outside of the cavity. Here,

to lnjE2j2for a two cavities system of total length Land with L1=L¼1=2;3=5, and 2/3, respectively. ( n,m) indicates the otherwise degenerate modes of the
two cavities that lead to the marked split resonance peak due to coupling. These plots have been shifted vertically for clarity.

Forr1;r3/C251,E1will have sharp peaks for p2¼e2ikL¼1,
i.e., kL¼np. Thus, the overall transmittance, i.e., jE1j2,
will exhibit peaks at frequencies /C23¼n/C230, as shown in
the plot (i) in Fig. 2(b). Note that the only parameter
that affects this plot is the product r1r3. The height of
the peaks diverges when jr1r3j¼1 and decreases when
jr1r3jis reduced. The phase of r1r3leads to a uniform
shift in all the peak-frequencies. This second method, simi-lar to the transfer matrix method,
22is more tractable, partic-
ularly when there are multiple interfaces, as discussed
below.
For two cavities separated by a partially transmitting inter-
face, we look at the steady-state conﬁguration of waves asshown in Fig. 3(b). We deﬁne p
1¼eikL1andp2¼eikL2and
analyze the transmission and reﬂection at the three interfa-
ces. This leads to the following six equations:t0

From the symmetric structure of the partition-disk with a

These linear equations can be solved for A2;B2;C2;D2;E2,

This is consistent with the single cavity expression, Eq. (1),
in the limit of no middle interface, i.e., r2¼0 and t2¼1,
after realizing that p1p2¼p. The resulting transmission
is shown as a two-dimensional density plot of ln jE2j2in
Fig. 2(a) as a function of x¼L1=ðL1þL2Þand /C23=/C23 0

same ﬁgure also displays the frequencies of the modes corre-sponding to zero coupling as black lines. The plots (ii)–(iv)
in Fig. 2(b) show ln jE
2j2forx¼1/2, 3/5, and 2/3, respec-
tively. For x¼1/2, all the modes of the two cavities are
degenerate, leading to a split peak for each mode frequency.
Forx¼3/5, the third mode of one cavity and second mode of
the other, labeled as (3,2), and their higher harmonics, aredegenerate. These modes are, therefore, split, while other non-
degenerate modes show a single peak. Similarly for x¼2/3, one
can see that modes (2,1) and higher harmonics are degenerate.
A complete study of E
2, as elaborated further, shows that
a phase difference of nearly p=2 between t2andr2is neces-
sary in order to observe avoided crossings. If the magnitudes
ofr2andt2are ﬁxed, but their phase difference is varied, the
splitting is maximum with symmetric peaks at p=2-phase
difference, as seen in Fig. 2(b). As this phase difference is
reduced from p=2, the height of two peaks becomes unequal
and at zero phase difference, one peak disappears. So at zerophase difference, one does not see the avoided crossings.
In fact, r
2andt2are dependent on the pipe’s diameter,
partition-disk thickness, and the hole diameter. This is dis-
cussed in the Appendix , where we develop a simple model
to explain the frequency-dependent phase difference between
r2andt2, which is found to be indeed close to p=2 at low fre-
quencies. Finally, the phases of t0
1andt3do not matter for
the variation of jE2j2with frequency but riandt2and their
frequency dependence are important for a comprehensive
understanding of the net transmittance. The exact phase andfrequency dependence of r
1andr3will depend on the details
of the speaker and the microphone receiver. However, in the
limit of small openings in the end caps as well as the parti-tion, we expect the phases of all r
ito be signiﬁcantly less
than pin magnitude. These phases are also expected to be
negative as the reﬂected waves should lag behind the inci-dent wave.

with the partition at two different positions, for three differ-
ent sizes of the partition hole.
The top red plot, for the pipe without partition, shows sharp
peaks at frequencies /C23n¼n/C230. From the difference between
successive peaks, we obtain /C230¼vs=2L¼0:79ð60:02ÞkHz.
With an effective cavity length L¼L0/C02d¼22:4c m ,t h e
value of the sound speed works out as vs¼354ð69Þm/s. The
uncertainty of 0.02 kHz in /C230, which leads to 9 m/s uncertainty
invs, reﬂects the error in judging the peak positions due to their
ﬁnite width and the noise in the measured signal. This vsis
consistent with the accepted value of sound speed at 20/C14Ci n
dry air: 343 m/s. Indeed, vshas aﬃﬃﬃ

dependence on absolute
temperature T, and it also increases with humidity. While we
have not recorded the room temperature and humidity duringthe experiments we estimate the room temperature to bebetween 25 and 30
/C14C and relative humidity to be between
50% and 75%.
The bottom three plots in Fig. 4show the transmitted
intensity for partition-disks placed at the center of the pipe(L
1¼L2¼10.8 cm) and having a¼0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 cm
diameter holes. We clearly see doubly split peaks. Eachsplit-pair is centered close to frequency nv
s=L0with 2 L0¼L0
/C03d. Since 2 L0¼L/C0d, due to the presence of the partition,
the effective value of /C230for this case is vs=2L0¼0:82 kHz.
This is slightly higher than that without the partition, whichexplains the slight mismatch between the peaks of the singlecavity (red plot) and the center of the doubly split peaks. Asexpected, the splitting magnitude is seen to grow withincreasing partition hole diameter.
More generally, as discussed above, the modes in the two
cavities are degenerate only if x¼n=ðnþmÞ, in which case
then
thmode of one cavity has the same frequency as the
mthmode of the second one. The middle three plots in Fig. 4
show how the peaks change when the partition is moved awayfrom the center of the pipe by 3.5 cm, leading to x/C252=3.The avoided crossing, thus, occurs between the ﬁrst and second
modes and between their higher harmonics.
For an arbitrary partition position, the frequency-
dependence of the acoustic transmission is not easy to com-prehend. However, it becomes remarkably clear when onelooks at the two dimensional density plots, see Fig. 5left col-
umn, of the sound intensity on log-scale as a function of thepartition position and frequency. These density plots weremade using the measured frequency dependent intensityplots at about 30 different partition positions. With eachpartition-position taking about 2–3 min, the complete datasetfor one such density plot can be acquired in 1–2 h time.
We see good qualitative agreement between the experi-
mental density plots, shown in the left column of Fig. 5,
and the theoretical one, with frequency independent r
2and
t2,i nF i g . 2(a). Let us also note that the frequency differ-
ence at each avoided crossing grows with the partition-hole
size. Furthermore, in contrast to Fig. 2(a), the observed
frequency difference between the two split peaks at avoidedcrossings decreases with increasing frequency. This behav-ior cannot be explained by frequency-independent r
2andt2
coefﬁcients.
In the Appendix , we develop a more realistic model for
the sound propagation at the partition disk, which explainshow r
2andt2can depend on the wave frequency. One gets
very good agreement between the model and the experimentas can be seen by comparing the corresponding density plotsin Fig. 5. The plots in the right column use the frequency-
dependent r
2andt2, as discussed in the Appendix , with the
actual values of S1andS2. The width of the splitting is now
understandable from the variation with frequency of themagnitude of r
2andt2, as well as of their relative phases. As
seen in Fig. 6(c), their phase difference decreases with fre-
quency, while the magnitude of t2reduces, leading to
reduced coupling between the two cavity’s modes.
Other than the frequency dependent complex r2andt2, the
two other parameters that dictate frequency dependence ofjE
2j2, see Eq. 2, are r1andr3. In theoretical density plots in
the right column of Fig. 5, we have used frequency indepen-
dent r1¼r3¼0:85e/C00:3pifor best agreement with the
experiments. We expect these complex frequency dependentr
1andr3to depend on the details of the opening in the end
caps as well as the speaker and receiver characteristics. Theused value of 0.85 for the magnitude of r
1andr3was esti-
mated using Eq. (A1), in the Appendix , with SiandSjas the
pipe and hole cross-section areas, which are dictated by theirrespective diameters, i.e., 2.4 and 0.7 cm, respectively.Regarding the phases of r
1andr3, all the peaks jE2j2shift to
higher frequencies when one incorporates a negative phase
in both r1and r3. The best agreement with experiment is
obtained for /C00:3pphase for both r1andr3. Unequal phases
ofr1andr3lead to a shift of the density plot either towards
lower or higher xso that the symmetric point shifts away
from x¼1/2. The effect of such a phase can also be seen in
the single cavity data in Fig. 4as the lowest frequency peak
occurs close to 900 Hz, which is slightly above /C230.
We would also like to discuss the peak that is seen in the
two cavities data, in the 500–800 Hz range, and which risesto higher frequencies as the partition hole diameter isincreased, see Figs. 4and 5. This occurs as the avoided
crossing corresponding to the zero frequency single-cavitymode leads to two low frequency peaks. Our experimentaldata were quite noisy below /C24200 Hz, making it difﬁcult to
see the lowest frequency peak.

There are two minor drawbacks in our experimental setup
that prevent a quantitative comparison of the measured inten-sity with the model. First, the combined response of thespeaker and microphone has a frequency dependence leadingto a broad peak centered close to 5.5 kHz. This can clearly
be seen from the single cavity red-plot in Fig. 4. Second,
acoustic waves are transmitted from the speaker to themicrophone through media other than the cavity, for
Fig. 5. The left column shows the density plots of the measured transm itted intensity (on ln scale) as a function of the partition position and normalized
frequency /C23=/C23 0with /C230¼0:82 kHz for three different partition hole diameters: a¼0.6 cm (top), a¼0.8 cm (middle), and a¼1.0 cm (bottom). The
right column shows the corresponding calculated transmitted intensity density plots, i.e., ln jE2j2with r1¼r3¼0:85e/C00:3piand r2and t2given in
Eqs. (A2) and(A3) .

instance, through the cylinder walls. Although the corre-
sponding intensities are very low, it affects the shape ofsome of the resonance peaks due to interference effects. Theeffect is more visible when the intensity of the sound trans-mitted through the cavity becomes comparable to that ofwaves arriving through other media. As a result of destruc-tive interference, just after some of the peaks, one can seethe sound intensity dipping below the background level andthe peaks acquiring a Fano-like asymmetry.
16In fact, this
effect was seen to be more drastic with another microphone,which was not so snugly ﬁtted into the end cap, leading tomore sound transmission through media other than thecavity.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our inexpensive homemade setup illustrates
a rather complex, though systematic, series of avoided cross-ings in resonance frequencies of two coupled one-dimensionalacoustic cavities. This is described by a theoretical modelusing reﬂection and transmission at different interfaces, whichis accessible to senior undergraduates and is quite generic tobe useful for waves other than acoustic. The model uses theactual experimental geometry with excellent agreement withexperimental results. This experiment can be easily set up inan undergraduate laboratory to illustrate multiple avoidedcrossings with a simple and rather comprehensive theoreticalunderstanding.

Figure 6(a) shows the schematic of a pipe of cross-

having a hole of cross-sectional area S2¼pa2=4. A sound
