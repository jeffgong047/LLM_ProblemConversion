Radiated energy and momentum for time-dependent dipoles

A recent article in this journal by Narayan1illustrated that
magnetic forces do not obey Newton’s third law of action
and reaction via the example of two “point” electric dipoles
whose moments pi¼p0;iekt^xigrow exponentially with time.
He correctly found that F12þF21þdPEM=dt¼0;where
PEM¼ÐE/C2BdVol =4pc (in Gaussian units, with cas the
speed of light in vacuum) is the electromagnetic-ﬁeld
momentum associated with the two dipoles.2This is an example
of a general result by Page and Adams3published in this journal
many years ago, in the so-called Darwin approximation4–6that
keeps terms only to order v2=c2(which ignores electromagnetic
radiation), where vis velocity. Narayan’s demonstration is nice
in that it holds to all orders of v=c:
However, Narayan mistakenly claimed that “there are no
electromagnetic ﬁelds in the far ﬁeld zone,” and hence, “no
radiation is emitted” in his example, based on the appearanceof his Eqs. (2) and (3). While those forms are convenient for
later computations, they do not well display the characteris-
tics of electromagnetic ﬁelds of a time-dependent dipole.
This was the topic of the appendix to a paper in this journal
by Berman,7,8where the magnetic ﬁeld of a time-dependent
electric dipole (at the origin) was shown to be Bðr;tÞ¼½ €p/C138
/C2^r=c2rþ½_p/C138/C2^r=cr2with½p/C138¼pðt/C0r=cÞ. The term that
varies as 1/ ris a “radiation” ﬁeld, nonzero except in the limit
t!/C0 1 when the dipole moment is zero by construction.
The radiation pattern of Narayan’s two dipoles can be com-
puted using Eq. (66.6) of Landau,5dI=dX¼cr2½Brad/C1382=4p;
and Fig. 1 of Narayan, where ^x1¼^xand ^x2¼^y;noting
also that ^r¼sinhcosu^xþsinhsinu^yþcosh^z;dI=dX
¼k4½ðp1þp2Þ/C2 ^r/C1382=4pc3¼k4½ðp2
1þp22Þcos2hþðp1sinu
/C0p2cosuÞ2sin2h/C138=4pc3:Then, the total intensity, integrated
over solid angle is, I¼2k4½p21þp22/C138=3c3:9
We can also consider the radiated momentum, dPrad=dt
¼ÐdXd2Prad=dtdX;where d2Prad=dtdX¼ðc^r=4pÞdI=dX:10
Although d2Prad=dtdXis nonzero, the total radiated momen-
tum dPrad=dtis zero, recalling the above form of dI=dX.
A variant of Narayan’s example has been suggested by
Onoochin,11in which the time dependence of the dipoles is
pi¼p0;it^xi;and the corresponding charge and current densi-
ties are qi¼/C0 Iitð@=@ xiÞd3ðr/C0riÞandJi¼Iidlid3ðr/C0riÞ^xi
with r1¼0 and r2¼a^x:Such a conﬁguration has been
called “semistatic,”12for which the electric and magneticﬁelds are given by the instantaneous Coulomb and Biot-
Savart forms. There is no radiation in this variant. It follows
that F12þF21¼/C0 ð I1dl1ÞðI2dl2Þ^y=a2c2¼/C0 dPEM=dt;more
quickly than in Narayan’s example.13
In a larger historical context, Ampe `re’s insistence that
magnetic forces obey Newton’s third law earned him the
sobriquet by Maxwell14as the “Newton of electricity.”
Ampe `re’s authority held up acceptance of the “Lorentz”
force law (stated obliquely by Maxwell in 186115,16) until
efforts by Thomson17,18and Heaviside19in 1891 clariﬁed
that electromagnetic ﬁelds carry momentum as well asenergy (following the ﬁrst clear statement of the “Lorentz”
force law by Heaviside20in 1885).
In 1864, Maxwell discussed “electromagnetic
momentum,”21identifying this with Faraday’s “electronic
state” in Sec. 26, and clarifying in Sec. 57 that the electro-
magnetic momentum of charge qin an external vector
potential AisqA(/c) (in the Coulomb gauge, as favored by
Maxwell). This formulation suggests that electromagnetic
momentum is a property of the charge, rather than of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. That Maxwell’s electromagnetic
momentum is equivalent to the electromagnetic-ﬁeld
momentum of Thomson and Heaviside (the PEMof this
Letter) in quasistatic examples was ﬁrst demonstrated by
Thomson.22,23
Applying Maxwell’s formulation, PEM¼RqjAðrjÞ=c;of
electromagnetic momentum to the “semistatic” variant ofOnoochin, we see that the (Coulomb-gauge) vector potential
of dipole 1 is the same at the position of both charges ofdipole 2, and so does not contribute to the momentum. The
vector potential of dipole 2 along the x-axis is A
2ðxÞ
¼I2dl2^y=cja/C0xj;so the electromagnetic momentum is
PEM¼ðq1dl1=cÞdA2ð0Þ=dx¼ðI1dl1ÞðI2dl2Þt^y=a2c2;noting

Recent letters1,2clariﬁed that, while in classical electro-
magnetism, all magnetic ﬁelds result from current loops, ouruniverse also includes non-classical sources of magnetic ﬁeldsin the form of intrinsic magnetic moments that require a quan-
tum mechanical treatment. These letters lead me to the reali-
zation that, while the two sources of magnetic ﬁelds differ intheir classical or quantum mechanical explanations, in bothsituations, it is the inclusion of relativistic considerations inotherwise purely electrical environments that result in mag-
netic effects. I look forward to sharing this insight with mystudents.

A short pre-history of quantum gravity
S.Deser
(Received 30 November 2021; accepted 13 January 2022)
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0080405
I have been asked by historians of Physics to provide my
recollections of the early attempts at quantum gravity (QG),
quantizing General Relativity (GR). This is a rather obscure
topic, given its lack of inﬂuence on its modern develop-
ments. However, it may be of some use in understanding
how ideas develop, particularly now that QG is at the center
of theoretical research! Warning: my account is necessarily
idiosyncratic, but at least I am one of the few remaining ﬁrst-
hand participants of that heroic era.
The period 1915–1920 marks the appearance, and rapid
acceptance, of Einstein’s classical GR, one of the most revo-
lutionary concepts in all of physics, by one of the giants in
quantum theory as well. Despite the war then raging in
Europe, it was rapidly accepted by the elite of the time,
though not as much by others until the veriﬁcation of the
“three tests” in 1919, of which the most amazing was
Einstein’s calculation of the observed value of Mercury’s
perihelion precession, a non- linear effect. Then the ﬁeld lay
quiescent for a while, because quantum theory and its suc-
cessor, quantum mechanics, were so fertile at microscopic
scales as to absorb all research for a long time.
It was unsurprising then, that about 15 years elapsed
before any attempts at quantization were made. These rather
modest beginnings, motivated by early quantum ﬁeld theory
(QFT), consisted in quantizing the free massless spin 2 ﬁeld,
namely, the linearized limit of GR in a weak ﬁeld expansion
about ﬂat space. The two works are by Bronstein1(also
Trotsky’s real name) in the USSR and by Fierz and Pauli2in
Switzerland. Pauli had a headstart: As a wunderkind aged
18, he wrote the ﬁrst text on GR! Sadly, Bronstein who was
also a wunderkind, was an early victim of Stalin’s purges.
Their quantization was a straightforward extension of that of
electrodynamics, the other abelian gauge theory. All authors
understood that this was far from a true QG, but at least it
was its ﬁrst glimmer, and indeed a long time—about
25 years—also passed until the next meaningful steps were
taken. Remember that the idea of quantizing spacetime is
conceptually vastly removed from that of ordinary matter
systems, namely, fermions and photons.
This brings us to about 1960, when the reformulation of
GR as a (rather unusual) ﬁeld theory was successfully under-
taken by Arnowitt, myself, and Misner (ADM)3and similarly,
if less completely, by Dirac.4Unlike theirs, most other GR
work of the time involved its original classical geometrical
form. I should also mention deWitt’s lifetime devotion to this
problem.5There was a separate interlude in the mid-ﬁfties
when several people (Klein, Landau, Pauli, and I) indepen-
dently suggested that QG might be a universal regulator for
the inﬁnities then ravaging matter loop calculations, but noth-
ing came of it. My foolhardy attempt was the only published
one,6at the ﬁrst conference devoted to GR at Chapel Hill, in
1957, where it was rapidly shot down by Feynman. [There
seems also to have been a small meeting at the Bohr Institute
in Summer 1957, at which I was apparently present, but of
which I have no recollections whatever!]Quite separately from this line is the lesson Heisenberg
drew from Fermi’s weak interaction model which, unlike
quantum electrodynamics, had a dimensional coupling con-
stant. He noted that any theory of this type would be beset
by inﬁnities of rising virulence with each perturbative order.This rapidly understood, if tacitly, insight applied to GR
with Newton’s constant and cast a complete pall on QG.
What Heisenberg told us was that perturbative (and there is
no other known way) QG was guaranteed to lose all predic-
tive power as soon as one left its classical, tree, level. On theother hand, GR’s quantization is mandated because
Einstein’s equations have matter as the source of gravity, so
consistency requires it. (I mercifully do not cite some feeble
attempts to circumvent this by making the matter source be
some sort of expectation value of its quantum nature.) Evenabsent matter, GR must be quantized to avoid the ultraviolet
catastrophe.
7But the motivation to continue any QG pro-
gram was greatly diminished. Still, ADM8and soon after,
Schwinger9separately completed the formal quantization
program. That is about the end of the prehistory, since therewas little incentive to proceed further on this purely formal
program, though one might add the decade later veriﬁcations
of Heisenberg’s predictions by explicit calculations of one-loop plus matter QG corrections, then still later, the two-loop
ones of pure QG.
10,11A minor spinoff is the derivation of
Classical GR using QM methods.12
In summary, the prehistory of QG was a relatively short
one—consisting of formal quantization but without
follow-through calculations of much interest, then explicit
veriﬁcation of non-renormalizability both of pure and
matter-coupled GQ—the mark of a ﬁeld in search of motiva-tion. How times have changed since then: Observational
cosmology has reignited the ﬁeld, while black holes,
Supergravity, and String theory have become the chieftheoretical QG arena, with very mixed results so far.
Even less successful have been some variants such as
L(oop)QG, asymptotic safety, and higher curvature models.
Fortunately, I cannot discuss these within my early QG
framework!
