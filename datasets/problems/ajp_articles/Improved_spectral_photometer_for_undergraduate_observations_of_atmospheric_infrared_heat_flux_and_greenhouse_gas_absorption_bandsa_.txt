We present an experiment investigating the physics of the atmospheric greenhouse effect that can be
performed by undergraduate physics students. The students construct a three-channel spectral
photometer to observe the infrared heat ﬂux in the atmosphere. With this spectral photometer, thestudents observe the difference in heat ﬂux between the portion of the IR spectrum that is absorbed
by water vapor and carbon dioxide and the portion that is not absorbed by atmospheric constituents.
The students discover that Earth’s surface is warmed by radiation from the greenhouse gasabsorption bands, and the radiation of heat to space is retarded by the absorption bands. One
component of the experiment is performed on the ground and the other component is performed in
the atmosphere using a high-altitude balloon. The students then compare their results to a simulationof infrared radiation transport in the atmosphere.

I. INTRODUCTION
The atmospheric greenhouse effect1is a signiﬁcant com-
ponent of Earth’s climate system.2Averaged over Earth’s
entire surface, the solar irradiance is 341 W/m2of electro-
magnetic radiation, mostly in the near-infrared (IR), visible(VIS), and ultraviolet (UV) wavelength regions.3Of this
radiation, 102 W/m2is reﬂected back into space as UV, VIS,
and near-IR, and 239 W/m2is absorbed and re-radiated into
space as mid-infrared region radiation3with an effective
radiation temperature of 255 K, in accordance with the
Stefan–Boltzmann law,
239 W m/C02¼5:67/C210/C08Wm/C02K/C04 ðÞ 255 KðÞ4:(1)
If Earth’s atmosphere lacked mid-IR absorbing constituents,
then that average radiation temperature of 255 K ( /C018/C14C)
would also correspond to the average temperature of Earth’ssurface.
However, Earth’s atmosphere does contain constituents
such as water vapor and carbon dioxide that have signiﬁcant
absorption bands in the mid-IR region, corresponding tomolecular rotational-vibrational transitions. Therefore, IR
radiation upwelling from Earth’s surface is partially
absorbed by those atmospheric constituents and re-radiatedisotropically, generating downwelling IR radiation with a
spectral signature corresponding to the spectrum of the
absorption bands and with an average heat ﬂux of 333 W/m
2
at Earth’s surface.3This additional IR heat ﬂux raises the
average surface temperature to 289 K (16/C14C), corresponding
to an IR heat ﬂux of 396 W/m2upwelling from the surface.3
This surface warming by IR radiation from atmospheric con-
stituents that absorb IR radiation is referred to as the atmo-
spheric greenhouse effect. Observation and measurement of
the spectrum of the downwelling radiation from the atmo-sphere is the ﬁrst objective of this experiment.
Not all of the surface cooling occurs through IR radiation.
Some (97 W/m2on average) results from thermal convection
and evaporation.3In a thermal convection cell, rising airexpands adiabatically as the atmospheric pressure decreases
with altitude, which causes a decrease in atmospheric tem-perature with altitude throughout the troposphere, the layer
of the atmosphere that participates in thermal convection.
This decrease in the ambient atmospheric temperature withaltitude means that as the altitude increases, the absorbed IR
radiation is re-radiated at lower temperatures. Observation
and measurement of the decrease in effective radiation tem-perature with altitude is the second objective of this experi-ment. The third and ﬁnal objective is to observe and measure
spectral differences in the upwelling and downwelling infra-
red radiation to better understand the roles of IR-absorbingcomponents in the greenhouse effect.
In a previous paper,
4we presented an investigation into
some of these aspects of the atmospheric greenhouse effect
that can be performed by undergraduates with access tohigh-altitude ballooning.5In this article, we present an
expansion of, and improvement upon, that experiment. We
present a ground-based investigation that can be performedby undergraduates who build a three-channel infrared spec-
tral photometer that measures the spectral heat ﬂux of infra-
red radiation from atmospheric water vapor in thewavelength range from 5.5 to 8 lm; from atmospheric car-
bon dioxide in the wavelength range from 12 to 14 lm; and
from the so-called “IR window” in between these absorptionbands from 8 to 12 lm. We also present an improvement
upon the design of the original 2-channel balloon-borne
spectral photometer, which is more accurate and hasexpanded capabilities over the original. Finally, we present
the results from the ﬂight of this improved instrument.
The student learning outcomes from this experiment are
numerous. With regard to learning about the greenhouseeffect, the students learn that the downwelling heat ﬂux from
a clear sky comes primarily from the molecular absorption
bands while clouds radiate in both the IR window and in theabsorption bands, that the upwelling radiation temperature
decreases with altitude in the atmosphere and that the
upwelling heat ﬂux is much lower in the absorption bandsthan in the IR window, and that clouds also reduce the IR

heat ﬂux through the atmosphere. In addition, students learn
applications of Planck’s law, infrared ﬁlters, electronics, and
programming. Finally, the students also learn about project
management and engineering design. All of these align with
learning objectives for preparing physics students for 21st-
century careers.6
II. INSTRUMENTATION
The instrument for this experiment comprises eight
MLX90614 infrared thermometers that function as infrared
sensors, an 8–12 lm bandpass ﬁlter and an 8 lm long-pass
ﬁlter that block IR radiation in certain wavelength bands
from reaching the sensors, an Arduino Mega microcontrollerto read the sensors, and a combined SD card/GPS receiver to
store data and provide a time stamp for measurements. It is
important to note that the MLX90614 sensors each contain
an integrated 5.5–14 lm bandpass ﬁlter.7The temperature
measurements reported by these thermometers are, therefore,inferred from the effective IR radiation temperature in that
band alone. It is also important to note that each sensor has a
conical 45
/C14ﬁeld of view, and the sensors are not calibrated
to measure radiation temperatures below 200 K. A photo-
graph of the instrument is shown in Fig. 1, and a block dia-
gram of the instrument showing the connections between
these components is provided in the supplementary mate-
rial.8The bill of materials for this instrument is provided in
Appendix A along with additional details on the components.
The Arduino code for this experiment is provided in the sup-
plementary material.8
The instrument makes six measurements at a time: Td, the
effective radiation temperature of IR radiation downwelling
from the sky; Tf1, the effective radiation temperature of
downwelling IR radiation after ﬁltering by an 8–12 lm band-
pass ﬁlter; Tf2, the effective radiation temperature of downw-
elling IR radiation after ﬁltering by an 8 lm long-pass ﬁlter;
Tu, effective radiation temperature of IR radiation upwelling
from the surface; Ts1, the temperature of sensor f1; and Ts2,
the temperature of sensor f2.9The sensor temperature is mea-
sured and reported by each MLX90614 thermometer along-
side the IR radiation effective temperature. For each of thesemeasurements, we use two separate sensors, subscripted 1
and 2, so that we can calculate the average and standard errorof the measurement, T6dT. With two measurements, the
standard error is half of the difference between the individualreadings. From the measured temperatures, we calculate the
downwelling heat ﬂux from the atmosphere in three wave-
length bands: 5.5–8 lm (the H
2O absorption band), 8–12 lm
(the IR window), and 12–14 lm (the CO 2absorption band).
We refer to these heat ﬂuxes as /a1,/w, and /a2, respec-
tively. We present a sample of data and the subsequent anal-ysis in Sec. III.
III. DATA AND ANALYSIS
The raw data presented in Table Iwere gathered on
October 27, 2022 at 12:05 CDT at 30.512
/C14N latitude,
90.466/C14W longitude under clear skies. When taking data,
the sensors were shaded from direct sunlight so that only IR
radiation from the atmosphere is measured.
From the temperatures in Table I, we next calculate the
heat ﬂux received by each sensor, /d,/f1,/f2, and /u.
Because of the integrated 5.5–14 lm ﬁlter on each sensor,
the infrared temperature, T, reported by a sensor is the effec-
tive radiation temperature in that wavelength band.
Therefore, we calculate the heat ﬂux, /, received by the sen-
sor by integrating Planck’s law over that wavelength bandand over the conical 45

/¼2hc21:87 srðÞð14:0lm
5:5lmdk
k5ehc=kkT/C01 ðÞ: (2)
We evaluate this integral numerically using the method pre-
sented in Appendix B . We also calculate D//DTso that we
can evaluate the uncertainty
d//C25D/
DTdT: (3)
Equation (3)shows that the heat ﬂux measurement error is
propagated from the temperature measurement error inherentin the infrared sensors.7The results of applying Eqs. (2)and
(3)to the data in Table Iare shown in Table II.
Next, we must account for the fact that some of the heat
ﬂux received by the sensors behind the external ﬁlters is IR
radiation emitted by the sensor and reﬂected back to the ﬁlter
by the stop band(s) of the external ﬁlters, which explainswhy /
f1is greater than /d, despite the fact that the ﬁlter
stops some of the external radiation from reaching the sen-sor. Filter 1 transmits IR radiation in the range 8–12 lm with
a transmittance of t
1¼0.803 (per the manufacturer’s data)
and reﬂects the remainder of the radiation. Therefore, the
radiation from sensor f1 reﬂected by ﬁlter 1 is

The results of these calculations are shown in Table II.
We are now in a position to calculate the downwelling
heat ﬂux in the IR window, 8–12 lm, which we designate
/w. The heat ﬂux received by sensor f1 is the sum of the
reﬂected heat ﬂux, /r1, and the external heat ﬂux transmitted

The results of these calculations are shown in Table III.
We designate the downwelling heat ﬂux in the 5.5–8 lm
water vapor absorption band as /a1and the downwelling
heat ﬂux in the 12–14 lm carbon dioxide absorption band as
/a2. The heat ﬂux received by sensor f2 is the sum of the
reﬂected heat ﬂux, /r2, and the external heat ﬂux transmitted
by the ﬁlter, t2(/wþ/a2),/f2¼/r2þt2/wþ/a2 ðÞ ; (10)

The results of these calculations are shown in Table III. The
ﬁnal step in the analysis is to divide the heat ﬂux in each
band by the respective bandwidth to calculate the spectralheat ﬂuxes, /
a1,k,/w,k, and /a2,k. The results of these calcu-
lations are shown in Table IV.
IV. RESULTS
The results from Table IVare graphed in Fig. 2. To pro-
vide a point of comparison for the measurements, we use a
simulation of infrared radiation transfer in the atmosphere
using MODTRAN.10MODTRAN is an algorithm that mod-
els the atmosphere as a series of horizontally homogenous
vertical layers and calculates the transmittance and radiance
of the atmospheric constituents in each layer in 0.2 cm/C01
spectral bands over the spectral range from 0.2 to 100 lm
and averaged the spectral heat ﬂux in these wavelength
bands.11,12The surface temperature input into MODTRAN
is the measured value of Tu, and default setting of “No
Clouds or Rain” was used to match the actual clear sky con-
ditions at the time of the measurements. The simulationresults are also shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the differ-
ence between the measured and simulated values is less than
2 standard errors of measurement.
The lesson for students is that the downwelling heat ﬂux
comes primarily from atmospheric absorption bands. This
downwelling IR heat ﬂux adds to the heat ﬂux from the Sun
and increases Earth’s surface temperature. This result demon-
strates the importance to the greenhouse effect of IR absorption
and re-radiation by water vapor and carbon dioxide.Table II. Total heat ﬂux received by the sensors and heat ﬂux reﬂected to

V. BALLOON-BORNE INVESTIGATION
Due to our participation in the Louisiana Space Grant
Consortium’s Louisiana Aerospace Catalyst Experience for
Students (LaACES) program, we were able to perform mea-surements of both the upwelling and downwelling infrared
heat ﬂux at altitudes in the atmosphere ranging from 0 to
30 km. LaACES is a program that provides experiential learn-ing and technical training for higher-education students across
Louisiana as they design, build, document, and ﬂy an instru-
ment for a scientiﬁc experiment on a near-space balloonﬂight.
13For this experiment, the instrument was conﬁgured as
shown in the block diagram provided in the supplementary
material.8The most signiﬁcant difference is that we used two
8–12 lm bandpass ﬁlters, one for upwelling heat ﬂux and one
for downwelling heat ﬂux, and did not use the 8 lm long-pass
ﬁlter. Consequently, we are able to distinguish heat ﬂux in theIR window and the absorption bands, but we are not able to
distinguish radiation in the 5.5–8 lmH
2O absorption band
from radiation in the 12–14 lmC O 2absorption band. The
LSU MegaSat Sensor Board adds atmospheric pressure, tem-
perature, and humidity sensors, as well as an internal tempera-
ture sensor, inertial measurement unit, and real-time clock asa backup to the GPS time signal.14Photographs of the instru-
ment are shown in Figs. 3and 4. One signiﬁcant design
change from the previous balloon-borne instrument is that theinfrared sensors were moved outside of the insulated housing
to prevent them from reaching the high pre-launch tempera-
tures observed by Blanchard et al.4This change greatly
improved the accuracy of the measurements by allowing the
sensor to cool to lower temperatures during ascent, which
reduces the heat ﬂux reﬂected by the ﬁlters that must be sub-tracted from the total heat ﬂux reaching the sensor in order to
observe the external heat ﬂux in Eq. (7).
The experiment was launched at 10:09 CDT on June 12,
2021 from 30.631
/C14N latitude, 92.405/C14W longitude and
ascended to 30 km altitude before returning to the surface by
parachute. The sky was mostly cloudy with a broken layer of
cumulus clouds. After recovery, we analyzed the data usingEqs. (2)–(9) . First, Fig. 5shows the upwelling and downwel-
ling IR radiation temperatures T
uand Tdmeasured by the
unﬁltered sensors vs altitude as well as the MODTRAN-simulated radiation temperatures.15Note that we do not
expect the model to precisely agree with the measurementsat altitudes less than 10 km because the model—using the
interface that we used—does not accurately reproduce thecloud structure of the lower atmosphere. The only option forcumulus clouds that was available to us was a solid cumuluscloud layer with a base of 0.66 km and a top of 2.7 km. Theactual cloud cover on that day was a broken layer of cumulusclouds with unknown base and top altitudes. In addition, themodel should be considered to represent average atmo-spheric conditions, and the actual conditions on any givenday may differ signiﬁcantly from the average. The lesson forstudents in Fig. 5is that the upwelling radiation temperature
decreases with altitude, so that the effective temperature of
the radiation to space is 32 K lower than the surface tempera-
ture. This is a quantitative measure of the greenhouse effect.
Figure 6shows the upwelling spectral heat ﬂux in the IR
window, w, and the combined H
2O and CO 2absorption
bands, a. The measured values are in qualitative agreement
with the simulation results. The lesson for students in Fig. 6is
that the upwelling heat ﬂux is lower in the absorption bands.Another lesson is the evident contribution of the low-altitudeclouds in reducing the IR heat ﬂux through the atmosphere.
Figure 7shows the downwelling spectral heat ﬂux in the
IR window and the combined absorption bands. At loweraltitudes (associated with the cloud layer), the downwellingspectral heat ﬂux is greater in the IR window; and at higher

model heat ﬂux obtained from MODTRAN.

altitudes (above the cloud layer), the downwelling spectral heat
ﬂux is greater in the absorption bands. One signiﬁcant differ-ence between the model and the measurements is the altitude at
which this crossover occurs. In the model, the crossover lies at
3 km, and in the measurements, the crossover appears lower,around 1 km. In both the model and the measurements, the
downwelling heat ﬂux trends toward zero at 10 km altitude.
The lesson for students is that the liquid water in the cloudlayer radiates in both the IR window and the absorption bands,
and in the clear air above the clouds the downwelling heat ﬂux
comes primarily from the absorption bands.
VI. CONCLUSION
The experiments presented in this article expand and
improve upon the work of our previous paper.
4We add a
ground-based experiment, expand the capabilities of the spec-
tral photometer from two to three bands, add measurements ofthe downwelling heat ﬂux in the atmosphere, and improve theaccuracy of the balloon-borne measurements through a simple
design change. These experiments allow students to investi-
gate the atmospheric IR heat ﬂux in different wavelengthbands to understand the role of water vapor and carbon diox-
ide absorption bands in the atmospheric greenhouse effect.In the ground-based experiment, the students observe the
infrared radiation spectrum from the sky in three wavelengthbands: the water vapor absorption band, the infrared window,and the carbon dioxide absorption band. The students dis-cover that the radiation from a clear sky comes primarilyfrom the absorption bands. This downwelling radiation fromthe greenhouse gas absorption bands is an important compo-nent of the greenhouse effect. A larger ground-based experi-ment could require the students to make and compareobservations at different times throughout the course of aday, on different days with different surface temperatures, or
under different sky conditions.
In the balloon-borne experiment, students observe the vertical
variation of the IR heat ﬂux in the atmosphere. They observethe decrease in the upwelling IR radiation temperature with alti-tude, which is the essence of the greenhouse effect. The effec-tive radiation temperature at the top of the atmosphere isdetermined by the total heat ﬂux from Sun to Earth. Thedecrease in the upwelling radiation temperature with altituderequires a higher surface temperature. The students also observethat the decrease in heat ﬂux with altitude is much greater in theabsorption bands than in the IR window, emphasizing theimportance of the absorption bands to the greenhouse effect.
In addition to these geophysical learning objectives, these
experiments add value to the physics curriculum in other
ways. The students gain experience with application ofPlanck’s law, infrared ﬁlters, electronics, and programming.The students also gain experience with project managementand the engineering design process. All in all, this experi-ment is an excellent capstone experience for a group ofundergraduate physics majors.

10We ran the model online at <http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/ >.
We used the default parameters, except for the following: Temperature off-
set, 11.1; Locality, “1976 US Standard Atmosphere”; Altitude, 0; “Looking
up.”

15We used the same parameters as above, with the exception of changing the
temperature offset to 16.8 to account for the different surface temperature
and changing the locality setting to “Cumulus Cloud Base.66 km Top
2.7 km.”Table V. Bill of materials for construction of the ground-based instrument.
