This work describes an experimental method for measuring the speed of light in air. It uses optical
feedback from a visible picosecond diode laser operated below the threshold and a voltage-controlled
oscillator to determine the time required for a pulse to travel a known distance. The experimental
setup is compact, ﬁtting into a space of 1 /C20.5 m2, and at the same time, can determine the speed
of light with an uncertainty of 0.03%. The method does not require fast detectors or oscilloscopes.

I. INTRODUCTION
In a previous paper, I described a method for measuring
the speed of light in air using the feedback from a 50-ps
pulsed diode laser triggered by a ﬁxed and stable oscillatorof frequency 80 MHz.1A beamsplitter that reﬂects a portion
of the laser beam to the laser can cause optical feedback,
which can increase the average output power of the laser
when it is operating below threshold. Feedback occurs inpulsed lasers when an emitted pulse is reﬂected back into thecavity and overlaps with another pulse inside the cavity.
When the distance between the laser and the beam splitter
(labelled lin Fig. 1) is an integer multiple of half the separa-
tion between successive laser pulses, a reﬂected pulse
encounters a generated pulse at the laser. For a laser operat-
ing below the threshold, feedback occurs over a much nar-rower distance than the spatial width of the laser pulse itself,which is about 15 mm for a pulse of 50 ps duration. Thus,
one can accurately measure the speed of light in air vby ﬁnd-
ing the positions at which the average power of the laserpeaks due to optical feedback

between the laser and the beamsplitter when the feedback
signal peaks. For f¼80 MHz, l1¼1:88 m, l2¼3:75 m,
andl3¼5:62 m. Since the laser is small and located inside
its container, it is hard to accurately measure the distance
from the beamsplitter to the laser. One needs at least to
observe optical feedback at two different beamsplitter posi-tions to eliminate the need to measure distances from thelaser. For example, using the positions of the ﬁrst two
occurrences of the feedback signal, one can determine thespeed of light from v¼2l
2/C0l1 ðÞ f. Only the difference
between the locations of the beamsplitter when feedbackoccurs is required.
This paper presents a method to measure the speed of light
by employing the feedback from a pulsed picosecond diode
laser triggered by a voltage-controlled oscillator. The advan-
tage of using a variable frequency oscillator over a ﬁxed fre-quency one is that it enables determining the peak of thefeedback signal by scanning the oscillator frequency at aﬁxed beamsplitter position instead of scanning the beams-plitter position at a ﬁxed oscillator frequency. It is usuallyeasier to change the frequency of an oscillator than to change
the location of a beamsplitter on a motorized linear stage.
Also, a variable frequency oscillator is much cheaper than amotorized linear stage. Additionally, unlike a ﬁxed-frequency oscillator where only one beamsplitter positionsatisﬁes Eq. (1)form¼1, multiple beamsplitter positions
can fulﬁll Eq. (1)form¼1 for a variable-frequency oscilla-
tor. Thus, one needs only to know the relative distances
between these beamsplitter positions for m¼1 without
needing to use data for m¼2 to eliminate the need to mea-
sure the distance to the laser, resulting in a compact setup ofa length of about 1 m for pulse frequencies in the range of75 MHz. As in the method of a ﬁxed-frequency oscillator,this method does not require fast detectors or oscilloscopes.The work in this paper is suitable as an experiment for an
undergraduate lab or an independent student project. In addi-
tion to measure the speed of light in air accurately, by doingthis experiment, students may also learn more about pulseddiode lasers, variable-frequency oscillators, frequency coun-ters, computer interfacing, and error analysis.

II. EXPERIMENT
Figure 1shows a diagram of the experimental setup.
Mirrors M1 and M2 steer the beam of picosecond laser DL
to beamsplitter BS, which is positioned on linear stage LS.
The beamsplitter partially reﬂects the laser beam to the laser
and transmits the rest through lens L to photodiode PD. The
laser beam needs to be parallel to the axis of translation of
linear stage LS. The alignment requires replacing beamsplit-
ter BS with an iris and then adjusting mirrors M1 and M2 so
that the incident beam passes through the center of the iris at
both extremes of the stage’s motion range.
The laser generates picosecond pulses of a typical full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of 50 ps, equivalent to a
spatial width of 15 mm. The maximum possible laser pulse
frequency is 80 MHz. For a laser pulse frequency near
75 MHz, optical feedback can occur for a distance of about
2 m between the laser and the beamsplitter. Mirrors M1
and M2 make the setup compact, ﬁtting into a space of
1/C20.5 m2. A voltage signal from data acquisition device
DAQ on voltage-controlled oscillator VCO, which triggers
the laser driver, determines the frequency of the laser pulses.
At a ﬁxed beamsplitter position, voltage-controlled oscillator
VCO changes the frequency of the laser pulses in small steps
while detector PD measures the average laser power. The
power becomes maximum at a frequency whose period
equals the time a pulse needs to travel from the laser to thebeamsplitter and back again. To eliminate the need to mea-
sure distances from the laser, one needs to ﬁnd the frequency
that maximizes the laser power for at least one additional
position of the beamsplitter.
In principle, a counter of a data acquisition device can ﬁnd
the frequency of the laser pulses accurately by counting the
electric pulses from the synchronization signal output (Sync
out) of the laser driver. However, the Sync out of the laser is
not compatible with the input of our data acquisition device.
The Sync out of the laser driver follows the NIM standard of
the levels of fast negative logic signals, while the counter
input follows the TTL standard. Also, the frequency of laser
pulses, about 75 MHz, might be too high for a data acquisi-
tion device. Figure 2shows a reshaping and dividing circuit
used to convert the sync output of the laser driver to a TTL
signal and divide its frequency by 2, 4, 8, or 16. It consists of
two ICs: MC10H125 quad MECL-to-TTL translator and
SN74F136A synchronous 4-bit binary counter.
The following are the models of the components used in
the experiment. These speciﬁc models were chosen because
they were already available in our lab, and other less expen-
sive models might be suitable alternatives. Diode laser DL isa commercial picosecond diode laser system consisting of a
head (LDH-P-C-650, PicoQuant) and driver (PDL 800-B,
PicoQuant). It emits a collimated visible beam at a wave-
length of 657 nm consisting of 50-ps pulses with a repetitionrate up to 80 MHz and an average power up to 6 mW.
Voltage-controlled oscillator VCO (CRBV55CL-0072-0076,
Crystek corporation) has a nominal frequency range between72 and 76 MHz and tuning voltage between 0.3 and 3.3 V.
The two mirrors (BB1-E02, Thorlabs) and the 50/50 beam
splitter (BSW10, Thorlabs) are mounted on kinematic mirrormounts (KM100, Thorlabs). Linear stage LS (NST150/M,
Thorlabs) is a motorized stage having a travel length of
150 mm and is driven by a stepper motor driver (DRV8824,Pololu). The experiment can be carried out without much
difﬁculty using a manual linear stage. Photodiode PD

(DET36A, Thorlabs) has an active area of 3.6 /C23.6 mm, and
its current is ampliﬁed by a transimpedance ampliﬁer
(DLPCA-200, Femto). As only a slow response is measured,
a resistor with an appropriate value that does not saturate thedetector can replace the transimpedance ampliﬁer. Data
acquisition device DAQ (USB-6366, National Instruments)
and LabVIEW code control the voltage-controlled oscillator,drive the linear stage, count the pulse from the reshaping and
dividing circuit, and measure the voltage of the photodiode.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Before collecting data for the speed of light measurement,
it is helpful to ﬁnd the laser threshold. Also, it is necessary to
understand the effect of laser operational conditions on therange of pulse frequencies over which the laser power is
affected by optical feedback. The accuracy of the speed of
light measurement depends on the ability to determine pre-cisely the pulse frequency that maximizes the laser power.
The pulse frequency range becomes very narrow below the
laser threshold, which helps in accurately determining thepulse frequency that maximizes the power.
A 10-turn intensity potentiometer sets the power of our
laser. With no beamsplitter in the path of the laser beam andhence no feedback, Fig. 3shows the dependence of the sig-
nal of photodiode PD, which is proportional to the laser
power, on the intensity potentiometer setting. The threshold
occurs at a potentiometer setting of about 6.8.
The frequency of the laser pulses is measured using the
synchronization signal from the laser driver unit. The electric
pulses from the synchronization signal output are divided by
16 and then counted by the data acquisition device over aspeciﬁc time duration. The counting time may affect the
accuracy of the frequency measurement, and there is a range
of durations for which the accuracy is optimal. For shortcounting times, the length of the counting time itself limits
the accuracy, while for very long counting times, low-
frequency drifts in the oscillator are the limit. The smalldrifts in the voltage controlling the oscillator and the room
temperature are the principal causes of the small and slow
frequency drifts.
The length of counting time can limit the accuracy, because
an error of missing one pulse can occur when counting over a
ﬁxed duration.
4For instance, for measuring a pulse frequency
divided by 16 using a counting time of 0.1 ms, the error in fre-quency measurement caused by missing one pulse can be as
high as 16 /C21=ð0:1m sÞ¼0:16 MHz :Table IIshows the
average and standard deviation for 100 pulse frequency mea-surements for different counting times. The table shows that
up to a counting time of 500 ms, the error in frequency mea-
surement due to drift is smaller than the maximum errorexpected from missing one count during the counting time.
We choose to work with a counting time of 50 ms, becauseTable I. Bill of materials.

the uncertainty in its frequency measurements is much smaller
than that of reading the pulse frequency at which the feedbacksignal peaks, which is 0.002 MHz, as will be shown later.
Also, a counting time of 50 ms provides a relatively short col-
lection time for the signal of the photodiode as a function ofthe pulse frequency. Since the measurements of the pulse fre-quency and the detector signals are simultaneous, the smalland slow drift in frequency the oscillator might experience
does not affect the speed of light measured value.
The beamsplitter needs to be carefully aligned to reﬂect
the laser beam back to the laser. The laser is set slightly
below the threshold, so the beam remains easily visible butnot potentially harmful to the eyes. For rough visual align-ment, the beamsplitter should guide the reﬂected laser beamback to the laser. This rough alignment can be improved by
ﬁnetuning the pointing of the beamsplitter when a peak is
found while scanning the pulse frequency.
Figure 4shows the photodiode signal as a function of the
pulse frequency for different laser intensity potentiometersettings for a ﬁxed beamsplitter position. The detector outputis the time average over many laser pulses and is propor-tional to the average laser power. One might expect that the
disturbance in laser power would occur whenever the gener-
ated and reﬂected pulses overlap. Since their full width athalf maximum is Dt/C2550 ps, the disturbance would be mea-
sured for l’s within the range Dl¼vDt. From Eq. (1), with
f/C2573 MHz, the m¼1 feedback disturbance would have

Optical feedback is a nonlinear process. When the laser is
near or above the threshold, the feedback from the tail of the
pulse is large enough to cause power disturbances over fre-
quency ranges exceeding 1 MHz, as in Fig. 4(a). When
the laser is operated well below the threshold, power distur-bance ranges become much narrower than the 1 MHz range.Figure 4(b)shows that at a potentiometer setting of 6.100, it
is possible to determine the frequency at the peak power
within 0.002 MHz.
Unlike continuous-wave laser operations, where the gain
is always less than the loss below the threshold, in pulsedoperations, the laser gain can exceed the loss over a shorttime below the threshold. When the reﬂected pulse falls on
the laser while the laser gain exceeds the loss, the generatedpulse becomes more ampliﬁed. The duration of the time, forwhich the laser gain is larger than the loss, becomes shorterand shorter as the laser operation point moves lower andlower below the threshold. Reference 1provides a detailed
mathematical description of the effect of optical feedback onpulse generation.
For eight different frequencies, the translation stage was
adjusted to ﬁnd the position xat which the feedback signal
reached a maximum. The feedback distance l

where x0is a constant (unmeasured) offset distance. x0is
the distance between the laser and the beamsplitter whenthe position of beamsplitter on the linear stage is zero. Foreach beamsplitter position, the beamsplitter needs to beadjusted slightly to make the reﬂected beam fall back intothe laser. Also, the intensity potentiometer needs to beadjusted slightly to make the size of the feedback distur-
bance signal optimal for accurate determination of its peak
frequency.

necting the data points is a non-linear ﬁt according to Eq. (3), and the dashed

measured frequencies is much smaller than the frequencies themselves.

with the speed of light in air 2 :997/C2108m=sa taw a v e -
length of 657 nm. As the measurement involves light
pulses, the measured speed should correspond to the group
speed of light in air. However, the difference between thegroup speed and the phase speed of light in air is relativelysmall, and both speeds are within the error bars of the mea-sured value.
The error bars for position and frequency measurements
are too small to be displayed in Fig. 5. Two factors affect
the accuracy of the position measurements: Positioningrepeatability on the linear stage, which is 0.001 mm, andthe alignment of the laser beam along the translational axisof the linear stage. The error in position due to misalign-
ment is estimated to be less than 0.015 mm from the small
amount the knobs of the beamsplitter mount need to rotateto make the reﬂected beam fall back into the laser when thebeamsplitter moves between the extremes of the beamsplit-ter position range. The error in reading the peak frequency
of the feedback signal, such as that shown in Fig. 3(b),i s
0.002 MHz, which is much larger than the maximum errorin measuring the frequency of the oscillator, 0.00032 MHz.The dominant contribution to the error of measuring the
speed of light is the error coming from determining the fre-
quency of the peak of the optical back signal, which ismuch larger than that due to position measurement.For example, using the two extreme data points in Fig. 5to
calculate the speed of light, the contribution to the percent
error in speed measurement from position uncertainty,from Eq. (3), is 100 /C2dx=Dx ðÞ ¼100/C20:015=140 ðÞ

Depending on how much of the setup and alignment is
performed in advance, this experiment could be completed
during a teaching lab period or built as a longer-term studentproject. Additional exercises related to the experiment are
