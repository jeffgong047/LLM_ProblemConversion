Approximate insightful ODE solutions
Sanjoy Mahajan
90(12), p. 887
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0131531Rather than only teaching students to solve differential
equations—either computationally or analytically—the authorsuggests that also showing them how to ﬁnd approximate sol-utions yields increased insight into physical behavior.
Graphical analysis of an oscillator with constant
magnitude sliding friction
V. Roitberg and Alon Drory
90(12), p. 889
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0073812Physics instructors are aware that when uniform circular
motion is projected onto an axis, the motion is identical to thatof an undamped harmonic osc illator. But what if the oscillating
mass experiences sliding friction? This paper shows that itsmotion can be found from the inward spiral of a mass attachedto a string that winds around two nails. This analysis techniqueis simple, powerful, and pedagogically helpful to students inter-ested in understanding motion impacted by frictional forces.
Charging a supercapacitor through a lamp: A power-law
RC decay
Michelle L. Storms and Brad R. Trees
90(12), p. 895
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0065500The exponential decay of the current in an ideal RC circuit
is a standard part of the introductory physics curriculum, but areal circuit involves subtleties not present in an idealizedmodel. Here, the authors present experimental, analytical, andcomputational results indicating that power law decay of thecurrent (not exponential decay) is found in circuits containinga supercapacitor and a lamp. This power law behavior is ulti-mately due to the temperature dependence of the lamp’s resis-tance. These are fertile pedagogical grounds, offeringinstructors the ability to emphasize differences between expo-nentials and power laws as well as an opportunity to makeconnections between thermal physics and electronics.Students will beneﬁt from such investigations as they developskills in reﬁning and updating scientiﬁc models.
Exploration of the Q factor for a parallel RLC circuit
J. G. Paulson and M. W. Ray
90(12), p. 903
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0074843The series RLC circuit is a staple of undergraduate physics
courses. Circuits involving different arrangements of thesesame components are less well-studied in standard curricula.
Such variations, therefore, are excellent candidates for labo-
ratory activities or student projects. The subject of this paperis the parallel RLC circuit, with special attention paid to thequality factor (Q-factor) which quantiﬁes dissipation. When
they ﬁrst encounter it, students may be puzzled by the coun-
terintuitive behavior of this circuit: why does the dissipationdecrease when the resistance is increased? This paperdescribes investigations and analyses that students may per-form while attempting to understand this mystery.
A simple electronic circuit demonstrating Hopf
bifurcation for an advanced undergraduate laboratory
Ishan Deo and Krishnacharya Khare
90(12), p. 908
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0062969Dynamical systems that exhibit Hopf bifurcations provide
a rich mathematical playground, but such scenarios are oftendifﬁcult to realize in the lab. This paper presents a nonlinear
electronic circuit that transitions between stable states via a
Hopf bifurcation, which can be analyzed with nonlinearequations derived from a repressilator-like transistor circuitin an advanced undergraduate laboratory setting.
The size of the Sun
M.A. Fardin and M. Hautefeuille
90(12), p. 914
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0081964Combining dimensional arguments on macroscopic and
microscopic scales, this article offers a surprisingly accessi-
ble comprehensive overview of stellar structure for beginners
in the ﬁeld. These theoretical ideas could be incorporatedinto a variety of upper-level undergraduate courses.
An introduction to the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method
Wenlong Wang
90(12), p. 921
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0122488Monte Carlo algorithms are one of the workhorses for simu-
lating thermal systems. Most practitioners use these algorithms
with only a cursory understanding of why they work. Wangprovides a pedagogical discussion of the underlying concepts ata level that undergraduate physics majors can follow.

Laboratory measurements of the speed of light often require
carefully controlled motion over long distances. This papershows that it can be measured with an uncertainty of 0.03%using a compact set-up with only 150 mm of throw, makinguse of feedback into a sub-threshold picosecond laser.
Data transmission in a multimode optical fiber using a
neural network
Tom A. Kuusela
90(12), p. 940
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0102369This paper demonstrates how a neural network can be
trained to recognize images that have been scrambled as a
result of transmission through a multimode optical ﬁber. Anoptical system, which can be easily replicated in most opticalinstructional laboratories, inputs a two-dimensional image toa step-index ﬁber and outputs a speckle pattern image at theﬁber’s end, which is acquired by a digital camera. A simpletheory of neural networks is presented and then implementedon the acquired data to model transmission through the ﬁber,providing pattern recognition with high accuracy. The manu-script will be useful in advanced undergraduate opticscourses and discusses many interesting topics, includinglight propagation in optical ﬁbers and its use in communica-
tion, laser speckle patterns, and neural networks as a method
for machine learning.
A Bose horn antenna radio telescope (BHARAT) design
for 21 cm hydrogen line experiments for radio astronomyteaching
Ashish A. Mhaske, Joydeep Bagchi, Bhal Chandra Joshi,
Joe Jacob, and Paul K.T.
90(12), p. 948
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0065381The design of a cost-effective radio telescope for use in
hands-on training in radio astronomy is presented. The
highly efﬁcient and easy-to-build system, which is tunedto detect the 21-cm hydrogen emission line, employs a
dual-mode conical horn antenna and off-the-shelf elec-
tronic components. Calibration methods are discussed, fol-lowed by experimental results acquired using this system
to determine the rotation curve as well as structure of the
Milky Way galaxy. The antenna is named in honor ofIndian physicist and pioneer in radio-wave scienceJagadish Chandra Bose. A summary of Bose’s work is
included in the paper.
