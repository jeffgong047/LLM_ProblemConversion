The possibility of stating the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the increasing behaviour
of a physical property establishes a connection between that branch of physics and the theory ofalgebraic inequalities. We use this connection to show how some well-known inequalities, such as
the standard bounds for the logarithmic function or generalizations of Bernoulli’s inequality, can
be derived by thermodynamic methods. Additionally, we show that by comparing the globalentropy production in processes implemented with decreasing levels of irreversibility but subject to
the same change of state of one particular system, we can ﬁnd progressively better bounds for the
real function that represents the entropy variation of the system. As an application, some newfamilies of bounds for the function log ð1þxÞare obtained by this method.

I. INTRODUCTION
In addition to the interest that algebraic inequalities pre-
sent from a purely mathematical point of view, they are also
fundamental tools in physics, economics, statistics, and
likely in any branch of science that employs mathematics in
its formal description. Inequalities involving elementary
functions appear so frequently in other disciplines that the
problem of bounding them is an important issue. One of the
most ubiquitous elementary functions is the (natural) loga-
rithm, for which the following bounds are probably well
known by the reader
x
1þx/C20logð1þxÞ/C20x;x>/C01: (1)
In what follows, we refer to Eq. (1)as the standard bounds
for the logarithmic function. From a geometric point of
view, the standard bounds are a consequence of the concave
behaviour of the function fðxÞ¼logð1þxÞ: Since a con-
cave function is upper-bounded by its tangent line at anypoint, fis bounded by the function t(x)¼x, which is its tan-
gent line at x¼0; the lower bound is an equivalent form of
the upper bound, obtained by the change of variable
zþ1¼1=ðxþ1Þ. Although the power and simplicity of the
standard bounds are indisputable, in practical applications
sharper bounds could be useful, so improvements of Eq. (1)
have been obtained by several researchers, albeit at the
expense of simplicity.1–3
In this work, we address the problem of improving the
bounds given in Eq. (1)by a method based on physical
considerations. According to the second law of thermody-
namics, the entropy of the Universe increases in any real
physical process. Consequently, a symbolic expression for
the entropy variation is always non-negative. This idea
can be traced back to the nineteenth century, where it was
ﬁrst used to prove the inequality between the arithmetic
and geometric means,4a proof that has been indepen-
dently rediscovered at least six times.5–10The thermody-
namic relevance of this particular inequality has been
revealed in the context of studies of the efﬁciency of
reversible heat engines operating between ﬁnite and inﬁ-
nite reservoirs.11A related concept here is the fact that the global entropy
change is a measure of the departure of a thermodynamicprocess from the reversible limit. This implies that if wecompare the entropy production in two processes in whichthe system undergoes the same change of state, less entropy
will be produced in the implementation that is closer to that
limit. This fact allows us to obtain a sharper bound for theentropy variation of the system, which, of course, is thesame in both cases since entropy is a state function.
The method explored here not only allows students to
deduce familiar results from an unusual starting point but
also to obtain potentially novel results employing accessible
tools. Including this perspective while teaching these topicsmight motivate curiosity and autonomous research instudents.
The outline of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II,w eo b t a i n
the standard bounds for the logarithmic function by performing
an entropy analysis of a simple physical system undergoing a
speciﬁc process. In Sec. III, we explain in detail the general
method that allows us to improve the bounds for the entropyvariation of the system. In Sec. IV, we apply this method to
ﬁnd sharper bounds for the logarithmic function. Remarks and
conclusions are presented in Sec. V.
II. DERIVING EQ. (1)BY AN ENTROPY ANALYSIS
First, we show how the natural bounds for the logarithmic
function, Eq. (1), can be obtained by thermodynamic argu-
ments. Consider an incompressible solid with constant heat
capacity C(system A), which undergoes a process from an
initial temperature TþDTdue to thermal interaction with
the environment at temperature T(system B). The entropy
variation of the solid is as follows:
DS
A
1!2¼ClogT
TþDT/C18/C19
¼/C0 Clogð1þxÞ; (2)
where x¼DT=T(notice that x>/C01 since the environment
cannot be at zero temperature). Applying the ﬁrst law and
using the fact that the variation of internal energy of an
incompressible solid is DU¼CðTf/C0TiÞ, we can obtain the
energy exchanged by the environment during the process

QB¼/C0 QA¼CDT: (3)
Hence, the entropy variation of the environment (modeled as
a thermal reservoir) is as follows:
DSB
1!2¼QB
T¼Cx: (4)
From Eqs. (2)and(4), we obtain the following:
DSUniv
1!2¼DSA
1!2þDSB
1!2¼Cx/C0logð1þxÞ ½/C138 : (5)
The key point is that, according to the second law of thermo-
dynamics, the global entropy change is always positive, sofrom Eq. (5)and using that C>0, we conclude that
logð1þxÞ/C20x;x>/C01; (6)
so the upper bound is established. On the other hand, the
analysis of the opposite process due to thermal contact of the
solid with a thermal reservoir B
0at the original temperature
TþDTleads to the following entropy variations of the solid
and the reservoir:
DSA
2!1¼ClogTþDT
T/C18/C19
¼Clogð1þxÞ (7)
and
DSB0
2!1¼Q0
B
TþDT¼/C0CDT
TþDT¼/C0Cx
1þx; (8)
so from the global entropy balance we conclude that
DSUniv
2!1¼Clogð1þxÞ/C0x
1þx/C20/C21
/C210; (9)
from which the lower bound is deduced.
The above procedure is completely general and allows us
to obtain bounds for other types of functions if other systems
and processes are considered instead of an incompressiblesolid. For example, consider the following bounds for the
function ð1þxÞd(generalized Bernoulli’s inequalities12):
1þx
1þxð1/C0dÞ/C20ð1þxÞd/C201þdx; (10)
with 0 <d<1 and x>/C01. To obtain these inequalities by
thermodynamic arguments, consider an ideal gas with con-
stant speciﬁc heat capacities cPandcv,which is contained in
a thermally isolated piston-cylinder device. The system isinitially in an equilibrium state at temperature T
1and pres-
sure P1produced by the action of the atmosphere and the pis-
ton on the gas. Suppose that we suddenly add a load over the
piston in such a way that the external pressure increases tothe value P
2¼P1þDP. It can be shown that after transient
oscillations, the system will reach a new equilibrium state atpressure P
2.13Deﬁne the quantities
x¼DP
P1;d¼R
cP; (11)
where Ris the gas constant. Performing the entropy analysis,
the following inequality is obtained:logð1þdxÞ/C0dlogð1þxÞ/C210; (12)
a result equivalent to the right inequality in Eq. (10). As the
reader may suspect, the lower bound arises on consideringthe process that takes place when removing the load from the
piston and waiting for the new equilibrium state to be
reached at the initial pressure. The details of these deriva-tions can be found in the supplementary material.

III. IMPROVING THE BOUNDS: GENERAL
PROCEDURE
Now consider a thermodynamic system (A) that undergoes
an irreversible process 1 !2 between two equilibrium states
due to the interaction with its environment (E). Since theglobal entropy change is non-negative
DS
Univ¼DSAþDSE/C210; (13)
we must have
/C0DSE/C20DSA; (14)
so the quantity /C0DSEis a lower bound for DSA.
Now suppose that instead of performing the process
1!2 directly, we have the system pass through an interme-
diate equilibrium state before reaching the ﬁnal state. Notethat since entropy is a state function, the entropy variation of
Ais the same in both cases. Applying the second law to the
global process, we obtain that
DS
0Univ¼DSAþDS0E/C210; (15)
where DS0UnivandDS0Edenote the new entropy changes of
the universe and the environment in the alternative process.
Of course, this provides another lower bound for the entropychange of A,
/C0DS
0E/C20DSA: (16)
Now, the inclusion of an intermediate equilibrium state in
the trajectory implies that the new process is closer to thereversible limit than the original process and, as a conse-
quence, less entropy is produced (see the supplementary
material
14)
DS0Univ/C20DSUniv: (17)
From Eqs. (13),(15),(16), and (17), we conclude that
/C0DSE/C20/C0DS0E/C20DSA; (18)
which implies that the lower bound for DSAgiven in Eq. (16)
is sharper than that given in Eq. (14). By including more
intermediate equilibrium states in the process, sharperbounds for DS
Acan be found.
IV. APPLICATION: APPROXIMANTS FOR log ð11xÞ
Here, we apply the above method to the process that led to
Eq.(1). As the method suggests, the idea is to perform the
process from temperature TþDTto temperature Tin steps,
introducing an intermediate equilibrium state. This can be
done by placing the solid in contact with another thermal
367 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 5, May 2023 Andr /C19es Vallejo 367 04 October 2023 22:52:08
reservoir ( R) at temperature T0¼TþpDT, where 0 /C20p
/C201. When thermal equilibrium with Ris reached (process
1!20), the energy exchanged by the reservoir Ris
QR¼Cð1/C0pÞDT, so its entropy varies by the amount
DSR
1!20¼QR
TþpDT¼Cð1/C0pÞx
1þpx: (19)
Finally, we remove the solid from contact with Rand let it
release energy to the environment at temperature T(process
20!2), so the ﬁnal state of Ais the same as that in the origi-
nal process. During the second stage, the energy absorbed bysystem EisQ

in
DSE
20!2¼QE
T¼Cpx: (20)
Then, from Eqs. (2),(19), and (20), for the global process
1!20!2, we obtain
DS0Univ
1!2¼Cð1/C0pÞx
1þpxþpx/C0logð1þxÞ/C20/C21
/C210: (21)
From this, the family of upper bounds for log ð1þxÞarises
as follows:
logð1þxÞ/C20xð1þp2xÞ
1þpx/C17f2
pðxÞ; (22)
forx>/C01;0/C20p/C201. The superscript in f2
pðxÞdenotes the
number of steps used, and the subscript represents the frac-tion of the global process covered at the end of each interme-diate stage. Since the process 1 !2
0!2 is closer to the
reversible limit than the original process, we conclude thatEq.(22) is a sharper upper bound for log ð1þxÞthan that
given in Eq. (1)
logð1þxÞ/C20f
2
pðxÞ/C20x; (23)
with x>/C01;0/C20p/C201; see Fig. 1. Taking the derivative of
f2
pðxÞwith respect to pand setting it equal to zero, we ﬁnd
that, for ﬁxed x, the value of pthat minimizes the new boundispmin¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
xþ1p
/C01=x, which when replaced in Eq. (23)
allows us to conclude that
logð1þxÞ/C202ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
xþ1p
/C01/C0/C1
/C20f2
pðxÞ/C20x; (24)
with x>/C01;0/C20p/C201. This provides a potential approxim-
ant of order 1/2, certainly tighter than the family of approxi-mations given by f
2
pðxÞ, whose growth for large values of xis
linear.
As we have already mentioned, it is possible to obtain better
bounds by dividing the process into more stages. As an exam-ple, let us assume that we perform the cooling process fromtemperature TþDT(state 1) to temperature T(state 4) in three
steps, allowing the system to thermalize with reservoirs at tem-peratures Tþ2DT=3( s t a t e2 ) , TþDT=3 (state 3), and ﬁnally
with the environment at temperature T. The total entropy pro-
duction obtained in this process can be shown to be:
DS
Univ
1!3¼Cx1
3þ2xþ1
3þxþ1
3/C18/C19
/C0logð1þxÞ/C20/C21
;(25)
so comparing this process with the two-step cooling process
already studied (using p¼1/2), we obtain that
logð1þxÞ/C20f3
1=3;2=3/C20f2
1=2/C20x; (26)
forx>/C01, where
f3
1=3;2=3¼xð2x2þ18xþ27Þ
3ð3þxÞð3þ2xÞ; (27)
and
f2
1=2¼xð4þxÞ
4þ2x: (28)
This is illustrated in Fig. 2. Considering the heating process
from temperature Tto temperature TþDTand following the
same procedure, it is also possible to improve the lowerbound for log ð1þxÞgiven in Eq. (1). For instance, the
reader may verify that if the system thermalizes with a reser-voir at temperature TþpDTbefore reaching the ﬁnal state,

the following intermediate lower bound can be deduced from
the global entropy balance:
x
1þx/C20x1þxpð2/C0pÞ ½/C138
ð1þxÞð1þxpÞ/C17g2
pðxÞ/C20logð1þxÞ;(29)
with x/C21/C01, and 0 /C20p/C201, see Fig. 3. The value of pthat
maximizes g2
pðxÞfor each xis the same as that in the previous
case, so substituting in Eq. (29), we obtain
x
1þx/C20g2
pðxÞ/C2021/C01ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
xþ1p/C18/C19
/C20logð1þxÞ;(30)
with x/C21/C01, and 0 /C20p/C201.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The increase in entropy in every physical process estab-
lishes a connection between thermodynamics and the theoryof algebraic inequalities that, in our opinion, deserves further
exploration. In the ﬁrst part of this work, we have employed
this connection to obtain a well-known set of bounds for thelogarithmic function. The inequalities are being generated
from a physics postulate, which is remarkable since they are
true independently of any thermodynamic considerations(and even if the second law turns out to be false). Whether
this kind of reasoning represents a formal proof of these
inequalities has been the subject of debate in the past, partic-ularly in the context of derivations of the inequality between
the arithmetic and geometric means.
15–17Certainly, our view
is critical about the logical consistency of thermodynamicproofs, since it is the maximization of entropy that assures
that the imposed ﬁnal state is, in fact, the equilibrium state.
However, it is important to remark that we did not need tomaximize the entropy to recognize the equilibrium state: It
can be deduced from empirical considerations such as the
intuitive fact that the ﬁnal temperature of a small system thatexchanges energy with a thermal reservoir must coincide
with the temperature of the reservoir. This implies that the
underlying inequality associated with a particular process isnever known or employed explicitly, but it is learned after
the entropy balance is performed. In that sense, it isundeniable that the thermodynamic method constitutes a
credible path towards the construction of true algebraic
inequalities. Some of them may be well-known results, but
others are possibly new. This has an intrinsic value regard-less of whether the process employed can or cannot be con-sidered a formal proof. Of course, if the readers feel
uncomfortable, they can try to demonstrate the inequalities
that arise from the thermodynamic analysis through tradi-tional methods.
It is a well-known fact that in partitioning a thermody-
namic process to bring it closer to the reversible limit, less
entropy is produced. This implies that when performing the
entropy analysis for the new process, a different inequality isobtained in which the terms involved are closer than those
generated in the original inequality. As we have shown, this
property allows us to improve the bounds for the logarithmicfunction found in Sec. II, but, of course, the validity of the
method is not restricted to that particular function. In fact,
bounds for a wide class of functions can be obtained and
improved if, instead of using ideal gases and incompressiblesolids, other substances (even hypothetical, with a more
complex dependence of the entropy on the other thermody-
namic properties) are employed.
We believe that, in addition to their power to deduce new
algebraic inequalities, the methods applied in this work havean interesting didactic value and can motivate students, espe-
cially those with a markedly mathematical proﬁle, to delve
into the study of thermodynamics.
