Conway’s classic game of life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton in which each cell is alive
or dead and evolves according to simple rules that depend solely on the number of live cells in its
immediate neighborhood. The emergence of complex multi-cellular objects provides a fascinatingvehicle for exploration. A variant of the classic game of life is presented, the generalized semi-
classical game of life, in which each cell contains a qubit that evolves by repeated application of
birth, death, and survival operators. Species are characterized by just two parameters: a preferredneighborhood liveness representing the tendency to herd and a resilience parameter representing
species’ vulnerability to environmental changes. This generalized model provides the opportunity
to model the fortune of species and to compare to available data. The model is shown to mimicenvironmental catastrophes and is illustrated by the model’s prediction of a return to the pre-
hunting level of the global whale population by 2140. A student-designed predator–prey model is
shown to qualitatively describe the fate of strongly- and weakly coupled predator–prey systems(snowshoe hare/lynx and rabbit/fox, respectively) and sudden and slow predatory impact (dodo and
diprotodon, respectively).

I. INTRODUCTION
Conway’s classic game of life was developed in the late
1960s and became the most popular cellular automaton inhistory.1–3Each cell of a two-dimensional matrix is either 1
(alive) or 0 (dead) and may change value at each time step
according to a set of simple evolutionary rules that depend
solely on the number of live cells in the eight cells of itsimmediate neighborhood, known as the Moore neighbor-hood.
4The rules dictate for each cell whether a birth (0 !1),
death (1 !0), or survival (0 !0;1!1) event takes place.
Conway’s rules are designed to mimic the evolution of a
society of organisms in which fortunes are based on the localenvironment. If the number of live cells in the neighborhoodis too high or too low, the cell dies due to overcrowding or
loneliness, but ﬂourishes if the surrounding liveness is opti-
mum. Repeated application of the evolutionary rules to eachcell at each time step (called a generation) can lead to anextraordinary myriad of complex patterns of live and deadcells.
5,6Flammenkamp has catalogued 100 static and
dynamic objects referred to as “ash,” but which are moreoptimistically referred to as “lifeforms.” These objects sup-ply a fascinating example of the development of complexity
through simple evolutionary rules.
Conway’s original game of life has been the subject of
many studies with most of the works published in prominentphysics journals. Common themes include statistics and statis-tical mechanics,
7,8nonlinear dynamics,9and critical behav-
ior.8,10There have been numerous adaptations of Conway’soriginal game, including the introduction of a thermodynamic
variable,7a three-dimensional version,11extension to Turing
machines,12modiﬁcation to a continuous space,13and proba-
bilistic adaptations.14
Of interest here is the quantization of Conway’s game
introduced and developed by Flitney and Abbott where eachlive-or-dead cell is replaced by a qubit.15–17The underlying
principles of Conway’s original game are retained with amodiﬁed set of evolutionary rules in which qubits evolve via
the application of birth, death, and survival operators. The
game’s creators termed the game “semi-quantum” becausesystems do not evolve time-reversibly. An educational illus-tration of the qubit is provided by L /C19opez-Incera and D €ur.

The quantization of the game of life moves the game
toward biological applications. The emerging discipline ofquantum biology studies the evolution of quantum objectsinﬂuenced by the local environment. General quantumaspects of life are discussed in Ref. 19. The semi-quantum
game of life has a parallel in quantum biology where a qubit
may represent an exciton produced by a photon in a proteincomplex during photosynthesis.
20The exciton interacts with
its environment to inﬂuence the energy transfer dynamics.21
A simpliﬁed version of the semi-quantum game of life has
been introduced in which the cell qubit components arerestricted to real numbers. This classical variant is denotedas the semi-classical game of life (SCGOL) to distinguish it
from the semi-quantum game of life and Conway’s classic
game. Intriguing new phenomena were discovered duringstudent project work, including chaotic effects and new

lifeforms composed of live cells, dead cells and part-live
cells, plus objects that mimic seeds.22
Cellular automata, such as the SCGOL, are ideal for
undergraduate projects that are designed to extend computa-
tional skills to matrix-based programming languages such as
MATLAB .23Moore neighborhood calculations and application
of boundary conditions are nontrivial problems that can beefﬁciently coded. Graphical presentation is well developed
and quickly mastered by students. Once the fundamental
rules are implemented, a wide range of different physicalphenomena can be explored. Mathematical game-based cel-lular automata have been shown to be effective at educatingstudents in the emergence of complexity
24and logical think-
ing.25All MATLAB software used in this article is provided in
the supplementary material.26
In the following, we generalize the SCGOL model to
model the evolution of a species by choosing two ﬂexiblychosen parameters: one representing the tendency of a spe-cies to herd and a resilience parameter representing vulnera-
bility to environmental changes. Section IIdescribes the
generalized semi-classical game of life (gSCGOL) modeland its evolutionary rules. Section IIIpresents case studies of
the catastrophic decline and subsequent recovery of a spe-cies, and examples of predator–prey behavior. We summa-
rize our results in Sec. IVand conclude that gSCGOL
provides exciting opportunities for original undergraduateresearch. Suggestions for new models are made in Sec. V.
II. THE GENERALIZED SEMI-CLASSICAL GAME
OF LIFE
The rules of the gSCGOL are based on a semi-quantum
adaptation of Conway’s game proposed by Flitney and
Abbott.
15Each cell of a two-dimensional grid is described
by a normalized qubit jwi, which is a superposition of alive
j1iand dead j0istates such that

where aandbrepresent the “liveness” or “deadness” of a cell,
respectively. In the gSCGOL, aandba r eb o t hr e s t r i c t e dt or e a l
numbers between 0 and 1. Thus, a cell may be “part live” or,
in the spirit of Schr €odinger’s cat, a superposition of both dead
and alive. In practice, the gSCGOL model merely converts the0 or 1 dead-or-alive structure of Conway’s classic game to onewith a liveness density determined by the value of aat each
cell. No claim to quantum-ness is made nor justiﬁed, even
though the gSCGOL is underpinned by quantum principles.
The qubit at each cell location interacts with its Moore
neighborhood liveness Aand is modiﬁed according to a set
of evolutionary rules. The Moore neighborhood liveness isdeﬁned as

borhood surrounding a cell and periodic boundary conditions

: (3)Each cell evolves at each generation following the appli-
cation of a cell-dependent generation operator ^Gaccording
to the algorithm by Flitney and Abbott designed to mimic
Conway’s classic game.15The generation operator ^Gappli-
cable to a cell is constructed from the birth, death, and sur-vival operators, the Moore liveness Afor the cell, and the
two parameters, A
0andR. The rules that deﬁne ^Gare pro-
vided in Table I.
The gSCGOL is parameterized by A0andR. A 0is the opti-
mum, or the preferred Moore neighborhood. In Conway’sgame, A
0¼3 because a cell with exactly three neighbors
becomes alive if dead and stays alive otherwise. In contrast,the gSCGOL allows any real number in the range1/C20A
0/C207. The resilience Rdeﬁnes when rule changes take
place in terms of a change in Aas seen in the ﬁrst column of
Table I. In Conway’s integer-based games, R¼1, because
the evolutionary rules may change at each integer value of A
and each Adiffers by 1 unit. The gSCGOL accommodates
any choice of Rprovided that A0/C0R/C210 and A0þR/C208.

The operation is not unitary and so the new state is normal-
ized to ensure that ja0j2þjb0j2¼1. The system evolves by
the repeated application of ^Gplus normalization to each cell
at each generation. The extraordinary complexity of the vari-ous games of life is due to the interaction of each cell withits neighborhood at each generation.
III. SPECIES MODELS
Games of life are so-called due to the emergence of aggre-
gations of live cells that mimic multi-cellular organisms.These complex lifeforms arise from an apparent soup of live
and dead cells purely by repeated application of simple rules.
With one exception (the stationary block object shown inFig.2), these lifeforms are not of interest here – it is the rules
which allow the gSCGOL to act as a novel species modelthat we exploit. Because the parameters A
0andRcan take on
many possible values, the gSCGOL provides many moreopportunities for exploring species dynamics.
The optimum liveness A
0is the preferred Moore liveness
and is a measure of the tendency of a species to herd, orequivalently, its sociability or gregariousness. Herding ani-mals possess a large A
0and solitary creatures, such as bum-
ble bees and snow leopards, a small value. The resilienceparameter Rrepresents a measure of the sensitivity of the
species to deviations of Moore liveness from its optimum.
Table I. The ^Goperator for the gSCGOL game is deﬁned for different
ranges of the Moore liveness A. The optimum Moore liveness is A0, and the
resilience parameter is R.

A species such as coral, which is highly sensitive to sea tem-
perature, has a small value of R, whereas a more robust spe-
cies, such as ants, have a large value of R. The gSCGOL
characterizes a species by the values of the parameter pair
(A0;R).
A simulation proceeds by ﬁrst deﬁning a species by choos-
ing the values of ( A0;R). Qubits with random liveness aand
normalized to unity are assigned to each cell of a two-
dimensional grid. The gSCGOL rules presented in Table I
are applied, and the mean liveness haiof the system is
recorded. The process is repeated until haiﬂuctuates about a
mean value indicating a steady state liveness has been
achieved. This step is akin to achieving energy equilibrium
in molecular dynamics. The system with the parameter pair
(A0;R) is now ready for the simulation proper to start.
The environment can be controlled through the resilience R
and deteriorating environmental conditions can be modeled bydecreasing R. Examples are presented in Sec. III A. Alternatively,
two species can interact by ﬁrst characterizing each species by
their values of ( A
0;R) and then introducing predation rules. The
two systems run in parallel through the execution of the gSCGOL
simulation while simultaneously interacting via the predationrules. Examples are presented in Sec. III B.
A. An environmental catastrophe model
More than 37,000 species are threatened with extinction.27
The biggest driving force of species extinction is human
activity, primarily through loss of habitat,28pollution, cli-
mate change,29,30and unsustainable hunting and harvesting.
The second most signiﬁcant cause is due to invasive species,
leading to predation or the introduction of infectious
diseases.31–33
The decline of a species is modeled by a reduction of the
resilience. The optimum liveness A0remains constant and
the resilience Ris reduced at each generation. The mean liv-
eness haiof the system is also recorded at each generation.
The results for the mean liveness for the parameter sets
(3:0;R) and (2 :5;R) are shown in Fig. 1. As anticipated, hai
declines steadily as the resilience Rdrops from R¼2.0 until
a tipping point is reached whereupon the mean liveness
drops sharply toward zero. Liveness density maps are dis-
played for systems with R¼0.93 and R¼2.0 for A0¼3:0.The sudden fall in liveness associated with a small reduc-
tion in Ris characteristic of catastrophe theories.
Catastrophe theory was developed by Thom in the 1960s,
but came into vogue in the 1970s when applied to the biolog-ical and social sciences.34–36The critique by Sussman and
Zahler provides the most accessible description of catastro-
phe theory and its applications.35Catastrophe theory predicts
that35
x3/C0x¼a: (5)
Equation (5)was solved for x(representing the mean liven-
ess) for a(representing resilience) ranging from –0.21 to
–0.09 in steps of 0.001 to establish the extent to which the
gSCGOL modelling matches the predictions of the purelymathematical description of an extinction process. The curve
was scaled and offset to match the gSCGOL data for
A
0¼3:0. The result is shown by the solid line for R/H114071:0i n
Fig. 1. The decline in mean liveness as the resilience is
reduced is matched by Eq. (5)but only until R/C251 below
which Eq. (5)offers no solution.
The dashed line represents the “catastrophe limit” or
“tipping point” at which point the catastrophe theory predicts
haidrops instantaneously to zero. The purpose of the com-
parison is to illustrate the differences in predictions between
catastrophe theory and the gSCGOL model for R/H113511:0. For
R/H113511:0, the gSCGOL decline is steep but not inﬁnite and hai
does not drop to zero. Both differences are important in the
analysis that follows and illustrates that the gSCGOL offers
a more realistic description of the decline of species thandoes catastrophe theory.
We now explore the ability of a species to recover from
severe population decline. The premise is that once the mean
liveness haidrops below a pre-chosen threshold, humans
will act to restore the environment to its original state or
environmental conditions naturally improve. The system is
ﬁrst subject to a deteriorating environment modeled by incre-mentally reducing the resilience R. Then, once the pre-
chosen threshold liveness density has been breached, Rrises
incrementally.
Figure 2presents the mean liveness as a function of gener-
ation displayed in years for three systems, each with the
parameter set (3 :0;1:0). A constant mean liveness haiis ﬁrst

cated by dotted lines. The inset shows a “block” object (see the text).

established. After 50 yr (marked by the arrow), the resilience
is decreased by 0.01 a year reﬂecting a gradual deterioration
in environmental conditions. At this stage, the population
density declines identically in each system. In one system,the resilience decline is reversed once the population density
has declined by 50%. The other two systems follow suit once
haihas dropped by 70% and by 90%, respectively.
The horizontal dotted lines indicate the population
declines of 50%, 70%, and 90%. These act as trigger points
for the improvement of environmental conditions and areversal of the decline in R. At these points, Rincreases at
the same rate of 0.01 each year. All populations are found to
continue to decline after the trigger point when the environ-mental conditions improve. The drop in Rof 0.01 per year is
too rapid to allow equilibrium liveness to be attained in a sin-
gle year. and it takes time for populations to recover.Encouragingly, all populations eventually recover.
We ﬁrst apply the gSCGOL model to qualitatively explore
the fortune of whales. Whales have been a human resource for
millennia, but whaling started to increase in the 18th century
and accelerated signiﬁcantly in the 19th century with the devel-
opment of harpoon technology.
37The inﬂuence of American
whaling spread worldwide and became a multi-million-dollar
industry by the beginning of the 20th century. It is thought by
some scientists “that more whales were hunted in the early1900s than in the previous four centuries combined.”
37Despite
the reduction in whaling after its peak in the early 1900s, the
number of whales in the ocean continued to decline. In 1946the International Whaling Commission was established to over-
see whaling quotas, but whale numbers continued to decline. In
1982, the International Whaling Commission called for a mora-
torium on commercial whaling, and the whale population
s t a r t e dt or e c o v e r .
The results of a gSCGOL model designed to mimic the
population of whales in response to human predation are
shown in Fig. 3. The annual decline commences in 1760 with
a reduction in resilience of 0.001 per annum. The peak of theslaughter is presumed to occur in about 1900 when the model
whale population had declined by 70%. This decline acts as
the trigger point for an improvement in resilience reﬂectingreductions in hunting. From 1900, the resilience is increased
by 0.001 per annum. The whale population continues to
decline and reaches a minimum at about 1960 reﬂecting a
model reduction of more than 90% from the pre-1700 norm.After 1960, the whale population starts to recover, and by
2020, the population is approximately 2.5 times its 1960 low,but is still 80% below the pre-1700 level. The model predictsthat the whale population will fully recover by about 2140.
Of course, the decline and recovery of the whale popula-
tion cannot reliably be quantitatively matched by a modelthat establishes a smooth decline of the species resilience fol-lowed by an equally smooth recovery. In addition, reliablehistorical population data for the actual worldwide whalepopulation are not available. Nonetheless, there are somestriking qualitative similarities between the limited dataavailable and the general features of the gSCGOL model pre-sented in Fig. 3.
We now return to Figs. 1and2to explore extinction. In
Fig. 1, the mean liveness with A
0¼2:5 drops to zero as the
resilience Ris reduced and the species becomes extinct. In
this case the gSCGOL has mimicked the fate of the sabre-tooth tiger, the woolly mammoth, the dodo, the Tasmaniantiger, and countless other extinct species. In contrast, forA
0¼3:0 liveness does not decline to zero as can be seen in
Figs. 1and2.
An object (a local persistent conﬁguration) is created that
is resistant to reduction in resilience. This object is illustratedin the inset of Fig. 2and comprises four fully live cells (liv-
eness a¼1). This object appears in Conway’s classic game
as the second most common lifeform called the “block.”6In
the gSCGOL, the surrounding cells are nearly, but not quite,dead. Their liveness is small such that each live cell has aMoore neighborhood fractionally more than 3 such that theevolutionary rules in Table Ienable survival to the next
generation.
The liveness of the cells surrounding the block approaches
zero as the resilience is reduced. The local environmentimproves as Rincreases, and the liveness of the surrounding
cells increases and eventually the block evolves into newobjects and the liveness of the system increases. The blockobject therefore acts as a seed. It is able to lie dormant untilthe environmental conditions change so that the seed canevolve. The concept of a seed was introduced in Ref. 22in
the context of a SCGOL with a lifeform denoted by “qutub”
containing part-live cells. The qutub remains dormant untilcertain conditions are met, and then evolves when the condi-tions are breached. An analogy is with plant seeds, but cer-tain specialized animal species may exhibit a suddenblossoming of life after a dramatic environment-improvingevent such as rainfall.
38,39
In the context of the gSCGOL species model, the appear-
ance of the block object whose liveness deteriorates slowlyas environmental conditions worsen reﬂects a populationthat has plummeted but has not quite become extinct. A fewsurviving lifeforms remain. These remnants are able toincrease their numbers once the environment improves.There are numerous examples of the rediscovery of speciesthought to be extinct. Two or three species per annum previ-ously considered extinct have been found,
40most recently
the Madagascan dusky tetraka.41Their numbers fall so low
they are difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
B. Predator–prey modelling
A predator–prey relationship is a set of complex interac-
tions between a predator and a prey inﬂuenced by effectssuch as climate, habitat, and competing predators. The gen-eral features of the outcome of such interactions may beFig. 3. A gSCGOL model simulation of the whale population in response to
human predation with A0¼3:0 and resilience R¼1.0. In 1760 (arrow), Ris
reduced by 0.001 per annum. Ris increased by 0.001 per annum after the
population declined by 70% (dotted line).

modeled using the gSCGOL. The starting point is the strong
predator–prey interdependence illustrated by the lynx and
the snowshoe hare. In this case the predator exhibits a strong
reliance on a speciﬁc prey for its food, and suffers if its foodsource is diminished. The fortunes of the predator and preywith less impactful interactions are then explored and illus-
trated with examples.
The gSCGOL model starts with two independent species
characterized by the parameter sets ðA
0;RÞ¼ð 4:0;1:50Þfor
the prey and (1 :5;0:49) for the predator. Simulations are ini-
tially executed with no interaction between the species to
establish the steady state liveness of each species. The meanliveness is hai
eq;prey¼0:483 for the prey in the absence of
predation and haieq;pred¼0:202 for the predator with an
abundance of food; the subscript denotes the steady state
independent liveness density.
After 20 generations, the predator–prey interactions are
switched on. The resilience of a species is a measure of its
vulnerability to changes to its environment and the preda-
tor–prey interaction changes the resilience parameters Ri;prey
andRi;predat each generation i. A generation does not neces-
sarily correspond to a single year. We adopt the relations
Ri;prey¼Rmin;preyþfi;predðRprey/C0Rmin;preyÞ (6)
fi;pred¼1/C0haii;pred
haieq;pred(7)
Ri;pred¼Rpred/C0fi;preyðRpred/C0Rmin;predÞ (8)
fi;prey¼1/C0haii;prey
haieq;prey: (9)
These relations recognize that the resilience of the prey
diminishes as the predator liveness increases and the resil-ience of predators falls if there is less food. The new parame-
ters R
min;prey and Rmin;pred describe the strength of the
interaction between the two species. All the simulationresults presented in Fig. 4are for R
min;pred¼0:39, which is
the minimum value of the resilience that can possibly lead to
the survival of an isolated predator system with optimum liv-eness A
0¼1:5. Changes of the single parameter Rmin;prey
therefore allows outcomes due to different interaction
strengths and types to be explored.
Figure 4displays four sets of results. Two sets show both
the predator and prey population densities as a function ofgeneration. The ﬁrst pair is labeled as lynx and hare and pro-
vides a classic predator–prey outcome with strong interac-
tion. The lynx relies heavily on the snowshoe hare for itsnutritional needs.
42The gSCGOL is executed with
Rmin;prey¼1:15 with the interaction activated at generation
20. The population density of the prey drops rapidly. Theresilience of the predator then declines according to Eq. (9)
due to the scarcity of food, which in turn provides an oppor-
tunity for the prey to recover. Unlike idealized predator–prey
distributions modeled by coupled differential equations, themagnitude of oscillations diminishes signiﬁcantly after the
ﬁrst fall and rise. The ﬁrst predator peak occurs 67 genera-
tions after the ﬁrst peak of the prey population. After the ﬁrstoscillations, ﬂuctuations are clearly visible in both popula-
tions beyond 700 generations and a correlation analysis con-
ﬁrms predator peaks continue to be separated by about 70generations. The distribution of prey liveness is uniform atthe start of the simulation, but the reduced population density
is not uniform. The prey clusters with empty space betweenthem is shown by the single cluster in the snapshot in Fig. 4.
This spatial conﬁguration arises to ensure that the preyachieves the optimum Moore neighborhood liveness despitea loss of numbers. We see that the gSCGOL model mimicsnature where populations gather in regions with plentifulfood resources.
In Canada, the snowshoe hare population cycles approxi-
mately every 10 yr with dramatic changes in population.
43
This behavior is only partially reproduced by the gSCGOLmodel where peaks and troughs may differ by a factor ofthree at most. A gSCGOL cycle repeats every 300 genera-tions corresponding to 10 yr for the real lynx-hare system.The gSCGOL predator cycle lags by about 70 generations,
or two years, in agreement with observation.
43Additional
factors contribute to the rapid ﬂuctuations of the snowshoehare population. The habitat cannot support high hare densi-ties and so starvation and increased predation exacerbatepopulation change. These factors could be included in amodiﬁed gSCGOL model.
The second example represents the fox, a more diverse
predator, and the rabbit, its primary prey, Here the predatoris omnivorous and has a broad diet including rodents, birds,and frogs as well as berries and scavenging. The weakerpredator–prey interaction is executed with R
min;prey¼1:36.
The rabbit population declines without oscillations to about50% of its predator-free equilibrium. The fox populationdrops by just over 20%.
The third (dodo) and fourth (diprotodon) systems in Fig. 4
show the fortunes of a prey in circumstances where the pred-
ator–prey interaction is one-way. In each case, the predator
is unaffected by changes in the liveness density of the preyso that the resilience of the predator R
i;pred¼Rpred is
unchanged at each generation. The dodo is modeled by aninstantaneous reduction of the resilience from 1.5 to 1.0. Theslower demise of the diprotodon is modeled by the reductionof resilience of 0.0001 per generation.
The dodo was a large ﬂightless bird found only on
Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It is believed that it becameﬂightless due to the abundance of resources and lack of pred-ators on the island. The ﬁrst recorded account of the dodo

least partially due to predation. The inset is the model representation of a

was in 1598 by Dutch sailors who established a small island
trading settlement. There is scant evidence of impactful
human predation, but the introduction of non-native species,
especially pigs and crab-eating macaques, led to the destruc-tion of the ground nests and competition for food.
44Dodo
sightings were rare by the 1660s and the best estimate of its
extinction is 1693.45The dodo is modeled by a single instan-
taneous drop in resilience to 1.29 in Fig. 4. Assuming one
generation corresponds to one year, the dodo population
drops by 90% after 60 yr and is extinct within 99 yr, match-
ing the observations well.
The fourth example cites the diprotodon. The diprotodon
was a large marsupial native of Australia and one of many
that became extinct about 46,000 yr ago.46The decline of
large mammals in Australia over a period of a few thousandyears is striking: “All Australian land mammals, reptiles, andbirds weighing more than 100 kg, and six of the seven genera
with a body mass of 45–100 kg, perished in the late
Quaternary.”
46The cause of the Australian megafauna
extinctions could be due to climatic change, human preda-
tion, and/or loss of habitat due to human activity.46–48
Because many of these species survived for millions of years
and numerous ice ages before the arrival of humans in
Australia, it is tempting to point the ﬁnger at humans. A kill
every few months could lead to long-term populationdeclines for animals with a slow rate of reproduction.
The gSCGOL model for the diprotodon decrements R
i;prey
by 0.0001 at each generation. The result is presented in
Fig.4. The population decline is slow, dropping by just 15%
after 1200 yr. Thereafter, the rate of population declineincreases mirroring the catastrophe curves seen in Fig. 1.I n
this model, the diprotodon survives little more than 1500 yr.
This example highlights the difﬁculties of conservation. Theadverse impact of humans on a species may not be apparent
until its tipping point is reached.
IV. SUMMARY
Cellular automata are widely used in undergraduate phys-
ics projects and in courses designed to develop students’
skills, especially in matrix-based programming languages,
data management, and graphical presentation. Fascinatingcomplex phenomena can be explored on the basis of simple
algorithmic rules allowing individualized research projects
in species ecology. Skills developed include learning a pro-gramming language, data management using matrices, appli-cation of boundary conditions widely used in simulations,
and data interpretation and analysis in the context of often
very limited literature data. In addition, the gSCGOL modelincreases student understanding of qubits and operators as
taught in quantum mechanics courses.
We used the gSCGOL to describe a species through just
two parameters: the preferred neighborhood liveness A
0
describing the tendency of a species to herd and a resilience
parameter Rrepresenting sensitivity to changes in the local
environment. The gSCGOL model is shown to mimic envi-ronmental catastrophes in which a species becomes extinctbut, more optimistically, also demonstrates that a population
can survive in pockets and recover if the local environment
improves. The decline and recovery of the global whale pop-ulation was modeled using limited qualitative population
data as a guide and predicted a return to pre-hunting whale
populations by about year 2140.Predator–prey modeling requires two interacting species
each with distinct ( A
0;R) values. Equations of interaction
were given, and the results were presented for the snowshoe
hare-lynx and rabbit-fox systems. The dodo and diprotodonwere modeled in the context of systems in which the resil-
ience of the predator is unaffected by the presence or
absence of a speciﬁc prey. In all cases, qualitative agreement
with limited data is obtained.
The Matlab ﬁles supplied in the supplementary material
26
may be used as a basis to tackle some of the suggested prob-
lems below.
V. PROBLEMS
The gSCGOL requires two primary parameters: the pre-
ferred neighborhood liveness A0and the resilience R. A herd-
ing species typically has A0/H114074 and the gSCGOL will then
yield population distributions that mimic herds. A resilience
R/C251 is a good starting value. Suitable changes in Rat each
time step are required for some studies and are guided by
species data. Normally, a time step corresponds to one year(representing the natural breeding cycle) but corals, for
instance, deteriorate and recover at a much faster rate.
Example values for predator–prey models may be found inSec. III B.
Problem 1. The gSCGOL opens up numerous possibilities
for undergraduate projects where students can study the
demise and recovery of a species of their choice. Many spe-
cies have more reliable data available than the whale popula-
tion studied in Sec. III A . Changes in the Indian elephant
population due to forest defragmentation
49,50and loss of
African elephant populations due to the ivory trade51are
examples.
Problem 2. Corals are worthy of exploration because haz-
ards faced are many and varied. Kayal et al.52provided an
excellent summary of hazards with sources. The Palmyra
atoll was newsworthy in July 2022 because of a rapid recov-ery from bleaching as reported by Khen et al.
53Hughes et al.
presented the relation between global warming and bleach-
ing in Ref. 54.
Problem 3. The woolly mammoth constitutes an obvious
extinction study, but useful quantitative data are lacking. A
useful starting point is Ref. 55, which discusses the demise
of the woolly mammoth due to climate change and human
impact.
Problem 4. Numerous near-extinct species are slowly
recovering, and many others are in the process of decline.Examples for study exploiting the properties of the block
object discussed in Sec. III A include the Lord Howe Island
stick-insect, which was considered extinct until a climberdiscovered fresh remains in 1960 and was rediscovered in
2001 on a cliff,
56and a presumed extinct nocturnal wolf spi-
der spotted on a United Kingdom military base for the ﬁrst
time in 27 yr.57
Problem 5. More optimistically, the block object discussed
in Sec. III A can be exploited as a “seed” to model species
reintroductions. The dramatic success of the red kite in the
United Kingdom is a prime example of a successful reintro-
duction with available data.58
Problem 6. A related and interesting predator–prey study
on red kites and rabbits is possible using data on red kite
populations located within high density rabbit areas in
Spain.59
