An oblique collision of an object with a rigid surface involves an initial sliding phase that persists
throughout the collision at glancing angles of incidence but which involves a subsequent grip phaseat higher angles of incidence. The grip phase itself terminates towards the end of the collision if the
contact region starts to slide backwards. Experimental evidence of the three separate stages of the
collision process is presented using a high speed video camera to ﬁlm the impact of a rubber disk
on a rigid horizontal surface. A simpliﬁed model of the process is presented, providing analytical
solutions that are at least qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.

I. INTRODUCTION
An oblique angle collision between a sphere or a disk with
a rigid surface has been studied by many authors and is rea-
sonably well understood.1–8It is known that the colliding
object will slide along the surface throughout the collision if
it is incident at a glancing angle, but it will grip the surface
at higher angles of incidence. That is, the contact patch on
the object slides to a stop during the collision, and the fric-
tion force between the object and the surface changes from
sliding to static friction. If the contact patch comes to a stop
while the rest of the object continues to move forwards, then
the object will deform in a tangential direction as well as in adirection normal to the surface. The static friction force on
the contact patch can, subsequently, reverse direction, result-
ing in a decrease in the net horizontal impulse and a decrease
in the impulsive torque acting on the object.
Oblique angle collisions are of interest in many different
ﬁelds, including the impact of a sports ball with a striking
implement or playing surface, or impacts between small
granular particles or larger objects such as vehicles or astro-
nomical objects. In the present paper, the physics of the col-
lision process is examined for a speciﬁc case where the edgeof a soft rubber disk impacts a smooth, rigid surface.
Qualitative features of the collision are illustrated in Fig. 1
for a case where a circular object is incident from left to right
without spin on a horizontal surface. Figures 1(a) and1(b)
correspond to a glancing-angle collision where the friction
force F¼lN, where lis the coefﬁcient of sliding friction
andNis the normal reaction force. Both FandNincrease to
a maximum when the vertical compression of the object is a
maximum, then decrease to zero when the object leaves the
surface. The friction force acts to decrease the horizontal
speed of the object from v
x1tovx2, and the torque FRacts to
increase the rotation speed of the object to x2in a clockwise
sense, where Ris the radius of the object.
Figures 1(c)and1(d) correspond to a collision at a higher
angle of incidence where the bottom of the object slides to a
stop during the collision. During the sliding stage, F¼lN,
but the bottom of the object slides to a stop when vx¼Rx,
corresponding to a rolling condition. That is, the tangential
velocity at the bottom of the object, Rx, relative to the center
of mass, is equal and opposite to the horizontal velocity of
the center of mass. If the object actually started to roll then F
would suddenly decrease to zero and the object would
rebound with vx2¼Rx2since there would be no furtherchange in vxorx. However, the object grips the surface
when the bottom of the object comes to rest and then static
friction acts to extend the duration of the friction force, so
Rxincreases to a value greater than vxduring the collision.
While the bottom of the object remains at rest, the top of the
object vibrates forward and then backwards, resulting in a
reversal in the direction of F. Nevertheless, the object usu-
ally rebounds in an overspinning mode with Rx2>vx2. Near
the end of the collision, the object loses its grip since N
decreases towards zero. If the object slides throughout the
collision, as it does at glancing angles, then it rebounds with
Rx2<vx2.
Experimental results have been presented previously
which are consistent with the qualitative results shown in
Fig.1.2–5Experimental studies tend to focus on the rebound
speed and the angle and spin of the colliding object when theincident speed, angle, and spin are varied, yielding values for
land the coefﬁcients of restitution in the vertical and hori-
zontal directions. High speed video provides additional
information on vertical compression of a bouncing ball, but
very few studies have been reported on deformation of a ball
in the horizontal direction. The main problem is that it is not
possible to examine the interior of a bouncing ball using avideo camera. In the present paper, experimental and theoret-
ical results are presented for the oblique bounce of a 74 g,
70 mm diameter, 20 mm thick Chutex rubber disk, with a
focus on deformation of the disk in the horizontal direction.
A soft rubber disk (Duro 40) was chosen so that horizontal
deformation could be more easily observed.
A typical result is shown in Fig. 2where the disk was inci-
dent at 6.3 m/s on a smooth ceramic tile, without spin and atan angle of 31
/C14to the horizontal. The disk commenced slid-
ing, then gripped the surface, and then the contact region slid
backwards as the disk lifted off the surface. Radial lines and
white dots drawn on the disk show that the upper region of
the disk continues to rotate even while points at the bottom
of the disk remain at rest, and the incident and rebound
velocity of points at the bottom of the disk are opposite insign, in both the vertical and horizontal directions.
II. COLLISION MODEL
A detailed two-dimensional numerical model of an
obliquely impacting ball or disk is given by Maw et al. ,1
together with experimental data for steel and rubber disks.2
However, this model is much too advanced to present to

undergraduate students. A much simpler analytical version of
the model is presented in this section to capture the basic phys-ics and to compare with the results presented in Sec. III.T h e r e
is no fundamental difference between the two models apartfrom the fact that the simple model assumes that the contactregion either slides or grips the surface, whereas the model ofMaw et al. assumes that outer parts of the contact region can
continue to slide when the inner part grips the surface, depend-ing on the pressure distribution over the contact region.
The geometry of an oblique angle collision of a spinning
disk (or a ball) on a rigid horizontal surface is shown in
Fig.3(a). In most ball sports, the ball is incident on a surface
with spin, so spin is included here to cover those situations.The disk is incident with spin x
1at speed v1and at an angle
h1to the horizontal with velocity components vx1¼v1cosh1and vy1¼/C0 v1sinh1. For a disk of mass mand radius R, the
moment of inertia about the central axis is Icm¼amR2. For a
uniform solid sphere, a¼2=5, and for a uniform disk,
a¼1=2.
During the collision, the change in the horizontal speed of
the center of mass is described by the relationF¼/C0mdv
x=dt, the change in the vertical speed is described
byN¼mdvy=dt, and the change in the angular velocity is
found from FR¼Icmdx=dt. The gravitational force is usu-
ally negligible compared with the normal impact force on abouncing object, typically 50–500 times smaller, dependingon the incident speed and the stiffness of the collidingobjects. Initially, the disk slides on the surface, and Facts in
the negative xdirection.
The end result of the collision can be determined by inte-
grating the above relations over the duration of the collision,assuming that the relevant coefﬁcients of restitution are
known. To determine the behaviour of the disk during the
collision itself, it is necessary to examine the initial slidingphase, the subsequent grip phase, and the ﬁnal sliding phaseseparately. The three separate phases can be modelled interms of the coefﬁcient of sliding friction, the stiffness ofthe disk in the vertical direction, k
?, and its stiffness in a
direction parallel to the impact surface, kk. The stiffness of
the disk in the vertical direction can be represented by a lin-
ear spring of stiffness k?located between the bottom of the
disk and the horizontal surface, as indicated in Fig. 3(b).
The disk compresses mainly at the bottom of the disk, and
the spring represents the stiffness of that compressed region.

from t¼2.50 to 4.17 ms and then slide backwards while the center of the disk moves to the right throughout the collision.

, and the disk rebounds in the vertical direction
at speed vy2¼/C0 vy1if there is no energy dissipation in the
disk or the spring. A more realistic model could be obtained
using a nonlinear and lossy spring, but any given ball ordisk would then require a speciﬁc set of parameters to model
the nonlinearity and energy loss during the collision.

Since vxdecreases and xincreases with time, the disk will
grip the surface if vx¼Rxduring the collision. The static
friction force on the disk during the grip phase can beexpressed in the form F¼k
kx, where kkis the stiffness of
the disk in a direction parallel to the horizontal surface and x
is the horizontal displacement of a point near the bottom of
the disk, as indicated in Fig. 4. Then d2x=dt2¼/C0x2
kx, where
xk¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃkk=mEpandmE¼m=ð1þ1=aÞis the effective mass
of the bottom region of the disk. The effective mass is deﬁned
by the relation F¼/C0mEd2x=dt2where dx=dt¼vx/C0Rx,whereas the acceleration of the center of mass is given by
F¼/C0mdvx=dt. The contact surface at the bottom of the disk
remains at rest but points just above the bottom stretch by a
horizontal distance x, as indicated in Figs. 2and4.
In Fig. 4, the upper part of the disk exerts a shear force on
the lower part, even while the disk is sliding. It is assumed
that the spring in Fig. 4is compressed during the sliding
phase and stops compressing when the bottom of the diskcomes to rest. At that point, the sliding friction force on the
disk decreases to zero and is replaced by a static friction
force, in much the same way as static friction changes tosliding friction when a block on an incline starts sliding
down the incline.

ing phase. The relevant solutions during the grip phase are

Note that vxin Eq. (4)is the horizontal velocity of the center

During the grip phase, there is no change in the total
energy of the disk since Fis a static friction force. The total

during the grip phase.
Towards the end of the impact, the static friction force
reverses direction if xk>x?, as it usually is.4If the magni-
tude of the static friction force increases to the value lN,
then the disk will commence to slide backwards on the sur-

Solutions of Eqs. (1)–(7) can be obtained to provide rea-
sonably good ﬁts to experimental data by varying l,k?, and
kk. Typical results are shown in Fig. 5with v1¼2:5 m/s,
l¼0:7, and k?¼30 kN/m and with (a) h1¼30/C14and kk
¼26:5 kN/m or (b) h1¼70/C14andkk¼16:2 kN/m. In both
cases, the maximum value of Nis at least 80 times larger
than the weight of the disk (0.72 N), and the disk rebounds inan overspinning mode with Rx
2=vx2¼2:0, and with vx2=vx1
¼0:5 and ex¼0.5. The quantity exis the tangential coefﬁ-
cient of restitution deﬁned by ex¼ðRx2/C0vx2Þ=vx1when
x1¼0. The latter deﬁnition represents the ratio of the tan-
gential speed of the impact point after the collision to thetangential speed before the collision and is analogous to thenormal coefﬁcient of restitution, /C0v
y2=vy1. The quantities
vx2=vx1andexdepend on the kk=k?ratio at any given angle
of incidence. Solutions at other values of kk=k?are shown in
Fig.6,f o rh1¼30/C14;50/C14and 70/C14, also with l¼0:7.
As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the kk=k?ratio results
in an increase in vx2=vx1and a decrease in exat any givenangle of incidence. At higher angles of incidence, any given
combination of vx2=vx1andexvalues requires a decrease in
thekk=k?ratio. The calculated values of vx2=vx1andexin
Figs. 5and 6are consistent with the relationsÐFd t¼mðvx1/C0vx2Þ¼amRx2, where Fis integrated over
the duration of the collision. Those relations can be com-
bined with the deﬁnition of exto show that

Alternatively, if ex¼0 then vx2=vx1¼0:667, and if ex¼1

ex¼0.5 implies thatÐFd t¼0:5mvx1, which can be satisﬁed
by a suitable choice of the kk=k?ratio at any given angle of

throughout the impact and are also possible at higher anglesof incidence, as observed experimentally using a hollow rub-
ber ball.4Values of exgreater than 0.9 arise when kk=k?is
about 0.5, corresponding to a frequency ratio xk=x?about
1.2. The latter result is consistent with the prediction made
in 1969 by Garwin that the unusual properties of a superball
arise because its transverse vibration frequency is about the
same as its vertical vibration frequency.7
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The experimental result in Fig. 2was obtained by throw-
ing the rubber disk at a relatively high speed by hand in a
vertical plane so that it landed on its edge on a smooth, hori-zontal tile. However, this technique often resulted in the diskrebounding out of the vertical plane. To measure the reboundparameters as a function of the incident angle, the disk wasprojected at a lower speed by hand across a smooth, horizon-
tal surface to impact the tile, attached in a vertical plane to a
heavy brick. That way, the disk was incident and reboundedFig. 5. Solutions of Eqs. (1)–(7) for a rubber disk with m¼0.074 kg, R¼0.035 m, v1¼2:5 m/s, l¼0:7, and k?¼30 kN/m. In (a), h1¼30/C14andkk¼26:5

t¼0.9 ms then grips and then slides backwards when t>4.1 ms. In both cases, vx2=vx1¼0:5,ex¼0.5, and Rx2=vx2¼2:0.

in the same horizontal plane. Each impact was ﬁlmed from
above at 600 or 1200 frames/s to measure the incident andrebound speeds and angles using Tracker motion analysissoftware. The incident speed varied from 2.0 to 3.1 m/s, andthe magnitude of the incident spin was less than 2 rad/s. Themeasurement accuracy for both the linear and angular speedswas62%, but variations from one bounce to the next
resulted in random errors of about 65%.
Figure 7shows the normal coefﬁcient of restitution, COR
¼/C0 v
y2=vy1and COF ¼ðvx1/C0vx2Þ=ðvy2/C0vy1Þvsh1. COF is
an effective coefﬁcient of friction, deﬁned as the ratio of thehorizontal to the vertical impulse, and is equal to the coefﬁ-cient of sliding friction, l, if the disk slides throughout the
collision. Otherwise, COF <lsinceÐFd t<lÐNd t if the
disk grips the surface during the collision.
The COR was 0.72 60.03 when h
1>20/C14and increased
to 0.8260.05 when h1<20/C14. The COF decreased from amaximum value of 0.82 at h1¼10/C14to 0.02 at h1¼85/C14but
did not remain constant in the pure sliding region where0<h
1<20/C14. Consequently, a clear estimate of lwas not
obtained, apart from the fact that 0 :6<l<0:82.
The transition from pure sliding to a grip phase was identi-
ﬁed from measurements of S2¼Rx2=vx2andexshown in
Fig.8. The quantity S2is an outgoing spin parameter, equal
to 1.0 if the disk rolls without slipping at the end of theimpact. The quantity e
xis equal to zero when S2¼1 and is
negative in the pure sliding region where Rx2<vx2. When
h1>25/C14,exremains almost constant at a value of 0.5 60.1,
a result similar to values observed previously with rubberballs and superballs.4Similarly, vx2=vx1remains almost con-
stant at a value of 0.45 60.05 when h1>25/C14. These results
can be explained by a decrease in the kk=k?ratio as the angle
of incidence increases, as shown in Fig. 6. Alternatively,
effects not included in the simpliﬁed model may be involved

here. For example, the normal reaction force does not neces-
sarily act through the center of mass and is commonlyobserved to be offset towards the front of a ball or disk, aneffect that would reduce the outgoing spin of the disk.

An alternative method of displaying the experimental
results is one presented by Maw et al.1,2Those authors plot-
ted the angle of reﬂection of the contact point vs the angle ofincidence of the contact point. An equivalent plot is pre-sented in Fig. 9, showing b

b1¼/C0 vx1=vy1. If the disk slides throughout the impact and
ifx1¼0, then Eqs. (1)and (2)indicate that vx2¼vx1

þ2lð1þaÞ=aÞifvy2¼/C0 vy1as assumed in Eqs. (1)and(2).
The results in Fig. 9indicate that the disk slides throughout
the impact if h1<23/C14and grips the surface if h1>23/C14, con-
sistent with the results in Fig. 8. The results are qualitatively
similar to those obtained by Maw et al.2for a rubber disk
impacting on a rubber block, but those authors observed puresliding only when h
1was less than about 5/C14since the coefﬁ-
cient of sliding friction of rubber on rubber was much higherthan that observed in the present experiment. Measurementerrors are much more signiﬁcant at very low angles ofincidence.
IV. CONCLUSION
The oblique impact of a ball or a disk on a rigid surface is
a complicated process involving an initial sliding phase andsubsequent grip and reverse sliding phases at high angles ofincidence. A simple analytical model of the process is pro-vided to explain the basic physics involved, at a level appro-priate for undergraduate students. The stiffness of a ball ordisk in the tangential direction is greater than the stiffness inthe normal direction, leading to a reversal of the frictionforce during the grip phase and a signiﬁcant increase in theoutgoing spin. Measurements obtained by ﬁlming the bounceof a rubber disk on a smooth tile show the three stages of theprocess quite clearly and indicate that horizontal deformation
of a bouncing ball or disk is just as important as vertical
deformation in determining the outcome. For the rubber disk
during the grip phase, the vertical coefﬁcient of restitutionwas 0.72 60.03, the horizontal coefﬁcient of restitution was
0.560.1 and the outgoing spin factor S
2¼Rx2=vx2
increased from 1.5 to 2.5 as the incident angle increased.
The coefﬁcient of sliding friction varied from 0.6 to 0.82 at
glancing angles of incidence where the disk continued to
slide throughout the collision.
The experimental results for the disk are consistent with
the analytical model. A more detailed comparison with
experimental data would require a much more complicated
and nonlinear numerical model such as that described byMaw et al.
