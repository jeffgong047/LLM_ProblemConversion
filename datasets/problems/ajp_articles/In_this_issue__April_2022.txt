Balloon-borne two-channel infrared spectral photometer
for observation of atmospheric greenhouse effect by
undergraduates
Gerard T. Blanchard, Fawaz A. Adesina, William Cole
Belkwell, James R. Dyess, Victoria A. Frabbiele, Conor S.
McGibboney, and Ryan D. Rumsey
90(4), p. 256
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009284The greenhouse effect is a crucial parameter of cli-
mate change, but it is difﬁcult to exhibit in tabletopexperiments. This paper proposes a student project that,
by launching Arduino-based radiation sensors in a bal-
loon, measures that the radiation emitted by the Earthand its atmosphere towards space has an effective tem-
perature that decreases with altitude. They also measure
the effects of water and CO
2absorption. This undergrad-
uate project could be adapted for ground-based experi-
ments and can also serve as a practical illustration of
Planck’s law.The analog computer: Beyond the museum artwork, a
tool for studying linear and nonlinear systems
Marcello Carl /C18a
90(4), p. 263
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009634There was a time when physicists would argue whether
analog or digital computing would win out as the more use-
ful technology. Remember, in 1969, NASA used analog and
hybrid (analog computers controlled by digital electronics)computers for simulations and (some) ﬂight control in theApollo 11 mission! This era is now gone, but analog com-
puters are still an interesting pedagogical tool, as this manu-
script shows. In particular, educators can introduceundergraduate students to operational ampliﬁers-based elec-
tronic circuits that constitute the building blocks for analog
computing: the summing node, the integrator, and the multi-plier module. From there, solutions for linear and non-linear
oscillators can be derived, thus relating electronic circuits to
more general physics problems.
How physics textbooks embed meaning in the equals sign
Dina Zohrabi Alaee, Eleanor C. Sayre, Kellianne Kornick,
and Scott V. Franklin
90(4), p. 273
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009096Experts in physics may take for granted many steps in the
problem-solving process that have become deeply ingrained
after years of practice. These concepts may not be part of atraditional physics course, but, nevertheless, they might need
to be taught. One such concept, often taken for granted, is
the meaning of the equals sign. In this article, readers willﬁnd a categorization scheme of many possible meanings that
are encoded into an equals sign in physics. This article will
be of interest to educators wanting to gain a fresh perspectiveon the difﬁculties their students may face when trying to
interpret mathematical formulae.
Simulation led optical design assessments: Emphasizing
practical and computational considerations in an upperdivision physics lecture course
Vincent M. Rossi
90(4), p. 279
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064138Computation-based simulations in an optics course allow
students to gain practical experience in optics at the sametime that they develop coding skills. The author has devel-
oped a sequence of computational exercises that take stu-
dents from an introductory level (in both optics and coding)to the design and simulation of optical systems such as spec-
trometers and polarization-imaging microscopes. These
exercises are described in the paper, and the author shares

Continuous gravitational waves in the lab: Recovering
audio signals with a table-top optical microphone
James W. Gardner, Hannah Middleton, Changrong Liu,
Andrew Melatos, Robin Evans, William Moran, DeekshaBeniwal, Huy Tuong Cao, Craig Ingram, Daniel Brown, andSebastian Ng
90(4), p. 286
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009409In the past few years, we have all been thrilled by the
“chirps” detected by LIGO and other gravitational wave
(GW) observatories. These tiny signals are generated by
binary systems containing black holes and/or neutron stars inthe brief moments before their coalescence. The same obser-vatories are also searching for continuous GWs, signals that
are nearly constant in frequency and persist for years, emittedby non-spherical spinning neutron stars. The authors describea tabletop Michelson interferometer–a mini-GW detector–thatuses sound vibrations to perturb its interference pattern in amanner similar to GW detection. They then introduce theViterbi algorithm, a signal processing technique used by GWobservatories to detect signals that drift slowly in frequency,and demonstrate its effectiveness using their tabletop appara-tus. Finally, the authors review a number of signal-processingtechniques, employing their apparatus as an “optical micro-phone” to demonstrate each technique’s effectiveness inrecovering speech and music in noisy environments. Theapparatus can be used as a demonstration of GW detection fornon-specialists, or, with an added emphasis on signal process-ing, in physics, engineering, or cross-disciplinary classes.
Relativistic spin-0 particle in a box: Bound states, wave
packets, and the disappearance of the Klein paradox
M. Alkhateeb and A. Matzkin
90(4), p. 297
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009408This informative relativistic supplement to an introductory
undergraduate course in quantum mechanics introduces theKlein-Gordan wave solution as a single particle wave func-tion. With the interpretation of negative energy states as rep-resenting anti-particles, one gains a recognition of the scalarproduct as representing charge density, and this constitutes a
ﬁrst step toward quantum ﬁeld theory. Indeed, the Klein par-
adox itself, with its production of an ampliﬁed current inci-dent on a single potential energy barrier, has as yet neither asound theoretical basis nor experimental grounding regard-ing the behavior of bosons conﬁned to a classical potential
well. In addition, students will appreciate the multiple scat-tering analysis that leads to a classical particle interpretation.
Energy-mass equivalence from Maxwell equations
Alejandro Perez and Salvatore Ribisi
90(4), p. 305
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009156Einstein’s equation expressing the relationship between
mass and energy, E¼mc
2, is perhaps the most famous equa-
tion in physics. Historically, the relationship between massand energy predated the equivalence principle, one of thecornerstones of general relativity. In this article, the equiva-lence principle is used to derive Einstein’s most famous
equation. Even though it did not come about this way histor-
ically, the exploration of this connection can still be peda-gogically useful for those interested in special relativity,general relativity, and the connection between the two.
Phase plot of a gravity pendulum acquired via the
MEMS gyroscope and magnetic field sensors of a
smartphone
T. Splith, A. Kaps, and F. Stallmach
90(4), p. 314
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009254
With a smartphone serving as the bob of a gravity pendu-
lum, the pendulum’s time-dependent angular displacement
and velocity are produced from data acquired from thephone’s gyroscope and magnetometer sensors via the phy-
phox app. Experimental phase-space plots from the analysis
of these data are presented, along with ﬁts to the expectedtheoretical curves. This experiment is suitable as a lecture
demonstration as well as an instructional laboratory experi-
ment. Detailed instructions on how to adopt the experimentare provided in the supplementary material.
Marinated eggs: An engaging quantitative demonstration
of diffusion
Carson Emeigh, Hyeonggeun (Luke) Bak, Dilziba
Kizghin, Haipeng Zhang, and Sangjin Ryu
90(4), p. 317
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0062178Many cultures feature foods in which a ﬂavored sauce is
infused into hard-boiled eggs. The authors use eggs soakedin red food coloring to show that this process follows Fick’slaw of diffusion, creating a fun and engaging demonstration
or laboratory exercise for undergraduates.
