Resource Letter MP-4: The Manhattan Project and
related nuclear research
B. Cameron Reed
91(7), p. 495
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0149901The legacy of the Manhattan Project extends beyond the
creation of the atomic bombs that ended WWII to the tech-nology that became the basis of numerous peaceful applica-tions such as nuclear power and nuclear medicine. It is nowonder that the story of the Manhattan Project continues to
fascinate the public, as shown by the release of the summer
2023 ﬁlm, “Oppenheimer.” Adding to the ﬁrst threeResource Letters on the Manhattan Project, this newResource Letter includes over 140 new sources (books, jour-nal articles, videos, and websites) that describe the history,physics, personalities, and educational materials related tothe Manhattan Project.
Memories of a mid-20th century electrical measurements
laboratory and its instrumentation
Thomas B. Greenslade, Jr.
91(7), p. 510
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0155766In the mid-20th century, the junior year E&M course typi-
cally had a rigorous laboratory component in which studentsconducted precision electrical measurements using basic–butquite elegant–apparatus: galvanometers, bridges, standardcells, resistors, capacitors, etc. Return to that time with theauthor, as he describes these instruments and fondly recalls
the joys and challenges of using them as a student in the
1950s, and later as a young physics professor. The E&M labmay have disappeared long ago, replaced by courses in elec-tronics and computing, but have we lost something valuablein the transition?
Using rotation matrices to calculate the locations of
sunrise and sunset, the hours of daylight, observed path
of the Sun, and its elevation angle for any latitude
Margaret Stautberg Greenwood
91(7), p. 519
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0095598Understanding the apparent movement of the Sun can
motivate students to use new mathematical tools to describetheir world. In this paper, rotation matrices are used to pre-
dict the daily motion of the Sun and the seasonal variations
of sunlight. The calculations are then compared to observa-tions of sunrises made by the author over the course of ayear.Analysis of ill-conditioned cases of a mass moving on a
sphere with friction
Terry W. McDaniel
91(7), p. 527
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0063834What happens when a body slides down a spherical sur-
face? In the absence of friction, the motion is easy to solve
for, and students are often asked to do so in introductory
mechanics. But if friction is present, the motion is muchmore complex, and under the right conditions, exhibits an
unusual behavior: the sliding body slows to a near halt before
speeding up again, creating a nearly ﬂat “plateau” in a plotof position vs. time. A full solution requires a suite of numer-
ical tools, providing upper-level students with a rich mathe-
matical exercise in an easy-to-visualize physical situation.
Oblique collision of a soft rubber disk with a rigid
surface
Rod Cross
91(7), p. 532
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0135633The collision of deformable ball or disk against a rigid sur-
face can be a complicated interaction involving an initial
sliding or gripping phase, tangential deformation of the disk,and then a reverse sliding phase which imparts spin to the
disk as it leaves the surface. In this paper, a high-speed video
camera is used to record the impact of a rubber disk with a
rigid surface. The collision is modeled with empirically
determined vertical and horizontal effective spring constantsand a coefﬁcient of sliding friction. Results are in reasonable
qualitative accord with the model. Appropriate for an upper-
level dynamics or properties of materials class.
Analytical calculation of plasmonic resonances in metal
nanoparticles: a simple guide
Marco Locarno and Daan Brinks
91(7), p. 538
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0094967If you want your students to understand how butterﬂies
have those impressively beautiful colored wings, how to
design an invisibility cloak, or more generally to understandhow light interacts with an assembly of nanoparticles, you
should start with this article. In the 2000s, plasmonics
emerged as a ﬁeld in its own right, dealing with the propaga-
tion of optical signals at the interface between a metallic sur-
face and a dielectric. This paper gives an undergraduate-level presentation of the bases behind plasmonic resonances
that occur when a metallic nanoparticle is submitted to an
oscillating electric ﬁeld, thus affecting its optical properties.It also examines how one can engineer the shape, the size,
and the composition of the nanoparticles to obtain the
desired optical effect. This paper can serve both as an

introduction to the ﬁeld of plasmonics and as a nice under-
graduate E&M problem.
Wigner rotation and Euler angle parametrization
Leehwa Yeh
91(7), p. 547
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0111222A more familiar representation of rotations in space
through Euler angles has suggested to this author an analo-gous representation of Lorentz transformations in ﬂat space-time. This results in a new enlightening perspective on therotational differences between Lorentz boosts performed inopposite order. This could be introduced in upper-levelundergraduate mathematical methods courses.
Simple realization of the polytropic process with a finite-
sized reservoir
Yu-Han Ma
91(7), p. 555
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0104382Take an ideal gas with pressure Pand volume V. Polytropic
processes are thermodynamic transformations for whichPV
n¼constant. The isothermal ( n¼1) or adiabatic ( n¼c,
with cbeing the heat capacity ratio) transformations are
examples of such processes. If you want to learn what poly-tropic processes with other values of nare, and what kind of
experimental systems exhibit those (spoiler: The size of theheat bath with which the gas is in contact plays a crucial role),you should consider reading this paper. Appropriate for under-graduate thermodynamics classes or projects.Comment on “Thermodynamics of Benford’s first digit
law” [Am. J. Phys. 87, 787–790 (2019)]
Xi-Jun Ren
91(7), p. 559
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0149874The Newcomb-Benford law states that, in an ensemble of
random numbers, the probability of having the numbersstarting with digit d(d¼1, 2, …, 9) is not 1/9 as one could
expect, but that it follows a logarithmic distribution (speciﬁ-
cally p(d)¼log (1þ
1
d)). This article builds on a recent paper
by Don Lemons to draw an analogy between a number Nand
a system containing Iradiation modes. Using the Bose-
Einstein statistics and the grand canonical ensemble, Ren
shows that one can recover the ﬁrst digit law in the thermo-
dynamic limit and calculate the corresponding entropy. Thisexample could nicely ﬁt into an undergraduate statisticalphysics course.
The game of life as a species model
David Faux and Peter Bassom
91(7), p. 561
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0150858This paper discusses a generalization of John Conway’s
classic Game of Life that can be used to simulate thegrowth and decay of animal species, including extinction
and recovery. A special property of the model is the use of
qubits (from quantum computing) at each site, instead of
the usual ones and zeros of the classical Game of Life.Related problems that could be used for student assign-
ments are included.
