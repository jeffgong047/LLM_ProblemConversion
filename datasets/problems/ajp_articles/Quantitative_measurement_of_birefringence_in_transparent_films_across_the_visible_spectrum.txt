Common transparent polymer ﬁlms, such as cellophane and household tape, are frequently used as
examples of birefringent materials in textbooks and classroom demonstrations. Qualitatively,
birefringence is often demonstrated by layering such ﬁlms between crossed-polarizers. In thiswork, we describe an inexpensive experimental setup for the quantitative measurement of
birefringence in common household ﬁlms, suitable for senior high school or undergraduate labs.
Whereas traditional approaches for polarization-based classroom experiments typically usemonochromatic laser light, we encourage the combined use of an incoherent incandescent light
source and a portable spectrometer. In addition, we demonstrate how any concomitant thin-ﬁlm
interference effects can be used to separately measure the optical thickness in the most
heterogeneous and uniform ﬁlms. Such measurement can then be used as an independent
experimental conﬁrmation of either the ﬁlm’s index of refraction or its thickness, given knowledge
of the other. In an effort to provide examples for the data analysis procedures as well as toinvestigate a range of materials, we measure the birefringence across the visible spectrum of six
common household polymer ﬁlms, including thin kitchen wrap, cellophane, gift basket ﬁlm, and
common adhesive tapes.

I. INTRODUCTION
Optical birefringence is a material property pertaining to a
difference in index of refraction that depends on the polariza-tion and propagation direction of light. It is an importanttopic of study in optics, as birefringence is the central phe-nomenon used for many important technological applicationssuch as LCD screen displays,
1modern 3D glasses,2and
microscopy.3For centuries, calcite has remained the quintes-
sential example of a birefringent material.4As such, the
canonical demonstration of birefringence continues to be the
display of double-refraction in calcite; largely not onlybecause its birefringence is so large but also because theobservation of double-refraction does not require any prepa-ration of the polarization state of the light. However, whilebirefringence is at the heart of double-refraction,
4the latter
is a challenging concept to describe, and its demonstrationcan be lacklustre. Beyond calcite, birefringence in polymersand other “plastics” has also become a mainstay textbookexample of birefringence. In particular, the fact that house-hold ﬁlms, such as kitchen wrap and adhesive tape, can actas retarders (or waveplates ) remains a common feature in
polarization chapters of optics textbooks.
5Beyond theenticing visual effects of viewing bright tape between
crossed polarizers,6the mathematical and quantitative details
of such birefringence are also important and easily accessiblevia simple modern lab equipment.7
Over the years, there have been numerous investigations
of birefringence in transparent polymer ﬁlms.7–17Most of
these investigations measure the mean index of refraction n
or the maximum difference in index between perpendicularpolarizations (i.e., the birefringence Dn) at single or discrete
wavelengths,8–10 ,15–17where the wavelengths are often cho-
sen by the availability of laser sources.7In fact, both
detailed quantitative measurements and classroom labora-tory demonstrations of polarization-dependent optical phe-nomena typically involve narrowband (or monochromatic )
sources.
7,10,17–19 ,26It is difﬁcult to discern whether the ubiq-
uity of using lasers for lab demonstrations is pedagogicallydriven by a desire to keep measurements conceptuallyrestricted to single wavelengths, or simply by a presumption
that a coherent light source is needed. Nonetheless, there
may be broader pedagogical advantages to conducting con-ceptually simple but technologically sophisticated labexperiments involving broadband (i.e., “white”) and inco-herent light; experiments much like those used historically

by the likes of Newton, Bernoulli, Brewster, Young, Biot,
Rayleigh, and others.
In this Letter, we describe a straightforward approach to
quantify the birefringence of transparent tape and other(quasi-)uniaxial transparent ﬁlms across the visible spec-trum. With a simple setup that includes cheap sheet polar-izers, standard lab optics, a portable USB spectrometer, andan incandescent light source, this experiment is ideal for
junior-level university/college instructional labs and ambi-
tious senior high school physics classrooms. Throughout thisarticle, we will highlight a variety of tricks and traps, knowl-edge of which may improve the quality of experimentalclassroom results. Finally, we will present the quantitativemeasurements of broadband birefringence for a variety ofcommon birefringent polymer ﬁlms, including adhesivetapes, gift-basket wrap, cellophane, and polyethylene kitchenwrap.
II. THEORY
A. Simple polarimetry and birefringence
A quantitative measurement of ﬁlm birefringence can be
obtained by simple polarimetry.
7,10In the most general
terms, a birefringent sample, sandwiched between a pair ofpolarizers, alters the amount of light that exits the polariza-tion gate as a function of the orientation of the ﬁlm withinthe gate—irrespective of the relative orientation of the polar-izers. The transmission of light through the gate depends on
the optical wavelength, and thus, a collection of the transmit-
ted spectrum offers a straightforward measurement of thebirefringent action of the ﬁlm.
Consider an experimental setup consisting of light passing
through an initial polarizer on the way to a birefringent sam-ple and then onto a second polarizer designated as the ana-
lyzer. The ﬁrst polarizer prepares the incident light into a
linear polarization state, irrespective of the pre-polarizerpolarization state of the light. The birefringent sample altersthis linear polarization for any sample orientation whereeither optical axis isn’t exactly aligned along the polarizationaxis of the ﬁrst polarizer. If we consider the sample rotatedby an angle hwith respect to the ﬁrst polarizer’s polarization
axis, the sample induces phase retardance between orthog-onal polarization components as each travels at a slightly
different speed. This retardance (in radians) is given by
d¼ð2p=kÞdn
1kðÞ/C0n2kðÞ/C12/C12/C12/C12, where dis the thickness of
the sample, kis the wavelength of the light, and n1(k) and
n2(k) are (generally, wavelength-dependent) indices of refrac-
tion in the sample. The birefringence of the sample is thenDn¼n
1kðÞ/C0n2kðÞ/C12/C12/C12/C12and is not itself thickness or angle
dependent but is rather a material property of the sample.
Once passing through the sample, the polarization state of
the light has been altered such that, in general, it is no longernecessarily linear and no longer predominantly aligned alongthe axis of the ﬁrst polarizer. In terms of the dominant polari-zation angle, the sample will have rotated it by an angle of2h. Depending on the birefringence, thickness, and orienta-
tion of the sample, as well as the wavelength under consider-ation, the outgoing polarization may be elliptical, circular, or
linear.
5The analyzer ﬁlters the light along its polarization
axis, transmitting an intensity that depends on the incidentwavelength, the retardance induced by the sample, and thesample’s orientation. Two experimental arrangements areconceptually useful: In the closed gate (CG) arrangement,the polarizer and analyzer are crossed , such that no light
emerges when the sample induces no retardance (or the sam-
ple is removed). In the open gate (OG) arrangement, the
polarizer and analyzer are co-aligned, and all colors are max-imally transmitted in the no-retardance condition. The spec-
tral intensity transmitted through the closed gate and open
gate arrangements are given by

; (2)
respectively, where I0(k) is the incident spectral intensity
passing through the ﬁrst polarizer.
Analysis of these expressions shows that in either arrange-
ment, the transmission is a double modulation controlled bythe rotation angle of the sample relative to the ﬁrst polarizer
and the retardance provided by the sample. Furthermore, col-
lection of this signal with a spectrometer can yield informa-tion about the birefringence at each wavelength, thereby
providing a measurement of dispersion in Dn,
7rather than
assuming a priori that the birefringence itself is a constant
across the visible spectrum. Experimentally, it is most con-
venient to vary the sample orientation rather than somehow
vary the sample thickness or birefringence. Thus, for a givensample, the retardance is constant at each wavelength, andthe signal modulation is controlled via rotation of the sample
in the plane perpendicular to the propagation axis (i.e., vary-
ingh). A key experimental condition is attained when the
ﬁlm’s birefringent axes are set at 45
/C14to the polarizer’s axis.
In this case, maximum retardance is experienced by the light
and the equation for transmission is simpliﬁed. This maxi-
mum action condition yields a normalized transmission of

B. Etalon effects and optical path length
In some ways, a precise measurement of Dnis easier to
make than that of the individual indices n1andn2. The bire-
fringence of polymers ranges widely between values of zero
and/C240.015, whereas the index of refraction of most trans-
parent polymer ﬁlms only differs slightly between 1.45 and
1.6.20Thus, estimating the index to be 1.5 is likely adequate
for most purposes. Nonetheless, one likely wishes to measurethe index of refraction concurrently with a measurement of
ﬁlm birefringence. Fortunately, thin and transparent samples,
such as those under consideration, often display so-calledetalon effects —a sort of thin-ﬁlm interface transmission sig-
nal that can be used to estimate the index of refraction to a
reasonable degree of accuracy.

The amount of light reﬂected from a dielectric surface in air
depends on the index of refraction of the material and the angle
of incidence.5For fully transparent samples with no absorp-
tion, the light that isn’t reﬂected is transmitted into the ﬁlm.The transmitted light then travels to the back surface, at which
point it partially reﬂects inwards and partially transmits out of
the sample. Thus, light in the sample is free to bounce backand forth between the two interfaces, setting up constructive/
destructive interference that depends on the wavelength of
light and the optical path length of the ﬁlm, given by nd.T h e
resulting interference fringes can be observed both spatially
and spectrally. Spectrally, the progression of constructive anddestructive interference fringes present as a regular modulation
in the transmitted spectrum.
22Experimentally, the depth of
modulation in the spectral fringes varies considerably depend-ing on the surface quality and parallelism of the sample, and
the spatial uniformity of the incident beam among other con-
siderations. However, if any fringes are observed, the wave-length separation of consecutive transmission maxima or
minima proves to be a useful ruler for measuring the index of
refraction (or alternately, the thickness) of the thin ﬁlm. This
separation is called the free spectral range of the ﬁlm (or eta-
lon) and is approximately given by

where k0is the wavelength at the midpoint between the
fringes.22Since both k0andDkFSRcan be measured with rel-
atively good precision, an analysis of etalon effects present
in the transmission signal obtained from the polarimeter canprovide an independent measurement of nd.III. MATERIALS AND METHOD
The equipment needed for establishing a simple polarime-
try gate is simple and relatively inexpensive with a total costof approximately US$5,500 for the components shown in
Fig. 1. For a detailed parts-list see Appendix B . The most
expensive components are the USB spectrometer and itsassociated computer, along with the rotation stages for the
sample holder and analyzer. The use of a simple incandes-
cent halogen ﬂoodlight means that the experiment describedhere is less costly than most other common teaching lab
experiments that require a laser source.
In its most basic arrangement, the polarimetry gate com-
prises an incandescent light source, a polarizer mounted on aﬁxed axis, a rotatable sample holder, a second polarizer on arotatable mount, and a spectrometer outﬁtted with a multi-
mode optical collection ﬁber. The polarizers should be suit-
able for covering a signiﬁcant proportion of the visiblespectrum. We have found that most inexpensive sheet polar-
izers are adequate for the task. The cheapest ﬁlm polarizers
provide reasonable polarization purity to span the wave-length range 500–700 nm. Thicker polarizer sheets (sold as“laminated”) cover the wavelength range 430–760 nm, and
at under US$30 per sheet are highly recommended for these
experiments. Professional-grade calcite polarizers can offerimproved polarization purity across a broader spectral range.
For the experiments presented here, we used a combination
of a cube polarizer as the ﬁrst polarizer and laminated sheetpolarizer as the analyzer. The analyzer was simply afﬁxed toa rotatable lens mount via double-sided tape. In general, ﬁlm
polarizers may be used for both polarizers. Beyond the basic
elements of the gate, adjustable mirrors, simple lenses, andoptomechanical components on an optical breadboard are
useful for better optical alignment and repeatable positioning.
Figure 1displays a marked-up photograph of our experi-
mental setup. The light source is a simple halogen incandes-cent spotlight. A halogen-bulb source is preferred for its
brightness, which also permits it to be positioned at a dis-
tance from the other optical elements. As seen in the ﬁgure,we can place the light source as close as /C2430 cm from the
other optical elements, but we’ve also had success with the
bulb placed at distances greater than 1 m. Instead of pointing
the source directly down the axis of the polarization gate, weposition it pointing away from the detector, and then direct
the incident light down the axis of the gate using a single 1-
in. mirror. Stray light that doesn’t pass through all the ele-ments of the gate is adequately avoided by use of such rout-ing, along with simple light barriers (i.e., cardboard) and
lens tubes around the ﬁber collector. We have found that the
illumination intensity passing through the gate is nota limit-
ing factor, whereas subtle alignment variations can lead to
signiﬁcant variability in the spectrum obtained through the
direct illumination of the optical ﬁbre. This is largelybecause of the mismatch between the diameter of the collec-tion ﬁber and that of the illumination spot that passes through
the gate. The best means of making uniform and robust col-
lection is to diffuse the light through thin paper so that thedetector is sampling a consistent uniform area.
We have found that this is easily implemented by placing
a taut swatch of tissue paper (1- or 2-ply) within 2–5 mm in
front of the collection ﬁber, as can be seen in Fig. 1. While
this diffuser reduces the overall signal by nearly two orders
of magnitude, it provides excellent repeatability and unifor-
mity to the collected intensity.

Birefringent ﬁlm samples are mounted onto a 1 in. lens
tube screwed into a rotation mount using either double-sidedtape or, in the case of tape samples, their own adhesive. Therotation mount has 2
/C14demarcations, which allow for detailed
control of sample orientation. For experimental conﬁrma-tions of Eqs. (1)and(2), transmission spectra are collected
as a function of the sample angle in 2
/C14increments across any
span of 90/C14. There should be four no-action and four max-
action sample orientations found across each 360/C14sample
rotation in either open/closed gate conﬁguration. The no-
action conditions occur when the incident polarization is
aligned with either of the two birefringence axes of the sam-ple. This condition is easiest to establish by closing thepolarization gate and rotating the sample until minimumtransmission is observed across the widest wavelength span.Once this condition is found, the analyzer may be rotated by90
/C14to establish the no-action condition in the open gate. The
max-action condition is then most readily established by rotat-
ing the sample 45/C14from the no-action condition. Figure 2
shows raw spectra for the no-action closed-gate, no-actionopen gate, and 45
/C14(max action) open gate conditions for a
single-layer sample of ScotchVR371 packaging adhesive tape.
Birefringent polymer ﬁlm samples can be easily found
among commonplace household items. Most (but not all!)transparent adhesive tape products are birefringent. These
include most packaging and gift-wrap tapes, both of the 19-mmand 48-mm width varieties. While we present results for several3M Scotch brand tape, the equivalent products from other com-panies such as Grand & Toy, Duck, Staples, and Paperway areequally birefringent. Both true cellophane and biaxially ori-ented polypropylene (BOPP) ﬁlm are highly birefringent.Traditional cellophane gift-basket ﬁlm is increasingly difﬁcultto ﬁnd, and most “cello” ﬁlm being sold now is BOPP. A rollpurchased from a local dollar store provides a particularly inex-pensive birefringent sample. As we show in this work, the bire-fringence of cellophane and BOPP are not equivalent. We haveprocured thin square sheets of true cellophane marketed ascandy wrappers from Foilman ( www.foilman.com ).
Cellophane and BOPP ﬁlm can be cut to size and mounted
onto a lens tube using thin strips of double-sided tape. Finally,all kitchen “plastic wrap” that we have tested is birefringent,including both Saran and Glad brands. These samples are verythin and somewhat stretchable. To mount kitchen-wrap forstudy, we form a taut layer across a lens tube and secure it inplace with an elastic band, forming a kind of drum. It’s impor-tant to take care not to stretch the ﬁlm as this alters the samplethickness and impacts both the measurement of birefringenceand etalon fringes.
The sample rotation angle his deﬁned with respect to the
optical axes of the samples. In practice, the orientation ofoptical axes must be ﬁrst established experimentally, asdescribed above. For samples that come on a roll, a naturalreference direction is established by the direction along thelength of the ﬁlm. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that various birefrin-gent samples are manufactured such that the roll axis andoptical axis do not coincide. For example, this optical-axis-offset can be as high as 30
/C14in (19-mm) rolls of stationary
tape, while for other samples such as cellophane sheets andbasket wrap there is effectively no offset. All packaging tapevarieties showed a roll-axis offset of 9
/C1463/C14.
Knowledge of ﬁlm thickness is necessary for a quantitative
estimate of sample birefringence. Non-adhesive sample thick-ness was measured mechanically: Cellophane and BOPP ﬁlmwere stacked several layers thick and measured with calipers.Kitchen cling wrap thickness was estimated from reported rolllength and measured roll stack thickness. An accurate mea-surement of the birefringence “backing ﬁlm” thickness in
adhesive tape samples was precluded by the variable and
unknown layer thickness of the glue. For those samples, weuse the nominal thickness reported by the manufacturer.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Transmission analysis
The key to obtaining a normalized transmission spectrum
lies in the proper collection of the transmission spectrathrough both a closed gate and open gate. In each case, thesample is in place but aligned to a no-action orientation. Asan example, Fig. 2presents the raw and normalized transmis-
sion curves for a single layer of Scotch packaging tape. Inpractice, transmission curves were collected for each sampleat 2
/C14increments across 100/C14rotation span. This practice was
done as a check of the protocol, and is ultimately unneces-sary because the maximum-action condition for all wave-lengths occurs when the ﬁlm is rotated such that h¼45
/C14.A s
can be seen in Fig. 2, the closed-gate transmission curve
(with sample oriented to h¼0/C14) becomes a control

trum of the polarizer-analyzer combination, showing diminishing polariza-
tion purity in the polarization pair above 750 nm (light grey region), and
complete loss of polarization above 960 nm (dark grey region). (Black)

measurement for the wavelength-dependent polarization
extinction capabilities of the polarizer-analyzer pair. Fromthis curve, we see that our polarimeter gate provides strongextinction between 350 and 750 nm, with rapidly dwindlingextinction abilities above 750 nm and complete loss of polar-ization at 960 nm. The no-action open-gate transmission rep-resents a reference measurement for the incident spectrum—that is, it’s a proxy for I
0kðÞ. To obtain a normalized curve
forT45/C14
OGkðÞ, the raw open-gate transmission with the tape in
theh¼45/C14position must be divided by the open-gate trans-
mission, with the no-action closed-gate transmission signalﬁrst subtracted from both. The resulting normalized trans-
mission curve is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2.
The most noteworthy feature of the open-gate transmis-
sion of the Scotch packing tape sample shown in Fig. 2is the
extinction of transmission at wavelengths between 725 and750 nm. This represents a 90
/C14polarization rotation by the sam-
ple,thus signifying its action as a half-waveplate for these
wavelengths . Two oriented layers of this tape would thus com-
prise a half-waveplate at 360–375 nm. Unfortunately, both ofthese wavelength ranges are just outside of the visible spec-trum, and thus, this tape is not particularly useful as a demon-stration of a half-waveplate in the visible regime. Furthermore(and contrary to some reports in the literature
7,15,16), while the
six samples studied in this work display a range of birefrin-gence and thicknesses, no sample was found to act as a half-waveplate between 450 and 700 nm.
B. Retardance inversion errors
The retrieval of birefringence data from open/closed-gate
transmission requires the inversion of sine and cosine func-tions. A simple inversion of Eqs. (3)and(4)will only yield
retardance values within a restricted domain of 0 to p/2. For
many low-birefringence samples such as kitchen wrap, theretardance is sufﬁciently low across the visible spectrum thata direct retrieval of Dnworks well. However, many samples
provide retardance greater than p/2, and thus, a direct inver-
sion of these equations may result in error. There are fourpossible values of retardance between d¼0 and 2 pthat
satisfy any observed value of transmission. The inability todistinguish between these four values is likely one reasonwhy even single-wavelength (i.e., laser-based) polarimetrymeasurements of birefringence are rarely found in the exper-imental physics curriculum. However, with a broadband
wavelength-dependent measurement, it is possible to discern
which of the four domains are being spanned, based on theshape of the retrieved birefringence—at least for most bire-fringent thin-ﬁlm samples. Figure 3shows an example of
transmission curves for a simulated sample with sufﬁcientlylarge birefringence (or thickness) to span several retardancedomains across the visible spectrum. Whereas the simulatedbirefringence is relatively uniform as a function of wave-length, a mindless retrieval of Dn(k) based on the transmis-
sion curves leads to erroneous results and misleadinginterpretation. As seen in Fig. 3, only the open-gate transmis-
sion in a wavelength range that corresponds to d<p=2 gives
the correct value of the birefringence from direct inversion.
At shorter wavelengths, Dnis seen to either rise or fall
quasi-linearly, forming sharp kinks at wavelengths thatcorrespond to
1
2/C0/C1i4dDn, where iis an integer. The shape of
these curves can be used to discern a “corrected” value ofthe birefringence. For example, a positive (quasi-)linearslope with wavelength obtained in an open gate arrangementimplies that the retardance is between p/2 and p. For a closed
gate arrangement, a rising positive slope implies that theretardance is between 0 and p/2, or between pand 2 p,a s
shown in Fig. 3. Conversely, a negative-going slope in an
open gate arrangement implies a retardance between pand
2p, and in a closed gate arrangement it implies a retardance
between 0 and p/2. Alternatively, ﬁtting the raw transmission
spectra shown in Fig. 3(or, for example, that in the bottom
panel of Fig. 2) to Eqs. (3)or(4)can provide correct values
forDn(k). However, such ﬁtting algorithms will invariably
require substantial sophistication if one allows for the bire-fringence to vary by wavelength.
C. Etalon resonances
Several samples displayed etalon fringes in their raw trans-
mission spectrum. For the most part, adhesive tape samples
did not display strong fringes, likely because of the
Fig. 3. Simulated transmission spectra and inversion errors for a birefrin-
gence sample with 90- lm thickness oriented at h¼45/C14within closed and
open gate arrangements. (Top panel) The transmitted spectra for open- and
closed-gate arrangements are mirror images that sum to 1. The open-gate
(closed-gate) condition yields maximum (minimum) transmission at wave-
lengths that correspond to full-waveplate retardance, and yield minimum
(maximum) transmission at wavelengths that correspond to half-waveplate
retardance. (Bottom panel) Applying Eqs. (3)and(4)to the spectra in the
top panel generates an erroneous curve for the sample birefringence. Only
the portion of the transmission spectrum for which wavelengths are above a
value of 2d Dn yield the correct birefringence. Proper retrieval of the
wavelength-dependent birefringence (i.e., the ground truth) is obtained
either with proper ﬁtting of transmission spectra or with manual de-trending
of the retrieved birefringence, as described in the main text.

inhomogeneity of the adhesive-polymer interface. Non-
adhesive samples such as polyethylene kitchen wrap, polypro-pylene wrap ﬁlm, and cellophane sheets display prominent eta-
lon fringes that grow and diminish in ﬁnesse across the
measured wavelength ranges. Figure 4shows an example of
the transmission fringes observed for each of these three sam-
ples. According to Eq. (5), a measurement of the wavelength
difference between peaks (i.e., the free spectral range, FSR) at
any particular wavelength can constitute a measurement of the
optical thickness nd. As expected, with the three polymers hav-
ing very similar indexes, the thickness of the ﬁlm strongly
affects the FSR. The kitchen wrap ﬁlm is considerably thinnerthan the other two samples, and thus, displays fringes that are
further apart than the others. In principle, this method could be
used to independently measure n
1andn2of a birefringent ﬁlm.
However, with birefringence below 0.02 (such as found for all
samples studied here), differences in the FSR on the order of
0.1 nm would have to be measured. This requirement is well
outside of the sampling resolution of most spectrometers—
especially of the kind that can be found in teaching labs.Fortunately, this criterion also means that the sample orienta-
tion (i.e., h) at which the spectral fringes are analyzed is unim-
portant, and the ﬁlm can be oriented to maximize fringevisibility (as long as normal incidence is maintained).
As shown in Fig. 4, all three samples display sufﬁciently
clear fringe patterns in the vicinity of 800 nm to estimate avalue of dnfor the sample. For each ﬁlm, we use the value
ofdnobtained from Fig. 4, together with the mechanically
measured ﬁlm thickness, to obtain an estimated measure ofthe ﬁlm’s nominal index n
o. Such analysis yields values
of 1.5360.08, 1.49 60.06, and 1.45 60.06 for the index of
refraction of cling wrap, BOPP “cello” gift wrap, and cello-phane, respectively. The uncertainty in these measurements
reﬂects uncertainties in the thickness measurement, and
spectrometer sampling resolution.
D. Sample birefringence
The measured birefringence for six ﬁlm samples is shown
in Fig. 5. In principle, the spectral intensity and polarization
purity in our measurements are sufﬁcient to acquire databetween 400 and 950 nm. In practice, a variety of factorsrestrict the range over which reliable measurements can bemade to 430–800 nm. The choice between implementing anopen-gate or closed-gate measurement is largely arbitrary, asboth methods prove reliable. A general guiding approach isas follows: Use the gate conﬁguration that leads tomaximum-action transmission that is most distinct from the
no-action open-gate transmission. Thus, a preference may be
made for closed-gate measurements for samples with eithervery small retardances, or with retardance approaching inte-ger multiples of p. Conversely, open-gate measurements are
best for samples with retardances closer to multiples of p/2.
The birefringence curves shown in Fig. 5largely reﬂect this
choice: The smallest retardance samples—Scotch transparenttape and Glad cling wrap—are measured in the closed-gatearrangement, as is the sample of Scotch Storage and Packingtape which yields the largest retardance among all measured
samples. On the other hand, Cellophane, polyethylene gift
basket wrap, and Scotch (371) Packing Tape were measuredin the open-gate arrangement.
Measurements of birefringence in thin ﬁlms are often col-
lected at a single wavelength with the presumption that thismaterial property is constant in spectral regions far from anyabsorptive resonances. For the most part, the curves shownin Fig. 5conﬁrm this presumption; that is, the birefringence

to bottom are the normalized transmission spectra for Glad Cling Wrap, Voila
“cello” gift basket ﬁlm, and Foilman cellophane candy wrapper sheets. Theshaded area in each panel spans the two resonances closest to k
0¼800 nm,
which are then used together with Eq. (5)to estimate either the thickness or
index of refraction in each of the samples. The noticeably wider free spectral
range in the kitchen wrap ﬁlm results from its appreciably smaller thickness.

measured in the closed gate arrangement. The birefringence for Scotch packing
tape (black) is obtained from the transmission data presented in Fig. 1.

of the ﬁlms studied in this work is relatively constant across
a wide swath of the visible spectrum. A slight downturn inbirefringence is observed at wavelengths below 500 nm butonly in the three samples measured in an open-gate arrange-ment. The three measurements were collected weeks apart.Thus, this artefact is likely due to some systematic error inthe collection of the incident spectrum in the open-gatearrangement. Nonetheless, all samples show essentially con-stant birefringence between 500 and 800 nm.
Our selection of samples represents a variety of chemical
compositions and manufacturing processes. A summary ofsample attributes, including the measured birefringence,reported for the wavelength range of 500–700 nm, is pre-sented in Table I. The largest birefringence is found in trans-
parent gift basket wrap ﬁlm that is often sold as “cello
warp,” in reference to the traditional cellophane-based ﬁlms
that were ubiquitous decades ago. Nowadays, this ﬁlm ismade of BOPP rather than cellulose. Interestingly, with ameasured value of Dn¼0.01560.001, the birefringence of
this BOPP ﬁlm is about 33% larger than the 0.011 60.001
measured for the cellophane candy-wrapper ﬁlm. Scotch 371packaging tape, also made of BOPP, yields a birefringenceof 0.012 60.002. This value—while still larger than that for
cellophane—is smaller than that for the non-adhesive BOPPbasket-wrap ﬁlm, suggesting that the manufacturing processcan signiﬁcantly affect the resulting birefringence.
26The
slightly thicker packaging tape sold as Scotch Storage andPackaging is made of bidirectionally oriented polyester(rather than polypropylene) and shows a relatively large bire-fringence of 0.014 60.001. At nominally 10- lm thickness,
Glad Cling Wrap is the thinnest sample investigated. Thispolyethylene ﬁlm displays a relatively small birefringence of0.004360.0002. In a twist of irony, we ﬁnd that standard
transparent stationary tape yields the lowest birefringence
of the measured samples, with Dn¼0.002360.0009.
Nowadays, this tape is made of polyoleﬁn, but historicallytransparent stationary tape was made of much more birefrin-gent cellophane. In fact, in many parts of the world this prod-uct is still known generically as Sellotape. We suspect thatwhen transparent tape was ﬁrst used for textbook demonstra-tions of birefringence, the tape was invariably made of cello-phane.
5Compared with other common birefringent materials,the birefringence measured for polymer ﬁlms is large but
unremarkable. In comparison, calcite displays tenfold larger
birefringence than the most birefringent BOPP sample,
whereas birefringence in quartz is about 20% smaller than
that of cellophane.27Ice, with reported birefringence of
0.0014 is about half as birefringent as polyoleﬁn tape.28
Nonetheless, the birefringence of BOPP and cellulose ﬁlmare sufﬁciently large to enable their use in polarimetric tech-
nologies such as optical displays and “polage” art.6,11,29
V. SUMMARY
In this work, we have described an inexpensive experimen-
tal setup for the quantitative measurement of birefringence in
thin polymer ﬁlms, suitable for senior secondary or upper-
level college/university instructional labs. Whereas traditional
approaches for polarization-based classroom experiments typi-cally use monochromatic laser light, we encourage the combined
use of spectroscopic measurement and incoherent unﬁltered light
sources. There are signiﬁcant advantages to this approach,
including garnering an appreciation for the wavelength depen-
dence of optical retardance, and the ability to estimate the abso-
lute birefringence in samples that experience retardances greater
than p/2. In addition, we demonstrate how thin-ﬁlm interference
effects can be used to measure the optical thickness, nd,i n
heterogeneous ﬁlms of uniform thickness. Such measurement
can then be used as an independent experimental conﬁrmation
of either the index of refraction or ﬁlm thickness, given knowl-
edge of the other. In an effort to provide examples for the data
analysis procedures as well as to impart novel information not
readily available in the literature, we report the measured bire-fringence in six common household polymer ﬁlms, including
thin kitchen wrap and common adhesive tapes.

APPENDIX A: OBTAINING EXPRESSIONS FOR
INTENSITIES TRANSMITTED THROUGH
BIREFRINGENCE GATES
Derivation of Eqs. (1)and(2)comprises a straightforward
and useful exercise that can double as an introduction to
Jones calculus.30,31
We consider transmission through a closed birefringence gate
to comprise incident incandescent light passing through a polar-
izer with vertical polarization axis, then passing through a bire-
fringent sample with fast axis aligned h/C14from the horizontal,
and ﬁnally passing through an analyzer with horizontal polariza-
tion axis. For an open birefringence gate, the sequence is identi-
cal except that the analyzer passes vertical polarization. Each ofthese elements can be represented as a Jones matrix as follows:

APPENDIX B: A LIST OF PARTS AND COMMENTS
ON COSTS
Table IIprovides a list of parts and prices that most
closely represents the full experimental setup used for the
present work. All optics and optomechanical mounts are
sourced from a single vendor (Thorlabs) to best assure com-patibility among the items. However, any of a variety optical
instrument vendors may be used without loss of functional-
ity. Likewise, the USB spectrometer used for the presentwork is similar to ones sold by a variety of companies; any
of which are likely to be suitable for the kinds of measure-
ments reported here. As presented, the total extended price isapproximately US$5,500. Except for sheet polarizers, noth-
ing was purchased speciﬁcally for the present study; the
equipment was already part of a well-stocked laser lab.Thus, establishing a viable spectroscopically based polariza-
tion gate for the expressed use in a teaching laboratory can
be done at considerably less cost, and without signiﬁcantloss of functionality. The greatest cost savings can be had by
using sheet polarizer instead of a calcite polarizer cube, and
by purchasing an educational-quality spectrometer insteadone of research grade. In total, the experiments described in
this work could be implemented without signiﬁcant loss in
quality with a setup costing under US$3,500.
