Invariants: Finding constancy in a sea of change
Sanjoy Mahajan
91(2), p. 87
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0139569This Back-of-the-Envelope paper shows how invariants
can be useful in estimations. Sometimes they even yieldexact solutions!
Low-energy scattering parameters: A theoretical
derivation of the effective range and scattering length for
arbitrary angular momentum
Jordi Pera and Jordi Boronat
91(2), p. 90
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0079744While scattering theory is commonly studied by upper-
level physics students, how it is presented and studied canvary widely. This paper presents derivations for the angular-momentum scattering parameters of four different modelpotentials: hard-sphere, soft-sphere, spherical well, and well-barrier potentials. Working through these derivations couldbe beneﬁcial for students as they learn scattering theorybasics and apply their knowledge to various cases such as
the study of ultracold quantum gases.
A wave packet approach to resonant scattering
A. M. Michalik and F. Marsiglio
91(2), p. 102
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0106701Most treatments of scattering theory in upper-level quantum
mechanics classes use time-independent plane-wave formula-tions, but this limits qualitative understanding of the details ofthe scattering process, particularly in cases of resonant scatter-ing where constructive interference leads to the complete pas-sage of an incoming wave through an array of barriers. Thispaper offers deeper insight into the scattering process bymodeling incoming particles as time-dependent Gaussian wavepackets which retain their shape while propagating, anapproach which reveals that the reﬂected wave packet at reso-nance is in fact non-zero and is no longer Gaussian. Rather,the reﬂected wave packet, while being of very small amplitude,has a surprising double-Gaussian shape. Appropriate forupper-level and graduate quantum mechanics classes.
“A call to action”: Schr €odinger’s representation of
quantum mechanics via Hamilton’s principle
Michele Marrocco
91(2), p. 110
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0083015Quantum mechanics courses often present the Schr €odinger
equation as a fundamental postulate. This approach can leave
students disoriented without support from their knowledgegained in earlier courses. This article reviews some othercommon ways to introduce the Schr €odinger equation and
develops its own pedagogical approach (which has its roots
in the foundations of quantum mechanics) based on classical
Hamilton-Jacobi theory. This way of motivating theSchr€odinger equation may be less jarring to students who
have knowledge of the action principle in classical mechan-ics, and anyone interested in the relationship between classi-
cal and quantum physics will ﬁnd this article to be an
interesting read.
Science on a stick: An experimental and demonstration
platform for learning several physical principles
Dhananjay V. Gadre, Harsh Sharma, Sangeeta D. Gadre,
and Smriti Srivastava
91(2), p. 116
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0080881The authors give detailed instructions for building a sim-
ple apparatus that can be used in the laboratory or at home to
study both mechanics (gravitational acceleration) and elec-tromagnetism (induced currents).
Thermal infrared astronomy for the introductory
laboratory
Clifford W. Padgett, William H. Baird, J. Spencer Coile,
Wayne M. Johnson, Erin N. Groneck, and Robert A. Rose
91(2), p. 122
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0081072Although the electromagnetic spectrum is wide, labs often
restrict themselves to the study of visible light or, in moreadvanced courses, microwaves. But thermal infrared camerascan nowadays be purchased at a minimal cost to investigatethermal leaks in houses. So why not place them at a tele-
scope’s eyepiece, and observe the Moon and other celestial
bodies in the infrared range? Students can verify that thelaws of refraction are still valid, while realizing that theimages that they acquire can be drastically different fromwhat they obtain in the visible range. From there, thermal
properties of various bodies can be investigated.
Low-cost quadrature optical interferometer
Tanner M. Melody, Krishna H. Patel, Peter K. Nguyen,
and Christopher L. Smallwood
91(2), p. 132
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0110405This paper presents a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
designed to illustrate the qualitative functionality of polariza-
tion-based quadrature interferometry at a fraction of the costof commercially available alternatives. Background theory

on quadrature-detected interferometry is given, followed by
details on the construction of the low-cost instrument com-prised of a laser pointer, affordable polarization optics, 3-
D-printed optics mounts, homebuilt photodetectors, and
low-cost microcontroller-based analog-to-digital signalconversion. Quality of performance of the system is exhib-ited by plots of detector outputs and a thermal expansioncoefﬁcient measurement. This work provides an accessible
and affordable introduction to the topic of quadrature inter-
ferometry for optics instructional laboratory instructors andstudents.
Picometer measurements of strain coefficients by
quadrature interferometry and lock-in amplification
Alec Nilson and Kurt Wick
91(2), p. 142
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0102091The authors were motivated by LIGO to ask how accu-
rately they could measure distances in an advanced under-graduate lab. The answer? Using quadrature interferometry,they were able to measure displacements with an uncertainty
ofk/150,000. This manuscript explains the technique, start-
ing with a simple model and gradually adding more realisticcomplications, and also provides details for how to imple-
ment a similar laboratory project.

tions of extra spatial dimensions helps to place in contextthis investigation of a Schr €odinger-like equation for a hydro-
gen atom in higher dimensions. One signiﬁcant alteration isthe appearance of the Laplacian operator at higher integerpowers, with surprising restrictions that lead to bound states.
