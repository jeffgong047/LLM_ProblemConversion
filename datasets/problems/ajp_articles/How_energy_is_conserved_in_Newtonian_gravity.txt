The concept underlying conservation of energy in a force ﬁeld is that the work done by particles
moving against the force represents energy removed from particles and added to energy in theﬁeld. For electromagnetic ﬁelds and charged particles, the transfer of energy between charges and
local ﬁelds is described by Poynting’s theorem. However, a similar local model for gravitational
energy is not usually taught. In this paper, I derive the equations describing local conservation of
energy in Newtonian gravity, discuss the well-known non-uniqueness of various terms, and show
how comparison with Poynting’s theorem provides insight into conditions for physicalsigniﬁcance.

I. INTRODUCTION
Understanding and quantitatively describing conservation of
energy, an important part of learning physics, has been the sub-ject of renewed interest since the publication of Framework
for Science Education1and the associated development of
Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).2These reports
focused attention on a long-standing issue: Is energy associated
with force ﬁelds (e.g., electromagnetic, gravitational) better
represented in terms of potentials or of the ﬁelds them-selves?3,4Here, I discuss energy in purely classical (non-
relativistic) gravitational ﬁelds and show that it involves subtleaspects not always adequately treated in textbooks.
The work-energy theorem as usually stated applies to
complete isolated systems and must be generalized if we
deal with extended continuous media, including not only sol-
ids or ﬂuids but also gaseous systems described by localquantities that represent averages over small volumes con-taining many particles. As illustrated in the examplesdescribed later in this paper, the work that is done locally bythe ﬂow against gravity cannot, in general, be equated to the
local change of energy in the ﬁeld because energy can be
transported to other locations. To describe, this quantita-tively requires a local energy equation. This process is wellunderstood for electromagnetic energy, where Poynting’stheorem is the local energy equation, but an equation thatwould play the same role (although not necessarily having the
same mathematical form) in gravity as Poynting’s theorem
does in electromagnetism is hardly ever discussed explicitly.
The whole issue of how to describe changes of gravitational
energy within the classical Newtonian context seems to havereceived little attention. Textbooks sidestep the problem bydiscussing Newtonian gravitational energy only in the integralform for isolated systems,
5or they do not include gravity in
the discussion of energy conservation either because a relativ-
istically correct treatment is aimed at but the gravitationalterms have been formulated only in a nonrelativistic approxi-mation,
6or, on the contrary, because gravity is to be treated at
the general relativistic level and is purposely left out of thepreliminary Newtonian description,7or they simply do not
mention gravity at all in the discussion of energy.8My pur-
pose here is to try to ﬁll this gap in textbook coverage.
As ﬁnal revisions to this paper were being made, I learned
about another paper to be published in this journal that examinesa general description of gravitational ﬁelds, including energyﬂows, from a relativistic “gravitoelectromagnetic” perspectivewhere the ﬁeld equations are formulated in analogy to Maxwell’s
equations.
9In contrast, the approach taken in this paper is a classi-
cal Newtonian model where ﬁelds respond instantly to the motionof charges and masses. Readers are encouraged to examine bothpapers for a full picture of this issue.
As a simple example of the issues that arise when changes
in gravitational potential energy occur, consider water in apipe pushed up against gravity. This arrangement was dis-cussed as a thought experiment long ago by Bridgman,
10,11
and it is of current practical importance in the pumped-
storage system (Fig. 1) of some hydroelectric power plants.12
Two water reservoirs are located at different heights with
water being pumped from the lower to the upper. The workis done by the pump; where does the energy that is beingexpended to pump the water go? A simple answer is that theenergy expended in lifting a mass magainst Earth’s gravity
g
0to a mean height habove ground is stored in the mass m
as the change of its gravitational potential energy.13
However, this explanation is unsatisfactory if we think of theEarth as part of the system. As shown in the Appendix , the
change of gravitational potential energy is in fact dividedequally between the water and the Earth, even though thework done on the Earth is negligible.

II. WHY WE NEED A LOCAL ENERGY EQUATION
The work done per unit volume by the mass ﬂow against
gravity is given by
work per unit volume ¼/C0qV/C1g; (1)
where q¼mass density, g¼gravitational ﬁeld, and V¼bulk
ﬂow velocity, all functions of position rand time t. If energy
is conserved, the total work done must equal the rate ofchange of gravitational energy within the entire system,

Since the total gravitational energy UGis a quantitative prop-
erty of the system, expressible as the volume integral ofgravitational energy per unit volume (energy density) u

/C0ð
d3rqV/C1g¼ð
d3r@uG
@t: (4)
With the integrals on both sides extending over the entire
system (which in some cases may be over all space), this is a
global equation. It becomes a local equation not when the
two integrands are equal but rather when they differ by atmost the divergence of a vector S
G,
/C0qV/C1g¼@uG
@tþr/C1 SG; (5)
subject to the condition that the surface integral of the com-
ponent of SGnormal to the outer boundary of the system
vanishes,
ð
dA^n/C1SG¼0: (6)
The quantity SGis a vector representing energy transport
from one location to another; it is the local gravitational
energy ﬂux density, that is, the amount of energy transportedacross a directed unit area. Equation (5)expresses local con-
servation: Energy supplied locally by the work done per unit
volume either changes the ﬁeld energy per unit volume or
ﬂows out into adjacent volumes; the form of the equation
(RH side consisting of a time derivative plus a divergence)
ensures that the sum of the two equals the work done. Global
conservation of energy expressed by Eq. (4)requires the
boundary condition Eq. (6)of no net ﬂow of energy out of or
into the system. The energy ﬂux density S
Gis not mentioned
in most standard texts.
An energy equation in the form of Eq. (5)expressing the
work done as the time derivative of an energy density plus
divergence of an energy ﬂux density is a necessary conditionfor conservation of energy in the interaction between force
ﬁelds and matter, not just for Newtonian gravity but also,
with the appropriate redeﬁnition of work done, for forceﬁelds quite generally. For electromagnetism, the work done
is given by electric ﬁeld times current density, and the
energy equation is the familiar Poynting’s theorem,

showing the equation in both Gaussian and SI units willbecome apparent in Sec. VI. That such an expression for
E/C1Jcan be derived from Maxwell’s equations shows that
energy is conserved in electromagnetic interactions and alsoprovides deﬁnitions for ﬁeld energy density and energy ﬂuxdensity. Deriving the analogous equation (5)for/C0qV/C1g
from the gravitational ﬁeld equations is needed to show thatthe energy is conserved in Newtonian gravity and to providedeﬁnitions for u
GandSG.
Expressions for uGandSGare derived here in Sec. III.
They are not unique: Only the rate of work per unit volume
is uniquely deﬁned in terms of measurable physical parame-ters, but there are several matched pairs u
GandSG, with any
of which Eq. (5)describes energy conservation quantita-
tively; Poynting’s theorem is similarly non-unique.15,16The
signiﬁcance of various expressions is discussed in Sec. IV.
The Newtonian energy equation is illustrated by examples inSec. Vand is compared with Poynting’s theorem in Sec. VI.

which does not have the conservation form of Eq. (5),
because the ﬁrst term on the right side is not a simple time

Equation (18) has the required conservation form; it is the
looked-for counterpart in classical Newtonian gravity ofPoynting’s theorem in electromagnetism. Unlike Poynting’s
theorem, however, Eq. (18) is hardly ever mentioned, nor
was it known to several colleagues I consulted. I have foundonly one advanced graduate level text where it is derived,
but without any discussion of its role in local energy conser-
vation and with the divergence term—the one feature notfound in standard texts—removed immediately by integra-
tion over space.
17
The gravitational energy density is
uG¼/C0g2
8pG; (19)
an intrinsically negative quantity; adding positive energy
makes it less negative, i.e., decreases the magnitude of the
gravitational ﬁeld. The gravitational energy ﬂux density is
SG¼UqV/C01
4pG@g
@t/C18/C19
; (20)
which is equal to gravitational potential Umultiplied by a
quantity (Eq. (12)), which is the mass ﬂux density qVmade
divergence-free by adding a term proportional to the time
derivative of the gravitational ﬁeld. This is precisely analo-
gous to the electric current density made divergence-free byadding the displacement-current term. The technical term for
this is advection of gravitational potential by the mass
ﬂow.
18An arbitrary constant added to Udoes not change the
divergence of SGand, thus, has no effect on energy
conservation.
Note that uGis analogous, except for the change of sign,
to the energy density of the electric ﬁeld in Poynting’s theo-rem, and S
Gis analogous to the electric part of the much-
discussed alternative form of the Poynting vector.16
B. Form 1b: Alternative form of energy flux density
The net gravitational energy ﬂowing out of a volume
enclosed by any equipotential surface U¼constant is given
by the surface integralð

w h i c hi sz e r ob yE q . (12). The two terms inside the parentheses
cancel, both representing, with opposite signs, the rate ofchange of the enclosed mass content: The second determinedfrom its gravitational effect and the ﬁrst from continuity ofmass ﬂow. Hence, the work done against gravity within the vol-
ume enclosed by a gravitational equipotential is balanced
entirely by the change of gravitational energy contained withinthe volume, and there being no net ﬂow of gravitational energythrough the equipotential surface. The averaged gravitationalenergy ﬂow is, thus, along the equipotential surfaces, and it isthen a simple further step to reformulate the energy equation so
that the local energy ﬂow also is always along the
equipotentials.
The divergence-free mass ﬂow may be written as the curl
of a vector bdeﬁned by

The concept of vector potential is commonly introduced formagnetic ﬁelds, but any divergence-free ﬁeld in three dimen-sions can be represented as the curl of a vector potential, justas any curl-free ﬁeld can be represented as the gradient of ascalar potential. To evaluate b, take the curl of Eq. (22)(not-
ing that r/C2g¼0) to obtain
r

SGexpressed by Eq. (29) is identical in the mathematical

Eqs. (22),(27), and (28), is analogous to the standard deriva-
tion of Poynting’s theorem. Equation (29) has previously
been derived by assuming that a velocity-dependent gravita-tional force implied by special relativity exists

discussed in Ref. 9.

an expression involving both the potential and its time deriva-

changes both uGand the divergence of SG, but the two changes
compensate each other, so here also energy conservation is notaffected. There is no counterpart of Eq. (21) because @U=@t
need not be constant on equipotential surfaces.
There are no speciﬁc analogs to Poynting’s theorem;
expressions of electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density in termsof potentials are seldom used except in purely electrostaticor purely magnetostatic contexts.
IV. PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE
In the three versions of the local energy conservation
equation for Newtonian gravity derived here, Eqs. (18),(28),and(32), the ﬁeld energy density u
Gappears in two forms:
As ﬁeld squared, Eq. (19), and as (1/2) density /C2potential,
Eq.(33). The two, often derived by just visualizing the sys-
tem assembled particle by particle, are well-covered in
texts.20They are related by the equation
/C0g2
8pG¼1
2qUþr/C1Ug
8pG/C18/C19
; (35)
which follows from Eqs. (9)and(15). Locally, Eq. (35) is
unchanged by adding an arbitrary constant to the potential,
but when integrated over the entire system, the equation
becomes
/C0ð
d3rg2
8pG¼ð
d3r1
2qU/C01
2MU1
¼ð
d3r1
2qU/C0U1 ðÞ ; (36)
where Mis the total mass and U1is the potential at inﬁnity.
The energy densities uGof the two expressions (19) and
(33), thus, integrate to the same total energy UGonly if
U1¼0 is assumed, and even then they describe two quite
different local distributions of energy.21
Which of these expressions for energy density and energy
ﬂux density are just mathematical functions constructed to
ensure conservation of energy, and which—if any—have
physical meaning? The objective criterion for physical
meaning, other than quasi-philosophical arguments on whatis “intuitively reasonable,” is that the expression be uniquely
deﬁned in terms of measurable physical parameters, which is
a criterion satisﬁed by work done. In the terminology of
Bridgman, a physical entity should have locally observable
effects and, hence, should be detectable by suitable in situ
instruments; quantities which can only be calculated from
theory and/or measurements made elsewhere are to be con-
sidered mathematical constructs.
From this point of view, the u
Gof Eq. (19) is a locally
measurable quantity and, thus, should be taken as the physi-
cal expression of gravitational energy density. The uGof Eq.
(33) is a mathematical construct: It can only be calculated
because a potential deﬁned solely by position in a force ﬁeldhas no local signatures and, hence, cannot be locally mea-
sured. In Bridgman’s example in Fig. 1, water in the upper
reservoir has more potential energy than water in the lower
reservoir, yet the properties of water in both reservoirs are
the same. In other kinds of systems, where work is done notby displacing matter in a force ﬁeld but by deforming a
structure, e.g., a bent bow or stretched spring, increased
potential energy isdetectable as increased strain.
Gravitational energy ﬂux density S
Gis a mathematical
construct in all three versions of the energy equation,
including the two that contain the physical expressionEq.(19) foru
G:SGdepends either on Uor on the vector
potential b, which also has no local signatures. In Fig. 1,
according to Bridgman, “[we] are driven… to associate
with gravitating matter a store of energy which can be dis-
closed by no known measuring instrument.”11The expres-
sions are products of two terms: In Eq. (18), the not-locally
measurable gravitational scalar potential is multiplied by
the locally measurable mass ﬂow, while in in Eq. (28),
the locally measurable gravitational ﬁeld is multiplied
by the not-locally measurable vector potential of mass ﬂow.

Under what conditions ﬁeld energy ﬂux density can only be
calculated although ﬁeld energy density can be measured isfurther elucidated in Sec. VI.
V. SOME EXAMPLES
A. Solar wind
A direct illustration of Eq. (21) is provided by the solar
wind, the continuous outﬂow of plasma from the Sun that
removes mass from the Sun at the rate of some 10
/C014solar
masses per year.22–25Although the work done to maintain
the ﬂow against solar gravity represents a potential energyinput equal to nearly twice the kinetic energy of the ﬂowitself, no gravitational potential energy is advected outwardby the solar wind; instead, potential /C2mass outﬂow rate rep-
resents the rate at which the Sun’s gravitational energy ischanging as the result of mass loss. While it is not uncom-mon to speak of the solar wind as carrying gravitational
potential energy, saying the same about solar photon radia-
tion, the energy/mass equivalent of which represents a massloss about a factor of four larger than mass removed by thesolar wind, is rather unusual, although not entirelyunknown.

B. Pumped-storage system in terms of fields
For the system sketched in Fig. 1, the ﬁeld can be decom-
posed into the sum of the unchanging vertical ﬁeld of theEarth g
0and the ﬁeld of the water in the reservoirs g1,
g¼g0þg1;jg1j/C28jg0j; (37)
with densities q0(Earth) and q1(water) and U0;U1the cor-
responding gravitational potentials. The water reservoirs are
treated as distinct from the Earth and above its surface.
To lowest order in jg1j=jg0j, Eq. (18)then becomes
/C0q1V/C1g0¼@
@t/C0g0/C1g1
4pG/C18/C19
þr/C1 U0q1V/C01
4pG@g1
@t/C18/C19/C20/C21
; (38)
and the alternative Eq. (28)becomes
/C0q1V/C1g0¼@
@t/C0g0/C1g1
4pG/C18/C19
þr/C1 g0/C2b ðÞ : (39)
Only the interaction energy term /C02g0/C1g1appears, the self-
energy term g2
0being time-independent and g2
1being negligi-
bly small. Since g0is vertical and downward, only the
vertical component of g1affects the energy density; an
upward vertical g1decreases the total jgj, hence increases the
gravitational energy; a downward g1does the reverse.
The energy expended by the work /C0q1V/C1g0to pump the
water goes into energy of the gravitational ﬁeld, which isbeing modiﬁed by the changing g
1as the mass of water is
transferred from lower to higher altitude. The path of energy
ﬂow from the pump to the perturbed ﬁeld, as described by
Eq.(38), begins with advection by the q1VU0term, ﬁrst
upward within the connecting pipe and then horizontally intothe upper reservoir; there follows the downward ﬂow ofgravitational energy represented by the /C0ðU
0=4pGÞ@g1=@t
term, which presumably spreads horizontally over a widerarea. This will roughly be a distance comparable in the order
of magnitude either to the horizontal extent or to the verticalseparation of the reservoirs, whichever is larger. Integratedover any one of the equipotential surfaces (approximatelyconstant height, shown by dotted lines in Fig. 1) between the
top and the bottom levels, the two terms cancel exactly: Theupward advection of potential by ﬂow within the pipe is bal-anced by the integrated downward ﬂow of ﬁeld energyeverywhere produced by the time derivative of the changing
g
1. There is no net vertical ﬂow of gravitational energy,
although there may be localized up-and-down variations thataverage out to zero; the mechanical energy expended withineach height range goes into changing the energy of the gravi-tational ﬁeld within that height range.
In the alternative description of the energy ﬂow by Eq.
(39), the change of gravitational ﬁeld energy is everywhere
the same as above, but the energy ﬂow pattern is different,proceeding horizontally outward from the pump and con-necting pipe. g
0is vertical and essentially constant; bcircles
around the pump and connecting pipe, and its magnitudedecreases with increasing distance from them.
The total interaction energy of the reservoir-Earth system
is a global quantity, requiring integration over the entire sys-tem. The change of the gravitational energy as water is
pumped from lower to the upper reservoir (or vice versa), onthe other hand, can be computed from the changes of g
1,
which are essentially local, becoming negligible at distanceslarge compared to the horizontal extent of the reservoirs. Inreal life, the horizontal extent of a reservoir is likely to be
much larger than its depth. The gravitational ﬁeld g
1is then
that of a thin ﬂat plate: The vertical components point intothe plate on both sides and decrease in magnitude only oververtical length scales comparable to the horizontal extent ofthe plate. If in addition the altitude difference of the reser-voirs is much smaller than their horizontal extent, g
1can be
represented by the following simple model.

Thus, the integrated energy change equals total work done.
In regions above d–d0and below a–a0(Earth’s surface),
where negligible work is done, signiﬁcant non-uniform ﬁelds

When expressed in terms of potentials, energy supplied by
the work is partitioned: One half changes the potential
energy stored in the reservoirs, and the other half ﬂows down
to change the potential energy stored in the Earth.
VI. COMPARISON WITH POYNTING’S THEOREM
Poynting’s theorem is arguably the best-known of all the
local ﬁeld energy conservation equations. In its standard
form of Eq. (7)or(8), it has electromagnetic ﬁeld energy
density expressed in terms of ﬁelds and energy ﬂux density
given by the Poynting vector; an alternate form of energy
ﬂux density in terms of potentials is also well known.16
There are similarities and differences between both forms
of Poynting’s theorem and the corresponding forms of the
Newtonian energy equation. Aside from differently deﬁnedquantities, units, and change of sign, one obvious difference
is the presence of two locally measurable force ﬁelds Eand
Bin electromagnetism, in contrast to the one ﬁeld gof grav-
ity. As shown in Sec. III B, however, the Newtonian energy
equation can be expressed in the form of Eq. (28), mathemat-
ically identical with Poynting’s theorem, which also contains
two ﬁelds gandb, the only difference being that bappears
in the energy ﬂux density term (the counterpart of thePoynting vector) but not in the energy density term. To
understand why this is so, it is instructive to rederive
Poynting’s theorem, by analogy with the derivation of the
Newtonian Eq. (28), taking charge conservation as the start-
ing point,

and not introducing the magnetic ﬁeld until it becomes nec-

the time derivative of an added energy density ðk=2Þjb/C3j2.
Equation (55) can now be identiﬁed with Faraday’s law,
thereby introducing explicitly the physical magnetic ﬁeld B
and establishing its relation to the mathematical construct b/C3,

(k¼c2=4p;k¼l0for Gaussian and SI units, respectively).
What makes the above clear is that, as far as conservation
of energy is concerned, the difference between Newtoniangravity and electromagnetism results from the assumption
r/C2g¼0 in contrast to r/C2E6¼0: The magnetic ﬁeld
appears as an added energy density term in Poynting’s theo-rem (despite the fact that magnetic force does no work)
because of Faraday’s law, but there is no corresponding
added term in the Newtonian equation. The two expressionsfor energy ﬂux density, on the other hand, can be put into
identical forms except for a sign difference,

b
/C3is related to Jby a similar equation with the Laplacian
replaced by the speed-of-light wave operator. Both theenergy ﬂux densities, Poynting vector and its Newtonian
counterpart, are determined by the values of b
/C3andb, inde-
pendently of whether or not these are related to locally mea-surable quantities (and if so, how).
These mathematical constructs can, in fact, be related to
physical quantities. The electromagnetic b
/C3is proportional
to the magnetic ﬁeld, according to Eqs. (56) and(57). The
gravitational bhas no observable physical effects within the
strictly Newtonian theory, but an additional acceleration pro-
portional to the particle velocity v,
/C0v=cðÞ/C2h; (60)
appears in the linear (post-Newtonian) approximation to gen-
eral relativity.27The “gravomagnetic ﬁeld” his related to b

marks as a reminder that general relativity treats gravity in a
fundamentally different way than Newtonian theory. Theanalogy between Bandhis mathematical: Both are measur-
able (in principle!) by observing the acceleration of a moving
test particle, but Bis a physical force ﬁeld acting on theparticle while his the consequence of modiﬁed space-time
geometry.
The physical signiﬁcance of these relations is readily
apparent for the electromagnetic case in Gaussian units, Eq.
(56), as well as for the gravitational case, Eq. (61): The
mathematical construct is proportional to the physical quan-
tity multiplied by the speed of light. This suggests that what
confers independent physical reality to ﬂow of ﬁeld energyis ﬁnite propagation speed, as alluded to in Sec. I. The sour-
ces of the ﬁeld (charge or mass) change on a time scale set
by the ﬂow of the source (current or mass ﬂow); as long asthe ﬁeld conﬁguration adjusts itself to the changing sources
instantaneously as assumed in electrostatics and in
Newtonian gravity, ﬁeld energy distribution and source dis-tribution are both changing on the same time scale; hence,
the ﬁeld energy ﬂow as a physical process distinct from the
source ﬂow is not observable. When the adjustment of theﬁeld to changes in its sources is no longer instantaneous,
however, mathematical terms constructed to express balance
between energy supply and storage become identiﬁable asphysical locally measurable ﬁelds, varying on time scales
that can differ from those of their sources. Consistent with
this interpretation, for a given energy ﬂow rate, these ﬁeldsare proportional to 1 =c. When ccan be regarded as effec-
tively inﬁnite relative to spatial and temporal scales, the
physical ﬁeld approaches negligible values while the mathe-matical construct remains ﬁnite.
Whether the above interpretation could be inferred from
Eq.(57) in SI units instead of Eq. (56) in Gaussian units is
not clear. It has been repeatedly pointed out that SI units
treat electric and magnetic ﬁelds asymmetrically, therebyobscuring the fundamental symmetry between them required
by special relativity.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
(1) A local energy conservation equation for Newtonian
gravity, which plays the same role as Poynting’s theorem
for electromagnetism, has been derived in three different
forms: Eqs. (18),(28), and (32). All three include the
divergence of a gravitational energy ﬂux density; this
term, analogous to the divergence of the Poynting vector
in electromagnetism, has been left out in almost all pre-vious discussions of Newtonian gravity with the excep-
tion of some obscure and highly specialized texts.
(2) The gravitational energy ﬂux density in Eq. (28) is
expressed in a mathematical form identical to that of thePoynting vector. This expression, derived previously
only by invoking ﬁrst-order relativistic terms, is here
purely obtained from the ﬁeld equations of Newtoniangravity, conﬁrming that Newtonian theory is logically
complete by itself and does not require reference to rela-
tivistic effects.
(3) Conversely, a local energy conservation equation for
electromagnetism can be purely derived from electro-
static equations (assuming r/C2E¼0), without intro-
ducing the magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting equation (54),
analogous to the gravitational equation (28), is a trun-
cated Poynting’s theorem: It contains no magnetic
energy term but does contain the divergence of a ﬁeldenergy ﬂux density, identical to the usual Poynting vec-tor except for replacement of the magnetic ﬁeld by a
mathematical construct, the curl of which equals the cur-
rent density without the proportionality constant (4 p=cin

Gaussian or l0in SI units). I am not aware of any previ-
ous publication of this “electrostatic” Poynting’stheorem.
(4) The energy density of the gravitational ﬁeld in Eqs. (18)
and(28) is the well-known expression in terms of the
local gravitational ﬁeld and, thus, can be identiﬁed with
a locally measurable physical quantity. The energy den-sity in Eq. (32), the equally well-known expression in
terms of density and potential, is calculable but notlocally measurable. Both expressions have been derivedhere rigorously from the ﬁeld equations.
(5) The gravitational energy ﬂux density in all three forms
of the Newtonian energy equation is calculable but is notlocally measurable. Comparison with Poynting’s theo-rem and with the post-Newtonian approximation to gen-eral relativity suggests that ﬁeld energy ﬂux densitybecomes locally observable when the ﬁnite speed of lightis taken into account.

APPENDIX: ENERGY OF INTERACTION BETWEEN
TWO EXTENDED MASSES
Consider an extended mass m
0ﬁlling a ﬁnite closed vol-
ume, plus another extended mass m1outside the volume. The
gravitational ﬁeld can be expressed as the sum
g¼g0þg1; (A1)
where g0;g1and the corresponding gravitational potentials
U0;U1are related by Poisson’s equation (9)to the densities
q0,q1, respectively. Since the energy of the gravitational
ﬁeld is expressed, in all its forms, as a product of two factors,the energy U
Gof the entire system can be written as the sum
UG¼Uself;0þUself;1þUint; (A2)
where Uself;0;Uself;1are the self-energies of the two masses
(each in isolation) and Uintis their interaction energy. With
the ﬁeld energy in terms of potentials, Eq. (33), the energies
are given by the integrals
Uself;0¼1

which can be formally taken over all space as the integrands
are automatically non-zero only over the volumes of the twomasses.1. Reciprocity relation between exterior and interior
potential energies
The interaction energy Eq. (A4) is the sum of two inte-
grals, which can be related to the help of Green’s identity
(16)rewritten as

This is the reciprocity relation: The potential energy of mass
m1in the ﬁeld of mass m0equals the potential energy of
mass m0in the ﬁeld of mass m1. With the two integrals in
Eq.(A4) equal, the interaction energy Uintis partitioned
between the two masses in the ratio 1/2 to 1/2.
If, within either volume, the distribution of density under-
goes a change ( q!q0) without the change of total mass m,
the changes within both volumes are still related by Eq.
(A7),

for any value of U1. The reciprocity relation, thus, holds
also for changes of potential energy without the need to
assume U1¼0; the change of interaction energy DUintis
partitioned equally between the two masses.
2. Interaction energy in terms of fields

gies are given by the integrals over all space,

Uintis now a single integral over all space, symmetrically
dependent on both g1andg0; the integrand is non-zero
everywhere and locally can be positive or negative; the inte-
grated Uint, however, is always negative. The separation of
contributions from each mass is not possible, but an interest-
ing albeit non-unique association can be made. Write
Green’s identity (15) in two equivalent versions:
/C0g0/C1g1¼r/C1 U0g1ðÞ /C0U0r/C1g1; (A14)
/C0g1/C1g0¼r/C1 U1g0ðÞ /C0U1r/C1g0: (A15)
Select the equipotential U0of the ﬁeld of mass m0enclosing
the volume that includes the mass m0and just touches but
does notinclude the mass m1. Integrating Eq. (A14) over the
volume interior to the equipotential surface U0gives

The surface integral is zero because the surface does not
enclose the mass m1. The interaction energy density is not
zero inside the volume, however, but takes both negative and
positive values which cancel when summed; g1/C1g1is mostly
negative in the half-volume closer to m1and positive in the
other half. With the integral over the interior volume equal
to zero, the integral over the volume exterior to the equipo-
tential, which does include the mass m1, equals the integral
over all space, which by Eq. (A13) equals the interaction
energy,
ð

Selecting the equipotential U1instead of the ﬁeld of mass m1
enclosing the volume that includes the mass m1and just
touches but does not include the mass m0, then integrating
Eq.(A15) over the volumes interior and exterior to U1,
respectively, gives identical results with the masses m1and
m0interchanged.

18Advection of a property is the term for transport of that property by a bulk
ﬂow, used by ﬂuid dynamicists and meteorologists. Convection , strictly
speaking, is a special type of advection, deﬁned differently in differentcontexts but generally connoting some type of circulating ﬂow, particu-larly as the result of an instability. Imprecise use of the term convection as
a loose synonym for advection, however, is common.
