Modulated strain displacements were measured with a quadrature Michelson–Morley interferometer
employing polarization optics and two lock-in ampliﬁers to ﬁlter noise and thermal drift. The
advantages of the technique, its limitations, and estimates on the accuracy are discussed, includingan algorithm to correct for non-ideal components and non-linear effects. Instructions for the
construction and setup of the quadrature interferometer are provided. To test the interferometer,
the dynamic converse piezoelectric effect was used, and by modulating the electric ﬁeld across thesample, the d
14jj strain coefﬁcient for x-cut quartz was determined to be 0 :6660:04 pC =N, which is
within 1.5 standard deviations of the accepted standard. The measurements had a standard deviation
of 4.1 pm, resulting in standard errors as low as 5 fm/V after ﬁtting. #2023 Published under an exclusive

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the introduction of the ﬁrst optical interferometers,
advanced techniques1have been devised to improve their
sensitivity. One technique, the topic of this paper, is the
quadrature interferometer, which generates four distinct sig-
nals from the interference of superimposed waves with rela-tive phases of 90
/C14, 180/C14, and 270/C14. In practical quadrature
applications, only two of these signals are monitored withrelative phases of 90
/C14. This additional information provides
high accuracy without the need for other techniques such aselectromechanical feedback to maintain a constant phaserelationship.
1It also allows for unambiguous directional
information about the interferometer’s pathlength changes.
The interferometer generates its quadrature outputs by uti-
lizing polarization optics. It consists of a traditionalMichelson–Morley interferometer with four additional opti-cal components: A circular polarizer, a linear polarizer, apolarizing beam splitter, and an additional detector for the90
/C14out-of-phase signal. We have developed this design from
more complex measurement systems2,3not only to simplify
the experimental setup and alignment process but also
because it only involves the addition of linearly and circu-
larly polarized light, making it easier to explain.
Relying only on polarization optics as opposed to, for
example, mechanical feedback1or frequency shifting with
AO cells4makes this interferometer design well suited to
observe transients, because its response time is only limitedby the optical detector electronics. In our advanced lab, wehave explored the time evolution of compression waves trav-
elling at speeds of 5000 m/s in stainless steel rods.5Using a
digital oscilloscope to record the voltages from the two
detectors at sampling rates of 107samples per second allows
students to study the resulting displacements with just sixlines of code6with an accuracy of 1 nm or better.
Recently, we have been intrigued by the piezoelectric
effect in biological samples, speciﬁcally bones,7,8and
wood.9,10While the former has lately received attention,
because it is believed that exercise and bone growth andhealing might be directly linked to the piezoelectriceffect,
11,12the latter is a topic of little exploration. In both
cases, the piezoelectric effect is extremely small, resulting indisplacements of less than 1 pm/V when a voltage is applied
across the samples, putting it beyond the resolution of our
simple (DC) detection technique. We have determined thatthe limiting factor was the dominance of 1/f noise, i.e., thedrift in the measurements due to slow temperature changesin the room causing thermal expansion and contraction ofthe interferometer’s pathlength.
The solution to this problem was inspired by Reichert,
13
who in response to the recent discoveries by LIGO ques-
tioned how small a displacement one could measure in anadvanced undergraduate lab, speciﬁcally if one paired inter-ferometry with a noise suppression technique. One usefulmethod is phase sensitive lock-in ampliﬁcation,
14,15which
detects an AC signal at a speciﬁc frequency while rejecting
all other signals, similar to tuning a radio receiver to the spe-ciﬁc frequency of a radio station. In our experiment, the

“radio” signal is generated by applying an AC modulation
voltage across a piezoelectric sample, resulting in distortionsproportional to the applied electric ﬁeld. Attaching one ofthe interferometer’s mirrors to one side of the constrainedsample allows us to receive this signal from the interferome-ter’s detectors with our “radios,” consisting of two commer-cially available lock-in ampliﬁers (LIAs), each measuringthe amplitude and phase of the AC modulation at the speciﬁcmodulation frequency. While these readings are directly pro-portional to the amplitude of the sample’s distortion, theyalso depend on the phase difference of the two arms.Because the quadrature interferometer’s signals are exactly90
/C14out of phase with each other, a vector addition of the two
lock-in ampliﬁer signals yields a modulation amplitude thatis independent of the overall intensity.
We have applied this technique in our advanced lab and
measured the piezoelectric effect in wood and bone.6As con-
ﬁrmation, we present the results for a quartz sample sincestandard values exist for its piezoelectricity.16,17Even with
thermal drifts on the order of nanometers during the dataacquisition period, we were able to measure displacementsdue to shear strains with a standard deviation of 4.1 pm or1/150 000 of the wavelength of the interferometer’s lightsource. We determined the piezoelectric constant of ourquartz sample to within 1.5 standard deviations of itsaccepted value with the main uncertainty being the dimen-sions of the sample and the location of the interferometer’sbeam with respect to it.
In addition to describing the experimental setup, we derive
the relevant equations for a quadrature interferometer start-ing with the simple Michelson–Morley interferometer. Wepresent three different methods to analyze the data withincreasing complexity and accuracy, and we provide esti-mates of the accuracy of this technique and its limitations.
II. THEORY
A. Optical interferometry
By attaching a mirror directly to the sample, the resulting
deformation due to the piezoelectric effect was measured withan intensity splitting, optical Michelson–Morley type interfer-ometer (MMI). What follows is a brief derivation of how thedisplacement of the mirror affects the intensity of therecombined beam, ﬁrst for a traditional MMI and then for the
type of quadrature interferometer used in this experiment.
B. Traditional Michelson–Morley interferometer
For plane waves, the time dependent electric ﬁeld vector
of a monochromatic wave with frequency xand wavelength
kpropagating (in a vacuum) along the z-direction can be
expressed as the complex expression

; (1)
where ~Jis the (complex) Jones vector and represents the
amplitude and phase relationship of the polarization states in
thex- and y-directions.18For the traditional MMI, we may
assume that the electric ﬁeld is entirely contained in a single
component, arbitrary chosen in ^x, with a real amplitude ax,
or~J¼ax
0/C20/C21
.
We now follow the interferometer’s two separate beam paths
as they exit an inﬁnitely thin non-polarizing beam splitter
(NPBS), which we designate as the z¼0 point. (For illustra-
tion see Fig. 1. Though it represents the more complex quadra-
ture interferometer, by removing all its polarization
components (CP, LP, and PBS) and detector Y, it yields the tra-
ditional MMI discussed here.) After traveling distances u1þu3
andu2þu3, they both reach the detector located at point zD.
At this point, the ﬁelds from each of the two paths are

tively, and NPBS and PBS are non-polarizing 50:50 and polarizing beam splitters, respectively. The polarization is linear along u 0and u 1, circular along u 2,
and elliptical along u 3. Note that the distances u 1and u 2refer to the two-way path lengths between the NPBS and the corresponding mirror.

/0¼2pn;this will prevent us from determining the correct
net displacement znetwhen it is carried out over multiple
measurements, dzi, with znet¼Pdzi. This is of concern
when working in a noisy environment or, as is the case in
this experiment, when the sample undergoes small sinusoidaloscillations, which exhibit no net displacement. In addition,these small displacements generate a response equivalent totheir derivative, which according to Eq. (10) becomes van-
ishingly small for /

resolved by monitoring Vxand with the aid of a mechanical
actuator, adjusting the pathlength such that Du0¼nð

placement dzcan then be determined from the path lengthcorrections applied to the actuator to maintain this condi-
tion.1Instead, we selected an optical solution by generating

remains exactly 90/C14out of phase with Vx, i.e., Vy/0;dz ðÞ

C. Quadrature Michelson–Morley interferometer theory
Different optical designs exist for polarized quadrature
interferometers, also sometimes called “optical screws.”2,3,19
While they are based on the intensity splitting design of the
traditional MMI, a speciﬁc phase relationship between the
perpendicular polarization components of the two beams
must exist to achieve a quadrature relationship when the two
beams are recombined and interfere with each other.Speciﬁcally, while the polarization components of one beam
remain in phase with each other, so they are linearly polar-
ized, the components of the other beam must be 90
/C14out of
phase with each other, or circularly polarized. The difference
in the various setups consists in the polarization of the input
wave—linear or circular—and the optical components
employed to achieve the complementary polarization within
the interferometer. The main advantage of the quadrature
interferometer is that it creates two spatially identical, over-
lapping “traditional” MMIs, albeit with a speciﬁc phase rela-
tionship between them that allows us to recover directional
information of the pathlength changes.
The derivation is very similar to the one for the traditional
MMI except that in this case we must consider the both the x
andycomponents of the electric ﬁeld vector. The Jones vec-
tor for a linearly polarized wave at 45/C14to its x-axis is
~J1¼a11

: (12)
Since both components of the Jones vector are real, the EM
wave’s xandy-components oscillate in phase. Similar to the
previous discussion, this wave follows path u1, and hence, its
corresponding electric ﬁeld is

reﬂecting the y-component,0

detector separately measures intensity as the product of the
ﬁeld at the detector with its complex conjugate. The mea-sured intensities are scalars, but we can write them more
compactly in vector form with xandycomponents measured
individually by detectors XandYas

Unsurprisingly, I
xfor the quad detector is identical to the
previous result for the traditional MMI, Eq. (9). However,
with the addition of a polarizing beam splitter, IxandIycan
be measured individually allowing us to determine both the
magnitude and direction of dz.
While for the traditional MMI we assumed the ﬁeld ampli-
tudes ax1andax2to be identical, this is not the case in quad
detector. Prior to the start of its path along u1, the circularly
polarized wave is converted by the linear polarizer into alinearly polarized wave, which reduces its intensity by 1/2,

D. AC modulation and lock-in amplifier technique
for small signal detection
We were able to improve the resolution of the apparatus
by a factor of 100 by applying an AC modulation method in
Fig. 2. Because of the quadrature technique, the voltages for detectors X vs Y always remain 90 degrees out of phase with each other. Plotting them for di s-
placements dztraces out the circle shown above with radius V 0. Two different techniques exist for measuring the displacement, dz: The method in (a) relies on
two data points while the method in (b) sinusoidal perturbs the signal and then performs a vector addition of its response, indicated by the dashed vect ors.

combination with the lock-in detection method. First, we
sinusoidally modulated the voltage applied across the sample
at a ﬁxed driving frequency fD, causing a sinusoidal displace-
ment with amplitude dzdue to the piezoelectric shear strain.

The measurement of the AC component is well suited for
lock-in ampliﬁers because, through a technique known asphase-sensitive detection, they can single out the signal com-
ponent at a speciﬁc reference frequency, in our case the driv-
ing frequency f
D, to measure both the signal’s amplitude and
phase. It accomplishes this by functioning like a narrow
bandpass ﬁlter with center frequency fDand a bandwidth set
by its low-pass-ﬁlter’s time constant and rolloff; noise sig-nals outside of this passband are attenuated so they no longer
affect the measurements. (For tutorials on lock-in ampliﬁers,
see Refs. 14and15.) This technique allowed us to measuremodulation amplitudes as small as 4 pm while ﬁltering out
the far larger, 1.4 nm, 1/f type, DC drifts per measurementcycle, due to ambient temperature ﬂuctuations.
Connecting each detector to a separate commercial dual
channel lock-in ampliﬁer yields a direct measurement of the
modulated AC components

In the analysis presented here, we restrict ourselves to the
absolute value of the displacement, jdzjand consequently,
jd14j. However, since the lock-in ampliﬁer provides both
amplitude and phase information, we could have determinedthe direction of the displacement by comparing the phaseof the modulation voltage to its response at its detectors. Forthe piezoelectric effect, a positive stimulus voltage may,
depending on the material and its orientation, lead to either
an expansion or contraction, causing a displacement either inthe positive or negative direction, yielding a phase at detec-torsXorYof 0 or6p. For example, if at /
0¼0 the stimu-
lus and the response VyAC are in phase, then the sample
reacts to a positive stimulus with a contraction while a phase
difference of 6pindicates the opposite, namely, the sample
expanding with a positive stimulus. Since we neglected tomonitor this property, we are not going to elaborate on thistopic, but it could be used to measure the sign of the piezo-electric constant, d
14.
Equation (27) sufﬁces to analyze the magnitude of the dis-
placements of an ideal quadrature interferometer, from
which we obtained an error rdz¼50 pm. We will next derive
the necessary corrections for working with a non-ideal inter-ferometer to improve our accuracy.

accuracy, speciﬁcally in the case of the parametrized cir-cle, can be determined by calculating the voltages detected

III. APPARATUS
The distortions of the samples due to the piezoelectric effect
were measured with a quadrature interferometer, as shown in
Figs. 1,4,a n d 5. The speciﬁc design was selected for its sim-
plicity, which is desirable in a teaching environment. Onceassembled and aligned, only two polarization components—thecircular and linear polarizers—need to be rotated to generate an
optimal output signal. However, this design lacks the freedom
to correct for the unwanted ellipticity, which we determinedwas primarily due to unequal reﬂection coefﬁcients for thepolarized wave’s s- and p-components when the beam’sincidence on the interferometer’s mirrors deviates from perpen-
dicular, as expressed by the Fresnel equations.
18Typically, this
is compensated for by adding wave retarders within the interfer-ometer or by using an elliptical input wave, both of which com-plicate the initial setup. Instead, we opted to correct for thiswith the elliptical analysis. Components and their Thorlabs partnumbers and (2019) prices for the interferometer are given in
Table I.
The interferometer was powered with a 4.5 mW, linearly
polarized, frequency stabilized HeNe Laser with a wave-length of 632.8 nm (Spectra Physics, model 117A.). To allowfor beam steering, its output was sent to the interferometer
along a U-shaped path as in Fig. 1, controlled by two 1 in.
kinematic mirror mounts.
The interferometer was assembled using a 30 mm cage
system (Thorlabs) and, except for the mirror attached to the
sample, formed a rigid structure to reduce the effect of exter-
nal vibrations.
The beam entered the interferometer through a circular
polarizer (CP) mounted at the input port of the non-polarizing
beam splitter (NPBS) cube. To maximize its output intensity,
we rotated the circular polarizer until the DC voltage observedat either detector XorYreached a maximum while one of the
paths of the interferometer was blocked.
The circularly polarized light was then split by the 50:50
NPBS with one part being transmitted to the measurement
Fig. 4. An artist’s rendition of the electromagnetic polarization of the quad-
rature interferometer. The circularly polarized wave enters the interferome-
ter at the lower left. Encountering the non-polarized beam splitter (NPBS)
one part continues to u 2while the other, after passing through the linear
polarizer (LP), continues along u 1as a linearly polarized wave. Both compo-
nents are reﬂected by the mirrors to the NPBS where they combine into an
elliptically polarized wave. They continue to the polarizing beam splitter(PBS) where their horizontal and vertical polarization components are mea-
sured by detectors X and Y, respectively.

arm, labeled u2in Fig. 1, and the other reﬂected to the refer-
ence arm, u1. While the light’s polarization along path u2
was unaltered and, therefore remained circularly polarized,
along path u1it was changed back into linear polarization by
passing it through a linear polarizer, LP. This LP was care-
fully aligned by blocking the light from path u2and monitor-
ing the signals from detectors Xand Yuntil they were
identical, so that the resulting polarization along u1was at
45/C14with respect to the EM wave’s xy-plane.
Upon reaching the mirrors along paths u1andu2, the light
reﬂects to the NPBS where the two beams recombine andinterfere with each other. Half of this signal is lost because itis reﬂected by the NPBS back to the laser, while the other
half continues along u
3toward the polarizing beam splitter
(PBS), where it is separated according to its polarizationaxis, with its p-component transmitted by the PBS to detec-
torXand its s-component reﬂected toward detector Y.
The detectors (Thorlabs PDA36A silicon switchable gain
detector with 10 MHz bandwidth) produce a voltage propor-tional to the intensity of the incoming light. An adjustableiris, (Thorlabs part# SM1D12D), not shown in Fig. 1, was
mounted between the PBS and each of the detectors to allow
for additional control over the intensity and beam diameterof the signal entering the detector. Each detector’s outputvoltage was recorded by two instruments: The DC compo-nent with a DVM (HP 34401A) and the RMS AC componentwith a lock-in ampliﬁer (Stanford Research SR830). Theentire setup was mounted on a vibration-absorbing optical
table (TMC Micro-g Model Number 14-427-45).
A function generator (Keysight 33510B) provided both our
square wave reference signal for the two lock-in ampliﬁers aswell as our sinusoidal modulation voltage, which was ampliﬁedby a bi-polar piezo driver (PiezoDrive PDu100).
20The function
generator, DVMs, and lock-in ampliﬁers were controlled withNational Instruments LabView Version 2018.
A. Piezoelectric samples
The x-cut single crystal quartz, with dimensions 10 /C210
/C21m m3, was purchased from MTI Corporation (Part Number
1SP-SOX101010S1) and mounted as shown in Fig. 6.
The electric ﬁeld across the samples was generated by apply-
ing a voltage, VPiezo, to two electrodes, made of 0.002-inch-
thick aluminum tape with adhesive backing (Intertape Polymer
Group). These were afﬁxed to the sample’s opposite sides,along its yz-plane. A 7 mm diameter broadband mirror was
glued with cyanoacrylate adhesive and accelerator (FastCap2P-10) to the front of the sample, i.e., its xy-plane, and it served
as the reﬂecting mirror in path u
2of the interferometer. Finally,
for optical ﬁne adjustment, the sample with its mirror was
epoxied (Bob Smith Industries Five-Minute Epoxy) along its
topxz-plane onto a 1 in. diameter, 1 1/2 in. long keyed carbon
steel rod (McMaster, Part Number 1497K281) and mounted ina standard 1 in. kinematic mirror mount.
IV. METHODS: DATA COLLECTION PROCESS
The data collection process began by setting the function
generator’s output frequency, f
D, to 12.5 Hz, sufﬁciently low
for the piezoelectric samples to respond. The function gener-ator’s output V
Drive was set to VRandsin 2pfDtþ2:5Vwith
VRand being a uniformly distributed random value between
0 and 1.65 V. This signal was then linearly ampliﬁed bythe bi-polar piezo driver to its nominal output voltage55V
Randsin 2pfDt. With both lock-in ampliﬁers’ 12 dB/octave
low-pass ﬁlter’s time-constant set to 3 s and its input cou-pling in AC mode with the display mode set to polar (R/Theta), V
xLIA andVyLIA were recorded from detectors Xand
Yafter a 30 s time delay, allowing sufﬁcient time for signal
processing. Finally, other DVMs recorded VxDCand VyDC
and the RMS AC voltage applied to the sample, VPiezo=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
,
and this procedure was repeated until it was terminated by
the user.
Since the experimental setup was in an active undergradu-
ate lab, to reduce both light and vibrational noise, data runs
were conducted overnight with the interferometer covered
by a cardboard box, yielding data for one to two thousanddistinct piezo voltages.
V. ANALYSIS
We used two different algorithms in
MATLAB R2021b to
analyze our data. Both relied on ﬁtting VxDCandVyDCto the
parameterized ellipse as speciﬁed in Eq. (32) to obtain values
for the offsets, kx,ky, the semimajor axes, a,b, and the tilt
angle, n, thus allowing us to compute /0for each measure-
ment. Though we treat VxDCandVyDCin Eqs. (31) and(32)
as DC components, they do not remain constant over long
time periods. Due to the thermal drift, they gradually shift
during the data acquisition process, causing /0to trace out
the entire contour of the ellipse, as shown in Fig. 7, thus
allowing us to calculate its parameters.
The ﬁrst method to determine the optimal parameters of
an ellipse relied on the work of Gander et al.21In brief, they
employed geometric distance weighting and an iterativeweighted least squares process. The second method, devel-
oped by us, relied on
MATLAB ’s nonlinear least-squares
solver, the lsqnonlin function. Testing revealed no clear
advantage of either algorithm over the other. What follows is
a brief outline of the algorithm we developed.
First, initial guesses for the parameterized ellipse in Eq.
(32) were made. These “seed values” are required by the
Fig. 6. Exploded view of a sample when an electric ﬁeld is applied between
the electrodes in the x-direction. The shear strain created by the converse
piezoelectric effect distorts the originally rectangular sample into a parallel-
epiped, and with the sample constrained along its top xz-surface, it displaces
the mirror at the bottom of the sample along the z-axis a distance dz. The
effect depends on the sample type and orientation. For quartz, its z-axis wasparallel to the z-axis shown in the ﬁgure and the same applied to the ﬁbers
of the wood and bone samples. For illustration purposes, this effect, speciﬁ-
cally the angle generated between the sample’s xy-plane and the y-axis,
dz/Y, has been exaggerated. In the experiment, it never exceeded 0.05
arcsec. The smallest resolvable change was 1/100 of that, corresponding to
the angle subtended by the thickness of a typical human hair 250 km away.

Parameters kx,ky,a,b, and nare then adjusted in an itera-

“optimal” values are determined by minimizing the sum of
the square of the difference (SSE) between the individualdata points, VxDC iandVyDC i, and the values calculated from
Eq.(32), given by

Using these parameters and the values of VxLIAandVyLIA
in Eq. (35) determines jdzj. Fitting jdzjvs.VPiezo yields a
linear relationship from which jd14jcan be extracted using
Eq.(29).
VI. RESULTS
While we measured the strain when a voltage was applied
(converse effect), some of the published values measured thevoltage in the presence of a strain (direct effect). Lippman’stheory
22says these should be the same, so we compare our
results to them. Also, we do not distinguish between results
from dynamic measurements with those from static ones,i.e., measurements where the independent variable changes
as a function of time or not.
Figure 7displays the horizontal and vertical polarization
components from photodetectors XandY, respectively, for
the quartz sample. During the 18.3 h that the 1945 data points
were collected, there was a gradual drift in the interferome-
ter’s path length, as seen in Fig. 8, causing the x- and y-
components to sweep out the parametrized ellipse as
predicted in Eq. (32). Though modulation voltages were
applied to the sample during the entire data acquisition pro-cess, these perturbations were so small, jd/
zj<0:5/C14, that
they did not affect the DC voltage measurements. Also
shown in Fig. 7is a least-squares ﬁt of the data to the param-
eterized ellipse to determine its parameters. In the ﬁt, an
uncertainty, rVxDCandrVyDC, of 1.5 mV resulted in a reduced
Fig. 7. The horizontal and vertical polarization components as measured by
the DC voltage at detectors X vs Y. Due to thermal drift over the 18-hour
acquisition cycle, the individual data points sweep out the entire parame-trized ellipse. Error bars corresponding to r
VxDC;rVyDC¼1:5 mV are not
shown for clarity.
Fig. 8. While the exact cause of the mirror drift as a function of time wasnot determined, the graph gives an indication of its extent. It also provides
an estimate of the average drift during the 30 s required for one data acquisi-
tion cycle, approximately 1.4 nm. There is no particular reason why in this
ﬁgure the drift changes monotonically, and in most sampling periods for dif-
ferent samples, the change was not monotonic with cycles lasting anywhere
from 8 to 16 h.

chi-squared, v2
/C23, of 0.98 and a p-value of 0.26, indicating a
good agreement between our ﬁt model and the data.23The
uncertainty ratio in the individual ﬁt parameters ranged from
1/1700 (for nÞto 1/6000 (for kx,ky).
The mirror drift over the entire data acquisition time is
shown in Fig. 8. It was calculated by “unwrapping” the
angle, /0i, to account for 2pphase shifts.
The approximately 3 lm net-drift was most likely caused
by unequal thermal expansions in the two arms of the inter-
ferometer: One of them was connected separately to the opti-
cal table while the other was contained within theinterferometer’s stainless steel cage system. For example, a
thermal coefﬁcient difference of 10/C05m/m/C14C between the
two 0.15 m pathlengths would generate a drift like the oneshown if the ambient temperature changes by only 2
/C14C.
Figure 9shows the displacement, jdzj, as a function of the
amplitude of the applied piezo voltage. Note that in compari-
son to the average drift of 1400 pm during the 30 s of onedata acquisition cycle, the modulated displacement had a
standard deviation of 4.1 pm, demonstrating the necessity of
using lock-in techniques for our data collection.
A linear ﬁt of jdzjvs.V
Piezo, with uncertainty rdz
¼4.1 pm, yields dz=dVPiezo¼4.46460.004 pm/V and v2
/C23
¼1.02, corresponding to a p-value of 0.23. In comparison,
the result of a ﬁnite element analysis in COMSOL
Multiphysics 5.6 for a “Quartz LH (1978 IEEE)” sample of
identical size, orientation, and boundary conditions as in ourexperimental setup yielded dz=dV
Piezo¼4.6 pm/V, which is
very close to the above measured result.
The piezoelectric constant scales dz=dVPiezo by the ratio of
the dimensions of the sample. A thickness of X¼1:00
60:05 mm, and a distance from the top of the sample to the
interferometer laser location of Y¼6:7560:25 mm results
in a scaling factor of X=Y¼0:14860:009 and a
jd14j¼0:6660:04 pm =V. Note that the scaling factor’s rela-
tive uncertainty of 1:20 was the dominant uncertainty in
determining our value for d14.
Conﬁrming our methodology, our result for d14for quartz
coincides with Cady’s recommended value22of 0.67 pm/V
and is within 1.5 standard deviations of the value from theIEEE Standard of Piezoectricity16of 0.727 pm/V established
by Bechmann.17
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The quadrature interferometric technique, using two lock-
in ampliﬁers to measure sinusoidally modulated displace-ments, resulted in piezoelectric constants agreeing withpublished values for our quartz sample within 1.5 standarddeviations. The technique works for small displacementswith correction factors given for dzjj<k=8. Though we did
not measure the sign of the piezoelectric constant, it could bedetermined by recording the phase relationship between thelock-in ampliﬁers and the piezo driver. The dominant uncer-tainty in our results was related to the geometrical measure-ments of the samples, speciﬁcally, the determination of thedistance, Y,from the interferometer’s beam location on the
sample mirror to the top of the sample.
For the quartz sample, we obtained a standard deviation in
our displacement measurements of 4.1 pm, which corre-sponds to 1 part in 150 000 of the laser’s wavelength, or aphase change in the interferometer of 17 arc sec. Assumingthis standard deviation to be the smallest discernable signal(from a single measurement), it would correspond to a sig-nal-to-noise ratio of 1:300, with our main noise source beingthermal drift. With averaging and ﬁtting, we were able toobtain a standard error for d
14in the few femtometer regime.
