Introductory textbooks in solid state physics present solvable models for illustrating the occurrence
of allowed bands and forbidden gaps in the energy spectrum of Bloch electrons. However, thequantum mechanical description of electrons in non-periodic solids, such as amorphous materials,
is beyond the scope of introductory courses because of its intrinsic complexity. The tight-binding
approximation can account for such a scenario by letting the atomic levels vary at random from
lattice site to site. We theoretically tackle the study of the average properties of the energy
spectrum by introducing a transfer matrix method that allows us to obtain closed expressions forthe so-called coherent potential. The coherent potential is energy-dependent and constant in space.
It replaces the actual atomic random potential, thus generating a periodic effective medium with
the same average properties as the non-periodic solid. We demonstrate that the average density ofstates can be calculated within this framework without relying on heavy mathematical machinery.
Thus, our approach is suitable for introductory courses in solid state physics and materials science.

I. INTRODUCTION
The band theory of solids introduced by Felix Bloch paved
the way to understand electron motion in crystals and theoccurrence of allowed bands and forbidden gaps in the energy
spectrum.1Shortly after Bloch’s theory appeared, Ralph
Kronig and William Penney considered a one-dimensionalmodel of a periodic potential to describe the electron dynam-
ics in an idealized crystal.2In its simplest form, the
Kronig–Penney model corresponds to the Schr €odinger equa-
tion for an electron moving in a periodic array of d-function
potentials. The resulting band structure is obtained exactly
without requiring extensive computations, so it is often usedin introductory textbooks to expose students to the main ideas
behind the band theory of crystalline solids.3–13
However, disordered solids and amorphous materials are
beyond the scope of introductory courses, because their con-
stituent atoms are not arranged in a periodic manner, so
Bloch’s theory is not applicable. In his celebrated paper“Absence of diffusion in certain random lattices,” Anderson
tackled the problem of an electron in a three-dimensional
random lattice.14Anderson established that the spatial ﬂuctu-
ations imposed on the wave function by the random potential
lead to its localization when disorder exceeds a critical mag-
nitude (see Ref. 15for a comprehensive review). This phe-
nomenon was named Anderson localization and led to his
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for fundamental theoretical
investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and dis-ordered systems. Although a general overview of Anderson
localization can be introduced to undergraduate students
with the aid of simple reasoning and without sophisticatedmathematical tools (see, e.g., Ref. 16and references therein),
the topic of electron states in noncrystalline solids is usually
omitted from solid state physics courses because of its obvi-ous complexity.
Anderson localization may occur when disorder enters via
a random spatial distribution of elastic scattering sites.
15The
tight-binding approximation can account for such a scenarioby assuming that the atomic levels vary randomly from
site to site of the atomic lattice (see Ref. 16for a brief intro-
duction to the tight-binding approximation in the context ofAnderson localization). Material systems where this model
applies include metal alloys, such as CuNi and AgPd, and
molecular systems. The scattering approach is the usual start-
ing point for studying the average properties of the energy
spectrum. In general, though, the conﬁgurationally averaged
spectral properties cannot be calculated exactly and various
approximations with different degrees of sophistication are
employed. Among them, the coherent potential approxima-
tion (CPA) stands out because it interpolates properly
between weak and strong scattering limits.17While several
advanced textbooks in solid state physics provide thorough
discussion of the CPA,11,18,19introductory textbooks
addressing this approach are scarce20because advanced
knowledge of a scattering theory is needed.17
In this paper, we bridge the gap between introductory and
advanced textbooks by considering a one-dimensional (1D)model of a random binary alloy within the tight-binding
approach. Disorder in 1D systems has its own peculiarities
not shared by 3D systems. For instance, in 1D any amount of
disorder results in the spatial localization of electrons,
although the spatial extent of the wave function can be larger
than the system size for weak disorder. This behavior is
rather independent of the model of disorder (compositional
or positional) and the distribution function of the random
variables of the model (binary, uniform, Gaussian). So, in
spite of the high impact of disorder, 1D systems are easier to
study than their 3D counterparts.
In the CPA, the average electron properties of the disor-
dered (non-periodic) solid are tackled by replacing the actual
atomic random potential by one that is energy-dependent
and the same at all lattice sites, usually referred to as the
coherent potential in the literature.
17The resulting effective
medium is periodic with the same average properties as the
non-periodic solid. In our approach, the coherent potential is
obtained in a self-consistent way by means of the well-
known transfer matrix method (TMM).21,22We demonstrate
that the average density of states can be calculated without
relying on advanced mathematical tools. Remarkably, thecoherent potential obtained in this way turns out to be the
same as the standard CPA result obtained by means of more

complicated mathematical tools (Green’s functions
method).17Therefore, our approach could be of interest to
solid state physics instructors and students as it provides
them with all necessary tools to understand advanced text-
books17–19and articles23–25dealing with the electronic struc-
ture of disordered materials.
II. ELECTRON STATES IN A 1D SOLID
Our starting point is the Schr €odinger equation for a tightly
bound electron in a 1D solid, assuming that only a single
atomic orbital is relevant for the problem at hand.5The
amplitude wnof the electron wave function at the nth atom
of the lattice satisﬁes the equation of motion (see, e.g., Ref.16for further details)
ðE/C0e
nÞwn/C0Jwnþ1/C0Jwn/C01¼0: (1)
Here, Eis the electron energy, enis the energy of the atomic
orbital of the nth atom, and Jis the hopping (or tunneling)
energy, which will be taken positive without loss of general-ity. The last two terms of Eq. (1)are related to the overlap of
the wave functions of adjacent atoms.
A. 1D periodic monoatomic solid
Equation (1)is exactly solvable when the atomic levels
are independent of n(e
n/C17/C22e), because the lattice is periodic
and Bloch’s theorem holds. The amplitude of the wave func-tion is, therefore, expressed as w
n¼AexpðikanÞ, where kis
the wave number, Ais a normalization constant, and ais the
lattice parameter. Inserting the Bloch wave ansatz into theequation of motion (1), we obtain the dispersion relation,
E
0ðkÞ¼/C22eþ2Jcoska; (2)
where the subscript 0 refers to the periodic lattice. Here, k
lies within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, /C0p=a<k/C20p=a.
Ignoring for simplicity the double degeneracy of electronstates due to spin, the corresponding density of states perunit length (DOS) is q
0ðE;/C22eÞ¼ð 1=LÞP
kdðE/C0E0ðkÞÞ,
where L¼Nais the length of the 1D solid with Natoms.
Converting the summation into an integration over the ﬁrstBrillouin zone, the DOS inside the band is
q

2pðp=a
/C0p=adðE/C0E0ðkÞÞdk

/C0p=adðE/C0E0ðkÞÞdk; (3a)
where we used E0ðkÞ¼E0ð/C0kÞ. After performing a change
of variables, the DOS is

and vanishes outside the band. The DOS is of paramount
importance in solid state physics since it is directly related to
some important phenomena such as electrical conductivity inscanning tunneling microscopy, potential screening byelectrons in metals, and optical absorption in semiconduc-
tors. Finally, recalling the dispersion relation (2), we obtain
the DOS in the 1D periodic solid

within the energy band. Notice that the DOS is singular at
the two band-edges ( E¼/C22e62J) due to the 1D nature of the
periodic lattice.
B. 1D periodic binary solid
We now consider a slightly more complicated situation
when there are two different atoms per unit cell, with energy
levels eAandeB. Since the periodicity of the lattice is pre-
served and Bloch’s theorem still holds, Eq. (1)is exactly
solvable. The energy dispersion of the 1D periodic binary
solid is found to be

and, recalling Eq. (3), the associated DOS is
q0ðE;eA;eBÞ¼ðDEAþDEBÞ=paﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ð4J2/C0DEADEBÞDEADEBp ; (6)
where DEA¼E/C0eA;DEB¼E/C0eB, and aremains the lat-
tice parameter. The DOS vanishes outside the bands, namely,
when the denominator becomes imaginary.
Figure 1displays the DOS as a function of energy,
expressed in units of J, according to Eq. (6)when eA¼0:6J
andeB¼0. We observe the occurrence of a gap separating
two allowed energy bands and the DOS divergence at the fourband edges. The gap appears for any nonzero value of the dif-
ference e
A/C0eB, i.e., when the solid is truly diatomic. The
magnitude of the gap increases with increasing jeA/C0eBj.
C. 1D disordered binary alloy
In a disordered lattice, on-site energies enare different at
different atomic positions. In addition, we will focus on
binary disorder and assume that encan take on two values,
eAandeB, at random with probability cand 1 /C0c, respec-
tively. Hence, the probability distribution of this model of
the 1D binary alloy is
PðenÞ¼cdðen/C0eAÞþð 1/C0cÞdðen/C0eBÞ: (7a)
The conﬁguration average over the probability distribution
of any arbitrary function fðenÞof the random variables enis
simply given as
hfðenÞiav¼ð
fðenÞPðenÞden
¼cfðeAÞþð 1/C0cÞfðeBÞ: (7b)
It should be mentioned that other probability distributions,
such as Gaussian and uniform, can be handled in a similar
way but we focus on binary disorder for the sake of concrete-
ness. Figure 2(a) shows a schematic view of the 1D binary
813 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 Mart /C19ınez, Baba, and Dom /C19ınguez-Adame 813 04 October 2023 22:58:08
alloy, where the sequence of atomic levels with energy eAor
eBis random.
For a given conﬁguration of disorder, the equation of
motion (1)can be solved by numerical diagonalization of a
tridiagonal matrix, provided that the number of atoms Nin
the 1D binary alloy is not too large. Once the eigenenergiesE
/C23are known, the DOS is obtained as follows:
qðEÞ¼/C281
LX
/C23dðE/C0E/C23Þ/C29
av; (8)
where /C23in the sum runs over all eigenenergies. Here, as it is
a disordered chain, there is a non-zero probability to ﬁnd aregion with a sufﬁciently long string of atoms of the sametype. This means that the alloy DOS will extend over thesame range as the energy bands of a periodic array of Aatoms and a periodic array of B atoms.
26This kind of brute-
force attack was completely undoable in the early days of
the electron theory of solids. It was then suggested that theelectronic structure of a disordered binary alloy might betackled by placing on each site of the atomic lattice an effec-tive, or coherent, potential R[see Fig. 2(b)]. With thisassumption, the translational symmetry is restored since the
effective medium would be periodic, and the DOS would be
given in Eq. (4)asq
0ðE;RÞ. Therefore, the problem reduces
to ﬁnding Rsuch that q0ðE;RÞ¼qðEÞ, where the latter is
given in Eq. (8).
D. Virtual crystal approximation
For a ﬁrst approximation of R, assume that the potential is
given by the following average:
RVCA/C17heniav¼ceAþð1/C0cÞeB: (9)
This is known as the virtual crystal approximation (VCA)
(see, e.g., Refs. 27and28). The VCA is a reasonably good
description only if eA’eB, the weak disorder regime,
because the perturbed wave function is extended so theelectron sees the average perturbation. More elaborate self-
consistent approximations have a much wider range of valid-
ity, as we will show below.
E. Coherent potential approximation
Among other well-established approaches, the CPA is an
excellent and accurate alternative to purely numerical calcu-
lations of the DOS.
29,30The essential physical idea behind
the CPA is to ﬁnd the (yet unknown) coherent potential that
deﬁnes the effective periodic medium, shown in Fig. 2(b),
with the aid of some reasonable assumptions. This approxi-mation is generally regarded as a single-site theory since
electron scattering from clusters of impurities is neglected.
Therefore, the CPA starts by removing one (and only one)atomic level Rof the effective medium and in its place put-
ting an actual atomic level e
AoreB[see Fig. 2(c)]. The
coherent potential Ris determined by demanding that after
the replacement by eAoreB, there is no further scattering on
average. In other words, the CPA takes into account all scat-
tering events with the same impurity and neglects scattering
events with two or more impurities. The rigorous formula-tion of this condition requires advanced knowledge of a scat-
tering theory beyond the introductory courses in solid state
physics, as already discussed in the introduction. After com-plicated but otherwise straightforward calculations, the cen-
tral equation of the CPA is found to be

where the conﬁguration average is performed with the aid of
Eq.(7b). This is an implicit equation for the coherent poten-
tialR¼RðEÞthat will be discussed in more detail later. In
general, the coherent potential is complex and, according to
the scattering theory, the real part represents an overall
energy shift while the imaginary part is identiﬁed with thelevel broadening [see Eq. (14)].
We now present a simple methodology to arrive at the
CPA equation, which preserves its underlying ideas with no
need of the advanced scattering theory of quantum particles.Our approach relies on the well-known and easy-to-use
transfer matrix method for 1D lattice problems.
21,22We start
by rewriting Eq. (1)in the matrix formFig. 1. Density of states (DOS) of a 1D periodic binary solid with on-site
energies eA¼0:6JandeB¼0 as a function of energy.

medium is represented in (b). (c) The coherent potential Ris determined from
the condition that no further scattering happens on average when a single site

the effective medium, in the sense that one of their twonearest-neighbors does not have an energy level Rbut rather
e
AoreB. Hence, sites m– 1 and mþ1 need to be regarded as
part of the scattering region as well. After performing the
matrix multiplication, the elements of the transfer matrix are
found to be

The scattering region is connected to two semi-inﬁnite lat-
tices with on-site energy R. An electron incident from the

when 0 <k/C20p=a. In conclusion, by virtue of Eq. (14),w e
ﬁnd the same CPA equation (10) for the coherent potential
using only the elementary scattering theory.
III. RESULTS
In order to simplify the expressions, we set the origin of
energy at the energy level of B atoms, eB¼0. Performing
the conﬁgurational average in Eq. (10) or Eq. (16) with the
probability distribution (7a), and rearranging terms, the CPA
equation can be cast in the following form:
R¼ceA
1þiðeA/C0RÞ.ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
4J2/C0ðE/C0RÞ2q : (17)
The CPA equation (17) is an implicit equation for Rwhich
must be solved numerically for each energy of interest.28In
general, the coherent potential Rwill be complex and,
according to Eq. (14), there exists the possibility of obtaining
complex energies E(k) for real values of k. In cases like this,
ImðEeffðkÞÞ<0 gives the width associated with the state
having energy Re ðEeffðkÞÞ.19Level broadening in disordered
solids can also be understood from the perturbation theory:If the disordered potential is regarded as a perturbation, thenit will mix Bloch states with different crystal wave numberk. The variance of the perturbed levels turns out to be non-
zero and can be identiﬁed with a broadening of the levels(see Ref. 16for further details).
The solution of Eq. (17) is particularly simple in the limit-
ing cases of strong and weak disorder. We start by consider-ing these two limiting situations and compare the predictedDOS with the results obtained by direct diagonalization ofthe tridiagonal matrix Hamiltonian with rigid boundary con-ditions ( w
0¼wNþ1¼0).
A. Strong disorder
Disorder is regarded as strong when jeAjis large compared
to the bandwidth 4 J. In this limit, we can make the approxi-
mationﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
4J2/C0ðE/C0RÞ2q
/C25iðR/C0EÞin Eq. (17), resulting
in a real-valued coherent potential R. Inserting the obtained
coherent potential in Eq. (14) leads to the following disper-
sion relation:

cðkÞ/C17Jcoskaþð1=2/C0cÞeA; (18)
where the superscript sindicates the strong disorder limit.
Therefore, the energy spectrum splits into two bands in thislimiting case. Once the dispersion relation is obtained, theDOS is calculated from Eq. (3)when E
0ðkÞis replaced by
Es
6ðkÞ. The solid line in Fig. 3shows the obtained DOS for
c¼0.5 and eA¼6J. The singularities of the DOS at the
edges of the two bands are clearly observed in spite of the
815 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 Mart /C19ınez, Baba, and Dom /C19ınguez-Adame 815 04 October 2023 22:58:08
randomness of the system, a fact that it is deeply related to
the absence of an imaginary part in the coherent potential
(recall that the imaginary part gives the width of the energy
level).
The shaded histogram in Fig. 3displays the exact DOS
obtained after numerical diagonalization of the tridiagonal
Hamiltonian for a 1D lattice with N¼10 000 sites (see
Appendix B ). The exact DOS is an average over 500 conﬁg-
urations with the same values of candeA. Comparing the
two plots, the approximate dispersion relation (18) is able to
predict the splitting of the band, but the bandwidth is under-
estimated, leading to an overestimation of the bandgap. This
inaccuracy is attributed to the approximations made to
arrive at (18). To support this claim, the dashed line in Fig.
3shows the CPA result after solving Eq. (17) exactly.
Solution to this equation will be discussed later in this sec-
tion. Clearly, the CPA result provides excellent values for
the bandwidths and bandgap even in the strong disorder
regime. However, it fails to take into account the sharp
peaks observed in the numerical DOS that persist upon
increasing the number of realizations of disorder. This fail-
ure is usually attributed to the single-site nature of the CPA
[see Fig. 2(c)]. In other words, the CPA neglects the statisti-
cal ﬂuctuations of the local environment of atoms in the
alloy. Extensions of the CPA to deal with clusters of atoms
have been developed, but they are beyond the scope of this
work.28
B. Weak disorder
The weak disorder regime is established when jeAjis
smaller than the bandwidth 4 J. In this situation, Ris
expected not to differ much from RVCA¼ceA. Replacing R
byceAin the right hand side of Eq. (17) leads to the follow-
ing approximate dispersion relation:EeffðkÞ¼2Jcoska

which is easily solved to obtain EeffðkÞ. It turns out to be
complex, signaling the occurrence of a ﬁnite level width.Therefore, the d-function in Eq. (3)needs to be replaced by a

Figure 4shows the DOS calculated using Eq. (19) for
c¼0.5 and eA¼0:6J. This is compared to the exact DOS
calculated by direct diagonalization of the tridiagonalHamiltonian, shown by the ﬁlled curve. Although theapproximate DOS is ﬁnite at the two band edges, it slightly
overestimates the exact result. More accurate results are
achieved by solving the exact CPA equation (17), shown by
the dashed line in Fig. 4. Notice the excellent agreement
between this and the numerical result in the weak disorderlimit. It is worth mentioning that the singularities of the DOSat the band edges of the periodic solid observed in Fig. 1are
smeared out by disorder. This is a general trend in randomalloys since substitutional disorder leads to the erosion of thevan Hove singularities (see Ref. 24for a discussion of this
effect in disordered molecular crystals).Fig. 3. (Color online) DOS in the strong disorder regime for c¼0.5 and

C. Solution of CPA equation
Equation (17) can be squared to render the following cubic
equation for the coherent potential R:
A0R3þA1R2þA2RþA3¼0;

This cubic equation can be solved for RðEÞas a function of
the two parameters candeA. Once it is solved, the DOS is
obtained as explained above.
Figure 5shows the DOS for different magnitudes of disor-
dereAwhen c¼0.5. The single band observed in the weak
disorder limit splits into two bands upon increasing the mag-nitude of disorder. The onset of band splitting occurs ate
A/C244 J. Gap opening by disorder has a strong impact on the
optical properties of materials systems, as discussed byOnodera and Toyozawa in 1968, who showed that the behav-ior of the absorption coefﬁcient is rather complex.
31In addi-
tion, if the Fermi level moves through the gap that develops
with increasing disorder, then a metal/insulator transitionoccurs.
Finally, Fig. 6shows the DOS for different concentrations
cwhen the magnitudes of disorder are e
A¼2J. We observe
that the single band limit is restored upon increasing cabove
0.2 for this magnitude of disorder. This is consistent withwhat is described in Secs. II BandII C, since as cincreases
so does the probability of ﬁnding a sufﬁciently long chain ofatoms with the same energy e

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Electron motion in disordered solids has been an active
ﬁeld of research for the past 60 years. However, the absenceof translational symmetry makes theoretical analysis highlycomplex, and there are few introductory-level treatments of
important disorder-related phenomena such as localization
and metal-insulator transitions. In particular, the CPA is usu-
ally derived using advanced mathematical tools such asGreen’s functions and is typically beyond the scope of
undergraduate coursework in solid state physics. Our
approach to the CPA, based on the transfer matrix method,arrives at the same results without the heavy mathematicaloverload. This makes the treatment of disordered phenomena
accessible to undergraduate or early graduate students.

APPENDIX B: NUMERIC SIMULATION CODE
The code has been written using Python as the program-
ming language. Therefore, we need to import the packagesto be used
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import eigvalsh_tridiagonal
Then, we will deﬁne the diagonal of the Hamiltonian,
which will be ﬁlled with randomly on-site energies followingthe probability distribution (7a). The system will have N
sites, the on-site energies will be eps_a andeps_b , and the
hopping will be J.
def r_hamiltonian(N, c, eps_a, eps_b, J):
diag ¼[]
for i in range(N):
rn¼np.random.rand()
if rn >c:
diag.append(eps_b)
else:
diag.append(eps_a)
Once we have the diagonal elements deﬁned, we will pop-
ulate the off-diagonal matrix elements and then calculate theeigenvalues. They will be sorted in order to make the conﬁg-urational average in the next step.
RE¼np.sort(eigvalsh_tridiagonal(diag,
J*np.ones(N-1)))
return RE
Now, we will take the average of N_prom realizations of
disorder.
def Prom(N_prom, N, c, eps_a, eps_b, J):
M¼[r_hamiltonian(N, c, eps_a, eps_b, J)
for i , in ,!range(N_prom)]
eig¼np.moveaxis(M,0,-1)
E¼np.mean(eig,1)
return E
Finally, to ﬁnd the numerical DOS from the disorder
chain, we need to make an histogram with the averagedenergies.
