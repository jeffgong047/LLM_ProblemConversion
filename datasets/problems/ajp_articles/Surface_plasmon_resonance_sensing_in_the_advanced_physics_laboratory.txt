We present a set of experiments and computations suitable for introducing upper-level
undergraduate physics and engineering students to the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of nanoplasmonics forperiods ranging from a week-long advanced laboratory session to a summer research project. The
end product is a tunable optoﬂuidic device capable of detecting changes in a ﬂuid medium as low
as 0.002 refractive index units. The sensing element—a thin gold ﬁlm on a glass prism coupled to amicroﬂuidic cell—owes its sensitivity to the bound nature of the surface plasmon–polariton waves
that are resonantly excited by evanescently coupled light at the gold–ﬂuid interface. Pedagogically,
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing immerses students in the rich physics of nanoscale opticsand evanescent waves in constructing and operating a precision apparatus and in developing
theoretical, analytical, and numerical models to aid both in the physical understanding and
engineering optimization of the SPR sensor.

I. INTRODUCTION
The simple geometry of the ﬂat interface between a trans-
parent dielectric and a noble-metal conductor plays host toremarkable optical phenomena arising from the coupling ofelectromagnetic waves with collective plasma oscillations ofthe conduction electrons. Key manifestations of this couplingare surface plasmon–polaritons (SPPs)—hybrid electric
polari zation–pho tonevanescent waves that propagate along
the metal–dielectric interface with amplitude that decays
exponentially with distance in both the perpendicular direction(due to being surface-bound modes) and longitudinal direction(due to resistive losses in the metal). The resonant nature ofSPP waves and the fact that most of their electromagnetic ﬁeldis concentrated in the dielectric medium
1make them exqui-
sitely sensitive to minuscule changes in the medium’s refrac-tive index; moreover, under the speciﬁc conditions forexciting the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the electric-
ﬁeld intensity at the metal–dielectric interface is enhanced by
at least an order of magnitude relative to the incident wave.

These features enable dynamic detection of changes in refrac-tive index on the order of 10
/C06or better,6,7as well as label-
free analysis of the kinetics of biomolecular interactions, suchas protein binding to surfaces and immunoassays, and have
led to the development of a variety of SPR sensing techniques,
devices, and applications.8–14
This paper builds upon previous reports on incorporating
SPR-based projects into undergraduate physics and chemis-try curricula.15–24What sets our contribution apart is the
tutorial-style pedagogical integration of physical insights,
theoretical models, student-programmed analytical computa-
tions, and numerical simulations with student-performedprecision angular measurements of SPR reﬂectance curvesand real-time sensing of large and small refractive-indexchanges—measured using readily customizable opto-
microﬂuidic setups constructed by students with affordable
off-the-shelf components. We provide a wealth of references,curated with upper-level physics/engineering undergraduatesand their instructors in mind, to books, literature reviews,
and recent research articles on the fundamentals and specif-
ics of SPPs and SPR sensing as well as to all the necessarymaterials properties, software, and hardware components(with current prices listed in the references) to facilitate rapid
reproduction of the experiments and simulations described
herein. We also list in the conclusion a dozen or so carefullysourced recommendations for extensions to this project.

In our experience, the SPR sensing experiments foster stu-
dent ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially in experimen-
tal design, while the ability to verify measured results
computationally encourages students to strive for high accu-racy and precision.
An SPR sensor based on SPP evanescent waves responds
to changes in the dielectric environment with a shift of the
angle-dependent monochromatic reﬂectance curve. The sen-
sor can be optimized for differentiating between various ﬂu-ids with the help of computer simulations. Surface plasmons
generated in a prism-based optical setup offer a variety of
hands-on opportunities for undergraduate students to deepentheir understanding of electromagnetism in the context of
applied optics, to practice their laboratory and computational
skills, and to engineer a functional device with a high sensi-tivity-to-simplicity ﬁgure of merit. We showcase here theopportunities for student engagement and learning afforded
by our versatile, relatively inexpensive optoﬂuidic setup.
The tasks involved in constructing and optimizing the SPRsensor vary in difﬁculty, so instructors can select the appro-
priate level of challenge for their students, be it for a week-
long advanced laboratory session, a semester-long capstoneproject, or a summer research experience. Students get an
introduction to the ﬁeld of nanoplasmonics and a chance to
appreciate the power of combining precision experimentalwork with realistic computational modeling. For some stu-dents, the end product itself—a seemingly simple yet surpris-
ingly sensitive device—represents a memorable milestone in
their undergraduate physics careers. This article describes:the SPP dispersion relation (Fig. 1); the resonant conditions
for exciting SPP waves with a prism (Fig. 2); the experimen-
tal SPR setup constructed and modiﬁed by students (Fig. 3);
the computations performed by students with the Fresnel
equations formalism to verify and optimize the operation of
the SPR sensor (Figs. 4and5); the computed and experimen-
tal sensorgrams obtained by students from real-time detec-tion of relatively large (Fig. 6), small (Figs. 7and8), andtiny (Fig. 9) refractive-index changes in a ﬂuid medium; the
computed sensitivity of the SPR sensor (Fig. 10); and a
numerical simulation of the SPR reﬂectance curve with the
ﬁnite-element method (Fig. 11).
II. METHODS
A. SPP dispersion relation
Being hybrid electromagnetic modes of light coupled to
coherent electron-density oscillations on a metal surface,
SPP waves travel more slowly than light waves on the
dielectric side of the interface (i.e., in the sensing environ-
ment) and have a larger-than-light wavevector k

nience) the kxandxaxes in Fig. 1(b), we see that the SPP
dispersion curve (solid line) for a generic metal–dielectric
interface always lies below the corresponding light line
x¼ðckx=sinhiÞ=ﬃﬃﬃﬃedp¼ckx=ðndsinhiÞin the dielectric
medium of refractive index nd¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃedp, where cis the vacuum
speed of light. Thus, in Fig. 1(b), the x¼ckx=sinhilight
line in vacuum ( nd¼nvac¼1) does not intersect the SPP
curve either at the arbitrary incident angle hi¼60/C14(dotted
line) from the surface normal or at any other angle, includingh
i¼90/C14(dashed-dotted-dotted line) when the incoming
light grazes the metal–vacuum interface.
SPP waves cannot be excited externally by freely propa-
gating light on the dielectric side of the same interface
because the incoming photons carry insufﬁcient momentum
to match the in-plane momentum of the plasmon–polaritons.
Physically, the increased SPP momentum is due to the strong
coupling between light and surface charges—in essence the
light ﬁeld has to “drag” the electrons along the surface.4This
fundamental characteristic of SPP modes manifests itself inthe shape of the dispersion curve [Fig. 1(b)]. The simplest

and a semi-inﬁnite metallic medium ( z>0), as described in the main text. The arrowheads on the kdandkmwavevectors point in both directions since no
assumptions are made regarding the nature of these waves (e.g., incident or scattered wave in the dielectric region). In fact, surface modes like SPPs (squiggly
curves), being bound to the interface, correspond to solutions with no incident wave present, only a scattered wave in the dielectric and a transmitte d wave in
the metal (Ref. 25). As noted below and discussed in the main text, anypropagating wave impinging on the dielectric side of the interface, regardless of angle
of incidence hi, would not have a sufﬁciently large x-component of the wavevector to excite SPP modes at the same interface, i.e., kx<kSPP

sections exist between the SPP dispersion curve for a given interface and its corresponding light lines—whereas, for instance, light of angular freq uency
x¼0:6xpcoming from the glass medium can couple resonantly to a metal– vacuum SPP mode at hi¼60/C14(circle).

dispersion relation between the longitudinal wavevector
component and the angular frequency of the SPP wave,
kSPP
xðxÞ, can be derived for a single metal–dielectric inter-
face as follows.26
(i) Consider, as depicted in Fig. 1(a), an electromagnetic
wave with wavevector kd¼ðkd;x^x;0^y;kd;z^zÞin a
semi-inﬁnite dielectric medium (subscript “d”) occu-
pying the z<0 half-space and its counterpart wave
with wavevector km¼ðkm;x^x;0^y;km;z^zÞin the adja-
cent semi-inﬁnite metallic medium (subscript “m”)
occupying the z>0 region; the interface lies in thexy-plane at z¼0. The dielectric has a real-valued rel-
ative permittivity ed>0, whereas a good plasmonic
metal like gold has a complex-valued relative permit-tivity with a large negative real part Re ½~e
m/C138/C280 and a
small positive imaginary part Im ½~em/C138/C28/C0 Re½~em/C138.
Both media are assumed to be nonmagnetic (i.e., rela-tive magnetic permeability of unity). To simplify thederivation of the SPP dispersion relation withoutaltering its functional form, we ignore for now theohmic losses in the metal, responsible for dissipationof optical energy into thermal energy, by setting
Im½~e
m/C138¼0 and Re½~em/C138/C17em<0.
(ii) From the boundary condition of continuity imposed
on the tangential electromagnetic ﬁelds, the longitudi-nal component of the wavevector must also be con-served at the interface: k
d;x¼km;x/C17kx. In addition,
the longitudinal and perpendicular components of thewavevector are linked by a general dispersion rela-tion, which for the metal is k
2
xþk2
m;z¼emðx=cÞ2.
Since k2
x>0 and em<0, it follows that km;zmust be
an imaginary number, whereby the wave inside themetal is evanescent and decays exponentially awayfrom the interface. The next steps involve using thecontinuity boundary conditions for the electric andmagnetic ﬁelds to obtain an equation relatingk
d;z;km;z;ed, and em, which in turn will lead to kxðxÞ,
that is, kSPP
xðxÞ.

index isosceles ( A¼55.6/C14) or equilateral ( A¼60.0/C14) prism at external angle
hext, measured outside the prism counterclockwise from the normal to its
base, such that the beam is incident on the base at a counterclockwise inter-
nal angle hintgreater than the critical angle for total internal reﬂection (TIR)
from the prism (“input”) medium into the dielectric ﬂuid (“output”) medium.

vert (Ref. 35) to internal angle via Snell’s law and the prism geometry:
hint¼A/C0sin/C01½ðnair=n1Þsina/C138. Owing to the Au layer ( d3¼50 nm), TIR
becomes ATR, most strongly attenuated at the resonant angle for excitation
of surface plasmon–polaritons (SPPs) at the Au–ﬂuid interface given in Eq.
(7). The Au ﬁlm (3) is commercially deposited on an SF10 glass slide (100)
coated with an ultrathin Ti ﬁlm (2) for adhesion ( d2¼2 nm). The resulting
sensor chip (Ref. 36), comprising layers (100), (2) and (3), is seen between
the SF10 glass prism (Ref. 37) (1) and microﬂuidic assembly in (b) top-view
and (c) base-view photos (scale: any prism edge ¼30 mm), and (d)
exploded-view schematic (thicknesses not to scale). The sensor chip is inter-
faced on its glass side to the prism with index-matching liquid (10) and
secured with rubber bands; on the Au side, the chip is glued to the self-adhesive microﬂuidic cell (Ref. 38); dielectric ﬂuid (4) is injected with a
syringe into the 0.4-mm-deep channel via aquarium tubing (Ref. 39).
Fig. 3. (a) Schematic and (b) photograph of one of our Kretschmann-
Raether (see Fig. 2) experimental setups for SPR sensing. The linear polar-
izer can be rotated to vary the incident intensity of the already polarized
HeNe laser; the half-wave plate is rotated to ensure a p/C0polarized incident
beam, whereby the electric ﬁeld oscillates in the plane of incidence. The
50:50 non-polarizing beamsplitter sends half of the incident light to themicroﬂuidic prism assembly and half to a ﬁxed reference detector to correct
for instabilities in the laser output. The incident angle is adjusted by means
of a manual-stage goniometer equipped with a vernier scale (1 arc min preci-
sion). Light reﬂected off the sensing assembly is collected with a movable
detector. Neutral-density (ND) ﬁlters reduce the effects of stray light on the
reference and SPR signals. Signals are digitized in the DAQ unit and sent to
the computer for further processing and storage.

was conducted on the setup in Fig. 3; experiment 1 with water was conducted on a modiﬁed setup using a stabilized laser (details in the main text). (b)
Experiment 2 with water was conducted on a further -modiﬁed setup using the detector-arm assembly pictured in the inset (details in the main text).
Simulations using the Fresnel equations for p/C0polarization were performed with the WinSpall software (Ref. 49), which takes into account reﬂections from
the entrance and exit faces of the prism. The measured curves were scaled vertically by different multiplicative factors to equate the experimental a nd simu-
lated reﬂectance values near the critical angle for TIR. The measured curve for air in (a) is also shifted horizontally by /C00:76/C14to correct for an initial misalign-
ment of the experimental setup (Ref. 61). Also shown in (b) is a curve (solid line) simulated andﬁtted with WinSpall that matches well most of the experiment
2 data points after adjusting the properties of the Ti and Au layers as ﬁtting parameters (see upper legend) (Ref. 63). Note: The scaled measured data for water
from Experiments 1 and 2 largely overlap when plotted on the same axes; the Fresnel-calculated curve for water in (a) is replotted as the dotted line in ( b).

(iii) We consider transverse magnetic (TM) modes with
the magnetic-ﬁeld vector H¼Hy^yparallel to the
interface and oscillating in the y-direction, since it
turns out that no transverse electric (TE) bound modes
exist at metal–dielectric interfaces. Physically, TEmodes do not correspond to viable solutions for SPP
waves at a metal–dielectric interface, because the
purely transverse electric ﬁeld has no componentsalong the direction of SPP propagation and therefore
cannot excite the crucial longitudinal electron oscilla-
tions (i.e., the surface-charge density wave).

Equation (4), which retains its functional form for complex-
valued relative permittivities, can be used to quantify theearlier assertion that the SPP wavevector (momentum) at ametal–dielectric interface always exceeds the in-plane wave-vector (momentum) of light that is incident on the sameinterface from the dielectric half-space. For instance, for agold–air interface at 632 :8n m [ ~e
m¼~eAu¼/C011:740
þ1:2611i (Ref. 27) and ed¼n2
air¼1:000553 (Ref. 28)] and
grazing incidence ( hi¼90/C14, hence kx¼ðx=cÞsinhi!kx;max
¼x=c¼k), the complex-valued form of Eq. (4)gives
Re½~kSPP
x/C138/C251:05k. As mentioned above, the increase in wave-
vector and momentum is a consequence of the binding of theSPP hybrid wave to the interface due to the interaction of the
electromagnetic wave with the surface charges.29While the
above treatment follows Ref. 26, most plasmonics-related
books4,5,26,30,31and tutorial articles22,32include some version
of the derivation of Eq. (4). There is a trove of key concepts
from classical electrodynamics that students can (re)discover
on the road to the SPP dispersion relation such as the wave
equation, eigenmodes, evanescent waves, wavevectors,
boundary conditions, polarization ( p/TM works, s/TE does
not), and the complex-valued, frequency-dependent optical
constants of a metal in the framework of the Drude–Lorentz
model.
B. Idealized model of plasmonic metals
Here, we present the simplest version of the Drude–
Lorentz model, the so-called lossless Drude model for the
dispersion of the relative permittivity of an idealized metal,
in order to use the resulting functional form of emðxÞin Eq.
(4). The complete derivation is also found in most

C. Prism-coupling of incident light to SPP Waves
In this work, we use the method of attenuated total reﬂec-
tion (ATR), depicted in Fig. 2(a) in the so-called
Kretschmann-Raether conﬁguration,40,41to bridge the
momentum (and kx) gap between SPP modes of energy

excite SPPs at the Au–ﬂuid interface because it enters the Au
ﬁlm from the higher-index glass medium at an angle of inci-dence h
intthat is greater than the critical angle for total inter-
nal reﬂection (TIR). Energy and momentum are transferred
to the SPP waves by the evanescent wave that tunnels from
the prism-Au interface towards the Au–ﬂuid interface,through the Au layer, which is why the ﬁlm thickness is akey parameter, as discussed later on. On an x–vs– k

[Fig. 1(b)], the light line in the SF10 glass prism has a shal-
lower slope than the light line in the dielectric ﬂuid whenﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃeprismp>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃefluidp, which allows for the prism light line to

In practice, an adhesion-promoting titanium (Ti) layer44
of nominal thickness d2¼2 nm and index of refraction45
~n2/C17~nTiðk0Þ¼2:7039þ3:7651i is sandwiched between the
Au layer and the substrate. The effects of adhesion layerparameters on sensor performance were analyzed computa-tionally in Ref. 46. The substrate is a 1-mm-thick slide made
of the same type of high-index glass (SF10) as the prism; it
is not depicted in Fig. 2(a)but is visible in Figs. 2(b)–2(d) .

shown schematically in Fig. 2(d), is applied with a pipette
between the SF10 glass slide (100) and the SF10 glass prism
(1) to provide a continuous medium for the laser beam; that
is, the index-matching liquid (10) removes the air gap
between the substrate and the prism, effectively extendingthe prism material up to the Ti ﬁlm (2). The self-adhesivemicroﬂuidic cell

simple veriﬁcation of the resonant angles offers an excellent
opportunity to emphasize to students the importance of pair-
ing algorithmic computation (e.g., the Fresnel equations,
accurate but “clueless” about the nature of surface plasmons)
with physical reasoning (e.g., the SPP dispersion relation or
the cause of the reﬂectance minimum).
D. Physical interpretations
The two most frequently stated (equivalent) explanations
for the reﬂectance dip (e.g., in Fig. 4) involve, on the one
hand, the total conversion of the missing light into surface
plasmons that carry the energy away along the interface and

thus prevent it from reaching the detector, and on the other,
destructive interference between the TIR light and the SPP
light emitted back into the prism as radiation damping.4In
other words, SPPs excited via wavevector-matching with a
prism are inherently leaky waves : They lose energy not only
through Joule heating due to absorption inside the metal,
characterized by a non-radiative, intrinsic damping term cin
in the propagation wavevector along the interface, but also
due to leakage radiation into the prism from excited wave-
vectors within the prism light cone (Fig. 1(b)), adding a radi-
ative damping term cradto the propagation loss.
From a microscopic point of view, intrinsic damping
occurs when the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the SPPs exciteselectron–hole pairs at the Fermi level of the metal, and sub-
sequent de-excitation generates phonons (collective lattice
vibrations) that heat up the ﬁlm.41Macroscopically, it stems
from Im½~em/C138, the imaginary part of the metal permittivity
[neglected in the lossless Drude model of Eq. (5)], so that
the complex-valued form of Eq. (4)yields cin¼Im½~kSPP
x/C138.
When the metallic medium has a small ﬁnite thickness, as in
the Kretschmann-Raether conﬁguration [Fig. 2(a), ignoring the
adhesion layer for now], the evanescent SPP waves tunnel back
through the metal ﬁlm and transform into propagating plane
waves in the prism medium. This back-radiation, emitted by the
SPPs propagating at the metal–dielectric interface, is in anti-
phase with the incoming light and interferes with it destructively
at the metal–prism interface. In the case of Rmin/C17Rðhres
intÞ¼0
(see below), the destructive interference is complete and the
back-radiation is also converted into thermal energy of the metal
ﬁlm.41We note that Eq. (4)(or its complex-valued form) is
strictly valid only for a semi-inﬁnite metal: As the metal thick-
ness decreases, the metal–prism interface approaches the met-
al–dielectric interface, where the SPPs propagate, and modiﬁes
the resonance wavevector approximately as ~kSPP
x!~kSPP

xcontains the dependence on the
metal ﬁlm thickness and causes a shift in the angular pos ition of
the resonance, while the imaginary part constitutes the radiative
damping contribution, that is, crad¼Im½D~kSPP
x/C138.41
Together, cinandcradmake up the imaginary part of the
SPP wavevector, Im ½~kSPP
xþD~kSPP
x/C138. For a plasmonic metal
ﬁlm of the optimum thickness, illuminated with evanescent
incident light at the resonant angle in the Kretschmann-
Raether conﬁguration, the destructive interference can be
essentially perfect and result in a vanishing reﬂected beam
intensity, and thus undetectable leakage radiation, when both
the “critical coupling” condition cin¼cradand the resonance
condition kx¼kSPP
xare fulﬁlled.5,30With transmittance and
reﬂectance both zero (and absent any scattering from per-
fectly smooth surfaces), conservation of energy requires that
the whole of the incident power be absorbed in the plasmonic
ﬁlm, increasing its temperature. A numerical simulation of
this absorption is depicted in Fig. 11[inset (iv)].
As noted by Raether,41the form of the SPR curve around
the reﬂectance minimum depends on the sum of the damp-
ing terms, cinþcrad. Since cincan be regarded as constant
to ﬁrst order, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is
dominated by crad, in turn determined by the metal ﬁlm
thickness.5
A further, somewhat counterintuitive insight can be
obtained from electric-ﬁeld penetration depths (or decay
lengths) into the dielectric ( dd) and metal ( dm), which, being
related as eddd¼jemjdm, can be used to approximate thefraction of the SPP electric-ﬁeld energy in the dielectric
medium asðjemj=edÞ2. Therefore, SPP waves experience
larger propagation loss for lossless dielectrics with higherrefractive indices (and permittivities e
d), because a larger
fraction of the SPP energy resides within the lossy metal.5A
consequence of this relative increase in non-radiative damp-ing is clearly apparent in Fig. 4(a):e

SPR curve for water wider than the curve for air.
E. Fresnel equations
The simulated SPR curves in Fig. 4were generated with
the feature-rich (but black-box) freeware programWinSpall.49In addition, students used WinSpall to check
their own MATLAB50implementations of the Fresnel equations
as part of a “virtual SPR sensor” advanced lab project duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. The Fresnel equations formalism,as applied to a stack of two thin ﬁlms (Ti and Au) sand-wiched between two semi-inﬁnite dielectric media (glass andﬂuid), is summarized below.

One strategy51,52for calculating the total reﬂectance of the
Prism(1)–Ti(2)þAu(3)–Fluid(4) stack in Fig. 2(a)is, ﬁrst, to
derive a recursive formula for the reﬂection coefﬁcient of ageneric slab of thickness d
jsurrounded by an input medium
and an output medium, either of which can be an adjacentslab (here: Au or Ti) or a semi-inﬁnite environment (here:prism or ﬂuid). We will write the slab reﬂection coefﬁcientsasr
input ;output—with a comma—to distinguish them from the
single-interface coefﬁcients in Eqs. (8)and(9). Second, we
apply the slab formula to the last thin-ﬁlm layer encounteredby the incident laser beam, Au(3), to obtain r
Au/C0slab/C17r2;4.
Third, we move backwards to the preceding thin-ﬁlm layer,Ti(2), and apply the slab formula to obtain r
Ti/C0slab/C17r1;4,
which will contain the single-interface reﬂection coefﬁcient
r12between the Prism(1) input medium and Ti(2) (see Eq.
(8)) and the effective reﬂection coefﬁcient r2;4from the other
interface. In essence, r1;4will combine coherently the effects
ofr12;r23;r34, and the phase changes accumulated by the
reﬂected light during multiple (mathematically, inﬁnite) tripsinside the slabs. Fourth, the absolute square of r
1;4will yield
the desired total reﬂectance R.
Let us consider a slab, designated as medium (3), surrounded
by input medium (2) and output medium (4). A p/C0polarized
plane wave with electric-ﬁeld amplitude E2impinges on

coefﬁcient t32; thus, the amplitude of this one-round-trip
partial wave is: Eð1Þ

wave that undergoes one r34reﬂection, one r32reﬂection, and
another r34reﬂection before reentering the input medium—
i.e., makes two round-trip passes across the slab—reemerges

Equation (12)models53,54the ratio Rof the reﬂected power
to the incident power in the input medium, which for our
SPR sensor is SF10 glass (see also Ref. 55). The dependence
of the total reﬂectance on the angle of incidence inside the
glass, i.e., RðhintÞ, stems from kxby proxy of the rjl’s and
bj’s.
When additional thin layers are added (e.g., see Ref. 56),
combining multiple single-interface Fresnel coefﬁcients into
slab reﬂection coefﬁcients becomes a rather burdensome and
error-prone endeavor. An elegantly powerful alternative57to
the Fresnel formalism that readily scales up to an arbitrarynumber of layers is the transfer-matrix method (TMM),
which starts with the fundamental boundary conditions for
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at each interface to produce a
2/C22 characteristic matrix for each layer. The total reﬂection
and transmission coefﬁcients for the entire multilayer stackare then obtained from the product of the characteristic
matrices, multiplied on the order of encounter by the incident
light. The TMM approach is described in detail in Ref. 51,
among others.III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Simulated and measured SPR reflectance
The microﬂuidic cell glued to an Au þTi–SF10 sensor
chip pressed against an SF10 prism with rubber bands, allvisible in Figs. 2(b) and2(c), are part of our SPR sensing
setup depicted schematically in Fig. 3(a)and photographed
in Fig. 3(b). This particular version of the setup, which was
built by a student as a capstone project, uses a typical HeNelaser (632.8 nm, 5 mW, linearly polarized), a linear polarizer,a half-wave plate, a non-polarizing beamsplitter, a manualgoniometer (from a vintage spectroscope
58), and reference
and SPR reﬂectance detectors59connected to a data acquisi-
tion (DAQ) interface.60Since the laser itself produces a line-
arly polarized beam and its cylindrical case can easily berotated by hand, the polarizer and the waveplate are there forconvenience rather than necessity. Moreover, the referencedetector can also be omitted if a stabilized laser is available,or if the expected reﬂectance variations caused by changingthe ﬂuids substantially exceed the output ﬂuctuations of the
874 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022 Abdelhamid et al. 874 04 October 2023 23:21:26
non-stabilized laser during the measurement interval (e.g., see
Fig.6). With air as the ﬂuid in the sensing channel, a student
measured the SPR curve (circles) in Fig. 4(a)with the setup in
Fig.3. The reﬂectance signal detected at each manually adjusted
internal incident angle was automatically normalized by the ref-erence signal. For a meaningful comparison with the theoreticalreﬂectance curve (solid line) predicted by the Fresnel equations(see below), the measured curve was also scaled vertically by amultiplicative factor of 0. 0288 to make the experimental and
simulated reﬂectance values in Fig. 4(a)equal at h
int¼35:6/C14.
This angle corresponds to the measured data point that is closestto the nominal critical angle hair
c¼sin/C01½nair=nSF10/C138¼35:5/C14
for TIR at an SF10–air interface. The good qualitative agree-
ment between experiment and theory in Fig. 4(a)gave the stu-
dent, who had obtained both curves, a conﬁdence-boostingsense of “ownership” of the project, while also providing a
critical check of the experimental setup—and subsequent
correction.61
Figures 4(a)(water) and 4(b)show the work of a summer
research student at a different institution. This student, whowas guided in part by the notes of a former classmate fromthe advanced lab course they had completed in the previoussemester, constructed two modiﬁed versions of the setup inFig.3and measured SPR curves for distilled water (H
2O) in
the microﬂuidic channel. Both modiﬁed conﬁgurations dis-pensed with the polarizer, beamsplitter, ﬁlters, referencedetector and bulky goniometer, and instead incorporated anintensity-stabilized HeNe laser,
62a precision rotation
stage,34a pinhole (to reduce the laser beam diameter to about
1 mm), and a pivoted detector arm with multiple degrees offreedom. The ﬁrst modiﬁed conﬁguration, which was used tomeasure the reﬂectance data for experiment 1 (triangles) in Fig.4(a), included an additional 1-mm pinhole in front of the detec-
tor port to limit its acceptance angle and thus better control howthe reﬂected beam illuminated the photodiode. The trade-offwas that it took signiﬁcantly longer to collect the data comparedwith the original setup because the position of the pinhole-covered detector had to be adjusted with sub-millimeter preci-sion for each data point. After multiplying by a factor of 0. 0529
to match the simulated reﬂectance at h

c¼sin/C01½nH2O=nSF10/C138¼50:6/C14for TIR at an
SF10–H 2O interface, experiment 1 data agree well with the
SPR curve (solid line) calculated using the Fresnel equations.
For the second modiﬁcation of the SPR setup, the student
replaced the detector pinhole with an adjustable iris, coupledthe detector into the top port of a cube containing an integrat-ing sphere,
64and attached the assembly to the pivoted detec-
tor arm [see the inset in Fig. 4(b)]. This conﬁguration, albeit
more expensive, greatly simpliﬁed the measurement proce-
dure since the orientation of the detector was largely irrele-
vant, provided that the reﬂected laser beam entered the irisopening (about 5 mm) placed directly in front of one of the0.5-in. ports of the cube. The experiment 2 data in Fig. 4(b),
also for a H
2O-ﬁlled sensing channel, represent an average
of three sets of measurements taken with this modiﬁed con-ﬁguration and scaled vertically by a factor of 0.0231 duringthe ﬁtting process (see below). The good agreement with theexperiment 1 data and the Fresnel calculation (prior to ﬁt-ting) for water in Fig. 4(a)testiﬁes to the robust versatility of
the optical setup.
Going beyond Fresnel calculations with the nominal mate-
rials and geometry parameters, we can get an even bettermatch via nonlinear ﬁtting
63[Fig. 4(b)]. Although we leave
further exploration of this aspect of SPR for future work, wepoint out that the ﬁtting parameters listed in the upper legend
of Fig. 4(b) imply that the width of the reﬂectance curve
depends sensitively on the thickness and optical constants ofboth the “active” plasmonic layer (gold) and the adhesionlayer (titanium). Actually, tweaking the parameters awayfrom their best-ﬁt values reveals that the complex-valuedpermittivity ~e
fit
Tiof the Ti layer has a relatively weak effect on
the reﬂectance curve for changes in either part of a couple ofunits, whereas increasing the Ti layer thickness by just2.5 nm, for instance, widens the FWHM of the curve by0:5
/C14and lowers its maximum reﬂectance by about 15%.
Categorizing the speciﬁc type(s) of damping, such as chemi-
cal interface damping,65imposed on the SPPs by the adhe-
sion layer requires methodical study, as its permittivity andthickness jointly affect the effective permittivity of the adhe-sion–plasmonic bilayer system.
46,65,66Qualitatively, it
appears that the presence of the Ti layer in our SPR sensorincreases both the intrinsic ( c
in) and radiative ( crad) SPP
damping commensurately for a wide range of values of theTi permittivity and thickness, evidenced by R
minremaining
close to zero, hence cin/C25crad, even as the FWHM increases.
The effects of adjusting the best-ﬁt values of the Au per-
mittivity ~efit
Auare stronger because the SPP waves propagate
along the Au–dielectric interface and the Au layer constitutesa larger volume fraction of the adhesion–plasmonic effectivemedium. For instance, making Re ½~e

units downshifts the reﬂectance minimum by 1/C14, whereas
increasing the dissipative part Im ½~efit

widens the FWHM by 3 :5/C14, lowers the maximum reﬂectance
by about 15%, and raises Rminby 10%. On the other hand,
decreasing Im½~efit
Au/C138by 0.6—cf. the ﬁtting parameters on the
last line of the upper legend in Fig. 4(b)—narrows the
FWHM by 1/C14, raises the maximum reﬂectance by about 5%,
and lowers Rminby a factor of 5. Decreasing the Au layer
thickness by 3.37 nm widens the FWHM by 1/C14and mini-
mizes Rminfrom 10/C02to 10/C07, yet making the Au layer even
thinner raises Rminwhile continuing to widen the FWHM. In
general, as the plasmonic metal thickness decreases, theback-radiation ﬁeld increases and reduces the reﬂectancebecause it is in antiphase with the ﬁeld of the incoming light.Conversely, as the metal thickness increases towards thesemi-inﬁnite limit, the back-radiation disappears ( c
rad!0)
and the reﬂectance approaches a value close to unity.41
Based on the ﬁtting parameters listed in Fig. 4(b)and the
preceding discussion, we hypothesize that the moderateFWHM mismatch between the (vertically scaled) experiment1/2 data points in Fig. 4(a/b) and the Fresnel-calculated (but
not ﬁtted) SPR curve in Fig. 4(a/b) is most likely caused by
(i) the actual thicknesses of the Ti and Au layers differingfrom the nominal values speciﬁed by the vendor
36by
aboutþ1 nm and –5 nm, respectively; and (ii) the actual
imaginary part of the permittivity of our Au ﬁlm being 50%larger than the literature value,27possibly due to the ﬁlm’s
morphology.67
B. Calculated and measured SPR sensorgrams
Although the students’ MATLAB implementation of Eq.
(12)forRðhintÞneeded only about 50 lines of code to gener-
ate the SPR curves in Figs. 5(a)and7, adding another few
dozen lines to create the simulated SPR sensorgrams in Figs.5(b)and8(b)noticeably increased the students’ engagement
with the project when they perceived how their code repro-duced, virtually but realistically, the sensing behavior of the

real-world SPR device pictured in Fig. 3(b), which had been
constructed by their peers before COVID-19.
Figure 5(a)shows the simulated SPR reﬂectance curves of
four clear, transparent ﬂuids, conveniently chosen to effectrelatively large real-time changes of refractive index n
4as
one ﬂuid displaces another in the microﬂuidic channel of theexperimental SPR sensor: air ( n
air¼1:00028), deionized
water (DI H 2O:nH2O¼1:3317), isopropyl alcohol68(IPA:
nIPA¼1:3758), and ethanol69(EtOH: nEtOH¼1:3604). The
vertical arrows indicate values of the incident angle, hI
int
¼57.5/C14andhII
int¼60.8/C14, that correspond to the ﬁxed internal
angles used in the sensing experiments. At this point, if notearlier, it ought to become apparent to students that simula-tions are an indispensable tool for optimizing the SPR sensorfor a particular combination of dielectric ﬂuids. In Fig. 5(a),
the SPR curves for EtOH and air nearly intersect at h
I
int,
whereas at hII
intall four curves have distinct reﬂectance val-
ues. Although the refractive indices of EtOH and air differby 30%, the calculated sensorgram in the lower panel of Fig.5(b), extracted from the data at h
I
intin Fig. 5(a), predicts only
an 8% difference in detection signal between the two ﬂuids.And should hI
intbe inadvertently set to 57.2/C14instead of 57.5/C14,
the air and EtOH signals would differ by a mere 0.2%.Clearly, hI

¼nEtOHandn4ðtÞ¼nairusing this particular SPR sensor. No
such difﬁculties in signal differentiation arise at hII
int¼60:8/C14,
as demonstrated with the calculated sensorgram in the upperpanel of Fig. 5(b). The experimental sensorgrams in Fig. 6
conﬁrm the above predictions calculated with the Fresnelequations. The reﬂected intensity signal measured at h
II
int
¼60.8/C14as a function of time [Fig. 6(a)] allowed for the
unambiguous detection of air vs. DI H 2O vs. IPA/EtOH.
Even for IPA vs. EtOH, the lowest measured percentage dif-ference in the signals was 16%. (The intensity spike around720 s was caused by an air bubble transiting the sensingchannel.) At h
I
int¼57.5/C14, however, the measured signals for
air and EtOH were virtually indistinguishable [Fig. 6(b)], as
predicted in the calculated sensorgram in Fig. 5(b) (lower
panel). We note that the reﬂected intensities in Fig. 6were
not normalized to the reference signal split off from the inci-dent light [Fig. 3(a)], which is evident in the recurrent dips
[e.g., near 1850 s in Fig. 6(b)] due to ﬂuctuations in the out-
put of the non-stabilized laser. In fact, it was the observedlaser instability that prompted the student to improve theSPR setup by adding the reference arm; in the experimentsdescribed below, the reﬂected intensity was normalized bythe concurrently collected reference signal.
Having established that the SPR sensor operated as
expected for relatively large real-time changes in refractive
index, Dn
4ðtÞ, the student performed further Fresnel simula-
tions and sensing experiments, the latter by consecutivelyinjecting saline solutions with different concentrations intothe microﬂuidic channel. The refractive index increases asmore sodium chloride (NaCl) is dissolved, but it does so bysomewhat smaller increments Dn
4ðtÞthan was the case with
the sequence of organic solvents discussed above. Saline sol-utions with the following speciﬁc concentrations of NaCl inDI H
2O, in weight percent (wt. %), were prepared because
nominal refractive index values were readily available fromRef. 70(albeit for 589 nm instead of 633 nm): n
0:5wt%¼1:3339 ;n6wt%¼1:3435 ;n12wt%¼1:3541 ;n18wt%¼1:3648),
and n24wt%¼1:3757. The simulated SPR curves in Fig. 7
predict that such relatively small changes in n4due to theadded NaCl should produce easily observable horizontal
shifts in the SPR curves. Even shifts of less than 1/C14in the
resonant angle can result in large reﬂectance changesbecause of the steepness of the curves, to which the SPR sen-sor owes its sensitivity. Furthermore, Fig. 7demonstrates
that the internal incident angles h
I
intandhII
intfrom the above
experiments (marked by vertical arrows) are suitable for thedifferential sensing of the four saline solutions, DI H
2O, and
air, with the sole exception of n18wt%vs.nairathI
int, where
those two SPR curves happen to intersect.
Calculated and measured sensorgrams for DI H 2O and the
four NaCl solutions are presented in Figs. 8(a) and8(b),
respectively. The lower panels of both parts of the ﬁgure cor-respond to hI
int¼57.5/C14, while the upper panels correspond to
hII
int¼60.8/C14. In Fig. 8(a), the concentration of NaCl in the
ﬂuid, and hence the refractive index, increases 0–24 wt. %with (arbitrary) time, and the resulting sensorgrams resembleupward (for h
I
int) and downward (for hII
int) “stairs” of varying
“step” heights. If we neglect the short-duration spikes due totransient air bubbles, the experimental sensorgram for hI
intin
Fig.8(b) “runs upstairs” as predicted, before dropping back
down to the initial intensity level when DI H 2O is reinjected
into the microﬂuidic channel. Considering the individualstep heights, the largest sequential step-up (again ignoringthe air spikes) corresponds to sensing a change in NaCl con-centration from 6 to 12 wt. %, in agreement with the calcu-lated sensorgram, but the measured intensity change from 18to 24 wt. % NaCl is unexpectedly better resolved than its cal-
culated counterpart. A look back at Fig. 7, and especially the
intersections of the left vertical arrow with the 18 wt. % and24 wt. % curves, suggests that the actual experimental valueofh
I
intmight have been somewhat larger than 57.5/C14to yield a
larger measured difference in intensity between these twoSPR curves. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that hI
intwould have
exceeded 57.7/C14, since this angle is where the DI H 2O and
6 wt. % NaCl curves intersect in the simulations (Fig. 7). If
we now consider the experimental sensorgram for hII
int(ignor-
ing the air spikes), plotted in the upper panel of Fig. 8(b),i t
“runs downstairs” from DI H 2O to 24 wt. %, again in accor-
dance with the calculations. The largest sequential non-air-bubble step-down occurs between 12 wt. % and 18 wt. % inthe calculated sensorgram but not in the measurements.Here, too, one might reasonably attribute this discrepancy toa minor systematic error in determining the experimental
angle of incidence, though such arguments would be ques-
tionable because the experimental and simulated SPR curveshave different widths [e.g., Fig. 4(a)]. One could do better by
ﬁrst ﬁtting the simulated SPR curves to their measured coun-terparts for air and/or water [e.g., Fig. 4(b)], which might
yield a larger value of e

indicative of stronger dissipation of the SPP waves in thegold layer.63
C. Bulk sensitivity of the SPR sensor
The experimental sensorgrams in Fig. 9showcase the sen-
sitivity of our SPR setup to changes in the bulk refractiveindex of the dielectric ﬂuid. In Fig. 9(a),D IH
2O and
0.5 wt. % NaCl solution are clearly distinguished in thereﬂected signal at the angle of incidence hI
int, despite causing
a periodic change in the ﬂuid’s refractive index of onlyDn
4ðtÞ¼0:0022. The results in Fig. 9(b) are noisier but
indicative of even higher sensitivity: the capability to detectan even (presumably) smaller Dn
4ðtÞin the reﬂected signal

alternating between DI H 2O and bottled mineral water from
a grocery store. Students interested in precision measure-ments might even attempt to detect reﬂectance changesbetween different brands of bottled water before segueinginto advanced signal-enhancing techniques such as lock-inampliﬁcation.
Following Ref. 6, we can express the overall sensitivity S
of an SPR sensor as the product of the sensitivity (i.e., ratioof small changes) of the output signal—here, the reﬂectanceR—to the effective index n
SPP
effof the SPP mode and the sen-
sitivity of the effective index to the refractive index ndof the
dielectric medium: S¼ðdR=dnSPP
effÞðdnSPP
eff=dndÞ. The ﬁrst
factor depends on the method of SPP excitation (prism orgrating) and modulation (intensity, angular or wavelength),while the second factor does not, since it represents theintrinsic properties of the SPP mode. In principle, the second
factor can be calculated as a (numerical) partial derivative of
the SPP dispersion relation for the appropriate interface in amultilayer stack, which in turn can be approximated by thesingle-interface dispersion relation in Eq. (4). For in-depth
treatments of sensitivity and resolution, we refer the inter-ested reader to Refs. 6and71; briefer overviews of the per-
formance metrics for SPR sensors are given in Refs. 1and8.
Instead, here we take a more utilitarian approach to semi-quantifying the sensitivity of our SPR sensor.
In Fig. 10, we use the Fresnel formalism to simulate the SPR
reﬂectance Ras a function of the internal angle of incidence h
int
inside the prism for hypothetical dielectric ﬂuids that have
refractive indices ndwithin60.001 units of the nominal refrac-
tive index nH2O¼1:3317 of pure water. The goal is to get an
idea of how much (or little) Rchanges for small changes Dn
in the refractive index of the dielectric ﬂuid. Although the21 SPR curves plotted in Fig. 10(a) are separated by just a frac-
tion of a degree (see inset), their steepness in the regions ofh
int¼55:0–57 :0/C14andhint¼57:5–59 :5/C14enables changes in
reﬂectance ofjDRj/C250:01–0.04 for Dn¼60:001 (Fig. 10(b) ).
Figure 10(c) displays a color map of DRin theDn–hintspace to
aid in visualizing the angular regions that would result in thelargest absolute reﬂectance changes as the bulk refractive indexof the medium in the microﬂuidic channel deviates fromn
d¼nH2O¼1:3317.
Since the resonant angle hres
intdecreases/increases as ndis
decreased/increased [Eq. (7)], the SPR curves for the hypo-
thetical ﬂuids shift to the left for Dn<0 and to the right for
Dn>0 with respect to the curve for pure water ( Dn¼0).
These angular shifts push the Dn<0 curves lower
(DR<0)/higher ( DR>0) than the pure water curve for
angles below/above hint/C2557:15/C14; and vice versa for the
Dn>0 curves. If we assume, as a rough estimate based on
the trace in Fig. 9(b), thatjDRjmin/C250:01 is the minimum
reﬂectance change that can be reliably measured in our SPRsensor as is, then Figs. 10(b) and10(c) imply that a minimum
change ofjDnj
min¼0:0003 refractive index units (RIU)
should be detectable if the sensor is set to an angle within therange h
int¼56:0/C14–56:5/C14.
When the reﬂected signal is not normalized and has an
arbitrary baseline (e.g., Fig. 6), a more useful measure for
the minimum detectable deviation in intensity is the relative
reﬂectance change at each angle of incidence and index ofrefraction, expressed as a percentage of the reﬂectance forpure water: DRðh
int;ndÞ=R0ðhint;nH2OÞ. Figure 10(d) ) plots
this ratio for the 20 hypothetical ﬂuids and pure water, andFig.10(e) maps it at ﬁner Dnincrements. Again taking the
trace in Fig. 9(b) as a rough benchmark, we estimatejDR=R
0jmin/C253%, which in Figs. 10(d) and10(e) corre-
sponds tojDnjmin¼0:0001 RIU for the range of
hint¼56:8–57 :0/C14. However, the corresponding reﬂectance
change within this angular range in Fig. 10(b) is about 0.001,
which is an order of magnitude smaller than the earlier esti-mate forjDRj
minfrom the signal and noise in Fig. 9(b).
Moreover, the sensitivity of an SPR sensor operated in inten-sity modulation mode is inversely dependent on the photonﬂux,
72so it is reasonable to expect that the much lower
reﬂectance nearer 57 :0/C14than 56 :0/C14[Fig. 10(a) ] would further
degrade the ability to detect tiny changes in reﬂected inten-sity. Therefore, the earlier estimate of jDnj
min¼0:0003 RIU
is more representative of the actual limit of detection for ourSPR sensor without extra signal enhancement.
The above analysis hints at the educational value of com-
bining precision measurements with realistic simulations ofthe physical system. It offers students opportunities to designand implement improvements to the SPR setup (e.g., lock-indetection
23) and computational model (e.g., ﬁtting the SPR
curve, as in Fig. 4(b)), delve into the extensive litera-
ture6,8,72–75on noise, sensitivity, resolution, limit of detec-
tion, and ﬁgure of merit of SPR sensors, and uncoverdiscrepancies between experiment and model. On the lastpoint, for instance, a comparison of the experimental data inFig.9with the model curves in Fig. 10(b) suggests that, in
order to have measured positive changes in intensityDI¼I/C0I
H2O, the actual angle of incidence must have been
hint<57:2/C14<hI
int¼57:5/C14(nominal setting) if the refractive
index of the DI H 2O was, as it should have been, smaller
than the refractive index of either the 0.5 wt. % NaCl solu-tion or the mineral water. In hindsight, the 0 :017
/C14(1 arc min)
angular precision of the manual-stage goniometer58(or
0:083/C14for the manual rotation stage34used in subsequent
iterations of the SPR setup) would have permitted scanningthe angular range h
int¼56:0/C14–58:0/C14with sufﬁcient resolu-
tion to observe a reversal of the sign of DRand pinpoint the
optimal angle for detecting the signal in Fig. 9(b).
D. Numerical computation of the SPR curve
Before closing, we outline another component of the SPR
project that we are yet to formally introduce to students.Figure 11shows the result of a numerical computation of an
SPR reﬂectance curve with the ﬁnite-element method (FEM)using the Wave Optics module of the commercial softwareCOMSOL Multiphysics
VR.76Open-source FEM and ﬁnite-
difference time-domain software packages (e.g., FreeFEMand MEEP) are also available at the time of writing. In FEM,the algorithm solves Maxwell’s equations numerically bysubdividing the computational domain into small geometricpatches with locally deﬁned polynomial approximations ofthe solution called ﬁnite elements [e.g., inset (i) in Fig. 11],
and stitching the elements together under conditions of conti-
nuity of the tangential components of the electric and mag-netic ﬁelds.
77While the technical details of the FEM
formalism fall outside the scope of the typical advanced labprogram, we believe that hands-on practice with such a pow-erful computational tool in the context of SPR sensing wouldbe beneﬁcial to undergraduate physics and engineering stu-dents. Together with the spherical (or spheroidal) metalnanoparticle in a homogeneous medium, which can besolved analytically with the Mie theory formalism, the SPRsensor geometry belongs to the only other class of plasmonicsystems that allows exact solutions: the ﬂat multilayer stack.
877 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022 Abdelhamid et al. 877 04 October 2023 23:21:26
Thus, in the non-trivial process of trying to obtain the close
match of the numerical, FEM-computed SPR curve to the
analytical, Fresnel-simulated SPR curve in Fig. 11, we envi-
sion that students would learn about computer-aided design,meshing, convergence, Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions,perfectly matched layers (to prevent back-reﬂections from
domain boundaries), scattering (S-) parameters, and evanes-
cent waves—in addition to the workﬂow involved in settingup, solving, and post-processing a real-world application of
electromagnetic theory. The last step naturally lends itself to
appealing visualizations of otherwise abstract quantities,such as the highly enhanced longitudinal electric ﬁeld pre-sent in the SPR sensor at the resonant angle [inset (ii)] and
its dramatic weakening just 0.7
/C14past the bottom of the dip
[inset (iii)]. For example, visualizing the power dissipationdensity on-resonance [inset (iv)] and off-resonance [inset
(v)] would reﬁne the students’ intuitive understanding of
where inside the metal layer most of the optical losses takeplace—i.e., within a skin depth of the interface where theSPP waves propagate. And if a student dares to explore
beyond the few analytically solvable systems, they could,
with a reasonable amount of effort, modify the FEM modelin Fig. 11to simulate, for example, a periodic array of nano-
droplets on the gold surface instead of a continuous ﬂuid
medium, or the effects on the SPR curve of surface rough-ness
78or nanopatterning of the gold ﬁlm, or the enhancement
in SPR sensing performance due to the presence of metallic
nanoparticles.79So even though a 2D FEM model would
have worked as well, it is with a view to s(t)imulating suchnon-analytical scenarios that we implemented the full-wave
3D FEM model shown in Fig. 11.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have described in detail a simple, sensitive optoﬂuidic
setup based on the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon
that we have found to be effective in engaging undergraduate
physics and engineering students in advanced lab andresearch-style settings. The combination of relativelystraightforward and inexpensive construction, hand-on preci-
sion measurements, robust sensing functionality, and
challenging-to-attain
80but illuminating congruence of theo-
retical, analytical, numerical, and experimental results make
SPR sensing an advanced undergraduate project worth con-
sidering. Some potentially fruitful extensions include: imple-menting the TMM51,57orS-matrix81alternatives to the
Fresnel formalism; systematic ﬁtting of the simulated SPR
curves to determine the thickness and refractive index of thin
ﬁlms;82–86using refractometry,87,88ellipsometry,85,86and

the signal-to-noise ratio and detect even smaller RIU frac-tions; automating measurements of the SPR reﬂectance

and detector arm or a syringe pump90); fabricating and char-

42Strictly speaking, a frequency-dispersive quantity, e.g., ~nAuðxÞ, is mathe-
matically equivalent to the same quantity expressed as a function of thevacuum wavelength k
vac¼2pc=x. Although kvac¼632:991 nm for the
red HeNe laser, we chose to use the HeNe wavelength in air,
k0¼632:8 nm, and express the dispersive quantities in terms of the latter
since it is much more common in the literature and, e.g.,

55Presuming the input medium to be semi-inﬁnite, Eq. (12)does not include
reﬂection or refraction of the laser beam as it ﬁrst enters the prism [Fig.2(a)]. However, WinSpall does account for the prism’s geometry and
reﬂections from the entrance and exit faces, which explains why the
WinSpall-calculated SPR curves for H
2O in Fig. 4have a lower overall
reﬂectance than the curves calculated with Eq. (12)in Figs. 5(a)and7.

61The experimental curve in Fig. 4(a)is plotted with a horizontal offset of
/C00:76/C14relative to the original data. The mismatch between the measured
and calculated SPR dips alerted the student to a slight misalignment in the
optical setup, which they identiﬁed and corrected before proceeding withthe sensing experiments.

63We used the WinSpall software (Ref. 49) to perform a proof-of-principle
ﬁt of the Fresnel equations to one of our measured SPR curves; see Fig.
4(b). The six ﬁtting parameters were the thicknesses and complex indices
of refraction of the Ti and Au layers, with the following best-ﬁt values:
dfit
Ti¼2:82 nm, dfit
Au¼45:14 nm, ~nfit
Ti¼2:9611þ1:9568i, and
~nfitAu¼0:2735þ3:4394i. However, determining the optical parameters of
thin metal ﬁlms from SPR measurements is a non-trivial, inverse-type
problem (Refs. 82,84, and 85) that was beyond the scope of the current
work, so we did not pursue curve-ﬁtting any further. The nominal Ti and
Au parameters were used in all Fresnel calculations other than the ﬁt in
Fig.4(b).
