A ball that rolls on carpet while also spinning around a vertical axis will experience a drift force that
acts perpendicular to its velocity, opposite to the tangential velocity component of the front point of theball. Here, we present a model of this motion based on three assumptions: the ball rolls without slipping
around the point of contact directly below its center of mass; the ball experiences rolling resistance
due to a forward-shifted normal force; and the ball experiences a forward-shifted kinetic friction (drift)
force. This model produces a simple analytic solution that is consistent with experimental data.
Our measurements suggest that the kinetic friction force acts near the front of the contact patch betweenthe ball and carpet.

I. INTRODUCTION
The literature on the motion of a rolling ball that spins
about the vertical axis is limited to a handful of qualitative
descriptions.1,2A phenomenon of similar appearance is the
“hook” motion of a bowling ball, though this is explained by
the slipping motion of the ball.3,4The motion of spinning bil-
liards balls has been studied,5,6though often the emphasis is
on how a vertical spin might be imparted on a ball or on the
transition from sliding to rolling. Some work has been done
on the effect of a ball’s spin on its motion in a cylinder,7–10
though here the interesting behavior has to do with thecurved surface. Another closely analogous system is the
motion of a spinning curling stone11,12or hockey puck.13,14
In these systems, the kinetic friction force is modeled as
varying across the surface of the sliding cylinder in contact
with the ice, though obviously neither object rolls without
slipping.
With the exception of Ref. 1, these papers all describe sys-
tems that differ from the spinning ball on the carpet system
described here. Reference 1provides many interesting
details, including the observations that the ball follows a
curved path, rolls without slipping, and continues spinning
even after it has stopped rolling. Here, we propose a model
for the curved path of the ball that includes rolling resistance
as well as kinetic friction. Rolling resistance emerges due to
a forward shift of the normal force along the direction of the
ball’s center-of-mass velocity.15,16We add to this model a
kinetic friction force, which also acts on the ball at a point
ahead of the center of mass but perpendicular to the ball’s
center of mass velocity and not necessarily at the same point
as the normal force. Our experimental results suggest that
the kinetic friction force acts near the front of the contact
region between the ball and carpet, which is consistent withcomputer model predictions of rolling friction.17
In general, there is not a “single” kinetic or static friction
force acting in the region where the ball contacts the sur-
face. A particle level model would account for the small
friction force acting on each small piece of the ball in con-
tact with the surface, similar to descriptions of the motion of
curling stones and hockey pucks.11–14However, this is also
true of the normal force in the case of rolling.17At the
particle-level, a small normal force acts on each small piece
of the ball in contact with the surface. The total normal force
is the sum of these small normal forces. The sum of the
torques due to these small normal forces results in anon-zero net torque and accounts for the “forward-shift” of
the normal force.
Here, we will make the same type of simplifying assump-
tion about the kinetic friction force. In this case, the kinetic
friction force is the sum of the small kinetic friction forces
on each piece of the ball in contact with the surface. The
total torque due to kinetic friction is also the sum of all the
small torques, which we assume is equivalent to the torquefrom a single forward-shifted kinetic friction force.
II. THEORETICAL MODEL
We start by making three assumptions. First, we assume
that the ball rolls without slipping around a point located
directly below its center of mass. This means that there is only
one point on the ball that is not moving relative to the surface,
and any horizontal component of angular velocity will lead to
rolling without slipping. Second, we assume that the ballexperiences rolling resistance. The rolling resistance is caused
by the normal force, which is forward-shifted by a distance D
s
in the direction of center-of-mass velocity of the ball. Finally,
we assume that the ball experiences a kinetic friction force
that acts a distance Dahead of the center of the ball.
A diagram of the forces is shown in Fig. 1. Because the
friction forces all act either parallel or perpendicular to the
velocity of the center of mass of the ball, we adopt a coordi-
nate system ( ^v;^d;^z) with unit vectors along the velocity,
the drift direction, and the vertical axis. If the ^vdirection is
at an angle hrelative to the ^xaxis, then
^v¼cosh^xþsinh^y (1)
and
^d¼/C0sinh^xþcosh^y: (2)
These unit vectors are time-dependent in the Galilean lab
frame coordinate system ( ^x;^y;^z) because his time depen-
dent. Taking time derivatives of Eqs. (1)and(2)gives
_^v¼_h^d (3)
and
_^d¼/C0 _h^v: (4)
The velocity and angular velocity of the ball are

Note also that Eq. (14) is valid as long as jxzj>0. This
applies to the case studied here where the ball stops rolling
before it stops spinning around the vertical axis. Oncex
z¼0, the ball is no longer spinning around the vertical
axis, and there is no longer a kinetic friction force. The direc-tion of x
zdetermines the direction of kinetic friction, as
shown in Fig. 1.

ball rolls without slipping

The ﬁrst assumption assures the ball has the correct angular
velocity to roll without slipping. The second assumptionassures that the ball has a velocity component only in the ^v

III. EXPERIMENT
We spun a golf ball and a superball on a high-pile (bear-
moose pattern) carpet and a low-pile (stripe pattern) carpet.Typical rotational frequencies were roughly 15–20 Hz. All
trials were ﬁlmed from above with a smartphone camera at
120 frames per second (fps) and analyzed in Tracker.18An
example of an autotracker trail from Tracker is shown in Fig.
3. In order to test the model from Eq. (29), we performed a
curve ﬁt using the Optimization package from SciPy.19The
ﬁt model was of the form

(30)
where a,b,c, and dwere the ﬁt parameters. In order to
ensure that the argument of the log function in Eq. (30) was
greater than zero, we used a value of 1 =bfor all t>1=b. The
result is a constant yvalue of

ball is a uniform solid, meaning K¼2/5. We use the litera-

the ﬁnite shell thickness. The measured radii of the balls are

2.23 cm (golf ball) and 2.15 cm (superball). This leaves only
the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction to be determined.
The coefﬁcient of friction was measured using two techni-
ques. For the golf ball on a low-pile carpet, we taped three
golf balls together and dragged them with a force sensor.
Figure 4shows this assembly. By taking the ratio of the force
required to pull the golf ball assembly at a constant speed to
the weight of the assembly, we were able to measure a coef-
ﬁcient of lk¼0:2460:04. For the golf ball and superball
on the high-pile carpet, we held the carpet section at steep
angles (approximately 55/C14and 75/C14) to create an incline.
Then we sent the balls down the steep incline several times
and inferred a coefﬁcient of lk¼0:30260:027 for the golf
ball and lk¼0:31460:031 for the superball by measuring
the acceleration of the balls as they slipped (not rolled) along
the incline.20Another possible technique for measuring thecoefﬁcient of friction would be to impart backspin on a ball
using a billiard cue, then measure the acceleration of the ball
as it slides.
In all reported trials, we noted that the ball stopped rolling
before it stopped spinning, suggesting that kinetic frictionacted throughout the ball’s entire trajectory. Trials where the
ball obviously encountered bumps or irregularities in the car-
pet were omitted. In these trials, the ball was observed tosuddenly change trajectory.
We also made several unsuccessful attempts to observe
similar motion with soft and deﬂated balls on a hard surface.
In some cases, the drift motion due to kinetic friction wasmuch smaller than drift due to slight inclines of the surface.
In other cases, asymmetries in the deﬂated balls created top-
like motions that obscured the drift motion discussed here.Generally, we found that using hard balls on soft surfaces
produced the best results.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 5shows yvstplots and best-ﬁt curves for various
trials. Initial values of yhave been added to distinguish trials.
Each subplot shows two trajectories with x
z>0 and two
with xz<0, which accounts for the positive and negative
drifts. SciPy provides ﬁt parameter uncertainties based on
provided position uncertainties. We estimated position
uncertainties as the mean change in position over all frames.Values were typically on the order of a few millimeters, typi-
cally within 10% of the diameter of the ball. This accounts
for the expected irregularities that occur during tracking.However, the ﬁt parameter uncertainties estimated in this
manner were small compared to the change in parameter

are distinguishable. Estimates for v0were determined using the quadratic ﬁt method discussed in the text. Trajectories that trend in the positive- ydirection
have negative values of xz.

estimates due to a change in the ﬁt range. In some cases, the
ball slips (without rolling) for a short period after it is
released. At the end of the trial, the ball comes to rest.
Including 20 more or fewer frames of the beginning or end
of the data in the ﬁt range can change parameter estimates by
up to 10%, whereas SciPy’s ﬁt parameter uncertainties are
generally less than one percent. We conclude that the ﬁt-
range uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty. This uncer-
tainty also partly accounts for the time-lengths of trajectories
shown in Fig. 5, where some trials include more or fewer
data points at the beginning and end than other trials.
We measured the forward shift of the kinetic friction force
Dfor all four trials in each of the subplots of Fig. 5. The
mean and standard deviations for the golf ball on the low
pile carpet, the golf ball on the high pile carpet, and the
superball on the high-pile carpet are 7.3 61.2 mm,
9.561.9 mm, and 9.3 62.6 mm, respectively. For scale, the
diameter of a golf ball dimple is roughly 4 mm. We com-
pared these results with the size of the contact patch between
the balls and the two carpets. In all three cases, the estimated
mean Dvalues were slightly greater than the radius of the
contact patch, but within one standard deviation. This sug-
gests that kinetic friction acts near the front of the contact
patch (since it obviously cannot act outside the contact
patch).
We also compared the ﬁt results from Eq. (30) with ﬁt
results for Eq. (20). The ﬁt equation for Eq. (20) is

shows that the two ﬁt estimations for bare consistent. The
results varied for different trials and different combinations of
the ball and carpet, but the two estimates for bgenerally
remained consistent.
We note that Fig. 6(b) demonstrates that the ball does, in
fact, roll without slipping, as expected.1The estimation of
A¼/C00:072 m/s/C02means that the coefﬁcient of the rolling
resistance21is

Rð1þKÞ/C250:015: (35)
This is on the same order of magnitude as other observa-
tions1,16for rolling resistance and an order of magnitude
below the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction, which we would
observe if the ball were slipping instead of rolling.
The estimation of A¼/C00:072 m/s/C02also means Ds
¼0:46 mm. The yvstbest ﬁt for the data in Fig. 6(a) esti-
mates D¼5.10 mm, which means that Dis roughly an order
of magnitude greater than Ds, as predicted.
Estimates of DandDsvaried between trials, but in all
cases, Dwas much greater than Ds. In order to check this,
we combined estimates of B¼v0andb¼bfrom the ﬁt
results of Eqs. (30) and(33) for the data shown in Fig. 5
usingDs¼bv0ð1þKÞR=g¼bBð1þKÞR=g: (36)
The values of Dsfor the golf ball on the low pile carpet, the
golf ball on the high pile carpet, and the superball on the
high-pile carpet are 0.95 60.17 mm, 1.60 60.21 mm, and
1.660.4 mm, respectively. The ratios of Ds=Dare, there-
fore, 0.13, 0.17, and 0.17.
A summary of the measured values of lk,D,Ds, and Ds=D
is given in Table I. Finally, from Eqs. (29), we can see that
the total y-displacement of the ball should scale with v2
0. The
maximum ydisplacements in each of the subplots of Fig. 5
are loosely correlated with v0, but the relationship is not a
clean linear trend. The maximum ydisplacements depend on
D,Ds, and lk, which all may vary from trial to trial for the
same ball on the same carpet. There is even a slight speeddependence for D
sandlk,22,23though variation in lkdue to
speed is comparable to our estimated uncertainties on thesevalues. The simplest explanation for the variance in maxi-mum displacement is that the carpet pile is not perfectly uni-form. A local area where the carpet pile is denser could, for

fore, reduce Dand perhaps alter Dsandlk. Therefore, the
measurements presented here for D,Ds, and lkshould be

V. CONCLUSION
The results suggest that a ball that spins about a vertical
axis while rolling on carpet will experience a forward shiftednormal force and a kinetic friction force that acts near thefront of the contact patch between the ball and carpet. Theseresults will be of interest to physicists studying the motion ofcurling stones and hockey pucks that spin as they move onice. The key difference between these two situations is that aball can roll without slipping, whereas curling stones andhockey pucks obviously must slide. Additionally, friction onice is more complicated than friction on dry surfaces.
