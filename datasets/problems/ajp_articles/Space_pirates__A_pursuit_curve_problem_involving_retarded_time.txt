We revisit the classical pursuit curve problem solved by Pierre Bouguer in the 18th century, taking
into account that information propagates at a ﬁnite speed. The discussion of this generalizedproblem of pursuit constitutes an excellent opportunity to introduce the concept of retarded time
without the complications inherent to the study of electromagnetic radiation (where it is usually
seen for the ﬁrst time). We ﬁnd the differential equation, which describes the problem, solve it
numerically, compare the solution to Bouguer’s for different values of the parameters, and deduce
a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the pursuer to catch the pursued.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1732, French mathematician, geophysicist, and hydrog-
rapher Pierre Bouguer posed and solved a problem, which isnowadays regarded as the beginning of modern mathemati-
cal pursuit analysis.1The problem consisted of ﬁnding the
functional form of the curve described by a pirate ship in
pursuit of a merchant vessel, subject to the conditions that
both move at constant speeds and, at any given time, the
velocity vector of the pirate ship points in the direction of
the merchant vessel position at that time. This situation isillustrated in Fig. 1(Sec. II).
Bouguer’s original problem has been analyzed through a
number of different approaches as well as generalized to var-
ious other cases (see, for example, Refs. 2–8), and even a
three-dimensional version has been considered.9An inspir-
ing introduction to Bouguer’s and other pursuit problems is
given in a nice book by Paul Nahin.10
Though irrelevant in most cases of interest, there is a clear
physical inconsistency in all the above-mentioned problems:they tacitly assume that information on the position of the
merchant vessel reaches the pirate ship instantly; i.e., what-
ever signal used by the pirates to infer the merchants’ posi-
tion (such as light or sound) travels at inﬁnite speed.
Nonetheless, it is a well-known consequence of Einstein’s
theory of relativity that nothing can travel faster than the
speed of light in empty space.11
To the best of our knowledge, this issue has only been
addressed in a relatively recent paper by Hoenselaers,12in
which the author considers a relativistic correction to the
classical (pure) pursuit problem. However, in our opinion,
the relativistic aspect of the problem is overemphasized in
that paper, potentially scaring away readers who are notfamiliar with the theory. Indeed, although ultimately based
on the postulates of special relativity, the assumption of a
ﬁnite speed of propagation is all one needs in order to ana-
lyze the problem in a more physically accurate manner. In
fact, as alluded to in the previous paragraph, one could imag-
ine a situation in which visibility is too low, and the pirates
are guided only by the sounds produced by the merchants. In
that case, for speeds comparable to the speed of sound, the
corrections analyzed here would become very important,whereas relativistic effects would play no role at all.
The purpose of the present paper is, therefore, to comple-
ment the analysis done in Ref. 12, solving the problem in a
slightly different, more intuitive way. In particular, weemphasize the concept of retarded time, which is crucial to
the solution of the problem. We believe that introducing that
concept in the context of this classical mechanical problem,
without the complications inherent to the study of electro-
magnetic radiation (where it is usually seen for the ﬁrst
time), will be beneﬁcial to students. We also discuss in somedetail to what extent the problem analyzed in this paper can
be regarded as a relativistic correction to the original one.
II. REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM
In this section, we review the original problem posed by
Bouguer, following closely the solution given in Ref. 10.
Consider a merchant vessel traveling at constant speed V
malong
some given (known) trajectory. Not so far from it, a pirate ship
traveling at constant speed Vpis in pursuit of that vessel, follow-
ing a curved path such that its velocity vector (tangent to thecurve) always points directly towards the merchant vessel.
In the original problem, the merchants move along a
straight line. The chase starts at time t¼0 with the pirate
ship located at the origin. We assume that, at this time, the
merchant vessel is traveling on a path perpendicular to the
separation vector. We then align the X-axis with the separa-
tion vector, deﬁne the separation distance to be x
0, and align
theY-axis with the direction of travel of the merchant vessel,
so that its position at all times is ðx0;VmtÞ. Figure 1illustrates
this situation for some t>0, when the pirate ship is located
at an arbitrary point ( x,y). The problem consists of ﬁnding
the equation deﬁning the curved path followed by the pirate
ship in the form y¼fðxÞ.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the slope of the tangent line to
the pursuit curve at the point ( x,y) is given by
dy
dx¼Vmt/C0y
x0/C0x: (1)
Because the pirate ship’s speed is constant, we know that the
distance it has sailed along the pursuit curve from the originto the point ( x,y) is equal to V
pt. Now, from calculus, we
know that distance is precisely the arc-length

which is the solution to Bouguer’s problem. It is important
to note that, in deriving this solution, we have assumeda<1, i.e., V
m<Vp.I fa/C211, then the expression for y
diverges as xapproaches x0, implying that the pirates never
reach the merchants.
III. FINITE SPEED OF PROPAGATION
AND RETARDED TIME
In Bouguer’s problem, it is tacitly assumed that the pirates
perceive any change in the position of the merchant vesselinstantaneously. In other words, information is assumed to
propagate at inﬁnite speed. As mentioned in the introduction,
this would be in conﬂict with Einstein’s theory of relativity.In this section, we revisit the problem solved in Sec. IItaking
into account that information must propagate at a ﬁnite
speed. This will naturally lead us to the concept of retardedtime. Apart from that, we follow more or less the same steps
as in Sec. II, reobtaining the differential equation deduced in
Ref. 12in a slightly different manner.
As explained in the introduction, it is not necessary to take
the signal guiding the pirates to be an electromagnetic wave(thus traveling at the speed of light), but we will use cto rep-
resent the signal’s propagation speed with respect to the ref-erence frame described in Sec. II. If the signal is carried by
light, one could imagine that the pirates and the merchants
are now in spacecrafts moving through outer space at speedscomparable to the speed of light. With that in mind, onecould call the pursuers “space pirates,” and their spacecraft
trajectory would be a “relativistic” pursuit curve. As a matter
of fact, we will discuss to what extent it makes sense to referto those pursuit curves as “relativistic” in Sec. VI, but let us
ignore those subtleties for now.
At any given time, instead of pointing in the direction of
the merchant spacecraft position at that time, the velocity
vector of the pirate spacecraft points in the direction inwhich the pirates see the merchant spacecraft. Since it takessome time for the signal to reach the pirates after being emit-ted by the merchants (its propagation speed is ﬁnite), those
directions are, in general, not the same. This is illustrated in
Fig.2.
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the signal detected by the
pirates at time t—when their position is given by the vector
~r
pðtÞ—is not the one emitted by the merchant spacecraft at
that time, but the one emitted some time before, when the
merchants’ position was given by ~rmðtrÞ. If the signal propa-
gates at speed c, then the amount of time elapsed between
emission and detection of the signal, t/C0tr, satisﬁes the fol-
lowing equation:
cðt/C0trÞ¼j~rmðtrÞ/C0~rpðtÞj: (7)
Equation (7)can be regarded as an implicit deﬁnition of tr,
which is called “retarded time.”
We, henceforth, conﬁne the discussion to the case of a
merchant spacecraft traveling along a straight line in order to
compare it with the original problem analyzed in Sec. II.A s
in that problem, both the merchants and the pirates travel atconstant speeds, given, respectively, by V
mandVp, and we
take the merchant spacecraft to move along the line x¼x0.
Moreover, we assume that the merchant spacecraft only
becomes visible to the pirates once it crosses the X-axis of
our coordinate system. (One could imagine some big asteroid
Fig. 2. The concept of retarded time. It takes a ﬁnite amount of time ( t/C0tr)
for the signal to leave the merchant spacecraft and reach the pirates. During
that time interval, the merchants travel from position ~rmðtrÞto position
~rmðtÞ. The pirates’ velocity vector at time thas the direction of
~rmðtrÞ/C0~rpðtÞ, where ~rpðtÞdenotes the pirates’ position at that time.
Fig. 1. Sketch of the classical problem of pursuit. The ﬁgure shows the posi-
tions of the pirate ship and the merchant vessel at a generic instant t>0,
given, respectively, by ( x,y) andðx0;VmtÞ. Note that the tangent line to the
pursuit curve at the point ( x,y) passes through the point ðx0;VmtÞ.

was blocking the view before that.) We deﬁne t¼0 to be the
time at which the signal emitted by the merchants ﬁrst
reaches the pirate spacecraft. At that time, the pirate space-
craft is located at the origin of our coordinate system. Sincethe ﬁrst signal had to travel a distance x
0in order to reach
the pirates, taking an amount of time x0=cto do so, the posi-
tion of the merchant spacecraft at t¼0 is given by
ðx0;Vmx0=cÞ. Therefore, at time t2R, the merchant space-
craft is located at the point ðx0;ymðtÞÞ, with ymðtÞ¼Vmx0=c
þVmt. Figure 3illustrates this situation for some t>0, when
the pirate spacecraft is located at an arbitrary point ( x,y).
Note from Fig. 3that the line which is tangent to the
“relativistic” pursuit curve at ( x,y) connects that point to
ðx0;ymðtrÞÞ, i.e., the position of the merchant spacecraft at
retarded time tr, as opposed to its actual position ðx0;ymðtÞÞ.
This is the crucial difference between this problem and the
one posed and solved by Bouguer. We, thus, obtain an equa-tion similar to Eq. (1),
dy
dx¼ymðtrÞ/C0y
x0/C0x¼Vmx0=cþVmtr/C0y
x0/C0x: (8)
Furthermore, Eq. (2)is also valid here for the same reasons
given above it.
The last piece of information we need comes from Eq. (7).
In our case, it becomes

Finally, solving Eq. (8)fortrand Eq. (2)fort, and then
plugging the solutions into Eq. (10), we arrive at

where we have deﬁned b¼Vp=cand we recall that
a¼Vm=Vp. This equation is equivalent to Eq. (10) in Ref.
12. Note that when b!0 it reduces to Eq. (4), as expected.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Equation (12) cannot be analytically solved for p(x). To
see why, note that one can integrate it with the initial condi-
tionpð0Þ¼0 to ﬁnd13

(13)
This yields xas a function of p, but it is not possible to invert
that function.
Nonetheless, Eq. (13) is useful in applying numerical
methods to plot yas a function of x(see the Appendix for the
MATHEMATICA routine that we have used). We have done so
for different values of the parameters aandb, and our results
are shown in Fig. 4. Note that the smaller the parameter b,
the more similar are the solutions to the original problem
(Eq. (6)) and the retarded time problem (Eq. (13)).
V. DO THE PIRATES EVER REACH THE
MERCHANTS?
The ﬁnite speed of propagation of the signal emitted by the
merchants implies that the pirates’ velocity vector does notpoint in the direction of the merchant spacecraft position at
any given time, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This might suggest that
the spacecrafts never actually meet. Is that really the case?
As mentioned below Eq. (6), in the original problem, a nec-
essary and sufﬁcient condition for the pirate ship to reach the
merchant vessel is that the speed of the latter be lower than that
of the former, i.e., a<1. Otherwise the merchants escape.
Even though one cannot solve the “relativistic” problem
exactly, it is possible to reach a conclusion on this matter as
follows. First, note that, from the setup of the problem (or
just by looking at the numerical plots in Fig. 4), it is safe to
assume that the slope dy/dxbecomes very large as the pirates
approach the merchant spacecraft trajectory, i.e., for x/C25x
0.
Therefore, we can take a certain value of xin that region (as
close to x0as we want) and approximate Eq. (13)considering
pðxÞ/C291. Within this approximation, it is possible to solve
the equation for p(x), and the result is
pðxÞ¼dy
dx/C251
2/C18/C191=1þab
1/C0x
x0/C18/C19/C0að1þbÞ=1þab
: (14)
Integrating this equation from a certain value x?tox0,w e
ﬁnd that the corresponding variation of the ycoordinate is
proportional to the integral

The pirates make for the point at which they see the merchant spacecraft,
i.e., its position at retarded time.

which converges if and only if a<1. Hence, perhaps sur-
prisingly, the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the pur-
suer to catch the pursued is independent of band the same as
in the original problem.
VI. SUBTLETIES CONCERNING THE WORD
“RELATIVISTIC”
Throughout this paper, we have written the word
“relativistic” inside quotation marks. The reason is that we
actually use that word just to mean that information propa-
gates at a ﬁnite speed, as was done by Hoenselaers.12Inorder to analyze the problem in a truly relativistic manner, we
would have to take into account the fact that, in general, lightrays are not straight lines in accelerated frames of reference 14
such as the pirate spacecraft. This implies we cannot reallyafﬁrm that the pirates see the merchant spacecraft at its posi-tion at retarded time, i.e., Eq. (8)is not valid in general.
Of course, the discussion of the truly relativistic problem
is outside the scope of this paper, since our goal is merely tointroduce the concept of retarded time in a more friendlycontext. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to investigate the con-ditions under which our results in Secs. III–V can be
regarded as good approximations.
More precisely, we are interested in ﬁnding a constraint
on the parameters aandbsuch that the effects of accelera-
tion can be considered small. Following Ref. 14, we can

ða;bÞ(the thicker curve); the analytical solution to the original problem (Eq. (6)) for the same value of aused in the numerical solution (the thinner curve); a
vertical dashed line corresponding to the trajectory of the merchant vessel/spacecraft; two horizontal dotted lines indicating the y-coordinates of the points at
which the pirates reach the merchants in each version of the problem. Note that the two curves are indistinguishable in graph (c). (a) a¼0.5,b¼0.8. (b)

expect those effects to be small if the (proper) duration of
the chase is much smaller than c=Að0Þ
p, where Að0Þ

nitude of the pirates’ proper acceleration. Since the speed is
constant, the acceleration Apmeasured by the inertial

mated through the usual formula

from calculus, we know that

Plugging the solution of the classical problem (Eq. (6))i n

the order of magnitude of R, we get R/C24x0=a, hence

On the other hand, it is easy to show that the duration of
the chase, in the classical problem, is given by
Dt¼x0=Vp

Assuming that the duration of the chase in the relativistic case is
of the same order as Dt, we can estimate the total proper time
elapsed during the chase to be Ds/C24Dtﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

results in Secs. III–V can be considered good approximations if

Finally, note that the considerations in this section are
only relevant if we really take the signal, which guides the
pirates to be an electromagnetic wave. If we instead think of
sound waves, with crepresenting the speed of sound, then
our results are equally good for any values of the parametersin the range 0 /C20a;b<1.
VII. FINAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have revisited the classical problem of
pursuit, posed and solved by Bouguer in 1732,1taking into
consideration that information cannot travel at inﬁnite speed.We have combined analytical and numerical methods in
order to obtain the pursuit curve for different values of the
parameters involved in the problem.
Crucial to the discussion was the concept of retarded time,
which is usually introduced to students only in the context ofelectrodynamics, where it gets mixed with the complicationsinherent to the study of electromagnetic radiation. Interestingly,
Wikipedia has an entry on “retarded time,” which is listed as
one of the “articles about electromagnetism.” Here, we haveshown that the concept of retarded time can actually beintroduced in the context of a problem, which is essentially
classical mechanical, hence much simpler. We believe thatunderstanding retarded time in a context that is free from the
complications of electromagnetism will reduce the difﬁculties
students usually face when dealing with retarded potentials.
Furthermore, an important contribution of the present
paper was to show that, as in the original problem, the neces-sary and sufﬁcient condition for the pursuer to catch the pur-sued is that the speed of the latter be lower than that of theformer, which might be a bit surprising, since it does not
depend on the speed at which information travels.
There are a number of interesting directions in which one
could try and extend the present work. Perhaps, the mostimmediate one would be the investigation of this problemwhen the motion of the merchant spacecraft is not rectilinear.For instance, the case of a circular trajectory has been brieﬂy
discussed by Hoenselaers.
12However, even without leaving
the realm of rectilinear motion, there are a few questionsworth thinking about. First, one could consider the problemwe analyzed in this paper in the reference frame of the mer-chant spacecraft, which is inertial. This has been done for the
original problem in Ref. 8, where the authors found the pur-
suit curve in that frame. It would be very interesting to checkif a similar analysis is possible in the “relativistic” case.
Moreover, in the original problem, one can show that there
exists a constant of motion given by
15
C0:¼d
dtð~rmðtÞ/C0~rpðtÞÞ /C1 ð~vmðtÞþ~vpðtÞÞ/C2/C3¼V2
m/C0V2
p;
(21)
in the language of Sec. IIIwith ~v¼d~r=dt. Therefore, one
can easily obtain the duration of the chase by integrating Eq.(21). Would it be possible to ﬁnd an analogous conserved
quantity in the version of the problem involving retardedtime? Since, in that case, ~v
pðtÞis parallel to ~rmðtrÞ/C0~rpðtÞ,
one could think of the following candidate:
Cb¼?d
dtð~rmðtrÞ/C0~rpðtÞÞ /C1 ð~vmðtrÞþ~vpðtÞÞ/C2/C3: (22)
However, it is straightforward to verify that Cbis not a constant
of motion. This is related to the fact that, for the pirates, itappears as if the merchant spacecraft moved with variable speed,
a fact which was also noticed by Hoenselaers.12We currently do
not know whether or not a generalized version of C0exists, so
this fascinating problem remains open for future investigation.

APPENDIX: MATHEMATICA ROUTINE
In order to produce the numerical plots displayed in Sec.
IV, we have used the following MATHEMATICA routine. We
begin by deﬁning the function
Xp½/C138 :¼1/C01
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
p2þ1p
þp/C16/C17
p2þ1 ðÞab=2/C16/C171=aðbþ1Þ;
which comes from solving Eq. (13) forxand taking x0¼1.
Now we need to invert this function. Numerically, thismeans that we can make a table of points ( X,p) and then
interpolate between those points. In
MATHEMATICA , this can
be implemented as follows:
graph ¼Table fXp½/C138;pg;fp;0;100;0:1g/C2/C3;
P¼Interpolation graph ½/C138 ;
so that the function Pis the numerical version of p(x).
However, p(x) is just dy/dx, so it sufﬁces to numerically inte-
grate the function Pto obtain yas a function of x, i.e.,
Y¼Integrate P x ½/C138;x ½/C138 :
This is the function we plot to produce the ﬁgures in Sec. IV.
A few comments are in order. Note that, in the function
Table , we have chosen the maximum value of pto be 100
(which should correspond to a value of xvery close to x0)
and the increment Dpas 0.1. Those choices yield reliable
results when we set the value of the parameter abetween 0.2
and 0.5. For values of aoutside that range, it may be neces-
sary to change the parameters in Table in order to get a
reliable result.
How can we check whether or not a given result is reli-
able? One way to do so is by computing the ratio between
the total distance traveled by the pirates and the total dis-
tance traveled by the merchants, from t¼0 till the capture of
the latter. Deﬁning Ymaxas the y-coordinate of the point
where the capture takes place (numerically, Ymax¼Y=:x
!1.0), that ratio is given byC:¼ð1
0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1þpðxÞ2q
dx
Ymax/C0ab:
Now, since the speeds are constant, this ratio should give
1=a. Therefore, for a given function P, we can compute C
numerically and compare it to 1 =a. We consider the results
to be reliable if jaC/C01j/H113513%.

13It is worth noting that Eq. (13) is equivalent to Eq. (11) in Ref. 12,
although there is a typo in the latter. (The exponent on the right-hand side
should be /C0ðv/C01þc/C01Þ.)
