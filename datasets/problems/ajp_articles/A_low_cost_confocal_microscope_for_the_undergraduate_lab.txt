We demonstrate a simple and cost-efﬁcient scanning confocal microscope setup for use in
advanced instructional physics laboratories. The setup is constructed from readily availablecommercial products, and the implementation of a 3D-printed ﬂexure stage allows for further cost
reduction and pedagogical opportunity. Experiments exploring the thickness of a microscope slide
and the surface of solid objects with height variation are presented as foundational components ofundergraduate laboratory projects and demonstrate the capabilities of a confocal microscope. This
system allows observation of key components of a confocal microscope, including depth
perception and data acquisition via transverse scanning, making it an excellent pedagogicalresource.

I. INTRODUCTION
The design and use of optical instruments is an area of
broad interest, appealing particularly to students at the inter-section of biological ﬁelds with physics and engineering.With the large number of undergraduate physicists interested
in careers in biomedical ﬁelds, a confocal microscope pro-
vides an excellent opportunity to see how physics principlesrelate to state-of-the-art equipment used for image formation.
The properties, advantages, and applications of confocal
microcopy have been carefully investigated in the biologicalcommunity.
1–3
While many undergraduate optics courses spend signiﬁ-
cant time on the ideas of optical instruments and traditional
microscopes, confocal microscopy is an important applica-
tion that is often absent from the student experience. Therehave been a variety of designs for homebuilt confocal micro-
scopes in the lab,4–9but these designs are often more focused
on the production of an image than on student understandingof the physics underlying the operation of the instrument.Previous versions were often either too expensive or left
essential elements hidden in commercial components, mak-
ing them nonideal for undergraduate pedagogy.
In this paper, we present a simple scanning confocal
microscope experiment, ideal for the undergraduate optics or
advanced instructional lab environment. Rather than being
designed to minimize its size or acquire images on par withcommercial confocal microscopes, our instructional setup isdesigned to clearly demonstrate the physics involved in the
image acquisition method and to make the optical compo-
nents easy to manipulate. Our setup provides an excellentsystem to illustrate scanning confocal microscopy and also
gives experience with the calibration of a data acquisition
process.
Our system is designed to be versatile with potential to
develop student experimental skills in the areas optical sys-
tems, electronics, and 3D printing. Projects can be adapted to
suit the context of an advanced lab setting, an optics or elec-tronics course, an independent student project, or a senior
thesis. In this paper, we outline an experimental process that
can be used as a whole or broken up into parts, depending onthe pedagogical purposes of the instructor. In the ﬁrst experi-
ment, a microscope slide is used to illustrate the ability of a
confocal setup to acquire depth information in a sample. A
second experiment involves using this setup to investigate
height variations of a solid material. Finally, either of theseexperiments can incorporate a 3D printed translation stage,
10
which allows integration of programming and electroniccontrol.
II. DESIGN
Our confocal microscope experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 1. The essential elements of this system are readily
available commercial components. We use a simple 650 nm
laser diode with an optical power of 5 mW. This laser is
expanded with a two-lens beam expander to a beam waist of5 mm waist to ﬁll a commercial microscope objective lens.
The beam expander is constructed so that the distance
between the lenses is the sum of the focal lengths, which
increases the beam size by a factor of f
2=f1. An iris is placed
at the focus of the beam expander to make the beam more
404 Am. J. Phys. 91(5), May 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 404 04 October 2023 22:52:26
circular. Once the beam is collimated, the distance between
the expander and the objective, including the presence of a
steering mirror, is chosen for convenience. The sample is
placed on a translation stage, which can be either a commer-cially purchased or a 3D-printed stage. The objective focusesthe light onto the sample, where a portion is reﬂected back
through the objective and a beamsplitter redirects the light
towards a photodetector.
If the sample is at the focal point of the objective, the light
coming back through the system will be collimated, and aﬁnal imaging lens will focus it through an iris before the
photodetector. Hence, if the sample is at exactly the focal
length away from the objective, the image plane will be atthe iris location, and a large portion of the light will make itto the photodetector. However, if the sample’s surface is notat the focal plane, the amount of light at the photodetector
will be greatly reduced.
Essential to the operation of the confocal microscope is
the fact that the iris is in the image plane at the light focus.
Thus, it effectively images only the part of the sample at thefocal plane of the objective lens. Unlike traditional micro-
scopes, this allows depth information in a sample.
The apparatus described here is a cost-effective means for
demonstrating these ideas in an undergraduate setting. A full
list of the parts needed can be seen in Table I, where it is
assumed power supplies and an oscilloscope are available.The inclusion of the mirror and lens focal lengths were cho-
sen by convenience with an available breadboard and can be
modiﬁed as desired. The total cost of the equipment comes
to US $3,340.65. However, the largest cost is the 3-axis
translation stage, which can be replaced with a 3D-printedﬂexure stage,
10,11reducing the cost to under US $2,000 and
opening up new opportunities for development.
This setup can be used to examine several simple objects,
which provide excellent insight into the confocal imaging
process. A deeper understanding of depth information from
the microscope can come from examining standard micro-scope slides, especially those with concave sample openings.
The slide can be mounted on the translation stage in a num-
ber of ways; in our experiment, it was clipped to a 3D-printed stand, such that the laser passed through the slide
with nothing behind it. The system can also be used to exam-
ine surface variation of solid objects. We have found that
3D-printed objects with known height variation works well,
but a variety of other objects can be used.
III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the confocal
microscope, two experiments are outlined here. The ﬁrst
involves observing the thickness of semitransparent materi-
als, with commercial microscope slides offering an excellent
starting point. Using a microscope slide to demonstrate howthe confocal microscope works offers students the chance to
Fig. 1. The experimental setup for the confocal microscope. A generic visi-
ble laser is used and expanded to ﬁll a microscope objective lens. The objec-
tive lens focuses the light onto a sample, which is mounted on a translationstage at the focus of the objective. The light reﬂected from the sample is sep-
arated by a beam splitter and focused onto an image plane, where an iris lim-
its light to that which came from the focal plane of the objective. This
intensity is then monitored by a photodiode.

determine depth information on a sample. As a starting point,
a microscope slide with a concave sample opening can be
used. In this case, two reﬂections occur, one off of the slide’s
front surface and the other off of its back surface. As a result,adjusting the position of the sample longitudinally along thedirection of laser propagation allows the observation of twosuccessive peaks, as each of the slide’s front surface andback surface is in the focal plane of the objective. An exam-
ple of the data observed as the slide platform is adjusted lon-
gitudinally (in the x-direction) is shown in Fig. 2. Opening
the iris at the image plane makes clear the way in which theconfocal microscope causes a speciﬁc image plane for differ-ent depths in the material. Without this iris, depth informa-
tion is lost, as can be seen in Fig. 2.
By using a microscope slide with a concave sample open-
ing, the thickness of the glass can be observed as a function
of the position along the slide. As a starting point, this canbe done by moving the slide a small distance transversely(in the y-direction), then scanning longitudinally (in the
x-direction) to observe the two peaks, stepping through posi-
tions. An example of the data obtained with this two axis
scan technique is shown in Fig. 3.This setup can also be used to demonstrate the usefulness
of a scanning confocal microscope by acquiring the samedepth information, while only moving the slide transverselyto the laser beam. This makes the image collection processmuch faster but requires calibrating the system. As the slideis shifted transversely in the area where the depth varies, thedifferent depths will cause different voltages in the photodi-ode. To correlate these voltage changes to height changes, aﬁt for the voltage as a function of height in the regionscanned is found from the longitudinal scan, such as shownin Fig. 4.
The shape of the intensity peak is caused by the changing
beam waist as it propagates through the image plane, withthe intensity limited by the iris size. This is a complexdependence, but can be roughly ﬁt using a Lorentzian overmuch of the peak. For a more precise calibration, it is desired
to ﬁnd a function that ﬁts the intensity peak very well over a
particular range of heights of the sample. Using this calibra-tion, voltage changes when scanning transversely can beused to calculate height changes in the sample. The simplestcalibration is to use a portion of the graph that can be wellapproximated as linear, as shown in Fig. 4(a). However, this
linear ﬁt is only valid over a limited height variation, lessthan 100 lm. Over a larger height variation, an exponential
or polynomial ﬁt may also work well, where we illustrate aLorentzian ﬁt in Fig. 4(b). Allowing students to determine
this calibration technique provides additional insight andexperience in data analysis methods. Taking the data againfor the slide thickness using a transverse scan calibrated withthe Lorentzian ﬁt is shown in Fig. 3and agrees with that
taken when collecting points individually with motion inboth dimensions. Furthermore, this process allows studentsto understand how data can be collected and analyzedquickly in this “scanning” conﬁguration of a confocalmicroscope.
The ability of the confocal microscope to determine height
variations of a solid sample represents another key category ofexperiment that can be undertaken. To illustrate this point, ster-eolithography (SLA) 3D-printed objects of known height varia-tion are used. SLA 3D printing, like fused deposition modeling(FDM) 3D printing, creates a model layer by layer. Instead ofextruding ﬁlament, a laser polymerizes resin at a speciﬁc point.This process allows for a quantiﬁable amount of material to bedeposited with a known volumetric resolution. This propertywas exploited to create steps, with a known thickness, on thesurface of a 3D-printed block small enough to demonstrate theaccuracy of the system. Variations on this experiment could bedone with a variety of objects, as long as the object has heightvariation on the scale of 100 s of microns.
With these solid objects, there are no longer multiple
intensity peaks from different depths of the sample.Instead, the location of the surface can be seen by the maxi-mum of the intensity peak. Here, the surface height varia-tion can be investigated either by successively steppingtransversely and longitudinally, or by scanning only trans-versely using a calibrated intensity vs. height graph, as dis-cussed above. For our experiment two different surfacevariations were printed, one that increased 50 lm in height
for each 200 lm shift in position, and another that increased
100lm in height for each 200 lm shift in position. Figure 5
shows the measured surface location as a function of thedistance along the sample for each of these materials usingthe two-axis scan technique, and illustrates the ability ofthe system to determine solid surface height variations. The Fig. 2. As the distance between the objective lens and the slide is varied,
intensity peaks are seen when either the front or the back surface of the slide
is at the focal plane of the objective. This is shown both at the ﬂat edge of
the slide, and at the curved center where the slide is not as thick. The shifting
of the second peak reveals the changing thickness of the slide. Removing theiris in the imaging plane reveals the necessity of limiting the light from a
single image plane for depth perception.
Fig. 3. The distance from the objective where peak reﬂected light is
observed as a function of distance along the slide. The region where the slide
is ﬂat is visible, before the concave opening begins at 4 mm. Then the chang-
ing thickness where the concave sample opening begins can be observed.
The two-axis scan involves moving the translation stage transversely a small
amount before scanning longitudinally to ﬁnd the maximum. The one-axis
method involves only scanning transversely, using a known calibration of
the photodiode voltage with depth.

precision of 3D printers can limit the resolution of features
created using this method, but it is expected that the cost of
high-resolution 3D printers will continue to decrease,
allowing more intricate surface patterns to be investigated.Additional solid objects such as coins can also be exam-
ined, but the high reﬂectivity and angled surfaces can cause
complex behavior in the signal intensity, and extra care isrequired.
IV. INCORPORATION OF 3D-PRINTED
TRANSLATION STAGE
3D printing has developed into an extremely valuable tool
for the undergraduate lab, and has been incorporated into anumber of experimental designs.
12–14Due to recent advances
and open-source development, it is now possible to print and
program excellent open-source translation stages,10,11and
3D printing has been incorporated into a variety of micro-
scope designs.15–20In the confocal microscopy setup pre-
sented here, 3D printing presents the possibility of replacinga commercial translation stage system with a homebuilt
option. This replacement serves two main purposes: First, it
can reduce the cost of the necessary equipment by a signiﬁ-cant fraction. Second, it allows meaningful student experi-
ence in design, 3D printing, electronics, and programming.
This allows the confocal microscope project to be quitegeneral, appealing to students interested in a wide range of
engineering or data acquisition ﬁelds.
One option that incorporates 3-axis translation and excel-
lent precision is the OpenFlexure Block stage.
11This setup
is well documented elsewhere, and here was incorporatedwith little modiﬁcation to the design presented. This stage
was speciﬁed to have a step size in the xdirection of
12.460.2 nm and translate 2 mm on any axis. While this
translation distance is not large enough to scan over largeportions of the slide, it does allow the same experimentationon slide thickness described above, with the data taken againas observed in Fig. 2. Having both the data for slide thick-
ness taken from the commercial translations stage and theOpenFluxure Block stage allows an additional means of veri-fying the calibration for distance per step on the block stage.Using these data, our calibration was determined to be12.160.4 nm, consistent with previous measurements.
11
The use of 3D-printed translation stages makes the scanning
confocal microscope even more accessible and would com-bine well with projects commonly undertaken in an under-graduate lab environment.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The design for a homebuilt scanning confocal microscope
presented here is ideal for an undergraduate instructional lab-oratory setting. Through the measurement of microscope
slide thicknesses and surface variations, undergraduates
develop a better sense of the methods of scanning confocalmicroscopy and the information it provides. This design pro-vides a robust setup with understandable mechanisms at alow price that enables easy implementation.
Our setup is intended for pedagogical purposes rather than
quality imaging competitive with commercial confocalmicroscopes, but can be extended for more complete imag-ing. If desired, the OpenFlexure stage can be automated,allowing for expansion of this project into acquiring scannedthree dimensional images. This is especially appealing in thecontext of an independent project or senior thesis looking to
incorporate additional programming.
An investigation of the resolution of the system
2can also
be employed as an extension to the experiments presentedhere. Investigating the limiting resolution would requirematerials with much ﬁner features, as with this wavelengthand numerical aperture lens the theoretical lateral resolutionis expected to be near 1 lm, and the axial resolution on orderFig. 4. The intensity peak obtained as the slide is translated longitudinally can be used to provide a voltage vs. height calibration for the sample. An appropriate
ﬁtting function can be chosen to ﬁt the peak over a particular height variation region on a sample. (a) A linear ﬁt to a portion of the peak, providing a sim ple
calibration valid over 0.066 mm around the sample. (b) A Lorentzian ﬁt valid over 0.21 mm range around the sample.

15lm. Here, several factors could be investigated to deter-
mine maximum resolution, including beam size, the minimalsize and location of the iris, and the numerical aperture ofthe objective lens used.
The confocal microscope system described in this paper
can easily be expanded, either to improve its quality orexamine further applications. Enhancements include theaddition of an additional beamsplitter and camera, the use ofachromatic doublets to decrease aberrations, improving thelaser quality through ﬁber-coupling before use, or a galvo-scanning mirror in place of the x-ytranslation stage. In addi-
tion, the experiments outlined here can easily be extended tosimple biological samples or ﬂuorescence microscopy,allowing further insight into the way the optical system iscommonly applied in biomedical ﬁelds.
