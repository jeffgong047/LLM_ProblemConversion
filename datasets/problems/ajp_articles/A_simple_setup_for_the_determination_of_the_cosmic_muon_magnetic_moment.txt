We present a simple setup for the measurement of the magnetic moment of cosmic muons
convenient for a student laboratory experiment. A signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation is made in the detector
system compared to previous experiments of this kind, yet it retains all the necessary functionality
of the system. This simpliﬁcation additionally allows for the use of low-cost custom-madeelectronics for data readout and storage. These improvements considerably reduce the cost and
provide a more accessible setup for a student laboratory experiment.

I. INTRODUCTION
Measurements of the properties of cosmic muons provide
excellent opportunities for educational experiments in ele-mentary particle physics. A classic and very popular exampleis the muon lifetime measurement, an experiment that hasbeen conducted in numerous variations using standardnuclear physics equipment (see, for example, a recent reviewgiven by Riggi et al.
1) and also with more accessible low-
cost electronics.2,3More complex measurements of the
muon mass have also more recently been performed.4,5
Conceptually and instrumentally much more demanding is
the measurement of the muon magnetic moment. Being apoint-like charged lepton that carries a unit electrical charge,
either positive or negative, and with a spin of 1/2 and a mass
of about 207 masses of the electron, the muon possesses amagnetic moment.
6One of the most effective and successful
measurements of the magnetic moment of cosmic muons asan educational experiment using standard nuclear physicsequipment was performed by Amsler.
7This measurement
exploits the non-conservation of parity in the production anddecay chain of muons, ﬁrst observed in the experiment ofGarwin et al. ,
8which was also the incentive for Amsler’s
experiment. In particular, as a consequence of parity viola-tion, there is a net polarization of cosmic muons that have
been stopped in a material at Earth’s surface. By putting this
material in a known magnetic ﬁeld, the spins of the stoppedmuons precess in the ﬁeld. The spins of the muons are corre-lated with the direction of the positrons (electrons) emittedin the muon decays. By measuring the distribution ofpositrons (electrons) in a certain direction as a function of
time, it is possible to determine the precession frequency of
the muons and from this, the magnetic moment of the muon.
Our measurement is based on the same idea, but the detec-
tor system is simpliﬁed to the bare minimum of only onescintillation detector. Instead of using standard nuclear and
particle physics equipment, low-cost electronics is used for
the processing and recording of the signals from the scintilla-tion detector developed for a simple system for muon life-
time measurement.

In Sec. II, we brieﬂy describe the origin of cosmic muons
and their properties relevant for this measurement. In Sec.III, we introduce the muon magnetic moment and elucidate
the principle of the measurement. Our experimental setup
and measurements are described in Sec. IV. Section V
presents the analysis of our acquired data and the obtained
results, which are then discussed in Sec. VI.
II. COSMIC MUONS: ORIGIN, POLARIZATION,
AND DECAY
By the term cosmic muons , we mean muons that are pro-
duced in the decays of pions and kaons originating from theinteractions of primary cosmic rays (mainly protons and light
nuclei) with the nuclei in the Earth’s atmosphere; see, for
example, the textbook of Perkins.
9Cosmic muons from pion
decay are much more common because, in the primary inter-
actions, pions ( pþ;p0;p/C0) are created with a much greater
probability than kaons ( Kþ,K0,K/C0). While focused on pion

decay, the subsequent discussion is also valid for muons
from kaon decay.
Charged pions decay by weak interaction according to
pþ!lþþ/C23land p/C0!l/C0þ/C22/C23l: (1)
In the pion rest frame, decays are isotropic in the full solid
angle of 4 p. However, since created pions have given momenta
toward Earth, determined by the initial directions of primarycosmic rays, most of the produced muons also have momentadirected toward the Earth. On Earth’s surface, the mean muonenergy is approximately 4 GeV, and the total downward-directed ﬂux of muons with energies higher than 1 GeV/c isapproximately 1 cm
–2min–1. Due to the positive charge of the
primary cosmic rays, the ratio of the number of positive-to-neg-ative cosmic muons is about 1.25 in the GeV range.6
In pion decay, there is maximal violation of parity and, in
the rest frame of a positive pion, the produced positive muonis always left-handed (meaning its spin is in the oppositedirection of its momentum). This property is the conse-quence of the conservation of the total angular momentum,and the fact that pions have spin zero and neutrinos can onlybe left-handed. On the other hand, since antineutrinos canonly be right-handed (i.e., their spin is in the direction oftheir momentum), negative muons can only be right-handedwhen produced in the rest frame of the negative pions; see,for example, the textbook of Grifﬁths.
10
Polarization of the cosmic muons is the property resulting
from a preferred orientation of their spin, see, for example,articles of Hayakawa11and Johnson.12At ground level, it is
caused by parity violation in the processes of pion decay andby the energy spectra of pions from which the muons areproduced. To explain this point, let us consider two extremecases, one in which the muon is emitted in the direction ofthe pion boost (i.e., toward Earth’s surface) in the rest frameof the decaying pion, forward muon , and the other in which
the muon is emitted in the opposite direction of the pionboost (i.e., away from Earth’s surface) in the rest frame ofthe decaying pion, backward muon .
If we consider positive pions, in the forward muon case,
thel
þis emitted toward Earth and the /C23lis emitted in the
opposite direction, as in Fig. 1(a). Thus, forward muons,
which are initially left-handed, remain left-handed whenthey arrive at Earth’s surface. In the backward muon case,the momentum of the produced l
þin the rest frame of the
decaying pion is in the opposite direction of the pion boost,but since it is left-handed, its spin is in the boost direction,
that is, in the direction toward Earth, as in Fig. 1(b). Positive
backward muons that reach Earth’s surface (i.e., the muons
for which the boosts of the decaying pions were sufﬁcientlylarge to reverse the initial direction of the backward muons)
will be right-handed at Earth’s surface. Since the number of
pions decreases with the pion energy, an excess number offorward muons will reach Earth’s surface, producing a net
upward polarization of positive muons at Earth’s surface.
The analogous consideration is also valid for negative
muons and, keeping in mind that they are produced as right-handed particles, their net polarization at Earth’s surface will
be downward.
Muon polarization has been measured at Earth’s surface
as a function of energy and zenith angle. For example, for
positive muons from the zenith, the polarization has been
determined to be /C00:3860:04 and /C00:3360:04 for energies
near 3.5 and 1.0 GeV, respectively; the polarization falls off
at lower muon energies.
16The negative sign indicates that
the spin is antiparallel to the direction of the ﬂight of the pos-itive muons. The observed polarization of the muons at
Earth’s surface indeed proves the parity violation in the pion
decay.
Muons decay via the weak interaction with a mean life-
time of s¼2:196 981 1 60:000 002 2 ls.6Parity violation is
also present in these decay processes, which proceed as
follows:
lþ!eþþ/C23eþ/C22/C23land l/C0!e/C0þ/C22/C23eþ/C23l: (2)
The directions of the emitted positrons (electrons) in these
decays are correlated with the above described net polariza-
tion of the muons at Earth’s surface, producing an asymmet-
ric angular distribution. This fact can be qualitativelyunderstood if, in the decay of a muon at rest, we consider the
extreme case where the most energetic positron (electron) is
emitted.17In this case, both the neutrino and antineutrino
must be emitted in the direction opposite that of the positron
(electron), as in Fig. 2. Since neutrinos and antineutrinos
have an opposite handedness, the total angular momentumcarried by them is zero, and a positron (electron) must be
emitted with the spin parallel to that of the decaying muon.
To meet this requirement, and since positrons (electrons) areright-handed (left-handed), their momenta should be directed
in (opposite to) the directions of the muon spin. So, for the
decays of positive muons, positrons are favorably emitted inthe direction of the muon spin, and for the decays of negative
muons, electrons are favorably emitted in the opposite direc-
tion of the muon spin.

frame of decaying pion. (b) A positive muon emitted in the opposite direc-
tion of the pion boost in the rest frame of a decaying pion.Fig. 2. Decay at the rest of a positive (a) and a negative (b) muon with theemission of the most energetic positron and electron, respectively.

III. MUON MAGNETIC MOMENT AND PRINCIPLE
OF MEASUREMENT
A charged particle with a spin carries a magnetic moment.
For the muon, which is a point-like lepton and has charge e,
mass ml, and spin ~s, the magnetic moment is given by
~ll¼gllBohr
l~s; (3)
where glis the proportionality factor called the gyromag-
netic ratio and lBohr
l is the Bohr magneton of the muon
given by lBohr
l¼e/C22h=2ml. The gyromagnetic ratio is pre-
dicted by the Dirac equation to be exactly 2 for leptons, but
the experimentally determined gl-value differs slightly from
this theoretical expectation, an inconsistency termed themagnetic moment anomaly ,6a subject of great interest in par-
ticle physics both experimentally13and theoretically.14
If a muon is in an external magnetic ﬁeld ~B, its spin will
precess with the frequency
x¼gleB
2ml: (4)
If cosmic muons are stopped in a suitable non-magnetic
material that is immersed in a horizontal magnetic ﬁeld (withrespect to Earth’s surface), there will be a precession of spinsof the stopped muons. Copper is one such suitable material,
because it effectively stops cosmic muons due to its rela-
tively high density and atomic number. Most of the negativemuons are quickly caught by nuclei in the stopping material(the lifetime of negative muons in copper is 0.163 ls
(Ref. 15)) and since our apparatus is not sensitive enough to
determine their inﬂuence, in the following discussion, werestrict ourselves to the positive muons, which stop in thematerial and decay as free particles.The muon spin precession is determined as follows. We
detect positrons from the decays of stopped muons only in
the upward direction. Above, we described the net polariza-
tion of the cosmic muons at Earth’s surface, the precessionof their spins in the magnetic ﬁeld, and the correlations of
the directions of emitted positrons with muon spins. Based
on these facts, there will be an oscillation in time of the num-
ber of detected positrons from the decays about the usual
exponential decay curve. When there is no magnetic ﬁeldpresent, the data from our experiment should follow a simple
exponential dependence

where I(t) is the number of muon decays in a unit of time at
time t,I0is the decay rate at t¼0,sis the muon mean life-
time, and a constant Cdue to the background. With an
applied magnetic ﬁeld, with good accuracy, we expect theabove relation to become7

where ais the experimental asymmetry (that depends on the
asymmetry of the positrons emitted in the muon decays,the polarization of the stopped muons, and the geometry of
the setup), xis the muon precession frequency, and dis the
angle of initial muon polarization.
By ﬁtting function Eq. (6)to the measured time distribu-
tion, which is obtained by detecting upward emitted posi-
trons from the decays of muons that are stopped in the
material in the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, we can determine
the frequency of the muon precession x, and hence g
lfrom
Eq.(4).
IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND MEASUREMENTS
We used one scintillation detector for the detection of the
incoming cosmic muons and the same detector for the detec-
tion of the positrons from the decays. The scintillation detec-
tor consisted of an NE 102A scintillator plate of
50/C250/C21c m3, coupled to a twisted light guide of 60 cm in
length on which a Philips XP5312/SN 3-in. photomultiplier
tube was attached. The scintillator and the light guide were
glued with optical cement and wrapped with thin aluminumfoil and with black scotch tape. The PMT was mounted in an
aluminum tube with holders that enabled tight coupling to
the light guide; the coupling was enhanced by optical grease.Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the experimental setup (not to scale,
dimensions are given in the text).

A box with a custom-made high-voltage supply with variable
output voltage was attached to the aluminum tube that
housed the PMT. The voltage applied in the measurementwas/C01060 V.
A block of copper measuring 50 /C250/C22.5 cm3was
placed beneath the scintillator plate. The copper block con-
sisted of 40 pieces of 2.5 /C22.5/C225 cm3copper bars. The
distance between the middle of the copper block and themiddle of the scintillator plate was 6.3 cm. The role ofthe copper block was to stop some of the incoming cosmic
muons.
The copper block was positioned centrally inside a rectan-
gular copper coil of one layer with 355 windings, a length of
60 cm, a width of 57.5 cm, and a height of 7.5 cm, and whosepurpose was to produce the necessary magnetic ﬁeld. Thewire in the coil had a cross section of 1.5 mm
2. The copper
coil was mounted on an aluminum frame, which also held the
copper bars and the scintillation detector. During the measure-ments with the currents, the coil was cooled by a fan.
The experimental setup is schematically shown in Fig. 3.
With a current of 5 A through the coil, we obtained a mag-
netic ﬁeld of approximately 3.7 mT at the center of the coil.
The ﬁeld fell to approximately 3.4 mT at 25 cm from the
coil’s center (i.e., at a position toward the open edges of thecoil and the end of the copper target). With a current of 6 A,the magnetic ﬁelds were /C244.3 and /C243.9 mT at the coil’s cen-
ter and at 25 cm from the coil’s center (toward the open
edges of the coil). No signiﬁcant variation was observed inthe measured ﬁeld (measured approximately every 10 cm) onthe lines transverse to the longitudinal axis of the coil. These
measurement were made at several distances along the longi-
tudinal axis from the center of the coil.
In the calculation of g
lfrom Eq. (4)and for its uncer-
tainty estimation, we used the average of the ﬁelds mea-sured in the center of the coil and at 25 cm from the coil’s
center (toward the open edges of the coil) and the corre-
sponding uncertainties.
Most of the cosmic muons come from above, and the scin-
tillation detector registered the muons that pass through orstop and decay in the copper block beneath it. The same scin-tillation detector also registered the positrons that were emit-
ted in the upward direction in the decays of the stopped
muons in the copper block.
For signal processing and data acquisition, we used custom-
made low-cost electronics developed for the simple setup forthe measurement of the cosmic muon lifetime.
3Negative ana-
log signals from the PMT of the scintillation detector were
input to the fast TTL comparator (Analog Devices AD8561)with a variable threshold in the range of 0––500 mV. To securea constant width of the output pulse, regardless of the input
pulse width, a Texas Instruments 74121 chip was used.Positive logic signals, produced by the signals from the scintil-
lation detector above the set threshold, were input to the 32-bit
microcontroller (MikroElektronika PIC32 module, modelMINI-32 BOARD). The PIC32 module recorded time stampsof the events with a time resolution of 12.5 ns, which werethen stored on a PC disk. A schematic representation of the
electronics is given in Fig. 4.
When started, the time span of the measurement by the
PIC32 module was approximately 54 s (2
32/C212.5 ns), after
this time, it was reset automatically to zero, and the measure-ment continued automatically until it was stopped by theuser. The module was programmed to transfer the recorded
data in a block of 16 events to a computer via serial/USB
connection and to perform simple operational tasks on thedata. It counted the total number of registered events duringthe measurement and the number of events for which thetime difference was less than 10 ls, and these numbers were
shown on a display. The last number indicates the number of
registered muon decays in the selected time window, asexplained in Sec. V.
With this setup, we performed one measurement of
approximately 5 days without the magnetic ﬁeld, one mea-surement of 20 days with a current of 5 A through the cop-
per wire, and one measurement of 21 days with a current of
6A .
V. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Extractions of the time distributions of the muon decays
were performed in an identical way as for the muon lifetime
measurement.
3We ﬁrst calculated the time differences
between every pair of subsequently registered events. Byselecting the time differences smaller than some selectedtime window, e.g., 10 ls, we can extract events that, with
high probability, correspond to the decays of the stopped
muons. Since the time resolution of the PIC32 unit is prettyhigh, 12.5 ns per channel, even with the measurements ofseveral weeks, the number of events registered in each chan-nel will be small. To obtain a statistically signiﬁcant number
of counts, we selected time intervals in which we counted
the number of muons that decay.
We used time intervals DT¼0:2ls and ﬁt Eqs. (5)or(6)
on the obtained distributions for the measurement without amagnetic ﬁeld or with a magnetic ﬁeld, respectively.
For the measurement without a magnetic ﬁeld, we
obtained 5981 events within the time window of 10 ls. (A
total of 2 942 766 events was registered with the scintillation
detector.) The obtained time distribution and ﬁt are shown inFig.5. We obtained a muon mean life of s¼2.1260.04ls.
For the measurements with a magnetic ﬁeld, within the
time window of 10 ls, we obtained 20 936 events (total
10 246 368 registered events) and 22 882 events (total11 077 886 registered events) with a current of 5 A and 6 A,
respectively. The time distributions and ﬁts with Eq. (6)for
these measurements are shown in Fig. 6.
All the ﬁts were performed by using Minuit in the CERN
Root software package v6.20. The ﬁt region was from 0.2 to8.8ls, which corresponds to approximately four mean muon
lifetimes. The constant C, which represents the background
in the measurement, was not left as a free parameter in the ﬁt
but was determined from the data at the large values of t. For
the measurement of 5 days without the magnetic ﬁeld, CwasFig. 5. Measurement without a magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬁt to Eq. (5).

approximately 3.5 and for the measurements with the mag-
netic ﬁeld, it was approximately 13 for our binning.
The ﬁtting results for the measurements with the magnetic
ﬁelds and the determination of glby using Eq. (4)are pre-
sented in Table I.
VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have presented a simple setup for the measurement of
the muon magnetic moment suitable for a student laboratoryexperiment. We exploited the idea of the very effective
experiment presented by Amsler,
7but we made two signiﬁ-
cant modiﬁcations and improvements.
First, we reduced the detection system to only one scintilla-
tion detector compared to three scintillation detectors used in acoincidence/anticoincidence mode in the Amsler experiment.
To the best of our knowledge, there are always several scintil-
lation detectors used in various realizations of this experimentas a student laboratory exercise. However, this reduction does
not signiﬁcantly affect the functionality of our system. As also
argued in the discussion of the muon lifetime system based ononly one scintillation detector,
3the main source of the back-
ground in our approach (if there are no other radioactive sour-
ces present) is a second cosmic muon that comes in the
selected time window (in our case 10 ls) after the ﬁrst regis-
tered muon and which is then wrongly interpreted as a positronfrom the muon decay. The rate of these accidentals, which can
be removed by veto in the multiple-detector case, is a decisive
factor for the proper functioning of a measuring system com-prised of only one scintillation detector.
Using the statistics of random events for the case of
cosmic muons (see, for example, Ref. 18)a n dt h er a t eo f
all incoming cosmic muons that pass through our size ofscintillator, it can be shown that the rate of these acciden-tals in the time window of 10 ls is indeed not insigniﬁ-
cant. However, the overall efﬁciency of our scintillation
detector for the settings used in the measurement wasabout 12% for the detection of cosmic muons (assuming
that there are in total about 200 muons/m
2s). This detec-
tion efﬁciency level also reduces the rate of accidentals,
resulting in an expected rate of slightly less than 1 per
hour. This estimate is conﬁrmed by the measured totalbackground rate of around 1.5 per hour, which comparesfavorably to the average of approximately 45 registeredevents in the time window of 10 ls per hour.
We conclude that the rate of muon accidentals is accept-
able for the execution of the measurements with our setup.Their contribution is taken into account in the off-line analy-sis by supposing a ﬂat background in the decay spectra. Theapparatus is not sensitive enough to quantify the inﬂuence ofthe decays of negative muons, which are caught by nuclei,and this limits the accuracy of the measurements. One of themain sources of the systematic errors also comes from theinhomogeneity in the magnetic ﬁeld of approx. 5%.
Second, the maximal simpliﬁcation in the detector
setup enables our other important improvement, that is,
the usage of basic and low-cost electronics for the signalprocessing and data acquisition. Compared to the classi-cal nuclear physics equipment used for such measure-ments, typically including discriminators, coincidenceunits, time-to-amplitude converters, and appropriatepower crates, our electronics system is more than anorder of magnitude lower in cost and also simpler andmore compact, making this experiment readily accessibleas a student laboratory experiment.
