The nonrelativistic trajectory of a point charge qin the magnetic ﬁeld of a steady line current Iis
characterized by the three components of its initial velocity. The motion is periodic in the
cylindrical coordinates s,_/, and _z, describing, in the generic case, a kind of “double helix,” with
one helix serving as a guide while the other winds around it. A positive charge “drifts” in thedirection of the current (a negative charge goes the other way). The inclusion of a uniform line
charge k(coinciding with the current) does not alter the motion qualitatively, but it does change the
drift velocity, and can even reduce it to zero, collapsing the trajectory to the surface of a toroid.The relativistic treatment modiﬁes and illuminates these results.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we study the motion of a charged particle in
the magnetic ﬁeld of a long straight steady current. The
motion is (perhaps surprisingly) periodic in the radial cylin-drical coordinate and also in the longitudinal and azimuthal
velocities.
In Sec. II, we obtain the nonrelativistic equations of
motion and their ﬁrst integrals. In Sec. III, we examine three
special cases and adopt useful conventions for numerical
work. In Sec. IV, we endow the wire with a uniform static
charge (in addition to its current); this introduces an electric
force, but the main effect is to alter the drift velocity. In Sec.
V, we present a relativistic treatment, including both electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. Some of these results have appeared inthe recent literature, as indicated in the endnotes, but we
have endeavored to make our discussion self-contained.
II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION
The magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnite straight wire carrying a
steady current I, in cylindrical coordinates ( s;/;z), with I
along the zaxis, is

The acceleration (in cylindrical coordinates) is

where s0is a second constant of the motion—not to be con-
fused with s(0) (physically, s0is related to the momentum
conjugate to z). Instead of using Eq. (5-[1]) to get _s, it is a lit-
tle quicker to exploit the fact that magnetic forces do nowork, so the kinetic energy is conserved:

the particle slides back and forth, periodically, between the
turning points sminandsmax. But if s(t) is periodic, so too are
_/(Eq. (7)) and _z(Eq. (8)). This means that /ðtÞandz(t)
both take the “quasiperiodic” form7
jtþfðtÞ; (14)
where jis a constant and f(t) is periodic ( fðtþTÞ¼fðtÞ,
with Tthe period of s(t)). Except for a constant azimuthal
velocity and a constant longitudinal drift, all three coordi-
nates oscillate (at the same frequency). The entire motion isa kind of wobbling deformed helix, or “helicoid.”

III. SPECIAL CASES AND NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS
A. The Helix
If the amplitude of the radial oscillations is zero, then it is
atruehelix ( _/and _zare constants):8

The trajectory is a kind of double helix, with a small coil
winding around the larger helix of Sec. III A (see Fig. 3).
C. Zero angular momentum
If‘¼0;_/¼0, and the motion is conﬁned to a plane con-
taining the zaxis, the equilibrium radius is se¼s0((Eq.
(12)), and the frequency for small oscillations is x¼a=s0
((Eq. (17)).6The trajectories are cycloid-like (see Fig. 4).
D. Numerical solutions
The general solution depends on the parameter a((Eq.
(6)), with the dimensions of speed. For numerical work, we
might as well set9
a/C171; (18)
this just deﬁnes a convenient unit for velocity. We will also
setm¼1, establishing the unit of mass. Six initial conditions
determine the trajectory:
(1)s(0) (the initial radial position); we can use this as the
unit of length, so
sð0Þ/C171 (19)
(the unit of time, then, is sð0Þ=a).
(2)/ð0Þ(the initial azimuthal angle); we might as well set
this to zero

/ð0Þ/C170 (20)
(this just establishes the orientation of the axes).
(3)z(0) (the initial value of z); again, we might as well set
this to zero
zð0Þ/C170 (21)
(that just picks the position of the origin along the z
axis).
(4) _sð0Þ(the initial radial velocity):

(5) _/ð0Þ(the initial angular velocity):
_/ð0Þ¼‘: (23)
(6) _zð0Þ(the initial longitudinal velocity):
_zð0Þ¼/C0 lns0: (24)
Thus, each trajectory is characterized by three numbers,
which we can take to be E,‘, and s0(or, if you prefer, _sð0Þ;
_/ð0Þ, and _zð0Þ). In Figs. 2–4, we illustrate each of the trajec-
tories discussed.10,11
E. Period and drift velocity
For a given trajectory, the radius is localized ( smin/C20s
/C20smax), but the zcoordinate goes from /C01 to1. The
period of the oscillations is

The drift velocity is in the direction of the current if the
charge is positive. (If it is negative, vdis the opposite to I.)
Here is the proof.5
Proof: Rewriting Dz(Eq.(27)), we get
Dz¼ðT
0_zd t: (29)

But the last term is zero, since s(t) is periodic, and the
remaining integral is positive deﬁnite (except for the trivial
case of a particle at restor with no charge), so Dzshares the
sign of a(positive if qI>0, minus if qI<0).

However, for future convenience, we write the latter as

the same form as we had without the electric ﬁeld (compare
Eq.(11))!
This implies that there is a mapping between solutions to
the original problem and solutions of the generalized system.
Say that without the electric ﬁeld, we have a solution
fsmðtÞ;/mðtÞ;zmðtÞg: (41)
From this, we can construct a solution with the electric ﬁeld
fsemðtÞ;/emðtÞ;zemðtÞg (42)
(with s0!~s0andE!~E), such thatsemðtÞ¼smðtÞ;/emðtÞ¼/mðtÞ;

then (Eq. (15))

disappears entirely, and the orbital speed ðv¼se_/) satisﬁes

as it should (the electric attraction supplying the centripetal
force). In the generic case, we can “stop the drift”—produc-ing a localized “donut” trajectory (Fig. 6)—by subtracting v
d
from vzð0Þand introducing an electric ﬁeld (Eq. (32)) with
k

If all this comes as a surprise, remember that in relativity, a
current in longitudinal motion acquires an electric charge.14
Conversely, introducing kamounts to adopting a moving ref-
erence frame. We will explore this further in Sec. V.
V. RELATIVISTIC TREATMENT
Thus far, we have treated the motion nonrelativistically.
In this section, we consider the fully relativistic case, and—for a change—we will use a Lagrangian approach. The rela-tivistic Lagrangian for a point charge in electromagneticﬁelds speciﬁed by the potentials VandAis

In addition, we have the conserved total energy16

_s2¼c2/C0c4ðmcÞ2þðp/=sÞ2þðpzþamlnðs=aÞÞ2
ðEþagmclnðs=aÞÞ2: (60)

ðEþag mclnðs=aÞÞ2:
(62)
Equation (61) can be read as a ( non-relativistic!) one-
dimensional problem in which a particle of total energy
1=2mc2rocks back and forth in the potential well Veff.

which (except for the irrelevant constant A) has the same
form as Eq. (11); again s(t) is periodic, and so too are _/and
_z. Qualitatively, the trajectories are the same as in the nonrel-
ativistic case. The situation is more complicated, when gis
nonzero (i.e., with the electric ﬁeld included), for now

and since for physically possible motion c>1, it follows
that
ifag>0;then s>ssp; (68)
ifag<0;then s<ssp: (69)
In the ﬁrst case kq>0, the electrical force is repulsive, and
the motion is unbounded; in the second case kq<0, the
electrical force is attractive, and the motion is bounded (in
s). Typical plots are shown in Fig. 7.
An illuminating way to think about these results is to
imagine starting with a combination ( k;I), and performing a
Lorentz boost along the zdirection. Because
Jl¼ðcq;JÞ¼ck
A;I
A/C18/C19
; (70)
(where Ais the cross-sectional area of the “wire”) constitutes
a four-vector, ðcqÞ2/C0J2, and hence ðckÞ2/C0I2is Lorentz
invariant. It could be time-like (or shall we call it “charge-
like”?), or spacelike (“current-like”), and in the former case“forward” ( k>0) or “backward”:17
(i) charge-like, forward ðckÞ2/C0I2>0,k>0,
(ii) charge-like, backward ðckÞ2/C0I2>0,k<0,
(iii) current-like, ðckÞ2/C0I2<0.
By suitable Lorentz boost a forward charge-like conﬁgura-
tion can be transformed to any other forward charge-like
conﬁguration ðk0;I0ÞwithðckÞ02/C0I02¼ðckÞ2/C0I2, a back-
ward charge-like conﬁguration can be transformed into any
other backward charge-like conﬁguration with ðckÞ02/C0I02
¼ðckÞ2/C0I2, and with a boost plus a rotation a current-like
conﬁguration can be transformed into any other current-like
conﬁguration with ðckÞ02/C0I02¼ðckÞ2/C0I2. Therefore, thereare really just three distinct r /C19egimes here, and if we can ﬁnd
the trajectories for the “seed” conﬁgurations:
(i) I¼0,kq>0,
(ii) I¼0,kq<0,
(iii) k¼0,I6¼0,
we can construct the trajectory for anyðk;IÞby Lorentz
transformation. These are the r /C19egimes illustrated in Fig. 7: (i)
runaway repulsion to s¼1 , (ii) attraction to the axis, and
(iii) quasi-oscillatory motion with bounded s.

sign of the current and render apositive, while carrying one possible tra-

10.1119/5.0077042 for the Mathematica code used to create the ﬁgures.
12In Case C ( ‘¼0) these integrals can be evaluated in closed form: T¼
2ps0
aI0ðv=aÞ;vd¼vI1ðv=aÞ
I0ðv=aÞ;where Inis the modiﬁed Bessel function of order n,
andvis the (constant) speed of the charge. These results were obtained by Ess /C19en
and Nordmark (Ref. 5), but with unfortunate typos (their Eqs. (73) and (74));
they were derived in a different way by Asadi-Zeydabadi and Zaidins (Ref. 6).
13We might as well use ~s0as the zero for electric potential. You can use a
different reference point if you like: the equations will be a little more
cumbersome, but the result is the same.

17The “light-like” case ( ðckÞ2/C0I2¼0) is qualitatively similar, with the
exception of the trivial limit k¼0,I¼0, for which the trajectory is of
course a straight line, with constant velocity.
