An alternative approach to the n-dimensional small oscillations problem is presented. This method
is based on the ﬁnding of nnew independent constants of motion to get the neigenfrequencies and
thennormal coordinates of the problem. These constants of motion exist and may be explicitly
constructed for any small oscillations problem. Three examples are presented. One of them
involves solving a ﬁve-dimensional small oscillations problem whose solution is usually obtained
by ﬁnding the roots of a quintic algebraic equation. The approach constructed here is especiallysuited to deal with high-dimensional problems. Applications to small oscillations as well as to
high-degree algebraic equation solutions are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The usual way to solve the small oscillations problem is
discussed in many undergraduate and graduate classicalmechanics textbooks such as Refs. 1–3that present at length
the customary approach as well as solved problems.
Symmetries and conservation laws play a fundamental
role in physics. Noether’s theorem establishes a relationbetween the symmetries of a physical system and its dynami-cally conserved physical quantities. Examples of the impor-
tance of conservation laws in physics are the conservation of
energy for Lagrangians invariant under time translations,momentum conservation for Lagrangians invariant under
space translations, and angular momentum conservation for
Lagrangians invariant under rotation (such as all of the cen-tral force problems). In a similar fashion, the examples pre-
sented in this work are solved by using new conservation
laws obtained directly from the equations of motion.
In general, a small oscillations problem is stated in terms
of two known n/C2nsymmetrical regular numerical matrices:
the kinetic energy matrix, Tand the potential energy matrix,
V. The problem consists in solving the coupled system,
T€qðtÞþVqðtÞ¼0( 1 )
for an n-dimensional vector qðtÞ. The usual solution is
obtained by using the ansatz for a speciﬁc normal mode
qðtÞ¼Qe
ixt(2)
and then solving the algebraic eigenproblem
/C0x2TþV ðÞ Q¼0( 3 )
for the neigenfrequencies xand the nnormal coordinates Q.
II. THE NEW METHOD TO SOLVE THE SMALL
OSCILLATIONS PROBLEM
The novelty of the method presented here is the construc-
tion and use of n new constants of motion that exist for any
such problem. For simplicity, I have assumed that the matrix
Thas an inverse T/C01(which is the case in almost all classi-
cal mechanics studies), and there is no degeneracy, i.e., thefrequencies are all different. Taking the scalar product of Eq.
(1)with _q†to get
_q†T€qþ_q†Vq¼0; (4)
which implies that the Hamiltonian H,
Hðq;_qÞ¼1
2_q†T_qþq†Vq/C0/C1
; (5)
is a constant of motion due to the fact that both matrices T
andVare symmetric. Now take the scalar product of Eq. (1)
with _q†VT/C01,
_q†VT/C01T€qþVq ðÞ ¼0; (6)
which implies that the following “Hamiltonian”:
H2ðq;_qÞ¼1
2_q†V_qþq†VT/C01Vq/C0/C1
(7)
is a constant of motion, because both matrices Vand
ðVT/C01VÞare symmetric. Now, in turn, take the scalar prod-
ucts of Eq. (1)with _q†ðVT/C01Þ2;_q†ðVT/C01Þ3or, in general,
with _q†ðVT/C01Þj, where ðVT/C01Þjis the jth power of the
matrix ðVT/C01Þto get
_q†VT/C01 ðÞjTqþ_q†VT/C01 ðÞjVq¼0: (8)
All the matrices appearing in Eq. (8)are also symmetric and,
therefore,
Hiðq;_qÞ¼1
2_q†VT/C01 ðÞði/C01ÞT_qþq†VT/C01 ðÞði/C01ÞVq/C16/C17

2_q†TT/C01VðÞði/C01Þ_qþq†VT/C01VðÞði/C01Þq/C16/C17
(9)
are constants of motion for any value of i. Nevertheless, only
nof them are independent, because any matrix Msatisﬁes
its own characteristic equation.
Let us now take a slight detour. Consider the eigenvalue
problem for the square ( nbyn) matrix M,
579 Am. J. Phys. 91(8), August 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 579 04 October 2023 22:54:31
Mv¼kv; (10)
or
ðM/C0kIÞv¼0; (11)
whereIis the (square) identity matrix in ndimensions. It is
clear that v¼0always solves this equation which is, of
course, a trivial statement. In order to have non-trivial
solutions, one must require that the former solution be
non-unique, i.e., impose that the determinant of the matrix
ðM/C0kIÞvanishes
detðM/C0kIÞ¼0; (12)
which may be written as
PðkÞ/C17m0knþm1kn/C01þ/C1/C1/C1þ mn/C01kþmn¼0:(13)
The polynomial PðkÞis called the characteristic polynomial
of theMmatrix, and Eq. (13) is called the characteristic
equation for the matrix M.4The coefﬁcients miare
completely constructed in terms of the so-called invariantsof the matrix Msuch as its trace and its determinant. The
solutions for kare called eigenvalues of the matrix M, and
the corresponding solutions for the vector vare called eigen-
vectors of the matrix M.
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem
5,6states that any square
matrixMsatisﬁes its own characteristic equation, i.e.,
m0Mnþm1Mn/C01þ/C1/C1/C1þ mn/C01MþmnI¼O;(14)
whereOis the square ( nbyn) zero matrix.
Therefore, all powers of the M, which are equal to or
higher than n, may be expressed as a linear combination of
the powers of the matrix M, which are equal to or lower
than n– 1 by using Eq. (14) or the same equation multiplied
byMor higher powers of M. Hence, only nof the Hi’s are
independent.
We come back to the main road. It is straightforward
to realize that H1is the usual Hamiltonian H(written in
terms of the velocities instead of momenta) while all the
other “Hamiltonians” Hi,w i t h i6¼1, were, until now,
unknown as conserved quantities, to the best of my
knowledge.
The interpretation of the new conserved quantities may be
easily seen in terms of the eigenfrequencies xkand the nor-
mal coordinates Qk.
Each normal mode ksatisﬁes the equation of motion
€Qkþxk2Qk¼0ðno sum over kÞ (15)
and has a conserved energy Ekgiven by
EkðQk;_QkÞ¼1
2_Qk2þxk2Qk2/C0/C1
ðno sum over kÞ:
(16)
Note that, when using the normal modes’ coordinates
and velocities, the kinetic energy matrix Tnormal is equal
to the identity matrix Iand the potential energy matrix
Vnormal is diagonal, and its entry in the kthposition is
equal to xk2.Therefore, the Hi’s may be written in terms of the Ek’s as
Hi¼Xk¼n
k¼1ðxk2Þði/C01ÞEk
¼Xk¼n
k¼11
2ðxk2Þði/C01Þ_Qk2þxk2Qk2/C0/C1
; (17)
which is equivalent, considering the remark just after Eq.
(16)to state that
H1¼1
2_Q†Tnormal_QþQ†Vnormal Q/C16/C17
; (18)
H2¼1
2_Q†Vnormal_QþQ†Vnormal2Q/C16/C17
; (19)
or, in general,
Hi¼1
2_Q†Vnormali/C01_QþQ†VnormaliQ/C16/C17
; (20)
where the superscript indicates powers of the matrix and
Vnormal0¼Ið¼TnormalÞ.
Then one can write
Hi¼Xk¼n

whereWis the following matrix:

which depends on the (squares of the) eigenfrequencies x

only.
Both the determinant det ðWÞand the inverse W/C01of this
kind of matrix are known for any dimension n(see, for
instance, Ref. 7). Even if one were not aware of this fact,
detðWÞandW/C01may be easily computed by using alge-
braic manipulation software, such as MATHEMATICA (used in
this article), MAPLE ,o r MATLAB . Matrices like the one exhib-
ited in Eq. (22)are called Vandermonde matrices.
Solving Eq. (17)forEkone gets

Therefore, one must determine nðnþ1Þunknowns: n2
coefﬁcients of the (up to now, unknown) transformation

and the neigenfrequencies xk2.
580 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 8, August 2023 Sergio A. Hojman 580 04 October 2023 22:54:31
One, of course, has
_Qk¼Xl¼n
l¼1Nkl_ql; (25)
that is, the transformation matrix Nis the same for coordi-
nates and velocities.
Let us rewrite Eq. (23)as
1
2_Qk2þxk2Qk2/C0/C1
¼Xi¼n
i¼1ðW/C01ÞkiHi: (26)
The left-hand side of Eq. (26) is written in terms of the
new coordinates Qand velocities _Qand the unknown
(squared) frequencies xk2, while the right-hand side of Eq.
(26) is written in terms of the original coordinates qand
velocities _qand the unknown (squared) frequencies xk2.
The right hand side of Eq. (26) contains terms of coordi-
nates squared ðqiÞ2, products of coordinates qiqj,f o r i6¼j,
velocities squared ð_qiÞ2, and products of velocities _qi_qj, for
i6¼j.
Consider Eq. (26)written for k¼1a s

2_Q12þx12Q12/C0/C1
¼Xi¼n
i¼1ðW/C01Þ1iHi: (27)
To simplify matters, let us write
Q1¼ﬃﬃﬃ
2pXi¼n
i¼1aiqi (28)
and
_Q1¼ﬃﬃﬃ
2pXi¼n
i¼1ai_qi; (29)
so that the left-hand side of Eq. (27)is now written as
1
2_Q12þx12Q12/C0/C1
¼Xi;j¼n
i;j¼1aiaj_qi_qjþx2
1Xi;j¼n
i;j¼1aiajqiqj:(30)
Therefore, computing the right hand side of Eq. (27), the
ratios of the coefﬁcients of ðqiÞ2to those of ð_qiÞ2must be all
equal to x12for all iand, at the same time, they must be
equal to the ratio of the coefﬁcients of qiqjto those of _qi_qj
for all i6¼j.
We get then nðnþ1Þ=2 equations for k¼1, so the total
number of equations considering all kisn2ðnþ1Þ=2. Let us
combine those equations using one from each Ei(orxi2)t o
getðnðnþ1Þ=2Þnsystems of equations, which may be used
to solve for nof the unknowns. One has, in general, much
more than enough equations to solve for the nunknowns.
For n¼2, one gets 32¼9 systems of equations, and for
n¼4, the number of systems of equations is 104, for
instance. Not all the systems of equations obtained are regu-
lar, i.e., not all of them have a unique solution, because someof the equations in those systems are not independent. Thesystems to solve must be chosen so that they will be regular,
i.e., constructed from equations that are linearly independent.
For details, see the two-dimensional example below.Proceed by writing nindependent equations, by using Eqs.
(26) as described above (details in the examples section) and
solve for all of the x
2
k’s.
Once (the square of) the neigenfrequencies x2
kare known,
go back to Eq. (27) and get the absolute values of aias the
square roots of the coefﬁcients of _q2
i. The relative signs of the
different aj’s are obtained from the signs of the products _qi_qj
fori6¼j.O n em a ya l w a y sc h o o s et h e a1coefﬁcient (or the
ﬁrst nonvanishing coefﬁcient, for some _q2
i) to be positive,
because the Qi’s are deﬁned up to a multiplicative constant.
Fork6¼1, proceed exactly in the same way to solve the prob-
lem completely. I apply this new method in Secs. IIIandIV.
III. TWO-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLE
Consider the two-dimensional system of the ﬁgure below
(Fig. 1), which shows a system of two bodies with the same
mass mand three springs with elastic constants k1,k2, and k1
(from left to right), which is arranged so that each of the
springs is at its relaxed length. The coordinates of both bod-ies are labeled q
1andq2(from left to right) and are measured
as the displacements to the right with respect to the position
where each of the springs is at its relaxed length. TheLagrangian for the problem is

for right-pointing arrows and negative for left-pointing arrows) represent the
displacement of both masses with respect to their equilibrium positions.Note that t

Plug these results back in the expressions for the Ej(52),
(53), and (54). The square root of the coefﬁcients of _qi2inEj
is the absolute value of the coefﬁcient of qiin the expression
forQj, and the relative signs are obtained by inspection of
the signs of _qi_qj. Because Qjis deﬁned up to a multiplicative
constant, one may choose any of the coefﬁcients to be posi-tive and the rest are then completely determined.
In this example, we get
Q
1¼q1/C03q2/C03q3;
Q2¼q1/C02q2/C02q3;
and
Q3¼1
2ðq1/C03q2/C02q3Þ; (57)
which solves the problem, completely, by using this new
method.
V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
I have presented a new way to solve the n-dimensional
small oscillations’ problems in classical mechanics, which isbased on the existence and the application of nindependent
constants of motion. Both the eigenfrequencies and the nor-mal coordinates are obtained based on these new constants,which exist and may be constructed explicitly for any suchproblem. It is interesting to note that all of these n
Hamiltonians H
iare in involution, and therefore, the system
is integrable in the Liouville sense. The involution propertyis valid for any of the Poisson brackets, which may bedeﬁned starting from any one of them (or from theLagrangians L
iassociated with each of the Hamiltonians Hi).
The method to solve the problem deﬁnes a constructive
algorithm in the sense that the Vandermonde matrices, theirdeterminants, and their inverses are known from the onset
for any dimension n, and the Hamiltonians Himay be com-
puted once the matrices TandVare given.
The third example (presented in the supplementary mate-
rial8) provides a solution to a ﬁve-dimensional small oscilla-
tions problem, which usually involves ﬁnding the roots of a
quintic equation. This problem was completely solved using
this new method, employing the same software and gettingthe roots to the quintic equation in the process.
This result hints that there may be new paths to solve (at
least in some cases) high-degree algebraic equations by
using this method and ﬁnd possible applications in electriccircuits, ﬂuid dynamics, sound, seismic, electromagnetic and
gravitational waves, waves in solids, quantum mechanics,
and ﬁeld theory, for instance.
The results presented here may prove to be especially use-
ful for n/C215.
The algorithm may be constructed by means of a simple
enough code, and there is only one instance where an alge-
braic system of equations needs to be solved.
