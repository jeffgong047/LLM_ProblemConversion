Ellipsometry is an optical analysis technique that is useful for characterizing the physical properties
of a thin-ﬁlm system. Light reﬂected from a sample surface undergoes a change in polarization dueto phase delay and anisotropic reﬂection. This enables one to perform non-destructive measurements
of ﬁlm thickness, surface roughness, refractive index, and other optical constants. Ellipsometric
techniques are particularly convenient for characterizing coatings or ﬁlms in the semiconductor and
optics industries. However, these techniques may be inaccessible to undergraduate students and
educators due to the prohibitive cost of ellipsometers and similar instrumentation. In response to thisroadblock, we describe the construction of a simple, inexpensive, manually operated, rotating
analyzer ellipsometer (RAE). Required materials include a laser pointer, polarizing ﬁlm,
photometric detector, and a 3D-printed opto-mechanical framework, which are all readily accessibleat most institutions. The instrument’s performance was evaluated by comparing thickness
measurements of tetraethyl orthosilicate ﬁlms to those determined by a commercially available
reﬂectometer. An average ﬁlm thickness difference of 0.77% was measured using the twoinstruments.

I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing availability of new technology often
prompts an inﬂux of low-cost pedagogical supports for edu-cators. A trend in recent years is the acquisition of 3D print-ers by schools, universities, and libraries, allowing forcustom in-house manufacturing of 3D models and scientiﬁcinstrumentation, while providing opportunities for studentsto develop CAD skills. The ability to produce 3D modelsquickly and inexpensively as learning aids has proven usefulin subjects such as anatomy, geoscience, mathematics, pale-ontology, chemistry, and physics.
1The last two ﬁelds are
especially enriched by the construction of instruments ofmoderate complexity. Examples from the Journal of
Chemical Education include a colorimeter,2spectrophotome-
ter,3and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes.4Physics examples
include modular opto-mechanical frameworks, such as forthelCube,5and other custom components inspired by com-
mercial alternatives.6,7However, depending on the quality of
the 3D printer, factors such as print material, dimensionaltolerance, and build volume may limit component designand function. Therefore, any effort to construct an instrument
using 3D-printed components will require balancing cost and
complexity with measurement precision and accuracy.
One application that is relatively underdeveloped by the
3D-printing and Open Education communities is thin-ﬁlmanalysis, which is important for the semiconductor and opti-cal coating industries. Ellipsometry is a technique that usesstraightforward instrument design, construction, and opera-tion to determine the properties of a thin ﬁlm. It resolvessample properties by measuring the change in light polariza-tion following reﬂection from the thin-ﬁlm. One of the leastcomplex ellipsometer designs is the rotating analyzer conﬁg-uration shown in Fig. 1.
A rotating analyzer ellipsometer (RAE) consists of ﬁve
components: light source, polarizer, sample, analyzer (arotatable polarizer), and photometric detector. When linearlypolarized light is reﬂected from a sample surface, it becomeselliptically polarized. The reﬂected light is directed throughan analyzer, and the intensity is measured by a photometricdetector at several analyzer angles. The elliptical polariza-
tion state and the change in polarization can be directlyrelated to the optical properties of the sample system.
This work presents an RAE constructed using 3D-printed
opto-mechanics and readily available optical components,making it suitable for undergraduate or graduate research at asigniﬁcantly lower cost than a commercial instrument. Arobust model of a three-media sample system was developedin an accessible format, Microsoft Excel. This model deter-
mines thin-ﬁlm thickness and refractive index by regression
ﬁtting to the experimental measurements. The accuracy andprecision of the instrument was characterized throughrepeated measurements of ﬁve samples of polished tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) ﬁlms on silicon substrates. TEOS iscommonly used as a dielectric layer in integrated circuit devi-ces. Comparison of TEOS ﬁlm thickness to measurementsfrom a commercial instrument revealed an average differenceof 0.77%, and the average variability in repeat measurementswas found to be 0.03%. This performance is attained at asmall fraction of the cost of a commercial instrument.
II. ELLIPSOMETRIC THEORY
This section presents the theoretical principles of the ellip-
sometric technique with a focus on rotating analyzer ellips-ometry as adapted from Refs. 8and9.
Two factors contribute to the polarization change of light
reﬂected from a thin-ﬁlm system: (1) the phase shift causedby interference of multiple internal reﬂections and (2) theanisotropic reﬂectivity of parallel ( p) and perpendicular ( r)
polarization components relative to the plane of incidence.Consider the overall reﬂection of light from a system consist-ing of an ambient medium, a ﬂat and uniform thin ﬁlm of
thickness d, and a substrate of semi-inﬁnite depth, as illus-
trated in Fig. 2. The incident and refracted angles of light
through the system, governed by Snell’s law, are representedbyh
0,h1, and h2. Multiple internal reﬂections inside the thin
ﬁlm yield parallel outgoing rays such as Er1andEr2with
phase differences arising from different path lengths throughthe system.

The interference of these rays is governed by the ﬁlm

Additionally, as reﬂectivity of the parallel and perpendicular
polarization components is typically unequal, two sets of
reﬂection coefﬁcients, denoted by superscripts pand r,
respectively, are required for each interface. Combining theaforementioned factors through summation of an inﬁnite
geometric series yields the total complex reﬂection coefﬁ-

The concept diagram in Fig. 4summarizes how an RAE is
used to determine sample properties. Linearly polarized light
is reﬂected from the sample surface and passes through ananalyzer. The resultant intensity is measured at three or fourdistinct analyzer angles relative to the plane of incidence.These measurements directly interrogate the elliptical polari-zation state of the reﬂected light described by WandDvia
the Stokes parameters S
0,S1, and S2. Together, WandDare
then ﬁtted to a mathematical model of the sample system toextract useful parameters such as ﬁlm thickness.
It is worth reiterating that Eqs. (1)–(5) , which relate to
sample parameters b,q, and P, are tied to the assumptions ofa speciﬁc model: a three-media optical system with an ambient
medium, a single ﬂat and uniform thin ﬁlm, and a substrate
with semi-inﬁnite depth. For variations on this model, such as
multi-layer ﬁlms, one could use the transfer-matrix method todetermine a solution for the complex total reﬂection coefﬁcient
P.
12Similarly, Eqs. (7)–(16) , which relate to the measured
parameters Iða2Þ;W,a n dD, are speciﬁc to an RAE conﬁgura-
tion. Other instrument conﬁgurations require the use of Jones
or Mueller calculus to determine the relationship between mea-
sured intensity and ellipsometric parameters.
III. DATA PROCESSING AND MODELING
Using the theory presented above, one can build a predictive
model of WandDusing sample media complex refractive
indices ( ~n0;~n1,a n d ~n2), ﬁlm thickness ( d), angles of incidence
(h0), and incident wavelength ( k). Then, sample parameters,
such as ﬁlm thickness and refractive index, can be iterativelydetermined by regression ﬁtting of model ellipsometric param-
eters to the experimentally obtained ones. A best-ﬁt solution
can be obtained when the sum of normalized squared errorsbetween model and experiment parameters is minimized.
Due to the periodic nature of light interference in a thin ﬁlm,
multiple best-ﬁt ﬁlm thickness solutions may exist for a single
set of instrument parameters. To construct a model that is char-acteristic of a single ﬁlm thickness, photometric measurements
using a monochromatic laser can be collected through a range
of angles of incidence. Predicting WandDas a function of
angle of incidence produces model plots that are highly sens itive
to ﬁlm thickness. Figure 5illustrates this for a silicon substrate
coated with a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) thin ﬁlm. As ﬁlmthickness increases through the set d¼f6000;10 500 ;15 000 g
A˚, plots of WandDexhibit characteristic peak formation and
shifts, especially at angles of incidence between 25
/C14and 75/C14.
Another sample parameter that could be iteratively deter-
mined with this technique is the thin-ﬁlm’s refractive index.
Figure 6illustrates the sensitivity of the ellipsometric param-
eters for a TEOS-coated silicon sample to small changes inthe ﬁlm’s refractive index. Characteristic features of the plot
shift noticeably, especially at greater angles of incidence.
Both Figs. 5and6are speciﬁc to a three-media optical
system (as in Fig. 2) consisting of ambient air and TEOS

coated silicon wafers, assuming a complex refractive index
of the substrate ~n2¼3:844þi0:016 and incident wave-
length k¼653 nm. Although this model accurately predicts
experimental data from cleaned and polished samples, it is
ill-equipped to account for surface artifacts.
The Excel calculator used in this work has two core func-
tions. First is the calculation of experimental ellipsometric
parameters from RAE photometric measurements.Measurements with three or four analyzer angles according to
Eqs. (14)–(16) can be accommodated. The second function of
the calculator is the iteration of ﬁt parameters dand/or ~n
1
within user-deﬁned ranges to produce WandDvalues that best
ﬁt the experiment data. Although both ﬁt parameters can be
changed simultaneously, knowing one to a high degree of cer-tainty will increase the reliability of the model to determine the
other. The ﬁtting is done over several sets of ellipsometric
parameters, each at a ﬁxed angle of incidence, using the“Solver” add-on. Because of this, optimum sampling occurs
where there is greatest dynamic range for WandD. Modeling
also requires the incident wavelength ( k) and complex refrac-
tive indices for the ambient ( ~n
0) and substrate ( ~n2) media to be
known.While it may beneﬁt students to build the model and ﬁt-
ting routine with a programming language such as PYTHON ,
we leave that as an optional exercise for the reader. Instead,we offer an open access resource that can be used as-is and
does not require programming skills.
13We recognize that
Microsoft Excel is not the most convenient program withwhich to execute these functions, but it is familiar to studentsand widely accessible throughout academia.
IV. THE 3D-PRINTED INSTRUMENT
Data collection using the 3D-printed RAE is carried out
by varying two key instrumental parameters: the angle ofincidence h
0and the analyzer azimuth a2. Typically, one
measures light intensity at three or four analyzer azimuth
angles before making an incremental change in the angle of
incidence. High-quality data collection requires that the rele-vant physical components be robust, precise, and easily oper-ated. To achieve this, an opto-mechanical framework was
designed and 3D printed. All ﬁles relevant to this work,
including the Excel calculator, stereo-lithographic ﬁles, 3Dmodels, and assembly instructions for the framework, arefreely available in the supplementary material and Github.
13
Figures 7–9illustrate the primary opto-mechanical com-
ponents of the RAE. A goniometer with one-degree gradua-
tions (Fig. 7) allows for angle of incidence adjustment
between 10/C14and 85/C14. In practice, angles of incidence
between 15/C14and 65/C14are preferred to prevent collision of
optical components and elongation of the incident light
beam across the sample surface. The goniometer guides a
pair of 107 mm long pivoting arms on which are mountedthe components from Fig. 1, including the rotating polarizer
and analyzer. A worm-driven gear with 42:1 ratio (Fig. 8)
can precisely rotate an internally mounted polarizing ﬁlm
(0:5i n:diameter). The polarizer and analyzer require cali-
bration so that the transmission axis of the polarizing ﬁlm ismeasured relative to the plane of incidence. Samples of vary-ing depth are accommodated with a linearly translating verti-
cal sample mount (Fig. 9).
The speciﬁc light source and detector can vary depending
on the availability of parts, desired function, and budget.Custom mounts may be designed to accommodate this

variety of options. Figure 10shows the assembled instrument
mounted on an optical table. The light source used was an
inexpensive 5 mW ;653 nm diode laser powered with
5VDC. Monitoring the output power and spectrum of thislaser diode revealed no signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in intensity orpeak wavelength. A Vernier “Light Sensor” with Go!Link
interface was chosen for the detector, because it is readily
available, relatively low-cost, simple to use, robust, and suf-ﬁciently accurate for this purpose. However, other lessexpensive detectors may be suitable such as a photodiodeconnected to an Arduino or even a photoresistor connected
to an ohmmeter. The opto-mechanical parts in Fig. 10were
printed using approximately 350-g of polylactic acid (PLA)ﬁlament and a Creality Ender-3 printer. A table of instrumentcomponent costs is included in the Appendix (Table II).
V. EXPERIMENT
To evaluate the 3D-printed RAE and Excel calculator,
comparative thickness determinations of polished TEOSﬁlms on ﬁve silicon wafer substrates were made using acommercially available MProbe20 Vis reﬂectometer andTFCompanion software from SemiconSoft. These waferswere provided by a collaborating research group who
obtained standard 15 000 A ˚TEOS ﬁlms from industry part-
ners. The collaborating group then used industry-standard
polishing equipment to reduce the ﬁlm thickness to a rangeofd¼½5000 ;15 000 /C138A˚. The TEOS ﬁlms are known to
h a v ear e f r a c t i v ei n d e x ~n
1¼1:483 at the incident wave-
length k¼653 nm. The complex refractive index for the
silicon substrate at this wavelength is tabulated as
~n2¼3:844þi0:016.
Using the reﬂectometer and the standard operating proce-
dure from our collaborating group, the TEOS thickness ofeach sample was determined in a 3 /C23 grid pattern across
the sample surface to characterize ﬁlm thickness homogene-
ity. Additionally, nine repeated ﬁlm thickness determinations
were made at the approximate center to characterize the pre-cision of the instrument.
Using the 3D-printed RAE, photometric measurements were
collected at the approximate center of each sample as the angleof incidence h

measurements. The angle of incidence sampling range was cho-
sen as it ﬁt within the range of the instrument’s goniometer and
was associated with signiﬁcant characteristic changes in Wand
D, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The photometric measurements from
each trial were used with Eqs. (14)and(16)to determine Wand
Dat each angle of incidence. The Excel calculator was then
used to determine ﬁlm thickness by ﬁtting the model to these
experimental data. The quality of the model ﬁt was evaluated bythe standard error across all angles of incidence.
VI. DISCUSSION
Table Isummarizes the experimental results for all TEOS
samples as determined by the reﬂectometer and the RAE.The reﬂectometer measurements reveal signiﬁcant variations
in thickness across the surface of the polished samples
(TEOS B-E) but signiﬁcantly less variation for the nine
repeated center measurements. This variation across the sur-
face is expected for polished samples as a result of imperfectplanarization process conditions.
14TEOS ﬁlm thickness
measurements with the 3D-printed RAE are shown to be
more precise compared to the center measurements from the
MProbe20 with consistently smaller standard deviations
across all samples. The difference in thickness measurementsbetween instruments ranged from 0.08% to 2.10% with an
average of 0.77%. The differences were determined to be
statistically signiﬁcant to 95% conﬁdence by t-test for allsamples except TEOS B. Fitting the model to the 3D-printed
RAE data yielded standard errors of less than 3
/C14forWand
less than 5/C14forDacross all ﬁve samples. Figure 11illus-
trates model curves ﬁt to the average experimental parame-
ters determined for TEOS A from three replicate trials.
Operationally, it is difﬁcult to analyze the exact same area of
the sample surface on both instruments. The spot size of the
MProbe20 Vis was signiﬁcantly smaller and static (due to a ﬁxed
0/C14angle of incidence), while the spot size of the RAE was larger
and elongated with more obtuse angles of incidence. This differ-
ence in spot size means that although both measurements were
collected in approximately the center of the sample, each instru-
ment may have been sampling a different area, and a differently
sized area, of the surface. The spot size and the TEOS thicknessinhomogeneity across the polished sample surf aces are likely to
be the largest sources of random difference between the two mea-
surements. However, the consistently low RAE experimentalthicknesses are indicative of a relatively small systematic differ-
ence, which is likely due to inherent differences in the ellipsome-
try and reﬂectometry techniques. Ellipsometry measures a change
in phase through D,w h i c hi ss e n s i t i v et ov e r yt h i nﬁ l m s .
Reﬂectometry measures reﬂected intensity without regard forphase. Whereas the RAE uses a ﬁxed wavelength of 653 nm and
multiple angles of incidence, the MProbe20 measures the reﬂec-
tance across the spectrum 400–1000 nm at a ﬁxed angle ofincidence to determine the ﬁlm thickness. In addition, the two
techniques have different sensitivities to surface ﬁlms that mightbe present as residue from the cleaning and polishing procedure.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf optical compo-
nents, the RAE can be built for less than $200. If instead one
wanted to construct a comparable ellipsometer without 3D-printing, the lack of components needed for the goniometer
from vendors, such as ThorLabs or McMaster-Carr, would
necessitate a more complicated design. The use of wave-length instead of angle of incidence as an experimental
parameter could simplify the design but would require
more expensive components (e.g., a spectrometer) and analternate analysis. In comparison, the MProbe20 Vis with
TFCompanion software has a cost of $13 000. Overall, the
3D-printed RAE instrument and Excel calculator describedhere strike a reasonable balance of instrument complexity,
cost, and measurement quality that makes thin-ﬁlm measure-
ments accessible to undergraduate as well as graduate studentresearchers. Interesting applications include analysis of oxide
and nitride ﬁlms used in the passivation of semiconductors for
solar cells and for the production of anti-reﬂective or otherTable I. Experimental results and statistical evaluation. “*”indicates statistically equivalent measurements between instruments using a t-tes t at 95% conﬁ-

Fig. 11. Plot of model ellipsometric parameters that have been ﬁt to the
experimental parameters of TEOS sample A as measured with the RAE.
Black lines and solid and dashed, indicate the model ﬁt of DandW, respec-
tively. Gray lines indicate the 95% conﬁdence interval for the model based
on the standard error of the ﬁt. Data points, circles and squares, indicate the
average of three sets of measurements. Error bars on data points are too
small to be distinguished.

optical coatings. Standards of these ﬁlms can be obtained
through vendors such as VLSI Standards.15Future develop-
ment considerations for students may include motorized
components for automated sample analysis, incorporation ofspectroscopic elements for spectral analysis, a precision trans-
lating sample stage for surface mapping, and adaptation of the
Excel calculator for multi-ﬁlm modeling.
12Additionally, an
exercise for students could be to reconstruct the three-media
optical model ﬁtting routine using a more convenient pro-
gramming language such as Python. Finally, the 3D-printedcomponents may be adapted for other experiments by those
with CAD or 3D design skills.
