Velocity reciprocity means that the velocity of an inertial frame Swith respect to another inertial
reference frame S0is the opposite of the velocity of S0with respect to S. While velocity reciprocity
holds true for both the Lorentz and Galilean transformations, it need not be true in general, and it is
a widely held misconception that velocity reciprocity is a sole consequence of the relativity of
motion principle. The situation is, in fact, much more complicated, and it is the purpose of this
paper to call attention to and hopefully help to rectify the matter regarding the misconception. We
show that if we ascribe universal and unrestricted validity to the relativity of motion principle, thenvelocity reciprocity cannot possibly follow only from the relativity principle, and we detail the
additional assumptions that must be made in order for velocity reciprocity to hold.

I. INTRODUCTION
The relativity principle demands the equivalence of all
inertial frames as far as the laws of physics are concerned, so
that no experiment can give privileged status to any one ofthem over any other regarding natural law. This is essentially
Poincar /C19e’s formulation of the principle, which, in his own
words, reads: “the relativity of motion principle … [is]…that principle according to which the laws of physical phe-
nomena should be the same, whether for an observer ﬁxed,
or for an observer carried along in a uniform movement oftranslation, so that we have not and could not have any
means of discerning whether or not we are carried along in
such a motion.”

There is a long-standing and widespread misconception
among many physicists concerning the relativity principle
and one of its inference velocity reciprocity . In many cases,
including those of the Lorentz and Galilean transformations,velocity reciprocity just amounts to the fact that the inverse
transformation relating a given inertial system Sto another
one S
0is always obtained from the direct transformation
from StoS0simply by replacing the velocity of S0relative to
Sby its negative. However, this need not always be the case,
and it is a misconception that velocity reciprocity is a conse-quence only of the relativity principle. In other words, many
of us incorrectly assume that the relativity principle always
requires that if one is moving relative to someone else with
velocity v, then that other person will be perceived as mov-
ing with velocity /C0vby the ﬁrst person. This misconception
comes from an improper understanding of the relativity prin-ciple and lack of appreciation of its universality. It has not
only found its way into many monographs and articles on
special relativity, including some recent ones in this jour-nal,
2,3but can also be found in some current introductory
physics textbooks.4,5In view of the central role that the rela-
tivity of motion principle plays in physics, we consider aclariﬁcation of the matter to be of some importance.
While velocity reciprocity is easily seen to be true for the
Galilean and Lorentz transformations, we shall show that it
does not always hold true for all situations and for all kine-matics. If velocity reciprocity were a direct consequence
only of the relativity principle, then, assuming universal
validity of the relativity principle, velocity reciprocity wouldalways have to be true. However, velocity reciprocity neednot always be true, even in relativistic theories where the rel-
ativity principle is assumed to hold. Thus, it cannot possiblyfollow solely from the relativity of motion. This is the main
result of this paper. In short, it amounts to whether or not we
follow Poincar /C19e in attributing absolute and universal validity
to the relativity of motion principle as “a general law of
nature …and admit it without restriction.”
6Poincar /C19e seems
to have been the ﬁrst person ever to have insisted on its unre-
stricted and universal validity.1,6–8The misconception con-
cerning velocity reciprocity can, thus, perhaps, at least in
part, be linked to neglect and lack of appreciation of
Poincar /C19e’s important contributions to the relativity principle
and to the theory of relativity.9
Concerning the issue of the validity of velocity reciproc-
ity, it is, in fact, much more complicated than most of us
seem to be aware, and in Sec. III, we detail the additional
assumptions, in addition the relativity principle, that are nec-
essary in order for velocity reciprocity to be true. Theseinclude assumptions like causality, and spatial isotropy and
homogeneity in space-time. Homogeneity of space-time
means that all points are treated equally, and spatial isotropy
means there are no preferred directions in space.
Homogeneity implies translational invariance in spaces,which admits translations, from which one can show that the
equations describing the transformation between two inertial
observers must be linear.

This article is by no means the ﬁrst to call attention to
confusion and misunderstanding surrounding velocity reci-
procity and the relativity principle. We point out the articleby Berzi and Gorini,12which was also written with the
explicit intent of calling attention to and rectifying the mat-
ter regarding the misconception that velocity reciprocity is
“a consequence of the principle of relativity alone.”12Their
article was followed by another paper a few years later byLevy-Leblond, again directed toward a clariﬁcation of the
issue.13Awareness of the problem goes back much further.
In an Annalen der Physik paper published in 1911, Frank
and Rothe described a kinematics respecting the relativity
principle but where velocity reciprocity does not hold.15
Their paper forms the basis for Lalan’s 1937 classiﬁcation
of all possible two-dimensional linear kinematics compati-
ble with the relativity principle.14F o rm a n yo ft h ek i n e m a t -

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section IIgives
some examples of false assertions in the scientiﬁc literaturebased on improper understanding of the relativity principle
and its relation to velocity reciprocity. These include some
treatments of special relativity wherein authors ﬁnd it conve-nient to assume velocity reciprocity solely as a consequenceof the relativity principle. Section IIIcontains the main result
of this paper. We show that velocity reciprocity cannot be a
consequence only of the relativity principle, if the relativity
principle is to have universal validity. This section also con-tains a precise statement of the velocity reciprocity theoremalong with the assumptions involved in establishing it. InSec. IV, we recall some derivations of the Lorentz transfor-
mations from ﬁrst principles that are found in the literature
without invoking the assumption of the constancy of thevelocity of light. Approaches to obtaining the linear (or vec-tor space) structure of space-time, including those usinghomogeneity, are brieﬂy discussed. We give a counterexam-ple to the assertion that a one-to-one mapping of space-time
must, up to a translation, be a linear mapping.
16We conclude
in Sec. Vwith some historical remarks dealing with the con-
cept of space-time and the relativity of motion principle. Thesupplementary material17provides further examples of kine-
matical models, which do not satisfy velocity reciprocity but
are compatible with the relativity principle.
II. FALLACIES INVOLVING VELOCITY
RECIPROCITY AND THE RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE
This investigation was motivated by a recent article in this
journal, which purported to derive the universality of time(t
0¼t) from nothing other than the relativity principle and
the spatial part of the Galilean transformation, x0¼x/C0vt.3
Such a result, if true, would be really quite remarkable, and
it illustrates the extent of error to which an improper under-standing of the relativity principle can lead.
A simple argument for obtaining t¼t
0is as follows.
Assuming that the inverse of the transformation x!x0
¼x/C0vthas the same form except for a change in the sign
ofv, then
x¼x0þvt0: (1)
If we combine this with the spatial part of the direct
transformation,
x0¼x/C0vt; (2)
we get
x¼x0þvt0¼ðx/C0vtÞþvt0¼xþvðt0/C0tÞ:
This implies
t0¼t; (3)
which is what is meant by “universality of time” in Ref. 3.I f
Eq.(1)is, indeed, always true, then universality of time fol-
lows simply and directly from Eqs. (1)and(2), making the
t0¼tpart of the Galilean transformation superﬂuous.
It is clear that Eq. (1)is true for the Galilean transforma-
tions, since the inverse of the transformation t0¼t;x0¼x
/C0vtist¼t0;x¼x0þvt0. However, surely such circular rea-
soning cannot be a justiﬁcation for Eq. (1). Equation (1)does, indeed, follow from Eq. (2)given velocity reciprocity,
so the issue amounts to whether or not velocity reciprocity is
always true. This shows the importance of understanding the
assumptions on which velocity reciprocity rests.
Let us see more precisely what is wrong with the above
argument for obtaining t¼t0. Assuming homogeneity in
space and time, it follows that the transformation equations
connecting an inertial frame Sto another one S0must be lin-
ear.12We also assume that the transformation of the spatial
part, x!x0;y!y0;z!z0, is given by the spatial part of
the Galilean transformation. We then have yand z
unchanged and
t0¼avt/C0bvx (4)
and
x0¼x/C0vt; (5)
where the primed coordinates refer to the inertial reference
frame S0moving with velocity vto the right along the xaxis
relative to a given inertial frame S. We require that avandbv
be functions only of v.13The motion of the origin of S0as mea-
sured in Sis obtained by putting x0¼0i nE q . (5).T h i sg i v e s x
¼vtfor the motion of the origin of S0inS,a n d v¼dx=dtfor
its velocity. We call this the direct velocity between the inertial
frames SandS0.
We can solve Eqs. (4)and(5)forxandtto obtain for the
inverse transformation:
t¼1
av/C0bvvðt0þbvx0Þ (6)
and
x¼1
av/C0bvvðavx0þvt0Þ: (7)
Similarly, as in the argument at the end of the previous para-
graph, the motion of the origin of Sas measured in S0is
obtained by putting x¼0 in Eq. (7), which implies that
avx0þvt0¼0. From this, we obtain the reciprocal velocity ,
which is the velocity of Srelative to S0,
u¼dx0
dt0¼/C0v
av: (8)
Thus, for this example, velocity reciprocity requires av¼1,
since then u¼/C0 v.
Now consider a third inertial frame S00moving with veloc-
ity~v0to the right relative to S0. It follows from the relativity
principle that the composition of the inertial transformationsS!S
0followed by S0!S00must again be of the form of
Eqs. (4)and(5)with t0andx0replaced by t00andx00andav
andbvreplaced by av00andbv00, where ~v00is the velocity of S00
relative to S.13If this were not true, it could lead to a viola-
tion of the relativity principle for the same reason as that
given below for why the inverse transformation of an inertialtransformation must be expressible as a product of inertialtransformations. Using Eqs. (4)and(5), we write the matrix
of the transformation from StoS
0as
KðvÞ¼av/C0bv
/C0v 1/C20/C21
;
127 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Patrick Moylan 127 04 October 2023 23:02:05
the matrix of the transformation from S0toS00as
Kðv0Þ¼av0/C0bv0
/C0v01/C20/C21
;
and the matrix of the transformation from StoS00as
Kðv00Þ¼av00/C0bv00
/C0v001/C20/C21
:
Then, since the composition must again be an inertial trans-
formation, we must have
av0/C0bv0
/C0v01/C20/C21
av/C0bv
/C0v 1/C20/C21
¼av00/C0bv00
/C0v001/C20/C21
:
From this, we get four constraints
av0avþbv0v¼av00;
/C0av0bv/C0bv0¼/C0bv00;
/C0v0av/C0v¼/C0 v00;
v0bvþ1¼1: (9)
From the last of these, we get bv¼0, and from the second-
to-last, we get
v00¼vþavv0: (10)
With bv¼0, the ﬁrst equation simpliﬁes to
av00¼av0av; (11)
and the transformation equations (4)and(5)reduce to
t0¼avt (12)
and
x0¼x/C0vt: (13)
The matrix of the transformation speciﬁed by Eqs. (12) and
(13) is
KðvÞ¼av0
/C0v1/C20/C21
:
The Eqs. (6)and(7)for the inverse transformation simplify to
t¼1
avt0(14)
and
x¼x0þ1
avvt0¼x0/C0ut0; (15)
since the reciprocal velocity uis given by Eq. (8).
Now the inverse transformation speciﬁed by Eqs. (14) and
(15) must be expressible as a product of the set of all inertial
transformations, which includes not only the direct transfor-
mation KðvÞbut also spatial rotations and translations in
space and time, not to mention discrete operations like spa-
tial reﬂections and time reversal. If this were not the case,then it could lead to a violation of the relativity principle,
since there could be some law of physics whose form waspreserved under inertial transformations made up out of KðvÞ
and rotations, reﬂections, and translations, but might nothave the same form under the inverse transformation. FromEqs. (14) and(15), the inverse transformation is
K
/C01ðvÞ¼1
av0
/C0u12
43
5:
Let us assume that it can be written in terms of direct trans-
formations as follows:
K/C01ðvÞ¼1
av0
/C0u12
43
5¼Ryav0
/C0v1/C20/C21
R/C01
y¼av0
v1/C20/C21
;
where the matrix Ryis given by Ry¼h10
0/C01i
. This can be
viewed as a rotation by 180 degrees about the yaxis in three
dimensions, with the yand zcoordinates suppressed.18
Solving this matrix equation for avgives u¼/C0 vanda2
v¼1.
From u¼/C0 vandu¼/C0 v=av(Eq. (8)), we then get av¼1,
which implies t0¼tby Eq. (12).
If this were the only possible way to write K/C01ðvÞas a
product of direct transformations, then one could make alegitimate assertion about the universality of time followingonly from the spatial part of the Galilean transformation andthe relativity of motion. However, there is an even easierway to express the inverse transformation as the product ofdirect transformations. It is simply
K
/C01ðvÞ¼1
av0
/C0u12
43
5¼av0
/C0v1"#
:
Solving this equation for avanduand making use of Eq. (8)
give a2
v¼1 and v¼u¼/C0 v=av, which implies av¼/C01.
Thus, t0¼/C0t, which means that this solution to problem of
writing K/C01ðvÞas a product of direct transformations violates
causality.
This is as far as it goes in this example with just linearity,
the relativity principle, and x0¼x/C0vtas assumptions. In
order to eliminate the second possibility without making use
of anything else, one would have to declare by ﬁatthat the
positive root of a2
v¼1 is the correct one. However, by Eqs.
(12) and(14), such would be tantamount to making use of
t0¼tto establish t¼t0, again giving circular reasoning.
What we have just described are two possible ways of
expressing the inverse transformation as a product of directinertial transformations. One leads to the standard descrip-tion of the Galilean transformations with absolute timet¼t
0, and the other to the causality-violating time reversal
relation t0¼/C0t. While the possibility with av¼/C01 leads to
causality violation, it cannot be ruled out on the basis of therelativity principle alone.
It turns out that there are inﬁnitely many other ways to
express K/C01ðvÞas a product of inertial transformations, all of
them serving as examples refuting the claim made at thebeginning of this section regarding universality of time. Inthe supplementary material
17to this paper and in Ref. 19,w e
describe a one-parameter family of such additional
128 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Patrick Moylan 128 04 October 2023 23:02:05
possibilities, depending upon a parameter c, for which
x0¼x/C0vtalways holds true, but for which neither velocity
reciprocity nor universality of time is true.12–14 ,19,20For each
value of the parameter c, we get a different solution to the
above problem of expressing the inverse K/C01ðvÞas the prod-
uct of direct transformations. These other possibilities corre-spond to only a few of the many nonrelativistic kinematicalmodels described in Ref. 14, all of which are compatible
with the relativity principle.
21
There are other examples of false assertions in the scien-
tiﬁc literature based on an improper understanding of the rel-ativity principle and its relation to velocity reciprocity. TheFrank and Rothe kinematics
15,17and Lalan’s results14pro-
vide counterexamples to the claim of Ref. 2that “the
Lorentz and Galilean transformations are the only structurescompatible with the principles of inertia and relativity.”2The
authors of Ref. 2are imprecise regarding their statements of
the relativity principle; they state it in their conclusions sim-ply as “the nonexistence of privileged reference frames.”2At
the start of their Sec. III, they describe it as “the requirement
that there are no privileged frames: all inertial frames areequivalent.”2Even though it is not uncommon to ﬁnd it
stated as such in the literature, such statements of the relativ-ity principle are not correct because they neglect the essen-tial part regarding “the laws of physical phenomena” inPoincar /C19e’s formulation of it given above. This imprecision
seems to us to be a main reason for their error regardingkinematical structures compatible with the relativity
principle.
Authors of some introductory textbooks, notably Young
and Freedman
4and Serway and Jewett,5make use of veloc-
ity reciprocity in their treatment of special relativity as a con-venient way to obtain either the Lorentz transformations orthe inverse Lorentz transformations from the Lorentz trans-formations. Young and Freedman state unequivocally thatvelocity reciprocity is a direct consequence of the relativityprinciple.
4They write that “…we note that the principle of
relativity requires that the form of the transformation from S
toS0be identical to that from S0toS. The only difference is a
change in the sign of the relative velocity component u.”4
Serway and Jewett in Ref. 5also invoke velocity reciprocity
to establish the inverse Lorentz transformation from thedirect Lorentz transformation, although they are less preciseabout its justiﬁcation or lack thereof. In Ref. 22, French
invokes velocity reciprocity to write down the spatial part ofthe transformation and its inverse in the following forms:
22
x0¼qvx/C0rvt (16)
and for the inverse
x¼qvx0þrvt0:
He notes that in these two equations “the velocities are equal
and opposite”22where by velocities he means the “motion of
the origin of S0as measured in Sand motion of the origin of
Sas measured in S0.”22
Halliday et al.23avoid the use of velocity reciprocity in
obtaining the Lorentz transformation and its inverse; instead,they show that velocity reciprocity (for the Lorentzian case)follows as a consequence of the Lorentz transformation.
23
They simply posit the Lorentz transformation, solve for theinverse transformation, and then note that the inverse trans-formation is obtained out of the direct Lorentztransformation simply by replacing /C0vwith vand inter-
changing primed and unprimed variables.
III. VELOCITY RECIPROCITY AND THE
RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE
LetSandS
0be two inertial reference frames associated with
some arbitrary kinematics initially speciﬁed only by linearity of
the transformation relating the two frames. For this transforma-tion, we take Eqs. (4)and(16).J u s ta si nS e c . II,w ed e ﬁ n et h e
direct velocity vto be the velocity of the origin of S
0with
respect to S, which now is obtained by setting x0in Eq. (16)
equal to zero and differentiating the resulting equation withrespect to tto obtain v¼r
v=qv. To obtain the reciprocal veloc-
ityu¼dx0=dt0, we solve Eqs. (4)and(16)forxandt,s e tx¼0
and differentiate it with respect to t0to obtain u¼/C0rv=avfor
the velocity of the origin of Swith respect to S0.T h e velocity
reciprocity theorem asserts that12,13
u¼/C0 v: (17)
The main assumptions on which the proof of the velocity
reciprocity theorem rests are the following: the validity of
therelativity principle ,homogeneity of space and of time ,
from which the linearity of transformations follows , and the
assumption of causality . Causality means that inertial trans-
formations should not alter the causal order of events.24
Additionally, its proof requires preservation of temporal isot-
ropy and spatial isotropy25under the inertial transforma-
tion.12,13It is also necessary to assume some mathematically
technical but physically natural assumptions, which are
given in Ref. 12. These involve concepts such as continuity
and surjectivity of the mapping u¼uðvÞrelating the direct
and reciprocal velocities. (Surjectivity means that uðvÞis an
onto mapping of the space of all (admissible) direct veloci-
ties, i.e., for each u¼uðvÞ, there is a v0in the space of all
direct velocities such that v0¼u.) For a detailed proof of the
velocity reciprocity theorem, we refer the reader to Ref. 12.
A somewhat different approach to the proof of the theoremusing assumptions essentially identical to those of Ref. 12
can be found in Ref. 13.
In order to see why velocity reciprocity should neither fol-
low solely from the relativity principle nor be a part of it, weshall show that such is incompatible with both time reversalinvariance or spatial reﬂection invariance, i.e., space inver-sion invariance. While these are not transformations that weusually incorporate in our reference frame transformations,they are important symmetries of physical laws with experi-mental evidence to support them.
26Thus, if velocity reci-
procity followed directly from the relativity principle, then
incompatibility of time reversal invariance and spatial reﬂec-
tion invariance with velocity reciprocity would entail theirincompatibility with the relativity principle, which conﬂictswith its assumed universality.
Consider the case of Galilean relativity. The operator Rof
space inversion is deﬁned in Galilean relativity as follows (p.
241 of Ref. 27):t!
Rt;x!R/C0x;and _x!R/C0_x. For the Galilean
transformation KðvÞ;x/C0!KðvÞx0¼x/C0vt. This followed by R
gives
x/C0!RKðvÞx0¼/C0xþvt;
andx0¼/C0xþvtimplies dx=dt¼vfor the direct velocity.
129 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Patrick Moylan 129 04 October 2023 23:02:05
Inversely, from x0¼/C0xþvt, we get x¼/C0x0þvt. From
this, we obtain for the reciprocal velocity,
0¼dð/C0x0þvt0Þ
dt0¼/C0dx0
dt0þv;
so that dx0=dt0¼v. In other words, the reciprocal velocity is
the same as the direct velocity for the improper Galilean
transformation RKðvÞ.
A similar predicament exists with the operator Tof time
inversion. The time inversion operator Tin Galilean invari-
ant relativity is deﬁned as t!T/C0t;x!Tx;and _x!T/C0_x,27
where xis the position and the dot means time derivative.
With this, as the deﬁnition of T, the (improper) Galilean
transformation consisting of a Galilean transformation KðvÞ
(with av¼1 because it is Galilean) followed by time inver-
sion Twould lead to the result that reciprocal velocity for the
combined transformation S/C0!TKðvÞS0would be the same as the
direct velocity.
We see this similarly as for space inversion: under
KðvÞ;x/C0!KðvÞx0¼x/C0vt, and under T,t!T/C0tand v!T/C0v,s o
that under TKðvÞ,
x/C0!TKðvÞx0¼xþvt;
andx0¼xþvtimplies dx=dt¼/C0 vfor the direct velocity.
Reciprocally, out of x0¼xþvt, we get x¼x0/C0vt, and
from t/C0!TKðvÞt0¼TKðvÞt¼/C0t, we get x¼x0þvt0. With this,
we immediately obtain the following equation for the recip-rocal velocity:
0¼dðx0þvt0Þ
dt0¼dx0
dt0þv;
so that dx0=dt0¼/C0 vfor the reciprocal velocity, also. Thus,
the reciprocal velocity and the direct velocity are the same
for the transformation TKðvÞ, making time inversion also
incompatible with velocity reciprocity.28
From these two results, it follows that velocity reciprocity, if
it is a direct consequence solely of the relativity principle,
would force us to discard the discrete operations of time andspace inversion since they lead to a violation of velocity reci-
procity and, thus, to a violation of the relativity principle. Time
reversal invariance and space reﬂection invariance would nolonger be acceptable laws of physics, since they would be
incompatible with the assumed universally valid relativity prin-
ciple.
29Currently, accepted explanations of experimentally ver-
iﬁed results in atomic and nuclear physics making use of space
reﬂection and time reversal invariance for their explanations(such as the vanishing of the static electric dipole moment)
would no longer be valid from a theoretical standpoint.
26This
would necessitate revising current theoretical explanations for alarge number of accepted experimental results.
There is no problem with the alternative assumption that
velocity reciprocity is not always true for all situations, so
long as its validity depends not only just on the relativity
principle but also on other conditions; in particular, those
mentioned at the beginning of this section and which areused in the proof of the velocity reciprocity theorem given in
Ref. 12. However, if velocity reciprocity is a direct conse-
quence of the relativity principle and nothing more, and if itis not always true, then it not being always true would imply
that the relativity principle does not have universal validity.
For the example in Sec. IIobtaining universality of time
solely from the spatial part of the Galilean transformation,
we note that we must have a
v¼þ1 in order for causality to
be preserved. This eliminates the case involving the negative
root of a2
v¼1. Since spatial isotropy invariance25(preserva-
tion of spatial isotropy) is automatically guaranteed by x0
¼x/C0vt;t0¼avtwith av¼61, it follows that all of the
hypotheses of Ref. 12stated above for the velocity reciproc-
ity theorem are satisﬁed for the choice av¼þ1.12,13For the
other case, av¼/C01, causality is violated. Thus, the relativity
principle together with linearity of the transformation (or
homogeneity of space and time) and causality preservation,in addition to the assumption of the spatial part of the trans-
formation is given by Eq. (2), is necessary in order to estab-
lish the universality of time without sacriﬁcing the
universality of the relativity principle.
IV. SOME ADDITIONAL REMARKS CONCERNING
THE LINEAR STRUCTURE OF SPACE-TIME
Almost immediately after Einstein’s seminal paper on rel-
ativity30was published, attempts were made to derive the
Lorentz transformations from general principles such as therelativity principle and homogeneity and isotropy of space
but without invoking Einstein’s second postulate that the
speed of light in vacuo is constant and the same for all iner-
tial observers. The ﬁrst such attempt is usually attributed to
von Ignatowsky in 1911.
31It was followed shortly thereafter
by the Frank and Rothe paper15published in the same year.
Since then, papers have continued to be written on the sub-
ject even up to the present.2
Without invoking Einstein’s second postulate, the most dif-
ﬁcult part in deriving the Lorentz transformations is that of
establishing the linearity of the transformations. In otherwords, given that an inertial transformation is speciﬁed by an
arbitrary bijective mapping of space-time onto itself, under
what conditions is the bijection linear? This is a highly nontriv-
ial problem, especially if we do not make use of homogeneity
of space and of time. A bijection is a one-to-one (injective)and onto (surjective) mapping, and since onto linear mappings
are always bijective, we might think that the linearity of a map-
ping is a necessary condition for its injectivity.
16This is wrong.
There are many bijective mappings of space-time onto itself,
which ﬁx the origin and are nonlinear. There are even exam-ples where the nonlinearity is only in the temporal part of the
transformation; one such being the following:

where W(x) is the Lambert W-function, which is the inverse

iprocity does not hold true.
A very convincing approach to the problem as to linearity
of inertial transformations is to start with an afﬁne space,
which is a vector space endowed with an additional structure
of translation of vectors. This space serves as the substratumfor the distinguished class of reference frames involved inthe relativity of motion principle. They are the inertialframes, and inertial transformations are 1 !1 transforma-
tions of the afﬁne space onto itself, which take inertialframes into each other. With straight lines being the paths ofinertial observers in space-time, we require an inertial trans-formation and its inverse map straight lines onto straightlines and preserve parallelism.
2,32The reason for the require-
ment of parallelism is that according to the principle of rela-tivity, no one inertial frame can have any preferred propertydistinguishing it from any other as far as the laws of physicsare concerned. Thus, if two straight lines describing theworld lines of two moving or stationary particles are judgedparallel by any one inertial observer, then they must also bejudged parallel by all other inertial observers. Otherwise,Newton’s second law would not always have the same formfor all inertial observers, a clear violation of the relativityprinciple.
There is a very important theorem for afﬁne spaces called
thefundamental theorem of afﬁne geometry . It asserts that
any arbitrary bijection of an afﬁne space, which mapsstraight lines to straight lines and preserves parallelism,something which is true of an inertial transformation, mustnecessarily be, up to a translation, a linear transformation ofthe underlying vector space.
32This approach to establishing
the linearity of the transformation equations between differ-ent inertial frames has the advantage that it forms the basisfor the Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild approach to curved space-
time in general relativity.
33
According to the previous two paragraphs, the relativity
principle demands that straight lines in space-time are car-
ried into straight lines and parallel lines into parallel linesunder inertial transformations. Thus, if an inertial transfor-mation takes the straight line ‘into the straight line ‘
0, the
inverse transformation must take ‘0back into ‘. However,
the relativity principle does not prohibit possible rescaling ofthe time and spatial coordinates under inertial transforma-tions. It is precisely this freedom to rescale the time coordi-nate that prevents validity of velocity reciprocity in thekinematical model considered in the Frank and Rothepaper.
15
The just-described approach to the linearity of the scale-
extended Lorentz transformations together with causality isused in Ref. 32to obtain the scale-extended Lorentz transfor-
mations. The approaches described in Ref. 34can all be
traced back to Ref. 31. Probably the most profound and con-
vincing approach to getting at the scale-extended Lorentztransformations is the approach of the authors in Ref. 36
based on causality alone. An especially lucid description ofit can be found in the paper of Borchers and Hegerfeldt,
37
and its ideas go back at least as far as Robb in Ref. 35. All ofthese ﬁrst-postulate only derivations of the Lorentz transfor-
mations lead to the existence of a universal invariant
speed.32,34,36,37This fundamental velocity is necessary to set
equal to cif the Lorentz transformations are to leave
Maxwell’s equations invariant. As Rindler succinctly puts it:
“So the only function of the second postulate is to ﬁx the
invariant velocity.”38
V. HISTORICAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS
The discussion in Secs. IIandIIImakes clear that absolute
time cannot possibly follow from only the linearity of the
inertial transformations, the spatial part of the Galilean trans-
formation, and the relativity principle, any more than thetime transformation part of the Lorentz transformation can
be obtained in a likewise manner from the spatial part of the
Lorentz transformation. Any route to the Galilean transfor-mation is much more involved than that portended at the
start of Sec. II. Furthermore, justiﬁcation should be given
regarding the usage of velocity reciprocity by textbookauthors who insist on using it in derivations of the Lorentz
transformations. Unjustiﬁed use of it is misleading, and it
can lead to serious error.
3
We conclude this paper with some historical remarks on
the relativity principle and our concepts of space and time. It
is an interesting question as to origin of the space-time con-
cept, that is, who was the ﬁrst to think seriously about uniﬁ-cation of space and time into space-time in a nontrivial way?
It seems that one can trace the origins of this concept at least
as far back as Hamilton’s discovery of quaternions in 1843,while he was crossing over the Brougham Bridge on a walkwith his wife along the Royal Canal in Dublin. Hamilton
carved in the stones of the bridge the quaternion relations:
39
i2¼j2¼k2¼ijk¼/C01;
and wrote the quaternions as
q¼tþxiþyjþzk;
where t,x,y,a n d zare real numbers and the three quanti-
tiesi,j,a n d kare subject to the relations given above. This
discovery leads Hamilton to an attempt at uniﬁcation ofspace and time over 60 years before Poincar /C19e’s Rendiconti
paper
6and Minkowski’s famous lecture to the 80th
Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in
Cologne on the September 21, 1908, where he proposedhisanti-deformation thesis along with his eloquent and
powerful proposal for the uniﬁcation of space and time
into a single entity.
40
If, in the above equation for q, the scalar tis identiﬁed
with time, then the quaternions can be used as a representa-
tion for a uniﬁed four-dimensional space-time. Hamilton
wrote: “Time is said to have only one dimension, and spaceto have three dimensions…. The mathematical quaternion
partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may
be said to be ‘time plus space,’ or ‘space plus time’: and inthis sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, four
dimensions …” and through the quaternions “The sciences
of Space and Time …became intimately intertwined andindissolubly connected with each other.” (p. 228 of Ref. 41).
Hamilton even expressed his conviction on the uniﬁcation of
time and space in beautiful poetical terms:
41
131 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Patrick Moylan 131 04 October 2023 23:02:05
“And how the One of Time, of Space the Three
Might in the Chain of Symbol girdled be.”
Finally, a few remarks on the origins of the relativity of
motion and the importance of the Poincar /C19e’s contribution to
it. From Galileo’s writings on the subject, it is clear that he
had grasped, for the most part, the meaning of the relativity
of motion principle, and that he extended it to both terrestrialand celestial bodies. Newton gave it a central place in his
Principia and used, as pointed out in Ref. 3, Galileo’s exam-
ple of ships in relative motion as an illustration.42
In addition to Galileo and Newton’s descriptions of it,
there are Buridan and Copernicus’ writings on the subject as
detailed in Ref. 3. In fact, there are many other scholars
before Galileo who also wrote about it, in particular theFrench philosopher and mathematician Nicholas d’Oresme
(1325–1382). Oresme’s description of the relativity of
motion is written with no less conviction and understandingthan Galileo’s:
“I suppose that local motion can be perceived only
when one body alters its position relative to
another. Therefore, if a man in a smoothly ridingboat, a, which is moved either slowly or rapidly,
can see nothing but a second boat, b, which moves
in just the same way as a, …then I say, that it will
seem to him that neither boat is moved. And if ais
at rest and bmoves, it will seem to him that b
moves; and if it is athat moves and bis at rest, it
will still seem to him that ais at rest and that bis
moved. …”
43Oresme then goes on to extend his
considerations to celestial motions.43
Historian Thomas S. Kuhn in his book The Copernican
Revolution suggests that Galileo might have read Oresme,
and that he might have been inﬂuenced by him, although,
according to Kuhn, Galileo never cited Oresme.43However,
Kuhn points out that it was uncommon in Galileo’s time to
quote sources in contradistinction to the customary practice
from at least the time of Poincar /C19e and Einstein onwards
acknowledging indebtedness to others.
Additionally, there are very compelling descriptions of the
relativity of motion given by Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464)
and Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), which can be found inRef. 44. Bruno, who was burned at the stake at the age of 51,
was a contemporary of Galileo; although it is unclear if they
ever met, their paths overlapped in Venice shortly beforeBruno was arrested during the Inquisition. In Ref. 44,i ti s
questioned whether Galileo could have borrowed from the
ideas of Nicolas of Cusa and Bruno similarly as does Kuhnregarding possible inﬂuence of Oresme on Galileo.
The relativity principle can probably be traced back even
further than to the fourteenth century. Surely, it must have
been understood in some form by some of the ancients suchas Aristaracus of Samos, who espoused the heliocentric the-
ory almost 2000 years before Copernicus.
45There are hints
of it even in Aristotle’s writings, although they contradict his
prevalent views on motion.46(According to Kuhn, it is not
infrequent to ﬁnd Aristotle contradicting himself.43)I n De
caelo ii 13, 293 a 18-b 30, Aristotle wrote concerning the
opinion of certain philosophers about the position of the
Earth: “The fact that the Earth is not the centre, but is at adistance represented by the whole (depth, i.e., radius) of half
the sphere (in which it revolves) constitutes, in their [the phi-
losophers] opinion, no reason why the phenomena shouldnot present the same appearance to us as if we lived (on an
Earth) away from the centre as they would if our Earth were
at the centre: seeing that, as it is, we are at a distance (from
the centre) represented by half the Earth’s diameter and yetthis does not make any obvious difference.”
46
With the principle of relativity already understood by
Galileo and Newton and to a somewhat lesser extent by pred-
ecessors such as d’Oresme and others, one might think todownplay the importance of Poincar /C19e’s reassertion and ele-
vation of it to a physical principle with universal validity
300 years after Galileo. We might even think to give Galileoalmost full credit for it. In our opinion, this would be a gross
misrepresentation of the situation. Galileo and Newton were
Renaissance men intent on and given free reign to revisingthe heavens with little or no objection from other scientists.For Poincar /C19e, much more was at stake. As mentioned in the
endnote to the introduction of this paper, the followers of
Maxwell’s electrodynamics were ready to uproot the relativ-ity principle and reinstate a new form of geocentrism, where
the relativity principle no longer held true. “The existence of
an absolute motionless frame of reference associated withthe electromagnetic aether became ﬁxed in the minds of
physicists developing the theory of optical and electromag-
netic phenomena by analogy with the theory of elasticity.”(p. 4 of Ref. 10). Such a conﬂicting state of affairs was never
the case when Galileo and Newton replaced the (for the most
part) experimentally baseless physics of Aristotle with theirrelativistic theories. At that time, there was simply no such
parallel to the crisis in physics centered on the relativity of
motion principle, which confronted Poincar /C19e.
Furthermore, the establishment of a ﬁnite velocity for the
speed of light, which came after the time of Galileo, makes
the situation regarding defense of the universality of the rela-
tivity of motion principle much more demanding. Being auniversal law with unrestricted validity, it should not onlyhold true for inertial observers moving relative to one
another with speeds less than c, but also for two observers
moving relative to one another with superluminal speeds.This is something that still eludes us even today: our inabil-
ity to construct an acceptable interacting theory of tachyons
with ordinary matter, even if tachyons have no “direct physi-cal interpretation,”
47poses a restriction to the universality of
the relativity principle. As of yet, unobjectionable applicabil-
ity of the relativity principle is limited to the class of inertialobservers moving with velocities less than c.
Clearly, there was much more at stake when Poincar /C19ei n
1904 boldly declared the relativity principle to be a general
principle of physics on par with the conservation of energyprinciple
1and having universal and unrestricted validity for
all physical phenomena.6The “efforts made to save it” by
Lorentz and Poincar /C19e were no small efforts, and the “vigor
of the defense [by Lorentz and Poincar /C19e] shows how serious
was the attack” on the relativity principle.1To Lorentz, there
seems no doubt that the credit should go to Poincar /C19e:8
“Poincar /C19e, on the contrary, obtained a perfect invariance of
the equations of electrodynamics [including the invariance
of the Lorentz force law,6,7something which was neglected
in Ref. 30], and he formulated the ‘postulate of relativity,’
terms which he was the ﬁrst to employ.”8The situation was
completely different in the time of Galileo and Newton, and
it cannot possibly be compared to Poincar /C19e’s efforts to
uphold the principle, which was under attack at the begin-
ning of 20th century.

9To put things into an historical perspective, we recall that at the end of the
nineteenth century, physics was in a terrible state of confusion. Maxwell’s
equations were not preserved under the Galilean transformations, and most
of the Maxwellian physicists of the time were ready to abandon the relativ-
ity of motion principle (Refs. 10and11). They adopted a distinguished
frame of reference, the rest frame of the “luminiferous aether,” as the
medium in which electromagnetic waves propagate and in which
Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law have their usual forms. In
effect, they were ready to uproot Copernicus and reinstate a new form of
geocentrism. Poincar /C19e proved to be an exception. He insisted on the neces-
sity to uphold the relativity principle, and, in so doing, he together with
Lorentz and Einstein were led to the creation of a “whole new mechanics(Ref. 1).” The new mechanics with the Lorentz transformations instead of
the Galilean transformations gave us new relativistic transformation laws
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and of the electromagnetic force, laws which
were ﬁrst obtained in their totality by Poincar /C19e (Ref. 6, Sec. 1. Lorentz
transformation and Ref. 7). For his defense of the relativity principle and
his elevation of it to a principle having unrestricted and universal validity,
Poincar /C19e deserves much credit.

unfortunately neglected and almost forgotten approach to relativity going
back to FitzGerald and Heaviside, which considers a dynamicalexplanation for the mechanism of length contraction and time dilation
based on the structure of moving atomic conﬁgurations. For example, a
spherical electron becomes a Heaviside ellipsoid when moving with
constant velocity. Surprisingly, advocates of this approach include, as
Brown points out, not only J. S. Bell but also Wolfgang Pauli.

which x0¼x/C0vtholds. Velocity reciprocity is not valid for these models,
even though they are compatible with the relativity principle. Descriptionsare given not only for one spatial dimension but also for the physicallyimportant case of three spatial dimensions. For the three dimensional case,
the Lie algebras of the homogeneous part of the kinematical groups
extended by scaling in time are explicitly described. Finally, we discusslength measurements and the measurement of time in these models. Itturns out that they are just as consistent as special relativity regarding
issues like the twin paradox.

28Our argument in Sec. IIfor the time reversing av¼/C01,u¼vsolution of
K/C01ðvÞas a product of inertial transformations can be given an interpreta-
tion in terms of the combination of the two discrete transformations of
133 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Patrick Moylan 133 04 October 2023 23:02:05
space inversion and time reversal similar to what we now describe here
individually for space inversion and then time reversal. The inverse
transformation K/C01ðvÞ can be written as the product
/C010
0/C01/C20/C21
KðvÞ/C010
0/C01/C20/C21
, where KðvÞis the matrix just below Eq.
(13), and the matrix/C010
0/C01/C20/C21
is the matrix of the transformation RT,
the combination of spatial reﬂection and time inversion. Incompatibility of
velocity reciprocity for this case follows in the same way as it does in the
current section for time inversion and space inversion considered
separately.
29Time reversal and space reﬂection invariance are by no means totally com-pelling, especially in view of the failure of both parity invariance andtime-reversal invariance in weak interactions. However, they do appar-
ently always hold true in atomic physics and also for much of nuclear
physics. So we shall take them to be exactly true. Furthermore, even in the
cases where they are not upheld, we would still have CPT symmetry,
which holds for all physical phenomena and which probably could also
serve to demonstrate incompatibility with velocity reciprocity in the fol-
lowing way. We adopt the interpretation of antiparticles as the correspond-
ing particles traveling backward in time, so that we would have t!
CTt
under CTand x!P/C0xunder parity inversion, and hence under CPT,
t/C0!CPTt;x/C0!CPT/C0x, and _x/C0!CPT/C0_x, which is the same as space inversion Ras
far as the space-time dependence is concerned.

Mathematics (Springer Verlag, New York, 2019); Johnson points out that
the quaternions were known much earlier already to both Euler and Gauss,
but do not seem to have inspired in them any such similar ideas to
Hamilton’s regarding a possible uniﬁcation of space and time, at least not
in any known written form.

edited by Vesselin Petkov (Minkowski Institute Press, Montr /C19eal, 2012);
Minkowski’s anti-deformation thesis refers to that part of his lecture
where he chides the mathematicians for not anticipating the Lorentz group
much earlier based on the necessity of a more general and terminal groupas far as deformations are concerned and which reduces to the Galilean
group when c!1 . The term ( anti-deformation thesis ) seems to be due to
I. E. Segal, one of the originators of contractions and deformations of Lie
groups.
