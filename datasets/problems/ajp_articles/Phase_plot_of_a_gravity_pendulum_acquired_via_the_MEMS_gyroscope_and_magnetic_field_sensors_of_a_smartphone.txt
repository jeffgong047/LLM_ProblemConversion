A gravity pendulum experiment in which a smartphone serves as pendulum bob and as
measurement device is described. As the pendulum oscillates, the smartphone gyroscope and
magnetometer sensors are used to simultaneously record the bob’s angular velocity and angular
displacement. While the angular velocity is measured directly via the gyroscope sensor, the angulardisplacement is deduced from the change of the magnetometer reading while the smartphone
oscillates in the constant magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth. These two independent measurements enable
us to derive the phase space representation of the pendulum motion directly from experimentaldata. Further data analysis yields energy plots, including the periodic change between the
pendulum’s kinetic and potential energy and the energy dissipation due to friction. Detailed
instructions on how to adopt the experiment, which is both suitable as a lecture demonstrationas well as an instructional laboratory experiment, are provided in the supplementary material.

I. INTRODUCTION
As a supplement to lectures, encouraging students to conduct
experiments using their own smartphones and tablets is a
developing pedagogical technique.1–4For such learning experi-
ences, a number of oscillation experiments have been proposedincorporating smartphones and tablets with their internal digitalsensors as measurement devices.
5–15Harmonic oscillations and
the oscillation equations are a fundamental part of experimental
and theoretical mechanics lectures. However, the representationof the oscillation in phase space, which later in the curriculumis needed for more complex mechanics and electrodynamics
systems,
16,17is an important, but often neglected, concept in
introductory physics courses.
In order to describe the oscillation of a gravity pendulum
in phase space, in which the position is plotted as a functionof the momentum, one needs to measure the angular dis-
placement uand the angular velocity xindependently. If a
smartphone is used as the pendulum bob, both quantitiesmust be detected with its internal sensors. While nearlyevery smartphone has a gyroscope sensor that measures
the angular velocity (for experiments using this sensor, see
Refs. 18–21 ), there are no internal sensors that measure theangular displacement directly and independently of the gyro-
scope. Usually, the smartphone’s acceleration sensor is used
to obtain the orientation of the smartphone relative to Earth’sgravitational ﬁeld. However, in Ref. 22, it is shown that nei-
ther this sensor nor the virtual linear acceleration sensor,
which uses additional information from other sensors, are
suited to obtain the angular displacement in an acceleratedsystem.
We propose measuring angular displacement via the ori-
entation of the smartphone with respect to Earth’s local mag-
netic ﬁeld using the smartphone’s magnetometer. Together
with the pendulum bob’s angular velocity, the phase spacerepresentation of the pendulum can then be obtained.
In this paper, we will present the experimental setup and
analyze the phase plot it produces. A detailed description ofthe setup, experimentation instructions, QR-code that in com-
bination with the phyphox application
1(RTWH Aachen,
Germany) can be used to reproduce the experiment, and step-by-step data analysis is included in the supplementary mate-rial.
23The corresponding results obtained using the linear
accelerometer sensor for the detection of the angular displace-
ment are also included and discussed in the supplementary
material. Furthermore, all data shown in this paper and a

are provided.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENT
Our gravity pendulum setup consists of a smartphone as
pendulum bob, which is suspended with VELCRO-fasteners
on four cords of 1 :19 m-length as shown in Fig. 1. The four
cords ensure a stable oscillation around the internal y-axis of
the MEMS gyroscope sensor after displacement of the smart-
phone from its equilibrium position. The period of oscillationis about 2 :2 s. The gyroscope and magnetometer data are
recorded via the phyphox app to fully characterize the angu-
lar velocity and angular displacement of the smartphone as afunction of time. For details of the experimental setup and
the equations used to transform the time-dependent magne-
tometer readings to the angular displacement, we refer thereader to the supplementary material Sec. I, “Materials and
Methods.”

III. RESULTS
The time dependencies of the angular velocity xðtÞand
angular displacement uBðtÞobtained via the gyroscope and
the magnetometer sensor, respectively, are presented in Fig.
4 of the supplementary material. By plotting the angular dis-placement as a function of the angular velocity, the phase
space representation of the oscillation is obtained. This phase
plot is shown in Fig. 2, where the lightness of the spiral-like
curve decreases with increasing time.
For harmonic oscillations, the phase shift between the
angular displacement and the angular velocity is 90
/C14,resulting in a circular phase-space representation. Because
the pendulum is dampened, the curve is expected to become
spiral-like.16While the phase space plot obtained from the
magnetometer data is quite noisy, it shows the expected
behavior.
Figure 3shows the movement of the pendulum in a three-
dimensional plot with the angular displacement (from the
magnetometer data) on one, the angular velocity on the
other, and the time on the third axis. We expect an oscillationwith a weak damping; therefore, the angular displacement
can be described with the equation16
uðtÞ¼u0cosXtþp0 ðÞ exp/C0t
s/C18/C19
; (1)
where u0is the angular displacement extrapolated to t¼0,
p0is a phase offset, sis the time constant of the damping,
andXis the circular frequency of the dampened oscillation.
From Eq. (1), one can easily ﬁnd an equation for the angular
velocity16

In order to ﬁt the experimental data from our pendulum
experiment shown in Fig. 3, Eqs. (1)and(2)were combined
to a three-dimensional model. The resulting ﬁt parameters
and the ﬁt function are shown in Table Iand Fig. 3, respec-
tively. The ﬁt represents the data very well, showing the con-
sistency between the two quantities measured in this
experiment by the oscillating smartphone. From the phase
space representation, the energy plot of the oscillation can be
obtained. This plot and a short analysis can be found in the
supplementary material (see Fig. 6 and Sec. II D).
The data obtained using the linear accelerometer as source
for the determination of the angular displacement also show
a periodic behavior. These data are presented in Fig. 4 of the
supplementary material and are included in the Jupyter note-
book ﬁle.23However, one can clearly identify an additional
phase shift between the angular velocity and the angular

displacement and an erroneous amplitude in these data. It is
clear that the phase space representation using these data(shown in Fig. 5 of the supplementary material) does notdescribe the observed pendulum motion correctly.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper describes an experiment that represents an intui-
tive approach to the phase space representation of a gravitypendulum. The key idea is to employ a smartphone as an oscil-lating pendulum bob and to acquire two independent simulta-neous measurements from the smartphone’s gyroscope andmagnetometer sensors in order to derive the time-dependentangular velocity and the angular displacement of the pendu-lum. While the angular velocity is directly measured with the
gyroscope sensor, the angular displacement is calculated from
the acquired magnetometer data using the orientation of thesmartphone in the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The experiment canbe reproduced with a smartphone and the open source applica-tionphyphox . For further evaluation, the experimental data are
ﬁtted in the three-dimensional phase space representation.
With the phyphox experiment ﬁle and detailed instructions
provided in the supplementary material, the experiment canbe used as a lecture demonstration to visualize and explainthe concept of phase space. The experiment is also suitableas an advanced instructional laboratory experiment for the“home lab” or a conventional physics lab course. Here,the task would be to measure and analyze the motion of thedamped oscillation of a gravity pendulum as a function oftime and in phase space. In the future, the principle of mea-
surement demonstrated in this paper may be applied to morecomplex systems like coupled or blocked pendulums.
