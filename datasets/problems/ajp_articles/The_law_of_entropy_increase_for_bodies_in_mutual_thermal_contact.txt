The law of entropy increase for bodies in mutual thermal contact may be argued using the fact that the
ﬁnal temperature in the thermal process is higher than the ﬁnal temperature in a reversible process for
work extraction. #2023 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

When two bodies at unequal temperatures, T1>T2, are
put in mutual thermal contact, it is observed that the hotbody cools down and the cold body warms up. The processcontinues until the two bodies reach a common temperature(T
F), which lies somewhere between the two initial tempera-
tures: T1>TF>T2. The process is irreversible, implying
that the total entropy ( S) of the two bodies increases in the
process. Since entropy is a state function, the standard calcu-lation of the entropy change in each body is performed bychoosing any convenient reversible path that connects theinitial and ﬁnal equilibrium states of each body and applyingthe Clausius formula, DS
i¼Ð
dQi=T, where i¼1, 2. For a
reversible heat transfer, dQi¼CidT, where the heat capacity
Ci>0 is, in general, a function of the temperature of the
body and is process dependent. The total change in entropyis the sum of changes for the individual bodies, given by
DS¼ð
TF
T1C1dT
TþðTF
T2C2dT
T; (1)
where DS1¼ÐTF
T1C1dT=T<0, since TF<T1, and
DS2¼ÐTF
T2C2dT=T>0, since TF>T2. Thus, the second-
law inequality, DS>0, is usually derived for this process by
an explicit evaluation of the entropy changes while assuminga speciﬁc functional form for C
iðTÞ.1Even though one term
is negative in the above, the sum of the two terms is positive.In this article, we show that DS>0 may be argued from the
fact that T
Fis greater than the ﬁnal common temperature
Tfthat would be reached via a reversible work extraction
process—a fact which itself derives from the positivity ofthe heat capacity of each body.
As a concrete example, consider the case of two bodies
with constant volumes and ﬁxed heat capacities C
1andC2,
for which we obtain1
DS¼ C1lnTF
T1þC2lnTF
T2; (2)
where the ﬁnal temperature, obtained from energy conserva-
tion, is TF¼aT1þð1/C0aÞT2, with a¼C1=ðC1þC2Þ, satis-
fying 0 /C20a/C201. The above expression for the entropy
change can be rearranged into the form
DS¼ð C1þC2ÞlnaT1þð1/C0aÞT2
Ta
1T1/C0a
2 !
: (3)
In this case, the proof of the inequality DS>0 rests on the
inequality between weighted arithmetic and geometricmeans, given by aT
1þð1/C0aÞT2>Ta
1T1/C0a
2, for T16¼T2.There has been previous discussion around this apparent cor-
respondence between physical laws and mathematical factssuch as these inequalities.2–11However, the fact that one of
the means in the above comparison, Ta
1T1/C0a
2, is also the ﬁnal
common temperature of the two bodies when subjected tothe process of reversible work extraction, seems to haveescaped attention in the literature so far. More precisely, con-
sider a reversible process that extracts work from the two
bodies initially at temperatures T
1andT2.1,12,13This may be
achieved by introducing a heat engine and running inﬁnitesi-mal, reversible heat cycles that gradually reduce the temper-ature difference between the two bodies, until the two bodiesobtain a common temperature T
f.14Now, Tfis determined
by the reversibility condition: C1lnðTf=T1ÞþC2lnðTf=T2Þ
¼0, yielding Tf¼Ta
1T1/C0a
2. So, Eq. (3)may be reexpressed
asDS¼ð C1þC2ÞlnðTF=TfÞ. Therefore, we can say that
the condition TF>Tfdirectly implies DS>0. We argue
below that TF>Tfholds not only for the case with algebraic
means but also in general.
One may wonder, why does Tfﬁgure in the expression for
the entropy change in a thermal process? Actually, this sug-gests a suitable reversible path by which we can bring our ini-tial two-body system to the ﬁnal state at temperature T
F,a n d
w h i c ha l s oc l a r i ﬁ e st h a t TF>Tf. The alternate path consists of
two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we bring the two bodies to the com-mon temperature T
fby a reversible process, as described above.
In the second step, an amount of heat—equal to the total workextracted above—is delivered to the two bodies, bringing themback at the initial total energy, but raising their common tem-perature to T
F. The temperature increases, because the heat
capacity of each body is deﬁned to be positive. Since energy inthe form of heat is added to the system, so we also expect thatthe total entropy of the two bodies shows an increase. This lineof reasoning is, expectedly, more palatable to the students com-pared to a plain application of the Clausius formula.

In conclusion, many previous derivations of the second-
law in a thermal equilibration process rely on the use ofinequalities between algebraic means (see also Ref. 16).
However, as we have seen above, the law of entropy increasefollows owing to the reason that the ﬁnal temperature
reached for the thermal process is higher than the ﬁnal tem-
perature in a reversible process for work extraction. The nec-essary and sufﬁcient condition for the above proof of thesecond law is the positivity of the heat capacity of individualbodies, which leads to the condition T
F>Tf.

14The envisaged reversible step requires the presence of a heat engine, a
reversible work source, and a set of auxiliary heat reservoirs. To visualizeone such inﬁnitesimal heat cycle—say, the ﬁrst one—we have preparedthe two bodies in initial states using reservoirs at temperatures T
1andT2.
Now, assume that we have another pair of reservoirs, which differfrom the initial pair by inﬁnitesimally different temperatures, denoted asT
1/C0dT1andT2þdT2, where dTi>0. Now, an inﬁnitesimal amount of
heat dQ1is reversibly transferred from the hot body to the reservoir at
T1/C0dT1, a reversible heat cycle is run, which outputs work dWand
rejects heat dQ2¼dQ1/C0dWto the reservoir at T2þdT2. This heat is
then reversibly transferred to the cold body at T2. In this whole process,
the engine and the auxilliary reservoirs undergo a reversible process, so
their total change in entropy is zero. As a consequence, the sum of theentropy changes in the bodies is also zero. Furthermore, the temperature ofthe hot body is reduced to T
1/C0dT1and that of cold body rises to
T2þdT2, thus decreasing the difference between their temperatures. The
sequence of cycles is repeated using heat reservoirs at appropriate temper-
atures, until the two bodies arrive at a common temperature Tf.
15The procedure is easily extended to the case of nbodies at initial tempera-
tures fTiji¼1;2;…;ngand heat capacities CiðTÞ>0. In this case, the
net entropy change in the n bodies during the proposed alternate process is
expressed as DS¼Pn
i¼1ÐTf
TiðCiðTÞ=TÞdTþPn
i¼1ÐTF
TfðCiðTÞ=TÞdT. The
ﬁrst sum vanishes due to the reversible work extraction step. Thus, the
total entropy change is simply due to heat transfer to the collective system
in the second step. Each integral in the second sum contributes positively,
since TF>Tf.
