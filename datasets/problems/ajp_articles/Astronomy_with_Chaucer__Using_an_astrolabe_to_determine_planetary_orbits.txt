Equipped with a home-made astrolabe and Kepler’s laws, one can arrive at accurate estimates of
the orbits of planets. Over the past three years, I have used an astrolabe to collect sightings ofcelestial bodies visible from my backyard. This paper shows that it is possible to measure one’s
latitude and longitude, the current time, locations of celestial bodies, and the sizes of the orbits of
nearby planets. When the astrolabe is used to collect both daytime and nighttime observationsof Venus, one can also demonstrate that Venus orbits the Sun.

I. INTRODUCTION
Even living in the midst of city lights, you can still see
some of the brightest stars and planets with the naked eye.
Over a span of two or three years, you can watch the planetsmove across the sky against the background stars.Surprisingly, with basic observations of these objects and asimple tool called an astrolabe you can tell the time, ﬁnd
compass directions, determine the season, and determine the
diameter of planetary orbits.
1,2The astrolabe is based on a
stereographic projection of the stars, in which they are pro-jected onto a plane that rotates around the celestial poles.
Astrolabes have been made since antiquity, and you can
make your own.3–6
In the hands of a skilled navigator, an astrolabe was often
the tool of choice, yielding elevation sightings accurate tobetter than a degree.7–10Additionally, the best source of time
until the 20th century had been obtained from the rotation of
the Earth, which can be measured by tracking the movements
of stars. There is also ample evidence that astrolabes wereused for teaching astronomy.11It is, therefore, natural to ask
if one can use an astrolabe to measure the solar system.
Over the past three years, I have used an astrolabe to col-
lect sightings of celestial bodies visible from my backyard,
hoping to learn what could be measured. My astrolabe fol-lows a design popular in medieval England and which isdescribed by the famous poet Geoffrey Chaucer in hisTreatise on the Astrolabe
12in a letter to his son.13As shown
in this article, the level of accuracy obtained by an astrolabe
is sufﬁcient to measure planetary orbits if one uses the mod-ern expedient of statistical analysis. Moreover, one can sup-plement nighttime observations of Venus with daytimeobservations aided by binoculars. Astrolabe measurements
of these combined sightings suggest that Venus orbits the
Sun.
The design of my astrolabe is explored in Sec. II, and its
use is outlined in Sec. III. Further usage instructions are in
the supplementary material associated with this article. With
these basics in hand, Sec. IVprovides several possible class-
room lessons or projects that can be undertaken using theastrolabe. Section Vdescribes a dataset collected with my
astrolabe. The remaining sections explore possible studentprojects that can be done with the dataset: Sec. VIuses the
dataset to measure the accuracy of sightings collected with
the astrolabe, Sec. VIIdemonstrates how the sightings canbe used to measure planetary orbits, and Sec. VIII suggests
some avenues for additional projects.
II. DESIGN OF THE ASTROLABE
The main use of an astrolabe is to measure the elevation
angle above the horizon of celestial bodies, and from these
sightings, derive other quantities of interest. To determine
planetary orbits, one needs only a set of observations con-taining the local time, date, and the right ascension of each
planet. These quantities can be derived from elevation sight-
ings using the astrolabe as a mechanical calculator.
The front of the astrolabe consists of two pieces pinned
together with a screw as shown in Fig. 1. The main body of
the instrument is usually held stationary and contains etch-ings of elevation contours, which are drawn using stereo-
graphic projection. Since the north celestial pole’s elevation
depends on one’s latitude, the elevation contours on the
astrolabe also depend on one’s latitude; compare the instru-
ments shown in Fig. 2.
The back of the main body contains a scale for taking ele-
vation sightings. My astrolabe also contains a plot of the
equation of time for translating between local apparent solar
time and local mean solar time. These two scales are shown
in Fig. 3.
The stars are etched on a clear sheet of plastic known as
the star chart (Fig. 4); this is free to rotate over the main
body and shows the locations of several bright stars.
On the star chart, the right ascension and declination coor-
dinates of each star are represented using polar coordinates
via stereographic projection. The right ascension is indicated
around the circumference of the star chart in hours with each
hour being equivalent to 15
/C14.
Circles of constant declination are concentric with the cen-
ter screw. In an astrolabe for the northern hemisphere, the
north celestial pole at declination 90/C14is placed at the center
screw. Stars with positive declinations (for example,
Capella) appear inside the celestial equator on the chart,
while those with negative declinations (for example, Sirius)appear outside the celestial equator. For a southern hemi-
sphere astrolabe, the south celestial pole (declination /C090
/C14)
is at the screw, and the stars would appear in different loca-tions on the chart as a result.
Because the star chart is drawn with stereographic pro-
jection, angles (but not areas) are preserved. This makes it

possible to identify certain constellations on the astrolabe,
because their stars are in their correct positions relative to
each other. Circles in the sky not passing through the south
celestial pole appear as circles on the star chart. Because ofthis, the ecliptic plane deﬁned by the Earth and the Sun
appears as a circle drawn on the chart whose center is offset
by roughly 23 :4
/C14from the celestial pole.14
The Sun’s right ascension increases at a mean rate of
approximately (1/365.25) degrees per day, so it completes a
counterclockwise circuit on the star chart once per year. Thechart shown in Fig. 4has a calendar scale plotted around
its circumference that allows the user to place the Sun at its
proper location along the ecliptic for any date. This is
explained in further detail in the supplementary material.I live in a light-polluted suburb of Washington, DC, from
which only a few bright stars are visible.15After a few ses-
sions of observing, I determined that 12 frequently visible
stars could serve as “guide stars”; these are the ones plottedon the star chart of my astrolabe (Fig. 4).
Determining star positions in right ascension and declina-
tion has been an important task for astronomers since antiq-
uity. All 12 of my guide stars have published right ascension
and declination coordinates from the European Space
Agency’s Hipparcos mission. Although these data are sub-stantially more accurate than necessary, they are formatted
in a way that makes drawing the star chart with a computer
very easy.
16If these high-quality data were not available,
one could resort to using the astrolabe itself to make these

measurements; Chaucer gave detailed instructions for this
task (Ref. 13, Sec. II and Refs. 17and18).
III. USING THE ASTROLABE
The astrolabe is a capable instrument, but it is not
completely straightforward to use. While the reader isencouraged to read Chaucer’s Treatise in its entirety, this
article outlines the basic tasks necessary for measuring the
orbits of planets. Some of the tasks that one needs to accom-plish depend on others, as shown in Fig. 5. These are dis-
cussed in more detail in the supplementary material.
Here are a few hints that the aspiring astrolabe user should
consider:
•Practice sighting objects of known dimensions during thedaytime before attempting nighttime sightings. Theauthor’s video demonstrates the basic procedure.
17
•Make sure that the astrolabe hangs freely from its toploop. Rather than hanging the astrolabe’s ring from one’sﬁnger, hang the astrolabe from a loop of string passedthrough the ring.
•Adjust the tension on the center screw so that the sightingpointer does not drift after being set. Once you have thepointer aligned with an object, make sure to avoid bump-ing the pointer until you have read it.
•Avoid sighting during windy conditions.•Wait for the instrument to stop moving between each
adjustment of the sighting pointer, and make only small
corrections to the pointer as you sight an object.
•Do not look directly at the Sun. Instead, cast a shadowwith the astrolabe and its pointer.
•Take a few sightings of an object and average them to
reduce the elevation error.
•Take sightings of as many guide stars as possible, then
attempt to “split the difference” across their locations onthe astrolabe (Ref. 13, Sec. II.5).
•Sighting Venus during the daytime is a challenge. Consult
the author’s video for detailed instructions.18
The astrolabe incorporates an elevation sighting scale on
its back (see Fig. 3). Taking a sighting is basically the same
as doing so with a theodolite, sextant, or similar instrument.
First, locate the object you wish to sight. Use your right
hand to hold the astrolabe from a loop of string passedthrough the thumb ring at the top, so that the back face of
the astrolabe is on your left. Plant your feet ﬁrmly on the
ground facing the object, holding the astrolabe at eye level.When the astrolabe stops swinging, carefully align the main
body of the instrument and back pointer so that the object
“just skims” the top edge of the pointer. Then you can readthe elevation of the object from the outermost scale on the
back of the astrolabe.

Amusingly (to me, anyway), Chaucer concluded his
brief instructions on how to take a sighting by saying

method for locating the Sun.

“This chapitre is so general ever in oon, that ther nedith no
more declaracioun; but forget it nat” (Ref. 13, Sec. II.2).
Loosely translated, this can be expressed as “We’ll be using
this so frequently that I won’t bother to mention taking ele-vation sightings again, but don’t forget how to do it.” This
may be true, but taking accurate elevation sightings required
more practice than I expected!
Even if one does not learn anything else about the astro-
labe, taking elevation sightings is a useful navigational skill
since it can be used to determine one’s latitude. To the accu-
racy of my astrolabe (which is about 2
/C14/C03/C14, according to
Table IIin Sec. VI A ), one merely needs to sight the eleva-
tion of Polaris.
Interestingly, Polaris was about 4/C14away from the north
celestial pole during Chaucer’s time, yielding an angular dif-ference that is detectable with my astrolabe. Chaucer
describes three options to deal with this [Ref. 13, Sec. II and
Refs. 23–25 ], each of which is a rather more elaborate pro-
cess than sighting Polaris. These options are still useful
when locating the north celestial pole using a telescope.
IV. ASTROLABES IN THE CLASSROOM
Astrolabes have been used for teaching basic astronomical
concepts since antiquity, and using astrolabe-based data inthe classroom opens many pedagogical opportunities. A few
are described in the following paragraphs.
11,19
A. Astrolabe fabrication
There are plans for complete, ready-to-use astrolabes from
a variety of sources.3,4,20,21For timekeeping activities, lami-
nated paper works well as a material for the main body, anda printable overhead transparency can be used for the star
chart. A folded laminated strip of cardboard attached with a
brass fastener can serve as the pointer. An instructor canprint a set of plans before a class, during which students can
construct their astrolabes. After students have completed
their astrolabes, it is a good exercise to “try them out” usingthe instructions in Sec. III. If Polaris is visible, sightings of
its elevation should closely match one’s latitude.
For projects requiring more extensive data collection, stur-
dier materials, such as wood or laser cut plastic,
22are prefer-
able. My ﬁrst astrolabe consisted of printed sheets of paperglued to thin plywood; these can be made without access to a
sophisticated workshop.
23The dataset described in this arti-
cle uses two sizes of 1/4 in. thick plastic astrolabes roughly 4in. and 8 in. in diameter. Students at my university have suc-
cessfully constructed their own laser cut astrolabes from my
plans with limited instructor supervision.
The center pin of a wooden or plastic astrolabe should be
what engineers call a “location ﬁt.” There is no side-play in
the pin, but it stills allows rotational movement of the star
chart and pointers. My plans are conﬁgured so that a USstandard 6–32 machine screw gives location ﬁt with no fur-
ther intervention. After three years of near-daily use, there is
no visible wear on any part of the instrument except forsome scratches on the star chart. If a different size screw is
desired, a good ﬁt can be obtained by making the center
holes initially a little too small. After they are cut, the holescan be carefully widened until the screw just passes. The
classic clock maker’s tool for this job is called a “broach,”
though the reader can certainly improvise an alternative tool.B. Offline astrolabe data analysis
For instructors not wishing to manage the construction of
astrolabes, the dataset presented in this article provides
numerous opportunities to teach students about statistical
properties of measurement errors. The entire dataset and all
source code for running the analyses described in Secs. VI
andVIIare available from the author’s public GitHub repos-
itory.
24The author has used these data to illustrate important
statistical distributions (particularly the normal distribution)
in elementary classes. Students can also analyze the statistics
of timekeeping errors, as described in Secs. VI A andVI B .
Several kinds of errors are present in the data. By consider-
ing the steps shown in Fig. 5, students can devise analyses to
isolate these errors from each other.
C. Week project: Using the astrolabe to tell time
The astrolabe is an ideal way to teach timekeeping.
Students would need to master the skills leading up to
“Reading the local apparent solar time” in Fig. 5with the
skills downstream of that point being optional. These skills
are explained in the supplementary material. Laminated
paper astrolabes are sufﬁcient for timekeeping. Since taking
sightings requires some practice (and clear weather), a mini-
mum of two class meetings should be devoted to developing
this skill. Once these skills are mastered, determining thetime can be completed in a few minutes.
Historically, printing errors were substantial,10but they
should be minimal with a modern printer or laser cutter.
Students can estimate the other kinds of errors in their sight-
ings using the techniques described in Sec. VI.
D. Month project: Measuring the orbit of Venus
Measuring the orbit of Venus is a feasible activity given
about a month of class meetings. It does require preplanningto ensure that students are able to collect sightings of Venus
near its furthest apparent distance in the sky from the Sun,
that is, when it is at maximum solar elongation. Not every
semester would present such an opportunity. In order to col-
lect the data (timeseries of the right ascensions of Venus and
the Sun), students must master the steps leading up to
“Computing right ascension” in Fig. 5. Although laminated
paper astrolabes might work for this task, those made with
more durable materials are more accurate and easier to use.Once the data are collected, the analysis described in Secs.
VII A orVII B will allow the class to derive estimates of
Venus’s orbital diameter.
E. A more ambitious project: Measuring the orbits
of other planets
Once a student has mastered the astrolabe, the only thing
preventing them from measuring orbits of the other planetsis time. My dataset contains just over three years of sight-
ings. As Sec. VIIshows, this is certainly sufﬁcient and pro-
vides some margin for error and missing data.
V. DESCRIPTION OF MY DATASET
Using astrolabes I fabricated, I carried out 773 observing
sessions over the course of three years. Most of the observa-
tions were collected with two laser-cut plastic astrolabes, a
smaller one with a 4 in. diameter and a larger one with an
748 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 10, October 2022 Michael Robinson 748 04 October 2023 23:18:25
8 in. diameter. I made 2093 distinct elevation sightings as
summarized in Table I. In each session, I recorded the cur-
rent time from my computer’s clock, the elevations of all vis-
ible planets, and the elevations of all visible guide stars. I
avoided taking sightings during windy conditions to mini-
mize errors. Although it would have been preferable to takesightings from the same location, my view of the sky is
obstructed by several large trees. I, therefore, had to move to
various locations in my yard (roughly a square 50 m on a
side) in order to collect all sightings for a given observing
session. The reader is encouraged to examine the data andthe associated analysis script, which was used to draw many
of the ﬁgures in this article.
24
With the exception of the daytime sightings of Venus, I
used no optical aid other than the astrolabe. Venus can be
seen during the daytime without optical aid under ideal con-
ditions. This requires knowing where to look ﬁrst, for whichbinoculars are helpful. Once acquired, the elevation angle to
Venus can then be sighted with the astrolabe. Since this is a
somewhat challenging procedure, I have documented it in a
video.18
VI. DETERMINING THE ACCURACY OF
OBSERVATIONS WITH THE ASTROLABE
Before embarking on computing the orbits of planets, it is
useful to determine the accuracy of the measurements one
can collect. Since the process for deriving time and right
ascension measurements involves several steps, it is impor-tant to check the accuracy at several points along the process
shown in Fig. 5.
A. Elevation accuracy
Using known positions of the Sun and stars, it is an exer-
cise in spherical trigonometry to translate these positionsinto elevation angles at any given location and time on the
Earth. These values can be compared with the elevation
sightings collected with the astrolabe. The elevation errors
appear to follow a normal distribution (see the supplemen-
tary material), which indicates that the errors are not skewed.The overall statistics are summarized in Table II.
A two-sample t-test from Table IIyields p¼0.005, so
there is a signiﬁcant difference in mean elevation estimationerror for the Sun versus the stars. In short, the Sun estimates
are a little more centered than those of the stars. I suspect
that this difference has to do with the design of my particular
instrument and the techniques I used. To sight a star, the usermust “skim” the star along the top edge of the pointer. This
tends to bias the estimates lower in elevation, because an
overestimate means that the pointer obstructs view of thestar. To measure the Sun, one casts a shadow with the pointer
and tries to minimize its apparent size. The procedure for
measuring the Sun appears to have less elevation bias thandirectly sighting a star.
A related instrument, the mariner’s astrolabe , is optimized
for sighting the Sun. The pointer on the mariner’s astrolabe
has two vanes, each perforated by a tiny hole through whichthe sunlight may pass only when the correct elevation is dis-
played. The mariner’s astrolabe can be used to obtain sub-
stantially better accuracy than what I was able to collect,typically 0 :1
/C14for skilled users on land.7–9
In what follows, sightings obtained with both my four and
eight-inch astrolabes are pooled. One would generally expect
that the larger instrument would give noticeably better eleva-tion accuracy, since the elevation scale is larger. However, Ifound no statistically signiﬁcant difference in accuracy
between them. I suspect that this effect is caused by the
straightness of the sighting pointers. Over the course of threeyears, the larger astrolabe’s sighting pointer has become a bit
more warped than that of the smaller one.
B. Time and longitude accuracy
The local mean solar time can be compared with my zone
time (Eastern Standard Time). Using either the Sun or starsresults in n¼765 distinct time estimates; the remaining
773–765 ¼7 observing sessions are instances where not
enough data were collected to uniquely determine the time.For these estimates, the distribution is close to normal; the
mean difference was—7.4 min and the standard deviation
was 57 min.
The length of a daytime observing session is quite short
(typically, one or two elevation sightings), while nighttime
sessions are typically longer. It would not be surprising if
there were a difference in the time error for day vs nightobserving sessions. Moreover, there is a signiﬁcant differ-
ence between elevation errors for the Sun vs the stars (see
Sec. VI A ). However, in the face of these potential problems,
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test shows no signiﬁcant
difference between time estimates derived from the Sun in
the daytime vs the stars at night.
By international agreement, UTC is the local mean solar
time at 0
/C14longitude.25Longitude is, therefore, obtained by
subtracting the local mean time determined from the UTC
time and converting to degrees of longitude by multiplyingby 15
/C14per hour. My computer’s clock provides an accurate
common time reference, which is aligned to the local mean
solar time at 75/C14West longitude. The difference of –7.4 min
noted above translates to a longitude of 76 :85/C14West, which
is, therefore, an estimate of my home longitude. This is about
13 km off from the true value, which is close to 77/C14West.
C. Right ascension accuracy
In Sec. VII, we will use the time series of right ascension
measurements of a planet to estimate its orbit. Therefore, itTable I. Number of elevation sightings collected by object.

is important to measure the accuracy of the right ascension
measurements obtained with the astrolabe.
In addition to the right ascension measurements of each
planet, I also predicted the expected right ascensions with acomputer algorithm based on Kepler’s laws in combinationwith modern values of the orbital elements.
26Each right
ascension obtained using the astrolabe can be compared withthese expected values; the discrepancies are summarized inTable III.
Chaucer claimed (Ref. 13, Sec. II.3) that right ascension
errors can be noticeably worse when an object is nearly due
south; this is because the elevation contours drawn on the
astrolabe become tangent to the object’s path through thesky. For instance, in Fig. 6, the impact of a 62
/C14elevation
error appears to depend signiﬁcantly on whether the star isnear due south (the vertical line of symmetry of the astro-labe) or not. Chaucer cautioned readers that
But natheles, in general, wolde I warne thee for evere, ne
mak thee nevere bold to have take a iust ascendent by thynAstrolabie, or elles to have set iustly a clokke, whan anycelestial body by which that thou wenest governe thilkethinges ben ney the south lyne.
In general, I warn you not to measure a right ascension of
a celestial body using your astrolabe—or use it to set yourclock—if it is near due south.
This claim can be tested using my data. Figure 7displays
right ascension error as a function of azimuth for the planets.While there is a noticeable discontinuity at due south, the
error does not change much as due south is approached from
either side. While the largest errors—which may be consid-ered outliers—do seem more pronounced near due south, Ithink that Chaucer was being overly cautious.
The design of Chaucer’s instrument was quite similar to
mine, though he was based in Oxford, England at latitude51
/C14500. Oxford is substantially further north than my home
latitude of 39/C14, which makes the tangency between elevation
and declination contours more severe; notice the differencein contours shown in Fig. 2. It may be that Chaucer’s advice
is sound in his location, especially when the instrument is inthe hands of a beginner.
I believe that an explanation for the discontinuity in Fig. 7
at azimuth 180
/C14could be due to buildings that blocked my
view of the sky. The walls of my house are closely aligned
with north/south and east/west, so it is very easy to tell if anobject has passed due south by simply sighting along one ofthe outer walls of the house. If an object appears east of duesouth (so its azimuth is less than 180
/C14), I am apparently less
likely to check if this is truly the case. Such an error (mistak-enly choosing a right ascension that is currently east as
opposed to west) would cause its right ascension error to be
positive.
VII. ESTIMATING THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS
From my location I was able to observe Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn (see Fig. 9and Table III). Although
Mercury is certainly visible without optical aid, its maximum
elevation is too low to be consistently observed from my
location. I made no observations of Uranus or Neptune; bothare difﬁcult targets without a telescope and were unknown toChaucer.
Knowing the right ascension of a planet is not sufﬁcient to
place it in its true location in space, nor can it be used todetermine an orbit without further information. The keyinsight that allows one to make the leap from right ascen-
sions to orbital dimensions is provided by Kepler’s laws,
which connect orbital dimensions to orbital periods. The lat-ter can be derived from a time series of right ascensions, asexplained below.

where k>0 is a constant of proportionality, which depends
on the mass of the Sun and the Newtonian gravitational con-stant G.
Directly measuring the orbital period of a planet is compli-
cated by the fact that both the planet and the Earth are in
motion. Fortunately, the planet’s orbital period can be esti-
mated using a geometric trick that works because the planetslie close to the ecliptic. There are distinct times when theSun, the Earth, and the planet are (nearly) colinear in space.
These times are called solar oppositions or solar conjunc-
tions, depending on whether the planet and the Sun are onopposite or the same side of the Earth, respectively. The pathof a planet and the Earth between two consecutive solar
oppositions or conjunctions is shown in Fig. 8. The time
interval between two consecutive conjunctions or opposi-tions is called the synodic period of the planet.
Kepler’s second law states that if a planet’s orbit is circu-
lar, then it will move at a constant angular speed over its
entire orbit. All four planets I observed have orbits that are
close enough to circular to assume that this is so.
Over one synodic period T(days), the angular distance
traveled by the Earth is approximately
2p
T
365rad:
Over the same period of time, a planet outside Earth’s orbit
will traverse only
2pT/C0365
365rad:
Let us use the Earth’s orbit as a yardstick for both radius and
period. That is, for the Earth, r¼1 astronomical unit (AU)
andT¼365 days, so that
k¼ð1=365ÞðAU3=day2Þ:
Therefore, Kepler’s third law asserts that for an outer planet
(one whose orbit lies outside Earth’s orbit), the semi-majoraxis rin astronomical units is given by
r¼T
T/C0365/C18/C192=3
AU: (2)
The situation is reversed for an inner planet. In this case,
the planet never exhibits solar oppositions since the planetcannot be on the opposite side from the Earth as the Sun. As
a result, the planet oscillates between solar conjunctions on
opposite sides of the Sun. The synodic period Tis the time inEarth days between two of the same kind of conjunction.
This leads to
r¼T
Tþ365/C18/C192=3
AU: (3)
A. Using the synodic period
The synodic period of a planet is the key to unlocking its
orbital dimensions and can be derived from time series ofright ascensions. Because the synodic period relates theEarth’s and the planet’s orbits to each other using conjunc-tions or oppositions, it helps one to subtract the planet’s rightascensions from the Sun’s right ascensions. The resultingdifferences, called solar elongations, have the convenientproperty that 0 h correspond to conjunctions and 612 h to
oppositions.
Figure 9shows the solar elongations of each of my plane-
tary sightings over my entire dataset. One thing that is imme-diately apparent is that Venus never appears in solar
opposition in my data. Especially taking into account the
daytime sightings, it appears on both sides of the Sun.
Therefore, one would have expected that if they were possi-ble, solar oppositions of Venus would be present. We knowthat Venus is an inner planet, because it never appears
Fig. 8. The synodic period for a planet whose orbit is outside Earth’s orbit is the time between (a) solar oppositions and (b) solar conjunctions.

“outside” Earth’s orbit. Moreover, a hint of sinusoidal varia-
tion is visible for the Venus sightings in Fig. 9. Thus, it
seems reasonable to claim that I have directly observed
Venus orbiting the Sun instead of the Earth . Unassailable
proof of this is credited to Galileo’s telescopic observation
of the phases of Venus in time with this sinusoidal variation.
This does not establish that the Sun is at the center of thesolar system, only that Venus orbits the Sun. Because theother three planets exhibit solar oppositions, we must con-clude that they are outer planets.
The synodic period is measured between consecutive
oppositions or conjunctions, though it is clear from Fig. 9that
I did not observe many of these events directly. Fortunately,the synodic period can also be estimated by considering thetime interval between recurrences of a solar elongation. Thatis, the synodic period is the time between consecutive cross-ings of an arbitrary horizontal line in Fig. 9.
As an example, I saw Saturn on 6 October 2020 at solar
elongation 6.1 h, and again at that same solar elongation on
23 October 2021. Both of these observations correspond topoints in Fig. 9. Together, these two observations suggest a
synodic period estimate of 382 days. Using this as the syn-odic period results in an estimate of 7.96 AU for Saturn’ssemi-major axis. Over the entirety of my data, there are
many such possible recurrences.
Although a given solar elongation may not recur exactly,
there are many cases where a similar solar elongation occurslater in the data. To capture these “approximate recurrences,”solar elongations were grouped into 2-h bins. Each pair ofobservations in each bin corresponds to a possible approxi-
mate recurrence of that solar elongation, and the time inter-
val between them is then an estimate of the planet’s synodicperiod. Figure 10(a) shows the distribution of these estimates
for the synodic periods.
Because binning also collects observations of the same
opposition or conjunction rather than a recurrence, shortintervals must be removed. Intervals greater than 200 days
between observations in these bins correspond to instances
where the planet had re-appeared in the same relative loca-tion and were used. All of these time intervals between pairsof observations in these bins were aggregated into adistribution, shown in Fig. 10(a) . Each of these time intervals
was used to estimate the orbital semi-major axis using Eq.
(2)(for the outer planets) or Eq. (3)(for Venus). The result-
ing estimates are shown in Fig. 10(b) and Table IV. Note
that the counts in the ncolumn of Table IVcorrespond to
pairs of sightings, and so differ from the number of sightings
of each planet in Table III.
B. The case of Venus
Because I collected numerous observations of Venus on
both sides of the Sun, we can cross-check estimates of its
orbit by another method that does not rely on Kepler’s laws.
This is to use geometry to directly estimate the orbital radiusfrom Venus’s largest solar elongation, if we assume that its
orbit is circular. The geometry of this situation is shown in
Fig.11(a) , where his the maximum elongation. We can read
off the maximum values of solar elongation directly from
Fig.9.
The geometry in Fig. 11(a) indicates that we only need to
estimate the maximum solar elongation. When this maximum
occurs, the angle between the Sun-Venus and Earth-Venus
segments is a right angle. (If a telescope is available, Venus
will appear as a half-disk at this time.) If there were noerrors, the distribution of these observations would have a
single sharp peak at the maximum solar elongation with no
observations larger than this value. To estimate this sharppeak, we can simply use every observation of Venus to
derive an estimate of Venus’s orbital radius by taking the
mode of the resulting distribution. (Taking the maximumvalue of solar elongation has the unfortunate consequence of
Fig. 10. Distribution of estimates for (a) the synodic periods and (b) the orbital semi-major axes of the four planets observed in the dataset. Accepte d ﬁgures
for the orbital semi-major axes are as follows: Venus 0.72 AU, Mars 1.5 AU, Jupiter 5.2 AU, and Saturn 9.6 AU. Notice that the widths of the box plots (thei r
inter-quartile ranges) of the semi-major axis for Venus and Mars are quite small.

also selecting the largest solar elongation error. The mode
tends to be less impacted by the errors.)
Figure 11(b) shows the distribution of estimates obtained
by computing the sine of the solar elongation of Venus, in
which a total of n¼47 observations were available. The dis-
tribution of these radius estimates has a fairly heavy left tail,corresponding to the points in time where Venus was not atits maximum apparent distance from the Sun. This tail is notvery relevant, since we are most interested in the maximum
value represented. To estimate maximum, we can use themode, which is 0.650 AU. The standard deviation for the
observations is 0.131 AU. The true value of 0.723 AU is
within one standard deviation of 0.650 AU, so we concludethat using geometry alone yields a good estimate of Venus’sorbital radius.
VIII. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE EXPLORATIONS
The data I collected
24can be used to answer many other
questions beyond those described here. For instance, I also
collected sightings of the Moon, including its phase. Canthese determine the Moon’s orbit closely enough to be ableto predict its location in the future? How does the errordepend on the forecast length?
There is also the possibility of using a telescope in con-
junction with the astrolabe to collect measurements of fainterobjects. Using a telescope, I have already collected a fewobservations of the phases of Venus. Even though they can-
not be seen by the unaided eye, even a small telescope allows
one to track the planets Uranus and Neptune. I have seenUranus through a telescope a handful of times and perhapseven Neptune, but not enough to perform any systematicanalysis.
If one is especially ambitious, the techniques explained in
this article could be made to work for minor planets such asVesta or Ceres. Some of the minor planets are sufﬁciently
close to the ecliptic that the techniques here can work with-
out modiﬁcation. For minor planets whose orbital planes arenot as closely aligned with the ecliptic as the major planets,one could use Chaucer’s instructions to determine theirdeclinations (Ref. 13, Sec. II.30). With these in hand,Kepler’s laws could help predict the orbits of minor planets.
This might be a challenging and rewarding exercise to
attempt.
Finally, one might consider several other studies in how
the astrolabe’s performance varies with changes to either its
construction or its usage. For instance, it stands to reason
that larger astrolabes might yield more accurate sightings.
One could fabricate several instruments from a few inches in
diameter to nearly a meter and collect a few months’ worth
of sightings to compare them.
IX. CONCLUSION
Table IVafﬁrms that given enough data (a few years’
worth), an astrolabe can help you measure the solar system,
even if you do not have dark skies. I have demonstrated that
it is possible to measure:
(1) one’s latitude and longitude to around 1
/C14,
(2) the time to within 30 min consistently, often much
better,
(3) the current locations of objects in the sky, and(4) the size of the orbits of the nearby planets.
Based on the observations of Venus, you can even suggest
that some planets orbit the Sun, and not the Earth. When sup-
plemented with daytime observations, the solar elongations
of Venus indicate that no oppositions ever occur, a clear sig-
nal that it orbits the Sun. Admittedly, to make the daytime
observations of Venus I had to use binoculars to “acquire”
the sighting, even though the astrolabe was used to measure
the elevation. This is perhaps an overly modern advantage.
Even without an astrolabe, the reader should go outside at
night and look at the night sky. It is beautiful and there are
many things to be learned.
