We discuss an investigation of students’ difﬁculties with systems of non-interacting identical
particles. The investigation was carried out in advanced quantum mechanics courses at both theundergraduate and graduate levels by administering free-response and multiple-choice questions
and conducting individual interviews with students. This research on student difﬁculties was used
as a guide to develop and evaluate a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) that helpsstudents develop a functional understanding of the concepts necessary for determining the many-
particle Hamiltonian and stationary state wavefunctions for a system of non-interacting identical
particles.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum mechanics (QM) is a particularly challenging
subject for students.1–20Our group has been investigating
student reasoning in QM21–28and using it as a guide for
improving student understanding of QM.29–34For example,
we have focused on using the common student difﬁculties as
a guide to develop research-based learning tools that include
Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILTs),35–46
which strive to improve student understanding of QM con-
cepts. However, there have been very limited investigations
into student difﬁculties with concepts involving a system ofidentical particles.
Here, we discuss an investigation of student difﬁculties
with fundamentals of a system of non-interacting identical
particles. That research was used as a guide in the develop-ment, validation, and in-class evaluation of a QuILT thathelps students develop a good grasp of relevant concepts.
We found common student difﬁculties that can hinder their
development of a consistent and coherent knowledge struc-ture pertaining to these concepts. Below, we start with a brief
background of relevant concepts and then describe the con-
text of the investigation, common student difﬁculties, thestructure of the QuILT that takes into account these difﬁcul-
ties found via research, and the in-class implementation of
the QuILT.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Classification of identical particles: Fermions
and bosons
In nature, there are two general types of fundamental or
composite particles: fermions with a half-integer spin quan-
tum number (e.g., electrons and protons) and bosons with aninteger spin quantum number (e.g., photons and mesons).
For a system of identical particles in classical mechanics
(e.g., ﬁve identical tennis balls), each particle can be distin-guished from all the other particles. In contrast, in QM, iden-
tical particles are indistinguishable: if the coordinates of two
identical particles are interchanged, there is no physicalobservable that would reﬂect this interchange. The wave-
function for a system of identical fermions must be
completely antisymmetric, and the wavefunction for asystem of identical bosons must be completely symmetric
with respect to exchange of two particles.
B. Consequences of symmetrization postulate
In a two-semester upper-level undergraduate quantum
mechanics course, most quantum mechanics instructorsteach identical particles and the symmetrization postulate.
Learning about identical particles and their exchange statis-
tics is important for understanding behavior of multi-electron atoms, molecules, and solids, as well as understand-ing the physics of muons, mesons, deuterons, Higgs bosons,and neutrinos. The properties of the systems of identical par-ticles govern everything from the chemistry of microscopicatoms and molecules to the formation of large-scale struc-tures such as white dwarf and neutron stars. For example,when students ﬁrst learn about atoms beyond the hydrogenatom in the periodic table (e.g., helium, lithium), they areintroduced to Hund’s rules, which follow from this under-standing of identical particles, to ﬁgure out the ground stateconﬁguration of the atoms.
The indistinguishability of identical particles also has con-
sequences for statistical properties of matter. Whether amaterial will behave as a metal, an insulator, or a semicon-ductor is determined by the fact that electrons are identicalparticles. In particular, how the electrons ﬁll the energybands in the materials is determined by understanding of theproperties of identical particles. The electrons obey the Pauliexclusion principle, which is rooted in the fact that they are
identical particles that have exchange statistics that are dif-
ferent from those of photons and other bosons.
The concept of Fermi energy, the idea that electrons ﬁll up
all of the lowest energy states until they reach a maximumFermi energy, relies on the fact that the multi-electron sys-tem consists of identical fermions. This idea has relevance inexplaining the difference between conductors and insulators,but can also be used to understand the stability of whitedwarf and neutron stars. Students can make sense of theseissues and even calculate the radius of a white dwarf withbasic understanding of identical particles. The neutron starwould not be stable if the neutrons were bosons. All of thisphysics pervades the universe and is important to introduceto students when they are learning upper-level quantummechanics.

C. Many-particle formulation
Here, we focus on the many-particle Hamiltonian and sta-
tionary state wavefunctions that are solutions to the Time-
Independent Schr €odinger Equation (TISE) for a system of
non-interacting identical particles. Unless otherwise stated,
here we will refer to the stationary state wavefunction as thewavefunction. The many-particle Hamiltonian for the system
ofNnon-interacting identical particles in the product space
is
^H¼^H

where the single-particle Hamiltonian, ^Hi, and the identity
operator, ^Ii, for the ith particle are in the M-dimensional
Hilbert space Hi. We will use the following shorthand nota-
tion for the many-particle Hamiltonian:
^H¼X
i^Hi¼^H1þ^H2þ^H3þ/C1/C1/C1þ ^HN; (2)
in which ^Hi¼^I1/C10^I2/C10/C1/C1/C1/C10 ^Ii/C01/C10^Hi/C10^Iiþ1/C1/C1/C1/C10 ^INis
the Hamiltonian of the ith particle in the MNdimensional
product space. Thus, in the rest of this paper, all the bold-face Hamiltonians act on the product space. We ﬁnd that
giving students an opportunity to think about the connec-
tions between the single-particle and many-particle
Hamiltonian using the tensor product notation is impor-
tant for helping them develop a good grasp of theseconcepts.
In order to determine the many-particle wavefunction for
a system of non-interacting identical particles, one must ﬁrst
solve the single-particle TISE, written as ^H
iwnjðxiÞ
¼EnjwnjðxiÞ, for the ith particle in the state wnjðxiÞ. The next
step is to treat the particles as if they were distinguishableand construct the many-particle stationary state wavefunc-
tions. These product states are then used as basis states to
construct the correct wavefunctions for identical fermions orbosons by permuting the labels for the states or the coordi-
nates. For convenience, we will refer to all direct products of
single-particle states as “basis states,” regardless of their
symmetry under exchange. For distinguishable particles, all
basis states are allowed, but for indistinguishable particles,the states must be appropriately symmetrized combinations
of these basis states. For identical fermions, only completely
antisymmetric linear combinations of these basis states are
allowed, while for bosons only completely symmetric linear
combinations are allowed. For example, if two electronsare in single-particle states denoted by w
n1andwn2, then
the normalized two-particle wavefunction is Wðx1;x2Þ
¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p/C0/C1
½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ/C0wn2ðx1Þwn1ðx2Þ/C138, if we assume
the electrons are non-interacting and ignore spin. The
completely antisymmetric wavefunction reﬂects the fact thatone electron is in the single-particle state w
n1and the other
electron is in the single-particle state wn2, but we cannot say
which electron is in which single-particle state. It is consis-
tent with Pauli’s exclusion principle, since if n1¼n2, then
the wavefunction vanishes. In the case of bosons, thecompletely symmetric wavefunction (again, ignoring spin)
isWðx

2p/C0/C1
½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þþwn2ðx1Þwn1ðx2Þ/C138,
which does not vanish in the case that n1¼n2.When considering the spin part of the wavefunction for a
single particle, we will use the notation jsi;msii(in which si
andmsiare the quantum numbers corresponding to the total
spin and z-component of the spin for the ith particle, respec-
tively). The states js1;ms1iare eigenstates of ^S2
1and ^S1z, and
the states js2;ms2iare eigenstates of ^S2
2and ^S2z. We will use
the following abbreviated notation for a spin-1/2 particle:j" i

/C01=2i1for electron 1 in the “spin-up” and “spin-down”
states, respectively, and similarly for electron 2.

two spin-1/2 particles in the representation in the product spacein which the sub-spaces can be decoupled, we will use thenotation j"i

III. CONTEXT OF INVESTIGATION
Student difﬁculties were investigated over three consecu-
tive years using individual responses to open-ended ques-tions after traditional instruction in relevant concepts from25 upper-level undergraduate students in the second semesterof a junior/senior-level QM course and 30 ﬁrst-year physicsgraduate students in the second semester of the graduate coreQM course at the University of Pittsburgh. Additional insightwas gained from responses of 14 students during individual
interviews (see additional details in the supplementary mate-
rial
56). We had previously administered multiple-choice
clicker questions to undergraduates, and these results helpedto inform our studies. Undergraduates had previously com-pleted modern physics at the sophomore level, whichinvolves a more conceptual introduction to quantummechanics including systems of identical particles with afocus on many-electron atoms. Other pre-requisites for themwere linear algebra, upper-level classical mechanics, andelectricity and magnetism. The undergraduate course text-books were by Grifﬁths
47or Townsend48(depending on the
instructor’s choice). The graduate course required the text-
book by Sakurai and Napolitano,49but students were encour-
aged to consult other textbooks.50–54The ﬁrst semester of
both the undergraduate and graduate QM courses covered
111 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Keebaugh, Marshman, and Singh 111 04 October 2023 23:01:50
non-relativistic QM of single particles, with identical par-
ticles being introduced early in both the undergraduate and
graduate second-semester courses.
Student difﬁculties were investigated using the questions
Q1–Q5 shown in Table I. Table Ialso shows the correspond-
ing learning objectives. Questions Q1 and Q2 were posed
during class both as pretests (after traditional instruction in
relevant concepts) and post-tests (after students engaged
with the QuILT and had submitted the completed QuILT as
homework). Questions Q3–Q5 were posed in individual
think-aloud interviews outside of class. The pretest and post-
test counted as quizzes (more details are in Ref. 55and
supplementary material56). In all the questions, the identical
particles are restricted to one spatial dimension for simplic-
ity. In some questions, students were asked to consider the
wavefunction of the many-particle system ignoring the spin
part of the wavefunction, but in other questions, they consid-
ered spin. In order to familiarize the students with the nota-
tion, in all situations, they were given that wn1ðx1Þand
wn2ðx2Þare the single-particle wavefunctions for particles in
states n1andn2and with coordinates x1andx2, respectively.
Similarly, the spin notation in Eq. (3)was also given to stu-
dents before they answered the questions.
IV. STUDENT DIFFICULTIES
A. Difficulty realizing that each indistinguishable
particle should have its own unique coordinate
Many students had difﬁculty with the fact that each quan-
tum particle in a system of identical particles is indistin-
guishable, but each particle is still expressed with a unique
coordinate. For example, on Q2, regardless of the type of
particle, there should be a unique coordinate for each identi-
cal particle in the three-particle wavefunction. However,
many students claimed that since there is no way to deter-mine which particle is in which single-particle state, there is
no way to assign a distinct coordinate to each indistinguish-
able particle. For example, one interviewed student incor-
rectly claimed that “we must use the coordinate xfor all the
indistinguishable particles since we don’t know where each
particle is.” He then noted that the many-particlewavefunction is w
n1ðxÞwn2ðxÞwn3ðxÞ. Table IIsummarizes
the number of students who displayed this type of difﬁculty
on question Q2 after traditional lecture-based instruction.
B. Difficulty realizing that the many-particle wavefunc-
tion must be written in terms of the product (not the
sum) of the single-particle wavefunctions
Question Q2 also probed whether students were able to
identify that the wavefunction for a system of identical par-
ticles must be expressed in terms of the direct product (asopposed to the sum) of the single-particle wavefunctions.For example, the wavefunction for a system of three fer-
mions (assuming n

Some students incorrectly expressed the many-particle
wavefunction in Q2 in terms of the sum (as opposed to the
direct product) of the single-particle wavefunctions, such asw
n1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þþwn3ðx3Þ. For example, one interviewed
student incorrectly stated that “since the particles do not
interact, the wavefunction will just be the sum of the (single-particle stationary state) wavefunctions.” This student was
later asked whether the wavefunction for a system ofTable I. The questions Q1–Q5 posed to students individually and the corresponding learning objectives (last column). Questions Q1 and Q2 were posed i n pre-
test (after traditional instruction) and post-test (after students engaged with the QuILT), and Q3–Q5 were posed in individual interviews.

identical particles is always expressed as the sum he had
written down or whether there are any situations in whichthe many-particle wavefunction must be written in terms ofthe direct product of the single-particle wavefunctions. Aftera moment of hesitation, the student stated that only “if theparticles were interacting, then the many-particle wavefunc-tion could be expressed as the product (of the single-particle)wavefunctions.” Table IIshows the percentages of students
who made this error.

In summary, weﬁnd that many students had difﬁculty realizing that themany-particle wavefunction should be expressed in terms ofa direct product of the single-particle states.
C. Difficulty with many-particle Hamiltonian and how
each term in a many-particle Hamiltonian would acton a many-particle state consisting of a productof single-particle states
In response to Q5, some students struggled to identify that
the operators in the Hilbert space of a given particle act onlyon the single-particle states of that particle. For example,when students were asked to evaluate the expression:
^H
1½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ/C138, some students incorrectly claimed that
“^H1½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼ 0, because ^H1only acts on wn1ðx1Þ
and ^H1wn2ðx2Þ¼0.” These students who provided such
responses struggled to realize that the operator ^H1is equiva-
lent to ^H1/C10^I2, in which ^H1acts on the subset of the Hilbert
space corresponding to particle 1 and the identity operator ^I2
acts on the subset of the Hilbert space corresponding to parti-
cle 2. The detailed difﬁculties with Q1 and Q5 are discussedin the supplementary material.56
D. Incorrectly determining the symmetry based on theappearance of a 1/2sign in the many-particle
wavefunction
The objective of question Q4 in Table Iis to investigate
students’ proﬁciency at identifying whether the spin part of awavefunction is a symmetric or antisymmetric wavefunction.Students were given Eq. (3)before this question and were
familiar with the shorthand notation used in Q4. Some stu-dents incorrectly applied a heuristic by which they claimedthat a wavefunction is symmetric if it is written in terms of asum. These students simply looked for all “ þ” signs to deter-
mine that a wavefunction is symmetric and looked for a “ /C0”
sign to determine whether a given wavefunction is antisym-metric. For example, in response to question Q4(a) and (b),one student incorrectly claimed that the spin part of thewavefunction given by j""i orj##i is neither symmetric nor
antisymmetric as “the wavefunction is not a sum so it cannotbe symmetric and there is not a minus sign, so it cannot beantisymmetric.”V. THE QUANTUM INTERACTIVE LEARNING
TUTORIAL
The details of the iterative development and implementa-
tion of the QuILT on identical particles are summarized in
the supplementary material.
56The QuILT is available on
Physport.55There are seven broad sections in the QuILT that
include a warm-up on many-particle formalism, wavefunc-tions without spin, wavefunctions with spin, determiningtotal energy (ﬁxed total energy of the system), determiningenergy (ﬁxed number of available single-particle states),accounting for degeneracy, and additional examples thatinstructors can have their students engage with. Instructorscan use any section or subsection of the QuILT with theirstudents. This paper only focuses on the basics of the identi-cal particles discussed in the warm-up and wavefunction sec-tions. The total time taken for all of the seven sections isroughly four hours in individual interviews in which studentswork through it while talking aloud. The sections discussedhere are estimated to take 2 h.
These seven sections were incorporated in an overall
three-part organization: the pretest, a guided inquiry-basedtutorial, and the post-test. The pretest is administered to thestudents after instruction covering systems of identical par-ticles. In this study, after completing the pretest, the under-graduates were given the tutorial in class and encouraged towork together in small groups; they completed any remain-ing part as homework. However, the tutorial can also beadministered as a self-paced learning tool that students canwork on as part of their weekly homework assignment (aswas the case for graduate students in this study). Upon com-pletion, students submit the tutorial for grading and are thengiven the post-test (similar to the pretest). The post-test isadministered in class as an individual assessment in whichthe students are not permitted any additional resourcesbeyond what is provided in the post-test. Students should begiven some grade incentive to engage deeply with the pre-test, tutorial, and post-test.
The QuILT framework emphasizes that after the instruc-
tors demonstrate for students how to use concepts to solveproblems (e.g., via lectures), students should be providedcoaching and support as they think through the conceptsthemselves before being able to solve problems on theirown. The QuILT is designed to help students engage withactive learning tasks by employing an inquiry-basedapproach that requires students to build their own knowledgestructure by answering questions, analyzing the validity ofstatements, and reﬂecting on what they have learned. Eachlearning sequence consists of several questions that build oneach other, requiring students to take a stand and activelyengage in the learning process. Similarly, the guided inquiry-based sequences often include a contradiction between theanswers to the questions in the sequence and students’ priorknowledge.
In case a hypothetical student dialogue did not have the
intended effect, checkpoints are provided at the end of eachsection that allows the students to go back to correct remain-ing misconceptions before moving on to the next section.Checkpoints either give further hints to help students resolvetheir difﬁculty or tell them which student is correct. Studentsare strongly encouraged to not look at the checkpoints untilthey encounter them in the QuILT because struggling withthe guided inquiry-based sequences ﬁrst and then encounter-ing the support in the checkpoints at appropriate places can
113 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 2, February 2022 Keebaugh, Marshman, and Singh 113 04 October 2023 23:01:50
strengthen their understanding. Below are examples from the
QuILT of support intended to help address some of the com-mon difﬁculties.
A. Helping students realize that the Hamiltonian for a
system of non-interacting identical particles should beexpressed as a sum of operators that act on states in the
product space
In a guided inquiry-based learning sequence in the QuILT,
students are asked to consider the following hypothetical stu-
dent conversation and to provide their reasoning for doing
so.
Student 1: In an inﬁnite square well, we are only permit-
ted to have one particle in the well. If the system has twonon-interacting identical particles, we MUST have two inﬁ-nite square wells in order to place each particle.
Student 2: I disagree. We can have two non-interacting
identical particles in the same inﬁnite square well.
Student 1 is incorrect and Student 2 is correct in the pre-
ceding conversation. Students also discuss that theHamiltonian for the system of two non-interacting identicalparticles in the same well in the product space is
^H¼^H
1þ^H2¼^H1/C10^I2þ^I1/C10^H2, where ^H1and ^H2are
the Hamiltonians in the subspaces for the individual par-
ticles. By using an example that is familiar to the studentsand by providing additional support, the QuILT helps stu-dents learn that the Hamiltonian for a system of non-interacting identical particles should be expressed as a sum
in the product space. Although tensor product notation is not
developed in Grifﬁths’s textbook, it is developed in the bookby Townsend used by one of the undergraduate instructorsand the book by Sakurai and Napolitano used by the graduateinstructor. The evaluation to be discussed later shows that allundergraduate students obtained perfect scores on Q1 after
engaging with the QuILT.
B. Helping students realize that each identical particle
should have its own unique coordinate
The QuILT helps students realize that each identical parti-
cle should have its own unique coordinate. The following isan excerpt from a hypothetical student conversation in the
QuILT regarding whether the single-particle wavefunctions
in a product state should have the same or different coordi-nates to properly specify a three-particle wavefunction for asystem of three non-interacting identical particles. The stu-dents must state which hypothetical student they agree with
and why.
Student 1: We must assign a different coordinate to each
identical particle. The wavefunction will have terms such asw
n1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þwn3ðx3Þ.
Student 2: No. I disagree with Student 1. When the par-
ticles are indistinguishable, we can’t possibly distinguishtheir individual coordinates. So the wavefunction will have
terms such as w
n1ðxÞwn2ðxÞwn3ðxÞ.
Student 1 is correct and Student 2 is incorrect: a unique
coordinate should be assigned to each identical particle.Follow-up guided inquiry-based learning sequences in theQuILT help students focus on the fact that the symmetryrequirement for the many-particle wavefunction is due to the
indistinguishability of the particles and that the indistin-
guishability is not represented by all particles having thesame coordinate (but by how the many-particlewavefunction is written). When the students are later asked
to construct symmetric and antisymmetric many-particlewavefunctions for various systems of identical particles withdifferent coordinates for each particle, they are asked toreﬂect upon how those wavefunctions take into account theindistinguishability of the particles.
C. Helping students realize that each term in the many-
particle stationary state wavefunction should beexpressed in terms of a direct product of single-particlewavefunctions
In the QuILT, students are asked to construct many-
particle wavefunctions and provided support to help themrealize that the many-particle wavefunction should beexpressed in terms of direct products of the single-particlewavefunctions. For example, they are asked to construct themany-particle wavefunction for a system of three indistin-guishable particles (identical fermions, identical bosons, andidentical particles that can be treated as distinguishable) inwhich the particles are in three different single-particle sta-tionary states (as in Q2). They are also asked to construct themany-particle wavefunction for a system in which two of the
three indistinguishable particles are in the same single-
particle state.
Additionally, students are asked to explicitly show that the
wavefunction Wðx
1;x2Þ¼wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þcannot be a
two-particle stationary-state wavefunction for theHamiltonian ^H¼^H
1þ^H2for a system of two non-
interacting identical particles. The instructional task below isan excerpt from a guided inquiry-based learning sequence inthe QuILT:
Instructional task Write the right-hand side without oper-
ators, if possible, in the following questions for a system oftwo non-interacting identical particles, whose single-particlewavefunctions satisfy the Time-Independent Schr €odinger
Equation (TISE), ^H
iwnjðxiÞ¼EnjwnjðxiÞfor the ith particle
with coordinate x iin the single-particle state given by n j.
Assume n 16¼n2. If it is not possible to write the right-hand
side without operators and without encountering difﬁcultiesor inconsistencies, explain why.
(a) ^H
1½wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼
(b) ^H2½wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼
(c) ð^H1þ^H2Þ½wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼
(d) ^H1½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼
(e) ^H2½wn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ/C138 ¼
(f) ð^H1þ^H2Þwn1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þ¼
Based upon your response, explain which of the wavefunc-
tions in (a)–(f) can be used as a basis state for the productspace of a two-particle system.
If the wavefunction is expressed as the sum of the single-
particle wavefunctions as in instructional task (a)–(c), then itis not a possible basis state for writing a two-particle wave-
function since the sum of the single-particle states is not a
two-particle state in the product space. However, each of thewavefunctions expressed as the product of the single-particlewavefunctions in instructional task (d)–(f) satisﬁes the TISEfor the two-particle system and these states can be used asbasis states for a two-particle system. In the next guidedinquiry-based learning sequence, students are asked to reﬂectupon two hypothetical student conversations regardingwhich of the wavefunctions in the QuILT instructional task

discussed are possible basis states for two-particle
wavefunctions:
Student 1: The basis state that can be used to construct
the two-particle stationary state wavefunction for a system of
two non-interacting identical particles can be written in
terms of the sum of the single-particle wavefunctions,Wðx
1;x2Þ¼wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ.
Student 2: I disagree. The sum of the single-particle
states wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þis not in the Hilbert space of the
two-particle system. When the two-particle Hamiltonian ^H1
þ^H2acts on the state wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ, there are inconsis-
tencies. Consider terms of the type ^H1wn2ðx2Þwhen ^H1
þ^H2acts on wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þ.
Student 1: Isn’t ^H1wn2ðx2Þ¼0?
Student 2: No. The single-particle Hamiltonian ^H1only
acts on the wavefunction corresponding to particle one butfor this wavefunction w
n2ðx2Þ¼1/C1wn2ðx2Þ, the wavefunction
corresponding to particle one is “1,” which is not
normalizable.
Student 3: I agree with Student 2. The sum of the single-
particle states wn1ðx1Þþwn2ðx2Þcannot be a basis state for
a two-particle system.
Students 2 and 3 are correct, while Student 1 is incorrect
in the preceding conversation. Students are then provided
further support that helps them identify the form of the possi-
ble basis states for writing the many-particle wavefunction.
D. Helping students identify and generate symmetric/
antisymmetric wavefunctions for systems of identicalbosons or fermions
The students work through several guided inquiry-based
sequences in which they are asked to generate symmetric wave-
functions for a system of identical bosons and antisymmetricwavefunctions for a system of identical fermions. Initially, theyignore the spin part of the wavefunction and use the Slater deter-minant to construct the many-particle wavefunction for a system
of identical fermions. This approach helps students generate a
many-particle wavefunction with the appropriate number ofterms and the correct sign for each term in order to construct acompletely antisymmetric wavefunction. The Slater determinantconstruction is also used to remind students that if they assignthe same coordinate to the different particles, then the wave
function will be zero. As another example, students determine
whether the two-particle wavefunctions in Q5 (a) and (b) orw
n1ðx1Þwn2ðx2Þare appropriate wavefunctions for a system of
two bosons or fermions. Then, they identify and construct boththe spatial and spin parts of the many-particle wavefunction for
a system of non-interacting identical bosons or fermions (e.g.,
how the two-particle wavefunctions in Q5 (a) and (b) can becombined with the two-particle spin states in Eq. (3)to construct
a completely symmetric or completely antisymmetric wavefunc-tion for bosons and fermions, respectively). Students are pro-
vided checkpoints at the end of each section to allow them to
reconcile any discrepancies between their initial reasoning andthe correct reasoning.
E. Helping students realize that certain linear
combinations of the products of the single-particlestationary state wavefunctions can be possiblemany-particle stationary state wavefunctions
In the QuILT, students are asked to explicitly show that an
appropriately chosen linear combination of the products ofsingle-particle wavefunctions is a many-particle wavefunc-
tion that satisﬁes the TISE for the many-particleHamiltonian, as in Q5. The goal is to have students use theirresponses to questions (d) and (e) in the instructional task tohelp them evaluate and reﬂect upon linear combinations ofthe products of the single-particle states in this context (i.e.,
reﬂect upon an appropriately symmetrized wavefunction for
identical fermions or bosons). Students are asked to summa-rize in their own words what they learned from these exam-ples and are then provided with checkpoints, which allowthem to compare their initial reasoning to the correct reason-ing and reconcile any differences.
VI. EVALUATION OF THE QUILT
The process of in-class implementation of the QuILT
(along with the pre/post-tests) is summarized in the supple-mentary material.
56Table IIIshows the percentage of stu-
dents who expressed the Hamiltonian for a system of non-
interacting identical particles as the sum of the Hamiltonians
^Hiof the ith particle ( i¼1;2;…;N) in response to Q1. On
the post-test, all of the undergraduates and nearly all of thegraduate students answered Q1 correctly. Table IVshows
the percentages of students who labeled each particle with itsown unique coordinate in response to Q2.
Table Vsummarizes the pre/post-test results for Q2. For
the post-test, every student stated that the many-particle sta-tionary state wavefunction is expressed as the sum over per-mutations of the direct products of the single-particlestationary state wavefunctions. The Slater determinant wastaught to students via traditional instruction, but studentsrarely used it in answering questions on the pretest. Afterworking through several conceptual and quantitative exam-ples in the QuILT, students were more likely to use theSlater determinant approach to correctly construct acompletely antisymmetric many-particle wavefunction for asystem of identical fermions.
Table VIshows the percentages of students who expressed
the many-particle stationary state wavefunction for a system
of identical fermions as an antisymmetric linear combination
of the products of the single-particle stationary state wave-functions in response to Q2 on the pretest and post-test.Table III. The percentages of undergraduates (number of students N¼25)
and graduate students ( N¼30) who expressed the Hamiltonian for a system
of non-interacting identical particles as the sum or direct product of the
Hamiltonians for the individual particles in Q1.

Table VIalso shows the percentage of students who
expressed the many-particle stationary state wavefunctionfor a system of identical bosons as a symmetric linear combi-
nation of the products of the single-particle stationary state
wavefunctions in response to Q2 on the pretest and post-test.It is not possible to tell with certainty why undergraduates
performed better than graduate students. However, under-
graduates had worked with other students in class on thetutorial, while graduate students worked on it as homework.
It is possible that small group interaction is more productive
than working alone. Graduate students also did not expectthese types of problems on their examinations (which
counted for most of their course grade), which may have
impacted their engagement with the QuILT.
VII. IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING
This study focuses on investigating student difﬁculties
with the basics of identical particles and using the research
as a guide to design a QuILT to help students develop a good
understanding of the underlying concepts. We note that theQuILT is designed to be used by the instructors as a supple-
ment, not as the ﬁrst tool to introduce students to the con-
cepts. In-class small-group implementation is stronglyrecommended if class time permits. It can alternatively beassigned as homework after students have had prior instruc-
tion in relevant concepts, as the checkpoints that are built
into the tutorial allow students to self-correct. The QuILT isdesigned to allow instructors ﬂexibility in using their pre-
ferred methods for initial instruction, ranging from tradi-
tional lectures to assigned reading followed by studentquestions and in-class discussion.
In summary, the QuILT gives students who have already
been introduced to the concepts an opportunity to think
through the concepts themselves using guided learningsequences that are developed via research on studentdifﬁculties. The QuILT provides the coaching and support
using guided inquiry-based sequences with feedback built in
via checkpoints. By the time students do the post-test, they
are expected to have become self-reliant and be able to solvethe post-test problems without help. If only a section or sub-
section of the tutorial is used by instructors, they could select
the pretest and post-test questions that correspond to thematerial in those sections. In this manner, instructors can use
either full or part of the QuILT based upon their preference
as a resource inside or outside of the classroom to activelyengage students in the learning process using a learning tool
developed via research.
