The Clausius–Clapeyron relation and its analogs in other ﬁrst-order phase transitions, such as type-
I superconductors, are derived using very elementary methods without appealing to the more
advanced concepts of entropy or Gibbs free energy. The reasoning is based on Kelvin’sformulation of the second law of thermodynamics and should be accessible to high school students.
After recalling some basic facts about the Carnot cycle, we present two very different systems that
undergo discontinuous phase transitions (ice/water and normal/superconductor) and constructengines that exploit the properties of these systems to produce work. In each case, we show that if
the transition temperature T
trwas independent of other parameters, such as pressure or magnetic
ﬁeld, it would be possible to violate Kelvin’s principle, i.e., to construct a perpetuum mobile of thesecond kind. Since the proposed cyclic processes can be realized reversibly in the limit of
inﬁnitesimal changes in temperature, their efﬁciencies must be equal to that of an ordinary Carnot
cycle. We immediately obtain an equation of the form dT=dX¼fðT;XÞ, which governs how the
transition temperature changes with the parameter X.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1844, Lord Kelvin studied a cyclic process based on the
water–ice phase transition and concluded that a perpetuum
mobile of the second kind would be possible, unless the
melting temperature of ice varied with pressure.1This varia-
tion is described quantitatively by the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation. Usually, it is derived by relying on the continuity
of the Gibbs free energy (or, more precisely, the chemical
potential) between the two phases (see Appendix A ). In this
work, we show how to derive the Clausius–Clapeyron equa-
tion and its analogs in other ﬁrst order phase transitions by
constructing reversible cycles operating between two very
close temperatures.
First, let us brieﬂy recall some basic facts about the second
law of thermodynamics. In Kelvin’s formulation, it reads, “Itis impossible to devise an engine which, working in a cycle,
shall produce no effect other than the extraction of heat from
a reservoir and performance of an equal amount of mechani-
cal work.”2In other words, it is impossible to construct a
heat engine that would have 100% efﬁciency, deﬁned as the
ratio of the work done to the heat absorbed. Furthermore,
this implies that of all possible engines operating betweentwo heat reservoirs at different ﬁxed temperatures, the ones
operating reversibly have the highest efﬁciency. This is
shown by making the reduction ad absurdum argument pre-
sented below: If there were a cycle more efﬁcient than the
reversible one, one could construct a cycle violating the sec-ond law of thermodynamics.
3
Consider the composite cyclic process shown in Fig. 1,
which consists of two separate cycles (represented by
hatched circles), which we will also call engines; the upper
one is reversible, and the lower one is a hypothetical cycle
that is more efﬁcient than the ﬁrst. Vertical lines marked T1
andT2represent two heat reservoirs at the indicated tempera-
tures, and lines with arrows represent transfers of heat orwork in the directions indicated by the arrows. Both of these
engines extract heat Q1from the left reservoir at temperature
T1. Assume that the upper (reversible) cycle releases heat Q2
to the right reservoir at temperature T2(T2<T1) and per-
forms an amount of work W¼Q1/C0Q2. Since the lower
cycle is more efﬁcient, it releases heat Q2/C0DWand per-
forms work WþDW(DW>0). If this were possible, the
upper (reversible) engine could be run in the opposite direc-
tion to extract the same heat Q2from the reservoir at T2,
using an amount of work Wdrawn from the work WþDW
performed by the lower engine (Fig. 2). The overall result
would then be a net amount of heat DWtaken from the reser-
voir at T2converted entirely into positive work DW, in con-
tradiction to Kelvin’s assertion.
From the reasoning summarized in Figs. 1and2, it also
follows that allreversible cycles working between the same
two reservoirs must have the same efﬁciency, and that theirefﬁciency depends only on the two reservoir temperaturesand nothing else. This efﬁciency is shown in any textbook
2
to be given by the following Carnot formula:
g¼1/C0Qout
Qin¼1/C0T2
T1¼T1/C0T2
T1: (1)
Note that the efﬁciency of a reversible cycle decreases to
zero (no work can be obtained) in the limit T2!T1. This
result will be the main tool in the analyses presented in theremaining part of this paper.
II. A SIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE
CLAUSIUS–CLAPEYRON RELATION
In 1844, while analyzing a cycle in which freezing water
performed mechanical work, Lord Kelvin was led to a para-
dox: It appeared that by exploiting the ice–water phase tran-sition, it was possible to construct a cycle violating the

second law of thermodynamics.4To avoid this, Kelvin’s
brother James concluded that the ice melting temperature
must decrease with increasing pressure.1Here, we show
how, with the help of a suitable inﬁnitesimal cycle, this qual-itative statement can be converted into a precise mathemati-cal formula (the Clausius–Clapeyron equation).
In the water–ice engine considered by Kelvin (illustrated
in Fig. 3), initially a movable deck forms the upper wall of a
container ﬁlled with water at a temperature T
1that is greater
than its freezing point T0(step 1). In step 2, a mass Mis
placed on the deck. Owing to the very small compressibilityof water, the change in water volume from step 1 to step 2
will be ignored in this analysis; in the limit of an inﬁnitesi-
mal cycle, this can be justiﬁed. In step 3, the system isbrought into contact with a cold reservoir at a temperatureT
2<T0and the water freezes. Because the density of ice is
less than that of water, the body is lifted up by
DH¼ðVice/C0VwaterÞ=A, where Vwater =iceis the volume of the
water/ice and Ais the cross-sectional area of the container.
In step 4, the mass is removed from the deck, and the gain inits potential energy MgDHis transformed into mechanical
work by lowering Mto its initial height. Finally, the engine
absorbs heat from a warmer reservoir T
1>T0, and the ice
melts. The heat received by the engine from the hotter reser-voir is equal to the sum of the latent heat of melting of theice plus the heat needed, ﬁrst to bring the ice to the melting
temperature and then to warm the resulting water to the tem-
perature of the warmer reservoir. The two last heats can beneglected if the cycle is inﬁnitesimal. After this sequence ofoperations, the engine returns to its initial state, which was
before Mwas placed on it. Figure 4shows this cycle on the
water–ice phase diagram using T–pvariables. The efﬁciency
of the cycle shown in Figs. 3and4isg¼

where Dvis the difference between the ice and water molar
volumes and lis the molar latent heat of the water–ice
transition.
As it stands, the efﬁciency of the constructed engine does
not depend on the temperatures of the reservoirs absorbingheat from or supplying heat to the system. In contrast, theefﬁciency of the Carnot engine approaches zero asT
1/C0T2!0. This situation violates the second law of ther-
modynamics, since as the temperatures are brought together,
at some point, the efﬁciency of the constructed engine will
exceed that of a Carnot engine operating between the sametemperatures.
The apparent contradiction is removed if the temperature
T
0of the phase transition varies with the pressure p. The
change in pressure exerted on the water/ice results from plac-ing and subsequently removing the weight lifted by thewater. This difference in pressure is simply

We can already conclude (without any quantitative analysis)
that the melting temperature must grow with lowering thepressure. If it fell, then it would be possible to melt ice afterremoving the weight by using the same reservoir that

Reversing the sense of operation of the upper (reversible) engine would lead
to violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

previously was used to freeze the water, and no difference in
temperatures would be needed to construct a working cycle.It is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamicsthat an increase in melting temperature with decreasing pres-sure must accompany the unusual property of water that its
volume is larger in the solid phase.
It is, however, possible to go further and obtain the pre-
cise relation between the changes in the melting tempera-ture and pressure by comparing the efﬁciency of thewater–ice engine with that of a Carnot cycle. However,ﬁrst, it is necessary to ask if the cycle can be realized(at least in principle) reversibly. If friction is eliminated
(a standard assumption in thermodynamical reasoning),
then placing and removing Mbecomes reversible. On the
other hand, a transfer of heat from a hotter to a colder bodyis, in general, an irreversible process. However, if Mis very
small, the change in pressure will also be small, so thechange in the freezing point will also be very small (inﬁni-
tesimal). In this limit, the difference in temperatures of the
two heat reservoirs can be made arbitrarily small, therebymaking the requisite heat transfers reversible, too. Thus, theinﬁnitesimal cycle can be considered reversible, and thecomparison of its efﬁciency with that of the Carnot cycle isjustiﬁed. It yields

which is the well-known Clausius–Clapeyron relation. A simi-
lar derivation can be found on p. 53 of Pippard’s textbook.2
III. ENGINE BASED ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
To show that the approach used above is quite general, we
next apply it to the normal conductor–superconductor phase
transition. One characteristic feature of type-I superconduc-tors (e.g., metals like tin, indium, and aluminum) is the van-ishing of their electrical resistance. A second feature is the
expulsion of an applied magnetic ﬁeld from their interior,
called the Meissner effect. The latter feature will be crucialfor the engine that we will discuss because it is responsible
for a force that pushes a superconducting specimen from a
region of stronger magnetic ﬁeld in the direction of weakerﬁeld. The work Wdone by this force to slowly (reversibly)
displace a superconducting body of volume Vfrom a region
of (locally) uniform constant ﬁeld B
1to a region of uniform
ﬁeld B2equals

where l0is the vacuum permeability. Type-I superconduc-
tors are characterized by a critical magnetic ﬁeld strength Bc,
above which the superconducting state is abruptly destroyed,i.e., the material undergoes a discontinuous phase transition.
Analogous to the water freezing point, B
cdepends on the
temperature: the material remains superconducting only ifB<B
cðTÞ.
Let us consider the cyclic process presented in Fig. 5,
operating between temperatures T1and T2and magnetic
ﬁelds BcðT1ÞandBcðT2Þ, where T2>T1. A body, initially in
its normal state at temperature T2and immersed in ﬁeld
BcðT1Þ, is cooled to T1to enter the superconducting state.
Mechanical work is extracted from the system by allowingthe body to be slowly (i.e., reversibly) pushed into the region
of the weaker ﬁeld B
cðT2Þ. Next, the body is heated to tem-
perature T2and ceases to be superconducting. Finally, the
body is returned to the region of the stronger ﬁeld. No work
is needed to perform this step because in the normal state,
the body does not interact with the ﬁeld. This cycle is shown
Fig. 4. The discussed cycle shown on the phase diagram of water (not to
scale). In steps 1 !2 and 3 !4, a body is placed on or removed from the
deck, which results in a change of the pressure. In step 2 !3, the water is
cooled, so that it freezes ( L2!3is the heat released). In step 4 !1, the ice is
heated and it melts ( L4!1is the heat absorbed). If the melting temperature
T0does not depend on the pressure p, then the cycle can be executed with
reservoir temperatures T1andT2arbitrarily close to one another, leading to
violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

normal state and has no magnetic properties.

in Fig. 6, which is a phase diagram of the superconducting
material. Just as for the water–ice engine, we assume that thecycle is inﬁnitesimal ( T
2/C0T1¼DT!0), which allows us
to neglect the heat received by or extracted from the bodyother than the latent heat Lrelated to the phase transition
(Fig. 7). Therefore, during the cycle, the body absorbs a heat L
and performs the work W given by Eq. (7), so its efﬁciency is

If the transition temperature were independent of the mag-
netic ﬁeld (so that the phase boundary in Fig. 6would be a
vertical line), one could choose arbitrary values of BcðT1=2Þ
and, in the limit T1!T2, violate the second law of thermo-
dynamics, analogous to the previous example. Conversely, ifthe magnetic ﬁeld at which the transition occurs were inde-pendent of temperature, a working cycle simply could not beconstructed, and the comparison with the Carnot cycle couldnot be carried out.In the limit of inﬁnitesimal DBandDT, Eq.

rewritten as

where DB¼BcðT2Þ/C0BcðT1Þ<0. In the limit DT;DB!0,

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The method presented in this work provides a simple,
essentially graphical way of studying the dependence of the
phase transition temperature on external parameters. Wehave shown how to apply it using two examples of ﬁrst-
order phase transitions, but there are many other phase tran-
sitions that could be analyzed analogously (e.g., melting,boiling, (re)sublimation, etc.). In each case, the strategy is
the same: Identify a discontinuous change of the system that
can be used to perform mechanical work and then construct
an appropriate inﬁnitesimal cycle, which must be reversible
in the appropriate limit. Finally, equate the cycle’s efﬁciencyto the efﬁciency of the corresponding Carnot cycle.

We now show that the method described above yields cor-
rect results in general. Unlike the rest of the paper, we appeal
to concepts beyond the high school program.
LetXbe an extensive property (such as volume or total
magnetic moment in the superconducting example) and Yan
intensive parameter (such as temperature) characterizing the
system under consideration. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
takes the following form:

(d/C0Qis the heat received andd/C0Wis the work performed by
the system). The corresponding change in the Gibbs free
energy is

Moving the body at temperature T2to the region of stronger magnetic ﬁeld
is analogous to placing a weight on water in the previous example: it
decreases the temperature of the phase transition.

ors and sizes of circles representing the working body denote distinct
phases, but not necessarily different volumes (the extensive parameter that
changes discontinuously during the phase transition is not speciﬁed). Instep 1, using the heat L, one obtains the phase transition A!B,w h i c h

performed. In step 2, one changes the intensive parameter Y, and as a
result, the temperature of phase transition drops. In step 3, we lower the
temperature of the body, so that there is another phase transition B!A,
and a negative work ðY/C0DYÞDXperformed. Finally, in step 4, one
restores the parameter Yto its initial value.

This is the standard (and the simplest) way to derive the
Clausius–Clapeyron relation. Since YdX is the inﬁnitesimal
amount of work performed by the system, one can construct
a cycle analogous to the ones considered in the main text.
For deﬁniteness, assume that in the transition A!B, the
latent heat and DXare both positive and consider the follow-
ing steps:
(1) Transition A!Bat a temperature T0. The heat absorbed
isLand the performed work is YDXA!B.
(2) Change Y!Y/C0DY. Note that at this point, we already
know (because we have assumed that DX>0) that thetemperature of the phase transition must drop. Otherwise,
it would be possible to violate Kelvin’s principle.
(3) Using the colder reservoir, change the temperature of the
working substance to T0/C0DTto cause the phase transi-
tionB!A. This is accompanied by the performance by
the system of negative work /C0DXB!AðY/C0DYÞ.
(4) Change the parameter Yand warm the working substance
to bring it back to the initial state.
IfDYandDTare inﬁnitesimal, DXB!A¼DXA!B, and one
can neglect the heat needed to warm up the working sub-stance in step 4. The useful work obtained is DXDY, while
the heat absorbed is L. Comparison with the Carnot engine
efﬁciency yields the desired formula (Eq. (A4) ).
