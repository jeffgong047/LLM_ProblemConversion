Theoretically, solutions of the damped harmonic oscillator asymptotically approach equilibrium,
i.e., the zero energy state, without ever reaching it exactly, and the critically damped solution
approaches equilibrium faster than the underdamped or the overdamped solution. Experimentally,
the systems described with this model reach equilibrium when the system’s energy has droppedbelow some threshold corresponding to the energy resolution of the measuring apparatus. We show
that one can (almost) always ﬁnd an optimal underdamped solution that will reach this energy
threshold sooner than all other underdamped solutions, as well as the critically damped solution, nomatter how small this threshold is. We also comment on one exception to this for a particular type
of initial condition, when a speciﬁc overdamped solution reaches the equilibrium state sooner than
all other solutions. We experimentally conﬁrm some of our ﬁndings.

I. INTRODUCTION
Under which conditions does the damped harmonic oscillator
return to the equilibrium state the fastest? Standard textbooks
answer that the oscillator returns to the equilibrium state the
fastest in the critically damped regime, regardless of the initial
conditions.1–5Since none of the solutions to this model ever
exactly reach the equilibrium state, but only asymptotically
approach it, textbook authors usually justify this answer by con-
sidering the convergence speed of the general underdamped,
critically damped, and overdamped solutions toward the equi-
librium state in the inﬁnite time limit.1Indeed, in that asymp-
totic sense, the critically damped solution approaches the
equilibrium state faster than the others. The situation becomes
more subtle when experimental resolution is taken into account;
one can determine the damping coefﬁcient in the underdamped
regime for which the oscillator settles down fastest to equilib-
rium by setting the maximal overshoot to be equal to the dis-
placement resolution.6Similarly, Heald7sets the minimum
detectable overshoot equal to the displacement resolution and
computes the degree of underdamping that would be mistaken
for critical due to the fastest return to the equilibrium.
In this paper, we theoretically ﬁnd the time interval during
which the envelope of the underdamped displacement is
smaller in magnitude than the displacement of a critically
damped oscillator using the Lambert W function.8Depending
on the damping coefﬁcient, we determine the instant at which
the envelope of underdamped displacement becomes larger
than the displacement of the critically damped oscillator. We
ﬁnd that displacements at and after that moment are experi-
mentally practically immeasurable for damping coefﬁcients
that are well within the underdamped regime, e.g., 10%
smaller than the critical damping coefﬁcient.
In the ideal case, the equilibrium state is the zero energy
state, with both the displacement and the velocity equal to
zero; here, we deﬁne the equilibrium state as the state in
which the energy of the oscillator has dropped to a certain
(inﬁnitesimal) fraction of the initial energy, e.g., below a
given experimental energy resolution. We show that it ispossible to ﬁnd an optimal damping coefﬁcient in the under-
damped regime for which the system’s energy will fall belowthis predetermined threshold sooner than for any otherunderdamped, critically damped, or overdamped oscillatorswith the same initial conditions. An exception to this is aspecial set of initial conditions for which an overdamped
oscillator reaches the equilibrium state sooner than all others,
regardless of whether we deﬁne the equilibrium state as azero energy state or as a state with some inﬁnitesimal frac-tion of initial energy. To check our statements experimen-tally, we designed an RLC circuit with variable parametersand measured the oscillating voltage across the resistor usinga standard laboratory oscilloscope. The measurements areconsistent with the theoretical ﬁndings.
II. SHORT REVIEW OF THE MODEL
The differential equation of the damped harmonic oscilla-
tor is of the form
€xðtÞþ2c_xðtÞþx
2
0xðtÞ¼0; (1)
where x(t) denotes the displacement from the equilibrium
position as a function of time, the dots denote time deriva-tives, c>0 is the damping coefﬁcient, and x
0stands for the
undamped oscillator angular frequency (the oscillator’s natu-ral frequency). The zero energy state of the system isachieved when both x¼0 and _x¼0. The form of the solu-
tion to Eq. (1)depends on the relationship between candx
0,
producing three possible regimes.
Forc<x0, the system is in the underdamped regime with

We want to emphasize here that the displacement maxima are
not tangent to the envelope, and it could be misleading to refer
to the function (3)as the time-dependent amplitude.9It is easy to
check that the envelope of the velocity, _xudðtÞ, behaves similarly,
and thus the system asymptotically approaches equilibrium.
Forc¼x0, the system is in the critically damped regime
with the solution

The solution approaches equilibrium without oscillating.

where a¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ

. As in the critically damped regime,
the solution approaches equilibrium without oscillating.
The envelope of the underdamped oscillations decays as
e/C0ct, and, thus, to compare the decays of the underdamped
and critically damped solutions, we examine the ratio

t!1xcðtÞ
e/C0ct¼lim
t!1x0þv0þx0x0 ðÞ t ðÞ e/C0ðx0/C0cÞt¼0; (6)
since x0>c. Therefore, the critically damped solution
approaches equilibrium faster than the underdamped solu-
tion. For the overdamped regime, the approach to the equi-
librium in the inﬁnite time limit is governed by the slowly
decaying exponential eð/C0cþaÞt; thus, we evaluate
lim
t!1xcðtÞ
eð/C0cþaÞt¼lim
t!1x0þv0þx0x0 ðÞ t ðÞ e/C0ðx0/C0cþaÞt¼0
(7)
due to x0/C0cþa>0. Again, the critically damped solution
approaches the equilibrium faster than the overdamped one.
The last statement is not completely general, since there is apossibility of a special case in which the initial displacement
and velocity are of opposite sign and satisfy jv
0j>jx0x0j.I n
this case, it is possible to choose a damping coefﬁcient c
such that the factor multiplying the slowly decaying expo-
nential is zero and only the quickly decaying exponentiale
ð/C0c/C0aÞtis present. In this case, the overdamped oscillator
approaches the equilibrium state faster than the critically
damped oscillator with the same initial conditions.
We now consider the energy of the oscillator. If we multi-
ply Eq. (1)by_xðtÞand rewrite the resulting ﬁrst and third
terms as time derivatives, we get

the ﬁrst term in Eq. (8)is the time derivative of the total
mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) per unit mass andthe second term is the power of the dissipative force per unitmass. The ratio of the system’s mechanical energy at time t

Note that, in the underdamped case, when budðtÞ¼1, the
system is in the equilibrium position and possesses onlykinetic energy. Conversely, when b
udðtÞ¼0, the system is at
a turning point, and possesses only potential energy. UsingEq.(11), we can rewrite Eq. (10) using the natural logarithm
as
d
dtlnEðtÞ
E0/C18/C19
¼/C04cbðtÞ; (12)
since the total energy is strictly real and positive. Equation
(12) is valid for all three oscillating regimes, i.e., for under-
damped, critically damped, and overdamped regimes. Weﬁnd it especially useful when analyzing the underdampedcase on account of its quasiperiodic motion.
Equations (10) and(12) are clearly related, but one must
be aware of their implicit differences. For example, bothloss rates have maxima, equal to zero, at moments when
_xðtÞ
2¼0 and bðtÞ¼0, but the minima occur at different
times. Compared to the undamped system, the underdampedoscillator achieves its maximum speed somewhat before itreaches the equilibrium position
10where bðtÞ¼1. To avoid
confusion, in what follows, we will refer to Eq. (12) as the
energy loss rate.
To summarize, the solutions of the damped harmonic
oscillator asymptotically approach the equilibrium state, butnever exactly reach it. In that asymptotic sense, the criticallydamped oscillator returns to equilibrium the most quickly in
all cases (apart from a speciﬁc case of an overdamped oscil-
lator). In nature and in experiments, systems described bythis model reach an effective equilibrium state in which theenergy of the system has decreased to the level of the sur-rounding noise, or the energy resolution of the measuringapparatus. Following this line of thought, we will deﬁne asystem to be in equilibrium for times t>ssuch that
EðsÞ

where d>0 is a dimensionless parameter that deﬁnes what
fraction of the initial energy is left in the system. In Sec. III,
768 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 Lelas, Poljak, and Jukic ´ 768 04 October 2023 22:57:45
we prove that, for any ﬁnite value of d, one can always ﬁnd
an optimal solution in the underdamped regime ( c<x0) that
will reach equilibrium, in the sense of Eq. (13), sooner than
all other underdamped or critically damped solutions withthe same initial conditions.
III. THE FASTEST ROUTE TO EQUILIBRIUM
A. Displacement analysis
We focus on the initial conditions given by x
0>0 and
v0¼0. The underdamped, critically damped, and over-
damped solutions for this set of initial conditions are
xudðtÞ¼AðtÞcosxtþ/ ðÞ ;with

: (16)
The critical and overdamped solutions (15) and(16) have no
zeros, and the overdamped solution approaches the equilib-rium state more slowly. Thus, we can conclude that the over-
damped solution is further from equilibrium than the
critically damped solution for any t>0 (we rigorously prove
that x
odðtÞ>xcðtÞfor any t>0 in the supplementary mate-
rial).11Therefore, we exclude the overdamped regime in
what follows. In Fig. 1, we show the envelope A(t), the
underdamped solution xudðtÞwith c¼0:6x0, and the criti-
cally damped solution xcðtÞ. Let us assume that Fig. 1models
a real-life experiment in which the displacement resolution
is, e.g., Dx¼60:1x0(which would be a poor resolution; we
take it here just to set an example). From the point of view of
that experiment, the underdamped solution settles down to
equilibrium sooner than the critically damped solution. Bysetting the maximal overshoot equal to the displacement res-
olution, one can determine the damping coefﬁcient in the
underdamped regime for which the damped oscillatorreaches equilibrium, within experimental resolution, as
quickly as possible, as Armstrong
6had already shown. Here,
we ﬁnd the time interval t2ðs1;s2Þduring which AðtÞ
<xcðtÞso that the envelope of the underdamped solution
xudðtÞis actually closer to the equilibrium than xcðtÞ.
We can gain analytical insight into the relationship between
the underdamped and critically damped solutions by analyzing
the dependence of the two crossing times, s1ands2,o nt h e
damping coefﬁcient. We equate Aðs1;2Þ¼xcðs1;2Þand get
eðx0/C0cÞs1;2/C0xs1;2/C0x

with two solutions (see Appendix A ),

where W0ðyÞandW/C01ðyÞare two different branches of the
Lambert W function.8
Figure 2shows the results obtained from Eq. (18).I nt h e

the underdamped solution xudðtÞoscillates with an envelope
that is smaller in magnitude than the critically damped solu-
tion, until both solutions reach a displacement of the order10
/C09x0att¼s2. In general, since the magnitude of the under-
damped solution’s displacement is smaller than the critically
damped solution for s1<t<s2,i fAðs2Þis less than the
experimental resolution, the underdamped displacement will
not be measured to be larger than the critically damped dis-
placement at any time after s1. Note that s2diverges as c
approaches x0, and therefore Aðs2Þcan be made arbitrarily
small by choosing a large enough damping coefﬁcient.
Therefore, even though the critically damped displacementapproaches equilibrium faster than the underdamped displace-
ment for t>s
2, for any given experimental resolution, one
can ﬁnd a damping coefﬁcient cfor which the underdamped
solution will be measured to reach equilibrium ﬁrst.
B. Energy analysis
We now turn our attention to the energy of the system. In
Fig. 3(a), we show the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (9)for
Fig. 1. The envelope A(t) (solid red curve) and the complete underdamped
solution xudðtÞwith c¼0:6x0(dotted blue curve) compared to the critically
damped solution xcðtÞ(dashed black curve). The arrows denote the moments
in time s1ands2when AðtÞ¼xcðtÞ. During the time interval t2ðs1;s2Þ, the
envelope of the underdamped solution xudðtÞis closer to the equilibrium
than xcðtÞ. The magnitude of the displacement in the underdamped case
becomes conﬁned within the band 60:1x0before the critically damped case
and remains within that region for all subsequent times.Fig. 2. The solutions to Eq. (18) for values of c½x0/C138from 0.05 to 0.95 in
steps of 0.05. Between times s1ands2, the underdamped solution xudðtÞ
oscillates with an envelope A(t) that is smaller in magnitude than the criti-
cally damped solution xcðtÞ.

four values of c¼f0:85x0;0:9x0;0:95x0;x0g. The energy
ratios for various underdamped cases are only slightly larger
than the corresponding ratio for the critically damped oscilla-
tor from t¼0 until t¼f1:10x/C01
0;1:06x/C01
0;1:03x/C01
0gfor
c¼f0:85x0;0:9x0;0:95x0g, respectively. After these
moments, the underdamped curves remain lower than the
critically damped one for the rest of the time period of Fig.
3(a). In Fig. 3(b), we show the same behavior, this time, for
the case when c¼0:9x0, and during a longer time period.
We note that the energy ratios of the two systems are equalwhen t¼24:24x
/C01
0. This energy ratio equality occurs
slightly later in time than the equality of the underdamped
oscillator envelope and the critically damped oscillator dis-placement ( t¼s
2¼23:81x/C01
0as shown in Sec. III A ). We
expect that these times do not coincide due to the differences
between the envelope and the full underdamped solution,
i.e., the underdamped displacement exceeds the critical dis-placement in magnitude later than the envelope. Aftert¼24:24x
/C01
0, the energy ratio of the underdamped oscillator
periodically dips below that of the critically damped oscilla-
tor. Finally, when t>43:03x/C01
0, which corresponds to
EðtÞ<10/C033E0, the energy ratio of the underdamped oscilla-
tor remains permanently above the energy ratio for the criti-cally damped oscillator, in accordance with inﬁnite time
limit (6). Other values of the underdamped damping coefﬁ-
cient show the same qualitative behavior. To determine anoptimal damping coefﬁcient cfor which the system’s energywill drop to a desired energy level the soonest, we ﬁrst give
an example in Fig. 3(a), where we draw a horizontal line cor-
responding to EðtÞ=E
0¼10/C05:5. It is immediately clear that
the underdamped oscillator with c¼0:9x0reaches the line
corresponding to EðtÞ=E0¼10/C05:5ﬁrst, before the other
underdamped oscillators.
C. Existence of a unique optimal damping coefficient
Using a particular example, we now show that it is possi-
ble to determine a unique underdamped cfor which the oscil-
lator reaches some energy level faster than for any other c.
The underdamped oscillator, described by Eq. (14), is in the
equilibrium position at moments given by

where n2Nis the index that counts the equilibrium cross-
ings and turning points, respectively. In Fig. 4(a), we show
the energy loss rates (12) of the critically damped oscillator

oscillators with c¼0:85x0(green dash-dotted curve), c¼0:9x0(red solid

tor (black dashed curve). (b) The energy ratio (9)forc¼0:9x0(red solid

t¼24:24x/C01
0, as indicated by an arrow. After this moment, the energy ratio
for the underdamped case oscillates above and below the same ratio for the
critically damped oscillator, until t¼43:03x/C01

arrow), after which it always remains above it.

and underdamped oscillators for c¼f0:886x0;0:9x0g. For
the case c¼0:9x0, the maximal magnitude of the energy
loss rate is 4 c¼3:6x0. This means, according to Eq. (12),
bud¼1 at time sA1¼6:17x/C01
0. At this moment, the system
ﬁrst passes through the equilibrium position. By contrast, theenergy loss rate is zero when b
ud¼0a t sB1¼7:21x/C01
0,
when the system arrives for the ﬁrst time at a turning point.It is clear that c¼0:886x
0(or any other c<x0) yields
qualitatively the same behavior.
In Fig. 4(b), we show the energy ratio (9)as a function
ofcatt¼6:17x/C01
0. At this moment, the oscillator with
c¼0:9x0reaches the equilibrium position for the ﬁrst time,
and we can see that the energy ratio has a global minimumfor a slightly smaller damping coefﬁcient, i.e., for
c¼0:886x
0. The value of this energy minimum is 10/C05E0.
Let us assume that this is the energy resolution of the experi-ment; we denote this threshold energy as E
th. We note here
that, for any c, the energy is a monotonically decreasing
function of time. Thus, Eðc;tÞ>Ethfort<6:17x/C01
0, and
the oscillator with c¼0:886x0reaches Ethatt¼6:17x/C01
0,
faster than oscillators with any other c. We can conclude that
c¼0:886x0is the optimal damping coefﬁcient for the
experiment with Eth¼10/C05E0.
This example shows us that if, at some instant, the energy
as a function of chas a global minimum at some cmin, the
oscillator with cminreaches that energy minimum faster than
all other oscillators, i.e., cminis the optimal damping coefﬁ-
cient for that energy threshold. In Appendix B , we present
the behavior of the energy ratio (9)and its global minimum
for a wider range of c, and at different instants over a larger
time span. It is clear that for any energy level Eth, the unique
optimal damping coefﬁcient can be found.
We note here that the oscillator with optimal damping
coefﬁcient reaches Ethwhen its displacement is between the
equilibrium position and the ﬁrst turning point (designated
by the red circle in Fig. 4(a)). At the same instant, the oscil-
lator with slightly larger damping coefﬁcient, i.e., withc¼0:9x
0, arrives for the ﬁrst time at the equilibrium posi-
tion and has slightly more energy than the optimally dampedoscillator (see Fig. 4(b)). In Appendix B , we show that this
difference—between the optimal damping coefﬁcient (for
which the energy ratio (9)has a minimum at some instant)
and the damping coefﬁcient, which causes the system to ﬁrstreach equilibrium at that same instant—decreases as wemove to lower values of E
th. Therefore, as we show below, if
we use Eq. (19) to determine cfor which the system ﬁrst
comes to equilibrium precisely when its energy is equal to
Eth, we have obtained an excellent ﬁrst approximation of the
optimal damping coefﬁcient and a good starting point for its
precise numerical determination.
D. Determination of the optimal damping coefficient
We deﬁne the system to be effectively at equilibrium
when its energy equals 10/C0dE0, with some d>0, and we
ﬁnd the optimal underdamped coefﬁcient coptin two steps.
First, we determine cfor which the system reaches this
energy level when passing through equilibrium for the ﬁrst
time. We will show that this value of cis an excellent ﬁrst
approximation for the optimal damping coefﬁcient.
Therefore, we will refer to it as the ﬁrst step optimal damp-
ing denoted as c1. In the second step, we use c1to ﬁnd a
small subset of underdamped coefﬁcients for which the sys-
tem reaches energy 10/C0dE0faster than the system with c1,
and we then determine the optimal damping coefﬁcient copt
from that subset.
The ﬁrst step optimal damping coefﬁcient c1is determined
by the condition EðsA1Þ¼10/C0dE0. Since, at sA1, the total
energy is equal to the kinetic energy, we can write the chosencondition as
EudðsA1Þ

Eq.(14), we get

The left-hand side of Eq. (22) is a function of conly, we
denote it as fðcÞ. We can then graphically determine c1, for
any given d>0, from the condition

ing to d¼10. Their intersections leads to c1¼0:9698x0.W e
give the results for other choices of din Table I.
We now proceed to the second step and ﬁnd the optimal
damping coefﬁcient. We focus on the energy resolution
10/C06E0; for any other choice, the procedure is the same.
From Table I, we see that the oscillator with c1¼0:9286x0
reaches this resolution when ﬁrst at equilibrium position, i.e.,
att¼7:44x/C01
0. In Fig. 6, we show the energy ratio (9)as a
function of cat this instant. From this graph, we determine
the subset of underdamped coefﬁcients c2ð0:9104 x0;
0:9286x0Þwith energy smaller than 10/C06E0at this instant;
this is the subset of underdamped coefﬁcients that drop
below the experimental energy resolution faster than c1.
Since this subset is only Dc¼0:0182x0wide, we deter-
mined the optimal damping coefﬁcient simply by stepping
through the values in this subset and numerically ﬁndingthe value of c, which causes the system’s energy ratio (9)
to intersect the level 10
/C06in the shortest time. We ﬁnd
that copt¼0:9145x0reaches the energy resolution atFig. 5. Graphical determination of the ﬁrst step optimal damping c1

we plot the energy ratio (9)as a function of catt¼7:20x/C01

and we see that the minimum for copt¼0:9145x0touches the
energy resolution level.
In this example, coptis 1.52% smaller than c1(this differ-
ence decreases as the energy threshold is lowered, see
Appendix B ), and the system takes 3.26% less time than the
system with c1to reach the energy resolution level.
Depending on the experimental conditions, this can be sig-niﬁcant, but for many applications, it sufﬁces to take c
1as
optimal. For example, in Sec. IV, where we experimentally
test our ﬁndings, the difference between coptandc1is unde-
tectable since it results in a change that is within the experi-
mental resolution.
For all other types of initial conditions, the system’s
energy behavior is qualitatively the same as for the initial
conditions x0>0 and v0¼0 (see the supplementary mate-
rial,11Secs. SII–SIV), with one exception. For the special
case in which the initial displacement and velocity are of
opposite signs and satisfy jv0j>jx0x0j, one can choosec¼jv0j

in the overdamped regime, for which the factor multiplying
the slowly decaying exponential in Eq. (5)vanishes, leaving
only the quickly decaying exponential eð/C0c/C0aÞt. For this par-
ticular initial condition, the overdamped solution with thedamping coefﬁcient (24) returns to equilibrium sooner than
any other solution (details are given in the supplementarymaterial,
11Secs. SIV–IVC).
For the interested reader, in the supplementary material,11
Secs. SV and SVI, we examine the relationship between the
energy loss rates and the ratio of the critically damped tounderdamped energy, and we show the results of the optimi-zation with respect to s
A2, i.e., allowing the system to pass
the equilibrium position once, overshoot it, and reach theexperimental energy resolution when coming into the equi-librium position the second time. It is expected that theadvantage of the underdamped oscillator over the criticallydamped oscillator is smaller for the results obtained thisway, since the energy of the underdamped oscillator gets
closer to the energy of the critically damped oscillator
after each cycle, until it eventually surpasses it (see Figs.3(a)and3(b)).
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
We tested our model using a series RLC circuit. Other sys-
tems are also suitable for this purpose, such as a physicalpendulum with an eddy-current damping system that allows
the damping conditions to be controlled with great
precision.

We note that the current in the circuit I(t) exhibits damped
oscillations, but so does the voltage across the resistor RI(t),
which can be measured with an oscilloscope.
The circuit was constructed using a decade resistor with a
range from 0 Xto 1 M Xwith a manufacturer stated tolerance
of 1%, an inductor with inductance of ð14:8060:03ÞmH,
and a variable capacitor with a range from 0 F to 10 lF. The
voltage was provided by a square wave from an Agilent33500B waveform generator with low frequency distortion(61lHz) and high voltage retention (1% of setting).
13The
voltage across the resistor was measured using a UNI-TUTD2102CEX 100 MHz oscilloscope. The oscilloscope’sTable I. The ﬁrst column contains the ratio EðtÞ=E0, which deﬁnes the effec-

measurement uncertainty depends on the readout scale and
was set to 1/4 of the smallest readout unit for both time and
voltage.
Initially, the wave source frequency was set to 200 Hz
with a voltage step size of 3.3 V. The capacitance was set to
1 nF, and the resistance to 800 X. We veriﬁed that the circuit
had no signiﬁcant stray resistances and inductances with the
PeakTech 2005 and Fluke 115 multimeters. We observed
underdamped oscillations of the voltage across the resistor,shown in Fig. 7. The blue line is the voltage from the switch-
ing voltage source (unit voltage step of 1 V), and the red line
is the voltage measured across the resistor (unit voltage step
of 265 mV). Both are measured on the same time axis with aunit measuring step of 10 ls.
Using the oscilloscope’s measuring tools, we took ﬁve mea-
surements of the time interval between two successive max-
ima or minima of the oscillations and took the inverse to
obtain the frequency, which was found to be ð40:060:2ÞkHz.
Using this value, we determined the circuit’s capacitanceand obtained ð1:0660:01ÞnF. This is slightly different
from the value set on the variable capacitor due to unavoid-
able stray capacitances in the circuit. Using these values,we can now ﬁnd the dimensionless damping factor fof the

At this point, we note that the calculated uncertainty of
Rcritical is purely a consequence of measurement uncertain-
ties and does not reﬂect the experimental resolution. Uponexamination, we saw that a change in the resistance of the
setup, which was smaller than 250 Xin either direction,
resulted in a voltage change that was within the experimen-tal resolution, which puts the resolution at the level of/C257%.
After setting the value of the resistance to the critical
value, we performed the measurement of the voltage acrossthe resistor again. No oscillations were visible this time, as
can be seen in Fig. 8, which is the expected behavior of a
critically damped oscillator.
We measured the time interval between the moment
when the signal was at its maximum and the moment when
it became indistinguishable from the osc illoscope’s
measurement resolution, which was veriﬁed by the measur-ing tool. This resolution is taken to be 1/4 of the smallestmeasuring increment, which, in this case, corresponds to
/C2513 mV. Since the maximum voltage was /C25800 mV, the
resolution is approximately 1.625% of the maximal volt-age. The measured time interval between these twomoments was ð28:060:4Þls¼ð7:160:1Þx
/C01
0. The uncer-
tainty in the measurement is a consequence of the time res-
olution of the measuring tool, which has a single step of
Dt¼0:2ls.
Since We measured the time interval starting from the
moment the oscillator was at its maximum displacement. This,in effect, sets the initial condition to that of Sec. III, so we can
compare our measurements to the results obtained there.

energy of the critically damped oscillator is in the interval½6:6;9:4/C138/C210

This value was rounded to 6.5 k Xdue to the fact that our
experimental sensitivity to resistance is of the order of

change in resistance is /C257%, setting the resistance to
6.5 kXin fact covers a range of f, which will include both
f1andfopt, which differs from it at the order of a few
percent.

value of the optimal resistance of 6.5 k X.I nF i g . 9,w e

this is a decrease in time of ð2063Þ%, in accordance with
the ﬁndings given in Table I.

blue line is the switching voltage signal.

Next, we systematically changed the resistance in steps of
250X, from 4 to 8 k X. We always ensured that the maximum
voltage of the signal was set to 800 mV. We conﬁrmed that,
within the experimental resolution, the voltage droppedmostly quickly to zero when the resistance was set to 6.5 k X,
as predicted by Eq. (30).
Decreasing the resistance below the optimal value, we
slowly start to notice the overshoot of the voltage signalunder the reference voltage (see the supplementary mate-rial,
11Sec. SVII). For resistances above the critical value,
the system becomes overdamped, and the time it takes for
the signal to drop to the reference level is longer than thecritical case.
V. CONCLUSION
The results presented here show that, contrary to popular
belief, critical damping is never the best choice if we wantthe damped oscillator to reach an equilibrium state as soon
as possible. For most initial conditions, a unique damping
coefﬁcient in the underdamped regime can be determined forwhich the oscillator reaches the equilibrium state the mostquickly. An exception to this occurs for a speciﬁc choice of
initial conditions, when an overdamped oscillator is the opti-
mal choice.
These ﬁndings can be signiﬁcant for understanding all
systems described by the damped harmonic oscillator
model, such as shock absorbers in cars,
14RLC and other
oscillating circuits, and measuring devices.15Recently, the
damped oscillator model was used to characterize the con-vergence of machine learning algorithms, and a connection
was established between the differential equations associ-
ated with the algorithms and the damped oscillator model.16
Although the algorithms converge to solutions with someﬁnite precision, critical damping has previously been con-
sidered desirable in terms of convergence speed.16We
envision that our results may be signiﬁcant in that contextas well.

APPENDIX A: LAMBERT FUNCTION
In this section, we discuss in more detail the solutions of
Eq. (17). The solutions to this equation, s1and s2, are
moments in time for which the envelope A(t) of the under-
damped oscillator equals the displacement xcðtÞof the oscil-
lator in the critical regime. First, we note that Eq. (17) can be
rewritten as
x
x0þxs/C18/C19
e/C0x0/C0cðÞ s¼1; (A1)
after which the substitution
u/C17/C0 x0/C0c ðÞ sþc/C0x0
x0(A2)
allows us to express Eq. (A1) in the form called the Lambert
equation,8
ueu¼y; (A3)
with the shorthand notation
y/C17c/C0x0
xeðx0/C0cÞ=x0: (A4)
We note here that /C01=e<y<0, since 0 <c<x0in the
underdamped regime. In this case, the Lambert equation
(A3) has two solutions for the unknown u,8
u1¼W0ðyÞ;u2¼W/C01ðyÞ; (A5)
where W0andW/C01are two branches of the Lambert W func-
tion. We can write this compactly as u1;2¼W0;/C01ðyÞ.B y

In Fig. 10, we show the base 10 logarithm of the energy
ratio (9)as a function of c2½0;1:5x0/C138for ﬁve time instants.
We see that as time increases, new local minima are formed,
but the global minimum persists and its position approachesthe critical damping value c¼x
0. The black dot on each
of the curves indicates the value of cfor which the system is
at the equilibrium position for the ﬁrst time at that instant.We see that the subset of the damping coefﬁcients, for which
the energy is lower than the energy for this c, decreases in
Fig. 9. The oscilloscope readout in the case of the underdamped circuit with
R¼6:5kX(red curve). The time interval required for the voltage to drop
from the maximal value to the resolution of the oscilloscope was measured
to beð22:460:4Þls.
