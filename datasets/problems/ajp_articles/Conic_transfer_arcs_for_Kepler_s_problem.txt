A fundamental problem in spacecraft mission design is to ﬁnd free-ﬂight paths from one place to
another that satisfy various design criteria. We explore the geometry of free-ﬂight paths between
departure and arrival points for Kepler’s problem. Newton showed that these paths are conic arcs.
We ﬁnd the parameters for all conic paths between a departure and an arrival point as a function ofone key variable called the inside angle. Once the paths are written in terms of this single
parameter, then it is straightforward to ﬁnd the path that takes a speciﬁed travel time (the Lambert
problem) or to perform other optimizations such as minimizing the fuel costs.https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0080491
I. INTRODUCTION
We aim to solve boundary value problems for Newton’s
inverse square central force gravitational model. We ﬁrst
ﬁnd the conic parameters ðp;e;xÞfor all conic arcs between
departure and arrival points. Finding these parameters is
complicated.
1,2In Sec. II, we give a new geometric solution
to this problem. Our solution is direct and uses the symmetry
of the central force model. We avoid using the eccentric
anomaly and Kepler’s equation.
As an application, we solve Lambert’s problem. This
problem has a long history.1–6In the standard solution of
Lambert’s problem, the travel time is given, and the parame-ters of the conic path that solves the problem are unknown.
Instead of starting with the travel time, we ﬁnd the conic
parameters ðp;e;xÞfor all conic arcs between these points
as a function of a key variable called the inside angle and
then ﬁnd the parameters for a speciﬁc travel time. We also
ﬁnd conic transfer arcs that optimize other quantities of inter-
est such as the energy needed for the transfer.

7provided an elegant derivation of Kepler’s laws,
and we present that derivation here, both as a reminder of the
general orbit problem and as a way to introduce the parame-
ters of the elliptical orbits. The derivation starts with
Newton’s two body gravitational equation
r€¼/C0l
jrj3r; (1)
where ris the vector from the central mass to the sec-
ondary body, l¼MG,Gis the gravitational constant,
and Mis the central mass, which we assume is much
greater than the orbiter’s mass and is, therefore, ﬁxed at
the origin.
Angular momentum is deﬁned as the vector mr/C2_r, where
mis the mass of the orbiting body, and conservation of angu-
lar momentum is established by using Eq. (1)to show that
d=dtðr/C2_rÞ¼0. Solutions with non-zero angular momen-
tum travel in the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum
vector. Let Ldenote the magnitude of the angular momen-
tum vector and choose polar coordinates ðr;/C23Þin this plane.
(The symbol /C23is commonly used in celestial mechanics to
represent the polar angle, and it is referred to as the “trueanomaly.”) Then Newton’s equation in polar coordinates is
the system of equations
mr2_/C23¼L; €r¼L2
m2r3/C0l
r2: (2)
For these equations, one can deﬁne an “effective potential
energy” VðrÞ¼L2=ð2mr2Þ/C0lm=rand deﬁne energy as
/C15ðr;_rÞ¼m_r2=2þVðrÞ. Using Eq. (2), one shows that
d/C15=dt¼0 so that energy is conserved. For a ﬁxed energy /C15,

Attempting to solve this differential equation by separation
of variables leads to an elliptic integral that does not have an
antiderivative given in terms of elementary functions.
However, a satisfying alternative is found by ﬁnding the
angle as a function of the radius using Eq. (2)

Equation (5)can be solved by separation of variables, and
the equation for the angle as a function of the radius can be
inverted with the result that

This gives Kepler’s ﬁrst law that orbits trace conic arcs.

To solve Eq. (7)by separation of variables leads to an
elliptic integral. The integral caused a big problem before

the invention of computers, because the integral did not have
an antiderivative that could be expressed in terms of elemen-
tary functions. This led to the introduction of eccentric
anomalies and Kepler’s equation. We will instead use thetrue anomaly as discussed below.
Our approach begins by ﬁrst ﬁnding all possible conic arcs
between two points. We start with the special case where the
ﬁrst point ð1;/C23Þis on the unit circle and the second point
ðc;/C23þD/C23Þis on the circle of radius c>1. The conic param-
eters ðp;e;0Þof all possible conic arcs with x¼0 between
these points are found as a function of the variablesðc;D/C23;/C23Þas discussed in Sec. II.
To produce all the conic arcs from a point ðR;aÞto a point
ðcR;aþD/C23Þ, we rescale and rotate the conic arcs for the
special case. As discussed in Sec. III, this general solution is
used to choose conic arcs that minimize characteristics of
interest such as the eccentricity or the energy of a transfer
orbit in addition to the travel time.
In Sec. IV, we use a recent NASA mission to Mars to pose
and solve a boundary value problem and apply our methods.
In Sec. V, we discuss how to patch together conic arcs
between several departure and arrival positions.
II. A GEOMETRY PROBLEM
For two points with polar coordinates ðR;aÞand
ðRc;aþD/C23Þwith c>1, the ﬁrst step of the problem is to
ﬁnd the parameters of all conic arcs between them. The
equation of a general conic has the form
rðh
Þ¼p
1þecosðh/C0xÞ: (8)
The angle /C23¼h/C0xis called the true anomaly. A general
conic is deﬁned by its parameters ðp;e;xÞ. The scale parame-
terpand the elliptic parameter, or eccentricity, eare
non-negative. A restricted conic as we deﬁne it here has the
argument of periapse x¼0. Coordinate rotation by xtakes
the restricted conic with parameters ðp;e;0Þto the conic with
parameters ðp;e;xÞ. Suppose a restricted conic with parame-
tersðp;e;0Þcontains the points with polar coordinates ð1;/C231Þ
andðc;/C231þD/C23Þas shown in Fig. 1. Here, the initial true
anomaly /C231is also referred to as the inside angle, and the
change in the true anomaly D/C23is called the transfer angle.
Then the rotated and rescaled conic with parameters
ðRp;e;a/C0/C231Þcontains the points ðR;aÞandðRc;aþD/C23Þ.
We will rotate and rescale to produce transfer conics fromrestricted conics. This will be done in the ﬁnal two para-
graphs of this section. Until that point, all conics will be
restricted conics with x¼0.
Given circles of radius 1 and radius c>1 centered at the
origin of a plane, we ﬁrst ﬁnd all ellipses that intersect both
circles. The minimum and maximum radii of an ellipse with
parameters ðp;e;0Þare equal to p=ð1þeÞand p=ð1/C0eÞ,
respectively. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for inter-
sections with the circles are p=ð1þeÞ/C201/C20c/C20p=ð1/C0eÞ.
The set of points in the ( p,e) plane which satisfy these condi-
tions forms a triangle TðcÞas shown in Fig. 2forc¼1:524.
The value 1.524 was used because this is the roughly the dis-
tance of the orbit of Mars from the Sun in astronomical units.The triangle is bounded by the lines e¼1;p
¼1þe, and
p¼cð1/C0eÞ. For conics with e/C211, the condition for inter-
section is 0 /C20p/C20ð1þeÞ.A conic with parameters ðp;e;0Þgenerates two equations
for its intersections with the two circles
p
1þecosð/C231Þ¼1; (9)
p
1þecosð/C232Þ¼c: (10)
The condition for the intersection points to span the angle
D/C23¼/C232/C0/C231further restricts the possible values of eandp.
Solving Eqs. (9)and(10) foreandpas functions of the
parameters c,/C231, and D/C23¼/C232/C0/C231yields Eqs. (21) and
(22). These equations allow all orbits with the required trans-
fer angle D/C23between the two orbital radii to be parameter-
ized in terms of the single parameter /C231. By evaluating the
orbital characteristics for the range of possible /C231, one can
ﬁnd the ellipse that satisﬁes a particular condition such as the
transit time (the Lambert problem) or the minimum fuel
transfer orbit.
However, before examining the results of those equations,
we will ﬁrst derive them through the following transforma-
tions, which can provide additional insight into the allowed
values.
The cosines ( c1,c2) of the angles ð/C231;/C232Þare found by
solving the equations

The set T/C3ðcÞ¼fðTðcÞÞis also a triangle contained in the
square ½/C01;1/C138/C2½ /C0 1;1/C138. The top boundary of T/C3ðcÞis the
image of the boundary of TðcÞwith e¼1. By using the for-
mula for f/C01one shows that this boundary is the line
segment

The triangle T/C3ð1:524Þis shown in the unshaded region in
Fig. 2. The cosine oval OvalðD/C23Þshown in Fig. 3is the
parameterized curve OvalðxÞ¼ð cosðxÞ;cosðxþD/C23ÞÞfor
0/C20x/C202p. The arc of the oval that is contained in the inte-
rior of the triangle will be used to solve for the parameters ofall ellipses that intersect the circles at points with coordinatesof the form ð1;/C23
1Þandðc;/C231þD/C23Þ. The complement of this
arc may be used to solve for the parameters of all parabolicand hyperbolic transfer conics.
For a given transfer angle, draw the oval and intersect this
oval with the image T
/C3ðcÞof the map f. The intersection
points of the cosine oval OvalðD/C23Þwith the upper boundary
of the triangle T/C3ðcÞare found by ﬁnding the solutions h1
andh2of the equation
cosðhþD/C23Þ¼cosðhÞþ1
c/C01: (17)
The intersection points determine an interval of inside angles
h1</C23 1<h2. Angles in this interval parametrize the possi-
ble elliptic transfer orbits.A typical intersection is shown in Fig. 3forD/C23¼2p=3.
The preimage of the intersection OvalðD/C23Þ\T/C3ðcÞas
viewed in the p-eplane is shown in Fig. 4. This shows the
elliptic parameters of the transfer ellipses with transfer angle
2p=3.
To compute the set of conic parameters f/C01½OvalðD/C23Þ/C138,
one uses the function g
g:0;2p½/C138 !R2; (18)

pðc;D/C23; /C23 1Þ¼eðc;D/C23;/C23 1Þcosð/C231Þþ1: (22)
We restrict the conic parameters to non-negative values.
This requires that ½cosð/C231Þ/C0ccosð/C231þD/C23Þ/C138>0. Viewed
in the cosine-cosine square with c1¼cosð/C231Þand
c2¼cosð/C231þD/C23Þ, this shows a further restriction on
“allowed” inside angles that generate non-negative conicparameters. The allowed angles for the non-negative conicparameters ðp;eÞof parabolic and hyperbolic transfers are
those where the oval is below the line c
2¼c/C01c1. The
eccentricity is inﬁnite on this line.
The allowed angles for elliptic parameters are those where
the “Oval” is below the line c2¼c/C01c1þc/C01/C01. When the
oval intersects this line, the eccentricity is equal to 1.
The function grestricted to the interval ðh1;h2Þdetermines
the set of allowed elliptic parameters of transfer ellipses as afunction of the outer radius cand the transfer and inner
angles. The function f
/C01applied to the set OvalðD/C23Þalso
determines the set of all conic transfer parameters.
To create elliptic arcs joining the points ðR1;aÞand
ðR2;aþD/C23Þ, choose c¼R2=R1. Using Eqs. (21) and(22),
choose elliptic parameters ðpðc;D/C23;/C23 1Þ;eðc;D/C23; /C23 1ÞÞ. These
are the parameters of an ellipse that intersects the circle of
radius 1 and the circle of radius cwith the transfer angle D/C23
and inside angle /C231. Set x¼a/C0/C231. The angle is the argu-
ment of the periapse of a rotated restricted ellipse. Then the

When the inside angle /C231is unconstrained, formula (23)
produces ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Using Eq. (21),
the eccentricity is zero when tan ð/C231Þ¼½ cosðD/C23Þ
/C01=c/C138=sinðD/C23Þand is inﬁnite when ½cosð/C231Þ
/C0ccosð/C231þD/C23Þ/C138 ¼ 0. We chose to focus on elliptic transfer
paths, because these have the lowest energy needed for the
transfer.
III. TRAVEL TIMES
For a given gravitational parameter l, travel times from
an inner radius Rto an outer radius cRdepend on the values
ofðR;l;c;D/C23; /C23 1Þ. Consider travel times for restricted conics
with x¼0 as a function of these variables. Use Eqs. (21)
and(22) to produce parameters eðc;D/C23;/C23 1Þ;pðc;D/C23;/C23 1Þfor
a conic with R¼1 and the chosen transfer and inner angles.
Then compute travel times using Eq. (7)and numerical inte-
gration. Alternately, use the standard approach using
Kepler’s equation.2Then rescale and rotate.
Algorithm: travel times as a function of ðR;l;c;D/C23;/C23 1Þ.
1. For R¼1 calculate ðeðc;D/C23; /C23 1Þ;pðc;D/C23;/C23 1ÞÞusing Eqs. (21)and(22).
2. Compute the travel time Tðl;c;D/C23;/C23 1Þdirectly using Eq. (7)and
numerical integration.
3. For ﬁxed parameters ðl;c;D/C23Þand for a given travel time s=R3=2, solve
the equation Tðl;c;D/C23; /C23 1Þ¼s=R3=2for/C23/C3

4. Calculate the parameters ðeðc;D/C23;/C23/C3

1ÞÞ ¼ ð e/C3;p/C3Þof the
transfer conic.
5. Set P¼Rp(rescale), L¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃlPp(angular momentum)
Rescaling changes the travel time from s=R3=2tos. This
follows from Eq. (7). The time to travel from ðR;aÞto
ðcR;aþD/C23Þon the transfer conic
rðhÞ¼Rpðc;D/C23;/C23 1Þ
1þeðc;D/C23; /C23 1Þcosðh/C0xÞ; (24)
with x¼a/C0/C231is the same as the time to travel on the cor-
responding conic with x¼0. Thus, the travel time does not
depend on x.
The algorithm solves Lambert’s problem by ﬁrst ﬁnding
the conic parameters of all transfer conics and then ﬁnding
the parameters for a speciﬁc travel time. Rescaling and rotat-
ing conic arcs also simplify other boundary value problems.
IV. A CONIC TRANSFER FROM EARTH TO MARS
As an example, we consider the Mars 2020 mission
launched by NASA on July 30, 2020 and landed on February
18, 2021. The transfer angle between departure and arrival
points is about 143.2/C14, and the travel time is about 203 days.
The allowable range of inside angles ðh1;h2Þfor elliptic
transfer orbits may be computed by ﬁrst ﬁnding the intersec-
tions of the oval with the hypotenuse of the triangle as shown
in Fig. 5.
By plotting the transfer time function of Tð/C231Þ, the differ-
ent possible solutions between the two desired points may
now be clearly seen as shown in Fig. 6. By using differentinitial guesses for /C231, a root ﬁnding algorithm can converge
to ﬁnd a zero of the function fð/C231Þ¼Tð/C231Þ/C0TransferTime.
By limiting the search space to the allowable /C231values
and using the algorithm, our solution converged to /C231
¼17:3/C14andðe;pÞ¼ð 0:219;1:209Þ. The geometry of this
ellipse is shown in Fig. 7. While these results were computed
for the dimensionless orbits in the plane, the actual transfer
orbits may be computed in three dimensions by simply scal-
ing and rotating the resulting orbits in combination with
using states from the ephemeris.
A similar algorithm can be used to minimize fuel costs,
which are an important factor in mission design. We are
biased towards using elliptic transfer orbits because these
have the lowest energy cost. Equation 33below shows the
role played by the conic parameters in the speed at a point
on a transfer orbit. Having identiﬁed all possible trajectories,
a simple calculation ﬁnds the parameters of the least energy
transfer. To minimize energy as a function of the inside
angle, ﬁrst ﬁnd the scale and eccentricity parameters ( p,e)a s
functions of the inside angle, then express the energy as a
function of these parameters, and then minimize the energy
as a function of the inside angle.

Equation 21gave the eccentricity as a function of the inside
angle for a ﬁxed transfer angle. The minimum eccentricity is
found at the inside angle implicitly deﬁned by the equation
tanð/C231Þ¼csinðD/C23Þ=ð1/C0ccosðD/C23ÞÞ: (25)
V. VELOCITY CHANGES AT PATCH POINTS
In this section, the formulas for conic arcs and transfer
times are applied to design patched conic orbits. Patched
conic orbits are used for preliminary mission design where
the velocity change of a spacecraft at the patch point isaccomplished by applying a thrust impulse from a rocket
engine. To transfer from one arc to the next on a patched
conic path, one must know the angle between the tangentlines to the arcs at the patch point. The angle Uof a tangent
vector to the conic equation (31) at a point ðrð/C23Þ;/C23Þon the
conic is required for this calculation. To ﬁnd this angle, onecan calculate using complex variables. For this calculation
the notation for eccentricity conﬂicts with exponential nota-
tion. Just for this calculation, the symbol used for eccentric-ity will be ^e

The velocity in polar coordinates is ðsðr;h;l;e;pÞ;
Uðr;h;e;p;xÞÞ. To transfer from an incoming elliptic orbit
to an outgoing elliptic orbit at a common patch point ðr;hÞ,
the velocity change needed is the difference between the out-
going and incoming velocities at this point. These velocities
are determined for polar coordinates by the above formulas.
As an interesting exercise, one may patch elliptic arcs
together in an outward spiral. Choose conic arcs between
circles of radii 1 ;c;c2;… with a ﬁxed transfer angle D/C23
between patch points and choose allowed elliptic parameters
ðp0e0;x0Þ. Then choose an initial scale parameter and gen-
erate a sequence of elliptic parameters p1¼cp0;e1¼e0;
x1¼x0þD/C23;… Elliptic arcs, travel times, and velocity
changes can now be computed from these data. A plot for
the choice c¼1:524;D/C23¼2p=3;p0¼1:202;e0¼0:2385
is shown in Fig. 8.
The problem of ﬁnding all conic paths from one position
to another in three-dimensions with focus at the origin is an
exercise in linear algebra. We have already shown how toﬁnd all conic paths from AtoBinR3provided both AandB
are in the x-y plane. To ﬁnd all conic paths from position X
to position YinR3with focus at the origin ﬁrst rotate the X-
Y plane to the x-y plane around the line where these planes
intersect. This line is called the line of nodes. Find thetransformed points Aand B. Find all conic paths from A
toBand rotate the paths back to the X-Y plane. The details
of this process will use the properties of vector cross
products.

plane spanned by XandY. The new basis ðB1;B2;B3Þpre-
serves orientation. The linear transformation from the stan-
dard basis to the new basis is given by the orthonormal
matrix U¼ðB1;B2;B3Þ. The inverse of the matrix U is U0
(the transpose of U). Transform the position vectors XandY
to the x-y plane by deﬁning A¼U0XandB¼U0Y.
These are vectors in the x-y plane. Now ﬁnd all conic arcs
from AtoB. Then transform the arcs to arcs from position X
to position YinR3using the matrix U. The elliptic parame-
ters of these arcs in the x-y plane are the same as the elliptic
parameters of the transformed arcs in the plane using the
basis ðB1;B2;B3Þ.
To ﬁnd the departure and arrival velocities in 3D for a
given travel time from position Xto position Y, rotate the
positions into the x-y plane, and solve the 2 D problem. Then
calculate the velocities at the departure and arrival positions
and rotate these velocities back into the X-Y plane.VI. CONCLUSION
A new geometric approach to computing all conic transfer
arcs between two points is derived as a function of the polarcoordinates of the points. The travel time between points ona given conic transfer arc is calculated as a function of theinside angle. This method was successfully used to computeconic transfers across a range of possible transfer times forthe direct case using elliptic arcs. By implementing astraightforward zero ﬁnding method, it is possible to com-pute speciﬁc orbits with desired transfer times. Thisapproach solves Lambert’s problem once subsequent stan-dard rotations are performed to orient the orbit correctly in athree-dimensional space. The present approach also allowsone to optimize other possible astrodynamic parameters forthe transfer. This may reduce the search space and speed upthe computation of the desired solution.
