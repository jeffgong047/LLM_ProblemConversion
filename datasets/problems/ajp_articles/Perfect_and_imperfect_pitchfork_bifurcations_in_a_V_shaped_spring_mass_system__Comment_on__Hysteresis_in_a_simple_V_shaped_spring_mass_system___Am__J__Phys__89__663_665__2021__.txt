In a recent article,1Ong described how saddle-node bifur-
cations arise in a simple system comprised of two identical
springs connected in a symmetrical V-shaped conﬁguration
to a mass m, such as that depicted in Fig. 1. Readers may be
interested to note, however, that the same spring-mass sys-
tem can also be used to study both perfect and imperfect
pitchfork bifurcations.2,3
To see how this works, recall that the equilibrium posi-
tions yin Ong’s system are given by solutions to1
f/C02ky1/C0l0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2þy2p"#
¼0; (1)
where yis the vertical equilibrium position of the mass, fis a
forcing parameter (which includes gravity), 2 xis the hori-
zontal separation between the points securing the springs, k
is the spring constant, and l0is each spring’s natural length
(see Fig. 1). Ong studied saddle-node bifurcations by explor-
ing how the number of possible equilbrium conﬁgurations
changes if the forcing fis varied, with x,k, and l0held ﬁxed.
Here, however, we study pitchfork bifurcations by exploring
how the number of possible equilibrium conﬁgurations
changes if the separation xis varied instead, with f,k, and l0
held ﬁxed. As we shall see, pitchfork bifurcations arise in
two different ways depending on the value of the forcing f.

This change in the number of possible equilibria when x¼xcis
called a perfect pitchfork bifurcation , as shown schematicallyin Fig. 2.N o t i c et h a ti f x>l0, then the springs are under ten-
sion, such that only one equilibrium is possible, with the mass
at the centre y¼0. If x<l0, however, then three equilibria are
permitted: two stable, symmetric equilibria y¼6½l2

and one unstable equilibrium y¼0, with the springs pushing
against each other. Observe from Fig. 2that transitions between
the stable equilibria are continuous at x¼xc.
Iff>0, then it is not easy to solve Eq. (1)fory, and the
situation becomes more complicated. One can, however,
demonstrate that the number of possible equilibria changes
from three to one (or vice versa) whenever xpasses through
the critical value3

In this case, the change in the number of possible equilib-
rium conﬁgurations when x¼xcis called an imperfect pitch-
fork bifurcation (see Fig. 3).
It may be shown for the imperfect pitchfork bifurcation
that increasing xthrough xc(e.g., by pulling the points of
attachment apart from one-another) can lead to the system
shifting from a stable equilibrium conﬁguration y</C0yc<0
(with the mass above the springs) to the one with 0 <y/C20ys
(mass below the springs), where3

the mass mis constrained to move in the y-direction only (e.g., by sliding on
a smooth vertical wire). The y-axis is positive in the “downward” direction.Fig. 2. Possible equilibrium positions yas a function of xwhen f¼0 (solid

Such transitions between equilibria take the springs from a
compressed state (with the downward force supported by thesprings’ reaction) to an extended state (with the downwardforce supported by the springs’ tension) and are, therefore,discontinuous at x¼x
c(see Fig. 3). Note that once the sys-
tem has shifted from /C0yctoys, decreasing xthrough xc(e.g.,
by pushing the points of attachment closer together) willsimply lead to the mass sinking further on the y>0equilibrium; it will not make the mass “jump” back to the
y</C0y
c<0 conﬁguration. In this respect, the transition at
xcis “non-reversible.”
Ultimately, it may be shown that the saddle-node bifurca-
tions discussed by Ong,1and the pitchfork bifurcations
described above, are both features of a cusp catastrophe ,2,3
meaning that the system exhibits a wider range of threshold
phenomena than it has been possible to summarise in ourComment here (see, e.g., our supplementary analysis pub-
lished in another context).3Given such rich behaviour, there-
fore, the simplicity of Ong’s system makes it an idealcandidate for developing undergraduate practical work onnon-linear effects more generally. Indeed, the presence of bi-stability suggests that if friction is considered, then drivingthe system may even lead to chaotic behaviour analogous tothat exhibited by a Dufﬁng oscillator.
4We look forward to
investigate such possibilities in future publications.
