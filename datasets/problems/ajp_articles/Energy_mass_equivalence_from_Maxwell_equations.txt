The celebrated mass-energy equivalence relation, E¼mc2, was derived by Einstein using thought
experiments involving the kinematics of the emission of light and the relativity principle. Textbookderivations often follow paths similar to Einstein’s or analyze the kinematics of particle collisions
in different inertial frames. In such derivations, the direct dynamical link with fundamental ﬁelds
describing matter (e.g., Maxwell theory or other) is overshadowed. Here, we show that the formula
can be derived directly from the dynamical equations of electromagnetic energy conﬁned in a box
(which can be thought of as a toy model of a composite particle). The mass-energy equivalencerelation follows from the inertia or (taking the equivalence principle for granted) weight of
conﬁned radiation. The present derivation offers an interesting pedagogical perspective on the
formula, provides a simple toy model for the origin of mass, and can serve as a bridge to generalrelativity.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the striking results of special relativity1is the
implication of an equivalence between the concepts of inertia
and energy. In one of his founding papers,2Einstein arrived
at the mass-energy equivalence by showing that a body emit-
ting an energy Evia electromagnetic radiation will see its
mass decreased by an amount E=c2. As compelling as it is,
Einstein was not completely satisﬁed and spent the next dec-
ades3–7on a quest for a better proof. Remarkably, the idea
that energy should be associated with a mass was already
present in the literature prior to Einstein’s papers even
though such accounts lacked the conceptual clarity that the
relativity framework provides. In this respect, it is important
to note Poincar /C19e’s derivation using electromagnetic momen-
tum conservation8,9and Hasenohrl’s deduction that a cavity
full of radiation should have a mass m¼4=3ðE=c2Þ10(see
Ref. 11for a historical account).
Today, textbooks give several different derivations, which
are chosen for their simplicity. In Jackson’s classic text-
book,12the equivalence is ﬁrst found by equating the force
on a charged particle with its four-momentum variation. A
second derivation requires the kinematics of colliding par-
ticles (seen in different inertial frames) to be consistent with
the relativity principle. In Ref. 13, one ﬁnds the reconstruc-
tion of Einstein’s argument in Ref. 14, where electromag-
netic radiation plays a central role. Finally, perhaps the
simplest (yet the most formal) derivation starts from the
(relativistic) free particle action15

Ever since Einstein, the interest in mass-energy equiva-
lence has not faded. Alternative derivations have been pro-
posed,16and some of which tried to move away from the
framework of special relativity and instead used concepts of
quantum mechanics17to show how the validity of thisequivalence goes beyond electromagnetism. All these deri-
vations are important and insightful in their own way, and
those found in standard textbooks remain perhaps the sim-plest path to E
0¼mc2. However, none of the modern
accounts make the link between pure energy and mass
dynamically explicit. They hide an important aspect that iscentral in the generalization of special relativity to general
relativity.
The derivation proposed here is complementary to the
standard approaches. In addition, our derivation presents anexplicit link between the ﬁeld equations of a massless theory
and the emergent mass of its conﬁned radiation. In this sense,
it is reminiscent of the old approaches of Poincar /C19e and
Hasen €ohrl. The derivation relies strongly on the notion of
stress-energy-momentum tensor of matter and the covariantinterpretation of its physical content. The exercise paves the
way for the understanding of the energy momentum tensor
as the source of gravity in general relativity and serves alsoas an introduction to the mathematics that is central to the
deﬁnition of the theory.
We will consider radiation conﬁned in an idealized box,
and we will show that this radiation confers an inertial massm¼e=c
2to the box, where eis its energy content. We ﬁrst
consider the radiation to be Maxwell electromagnetic ﬁelds,
which strengthen the idea that special relativity is entirelyencoded in the properties of electromagnetism. (This was the
perspective adopted by Einstein in 1905.) As our derivation
relies entirely on the coordinate independence of the ﬁeld
equations and the conservation of the energy-momentum
tensor of the matter ﬁelds, the result is expected to be validfor any generally covariant matter model. As an additional
example, we show that the construction also works for a
massless scalar ﬁeld.
The idealized box conﬁning the radiation can in turn be
thought of as a simple model of a composite particle (such as
a proton or a neutron): from modern computations
18in quan-
tum chromodynamics (QCD), we know that 99% of the massof a proton comes from the energy of the conﬁned gluon-
quark radiation while only the remaining 1% is due to the
contribution of the rest mass of the quarks (see, for instance,Refs. 19–21 for pedagogical discussions). The QCD conﬁne-
ment potential is replaced in our model by the box and the

boundary conditions that require the ﬁelds to vanish at its
walls. To render the analogy more precise, it is worth men-
tioning that the idea of deﬁning nucleons as conﬁned radia-
tion received a lot of attention in the 1970s. One popular
representation is the so-called “MIT bag model”22,23
designed to describe color conﬁnement in terms of (Yang-
Mills) ﬁelds restricted to vanish outside of a suitable space
region. Of course, such (quantum ﬁeld theoretical) models
were devised to calculate the mass spectrum of particles in
the standard model and not to establish the equivalencebetween mass and energy, which was simply assumed.
Our derivation could not realistically have replaced the
historical one, because it makes use of the physical interpre-
tation of the energy-momentum tensor (even though it is pre-
sent in the literature on Maxwell ﬁelds, it only became
central after the development of relativity) and the general
covariance of the relativistic ﬁeld equations (which also
emerged from general relativity). Nonetheless, all the mathe-
matical ingredients and physical interpretation were arguably
available in the context of Maxwell electromagnetism. Yetthe derivation we propose is straightforward only once mod-
ern tools and covariant methods are used. We hope that this
paper will present students with an alternative (perhaps tech-
nically more advanced) pedagogical perspective of both
technical interest and conceptual value.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give
some motivation for our approach by using the heuristics of
a photon trapped inside an accelerating box (or a box in a
constant gravitational ﬁeld by the equivalence principle). In
Sec. III, we review the properties of Rindler coordinates,
which represent accelerating frames. In Sec. IV, we derive
the formula E¼mc
2by analyzing the energy content of an
accelerating box trapping electromagnetic radiation.
In the appendices, we give supplementary material that
answers some questions that naturally arise from our analy-
sis. In Appendix A , we brieﬂy recall the structure of the
covariant version of Maxwells equations and derive useful
formulae. In Sec. 1 of Appendix A , we prove that the electric
ﬁeld in the rest frame of the box must be perpendicular to the
boundary walls (which is obvious for an inertial box but
requires justiﬁcation for an accelerating one). In Appendix
B, we illustrate the generality of our construction by general-
izing it to the case of a massless scalar ﬁeld.
II. HEURISTICS WITH A TRAPPED PHOTON
As a warm-up exercise, let us ﬁrst examine the heuristics
of the particle interpretation of electromagnetic radiation
from quantum mechanics.24Consider a single photon of fre-
quency xtrapped inside a cubic box of side L. Assume that
the box is accelerated with acceleration jajin the upward
direction (see Fig. 1). At time t¼0, we also assume the box
is at rest, and the photon is passing through the center of the
box and moving up at the speed of light c. At time

the photon hits the top of the box. We are assuming that the
speed of the box when the photon hits the top is much
smaller that the speed of light, hence jajL=c2/C281.
When the photon hits the top, its frequency in the rest
frame of the top wall is x1¼ð1/C0jajt1=cÞxdue to the
Doppler shift. Notice that this effect is expected from thenon-relativistic point of view also: in the limit where
jajL=c2/C281, the standard sound-wave-type Doppler shift
formula coincides with the correct relativistic one. Thus, noexplicit use of special relativity is being made here. Indeed,in the regime in which we are working, we can safely assumethat time tis always given by the very same inertial time
(thought to be absolute time in pre-relativistic terms). Attime t
1, the momentum of the photon changes from
/C22hx1=c!/C0 /C22hx1=c. Thus, Dp1¼/C02/C22hx1=cin the reference
frame of the box.
Next, the photon travels downwards, and its frequency
returns to x(in the instantaneous rest frame of the box)
thanks to the Doppler effect when it passes through the cen-
ter. Indeed the frequency at the center is always xas the
average photon energy must be constant in time in the restframe of the box. This is easy to understand intuitively byconsidering the equivalent situation of the box on the tableon the right panel of Fig. 1. This implies that at time t
2,
the photon hits the bottom of the box with local frequencyx
2¼ð1þjajL=ð2c2ÞÞxandDp2¼2/C22hx2=c. When the pho-
ton gets back to the center at time t3¼2L=c, the average
force F¼Dp=Dtthat must be applied on the box to keep it
constantly accelerating is

which implies that the box has a mass m¼E=c2with
E¼/C22hx(the quantum energy of the photon). The ﬂuctuating
character of the mass due to the bouncing back and forth ofthe photon would go away if we consider many photons in a
suitable conﬁguration that makes the radiation inside the box
“stationary” in a way that will become precise in Sec. IV.I n
this heuristic derivation, special relativity is of course hiddenin the assumption that the momentum of a photon is /C22hx=c,
which comes from quantum mechanics applied to theMaxwell theory. That is indeed our point: the mass-energyequivalence relation is encoded in Maxwell’s dynamics.
The calculation can be improved by considering multiple
photons in arbitrary conﬁgurations. The ﬁnal answer remainsthe same although details become more and more
Fig. 1. On the left panel: an accelerating box containing a photon. On aver-
age, a force jFj¼c/C02/C22hxjajneeds to be applied to maintain the acceleration.
The inertial mass of the box is due to differential radiation pressure of thephoton bouncing off of the walls of the box. (The pressure is smaller at the
top than at the bottom due to the Doppler shift.) On the right: the equivalent
gravitational situation with the box on a table; the weight of the box is

tional red-shift.

cumbersome. The single photon example sufﬁces as a moti-
vation for what follows. The limitation of the present
approach is the use of photons and quantum mechanics.
Nevertheless, this simple argument also gets to the heart ofthe reason for the energy-mass equivalence; it resides in the
structure of the photon momentum-energy relation p¼/C22hx=c
ande¼/C22hx, which is also present in the classical theory, as
realized by Einstein, and as pointed out in textbooks like
Ref. 25. More precisely, electromagnetic energy density
q/C17ð j ~Ej2þj~Bj2Þ=ð8pÞand the electromagnetic momentum
density (Poynting vector) Pi/C17ð~E/C2~BÞi=ð4pcÞare such
that for radiation (where j~Ej¼j ~Bjand ~B?~E), one has
j~Pj¼j ~Ej2=ð4pcÞand q¼j~Ej2=ð4pÞ, which conﬁrms the
energy-mass equivalence via the relationship ðenergy =c2Þ
/C2velocity ¼momentum for light. In what follows, we will
illustrate this in a clear-cut fashion by appealing only to thestructure of Maxwell’s equations without needing the details
of a particular solution. As long as the radiation is conﬁned
inside the box in a stationary conﬁguration, the energy-massformula will follow.
III. RINDLER COORDINATES
From now on, we will use abstract index notation (see
Refs. 25and26for deﬁnition and further discussion). We
ﬁrst need to get familiar with the description of acceleratedframes in geometric terms. This will be used to represent
observers at rest with respect to the box of radiation model-
ling the composite particle.

Also for later use, the four-volume form (see, for instance,Appendix B in Ref. 26) in terms of Rindler coordinates is

The subindex “box” is natural due to the fact that this Killing
ﬁeld is associated with the time translation invariance of theuniformly accelerating observers at rest with respect to thebox that will contain the conﬁned radiation as described in
Sec. IV. (The isometry corresponding to this Killing ﬁeld is
the one associated with the invariance of the ﬂat Minkowskimetric under boosts.)

Notice that even when all points of the box move at the same
speed (the box is rigid), different points have different accel-

(The distance between the top and the bottom of the box
remains ﬁxed.) This might be surprising at ﬁrst sight, but it isone of these counter intuitive facts in Lorentzian geometry. Allthe same, when the concept of acceleration of the box will beneeded (only in the material presented in the Appendices), wewill work under the assumption that ja

used in Sec. II) in which case a single constant acceleration
can be approximately assigned to the whole box.
IV. THE MASS OF MAXWELL FIELDS CONFINED
IN A BOX
In this section, we derive the mass-energy equivalence for-
mula from the inertial properties of a box with perfectly con-ducting walls ﬁlled with electromagnetic radiation. Weconsider the Maxwell theory and its solutions in Rindler coor-dinates, introduced in Sec. III, and impose boundary condi-
tions that represent perfectly conducting walls. However, wewill see that very little information about the solutions isneeded. (This is one of the nice features of the result.) Moreprecisely, the only explicit property of the solution that enters
the proof is that the electric ﬁeld, in the rest frame of the
accelerating box, must be perpendicular to the walls. This iswell known for a box in inertial motion, the fact that itremains true in the uniformly accelerated case is perhapsphysically clear but technically less obvious. The proof isgiven in Sec. 1 of Appendix A , and the basic mathematical
reason is that Maxwell’s equations maintain very much thesame structure in the accelerated frame as in an inertial one.Thus, the only assumptions that go into the proof presented in
this section are: the validity of the Maxwell equations (which
imply the conservation of the energy momentum tensor), theassumption of perfectly reﬂecting walls for the conﬁning box,and the requirement that the radiation in the box is “at rest” inthe frame of the box. This last ingredient takes a simple math-ematical form stated below in Eq. (23) and corresponds physi-
cally to the idea of a box representing a composite particle asevoked in the introduction.
Let us now compute the energy content of the box, as
measured in the laboratory frame, at a given simultaneitysurface of constant Rindler time s(see Fig. 2). In order to dothis, we introduce the energy-momentum tensor T
abof the
Maxwell ﬁeld and the current

The energy momentum tensor for electromagnetism is given
in Eq. (A5) ; however, its explicit form is not important at the
moment. By deﬁnition of the current in the previous equa-
tion, the energy content of the box of conﬁned radiation at a

As we show below, the second term in the previous equation
vanishes if we demand that the radiation inside the box is
stationary in its rest frame, namely, that the /C22x-component of
the total linear momentum of the radiation vanishes in therest frame of the box. This is natural from the perspectivethat the radiation itself deﬁnes what the particle is.
In order to show that this is equivalent to the vanishing of
the second term in Eq. (21), let us now consider the energy
current associated with the frame, in which the box is at rest.

general situations, the two terms in Eq. (21) are important.

V. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that radiation conﬁned to an idealized box
with perfectly reﬂecting walls has an inertial mass given byits energy content divided by c2. We demonstrated this for
both Maxwell electromagnetic ﬁelds and massless scalarﬁelds (see Appendix B ). Our calculation relies entirely on
general properties of the solution of the ﬁeld equations andthe properties of the energy momentum tensor of the con-ﬁned radiation. The only explicit requirement from the solu-tions is that the radiation be in a stationary state of vanishingtotal linear momentum in the frame of the box. This assump-tion is compatible with the fact that the box can be thoughtof as a toy model of a composite particle (an ultrasimpliﬁedclassical model of a proton or a neutron). The calculationsdone in this solvable simple model have deep conceptualimplications. In particular, mass becomes an emergentnotion suggesting the appealing idea that mass parameters inour physical models could arise from more fundamentaldegrees of freedom.
Even when no gravitational ﬁeld is invoked, the result fol-
lows naturally from the application of the mathematics ofgeneral relativity. On the physical front, the naturalness ofthe energy-momentum tensor as the source of gravity is
made more transparent by our special relativistic analysis.
For these reasons, we expect the paper to be useful from apedagogical perspective.

1. Maxwell equations in the accelerated frame of the box
An especially interesting case for the present paper is the
one corresponding to a uniformly accelerated box. Thus, we
analyze the content of the Maxwell theory in terms of theelectric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned in an accelerating frame.
Given the four velocity of a family of observers at rest with
respect to the accelerating box u
a

can write the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength as

Now we write Maxwell equation (A1) in a way that it
would lead to the analog of Gauss and Amp /C19ere integral
identities for inertial frames, but now these are valid in anaccelerated frame. This step is rather technical but veryimportant; a general treatment in curved spacetimes can be
found in Ref. 32.

which has the form of the usual Gauss law in an inertial

its usual form in arbitrary frames (see Problem 2 in Chapter
4 of Ref. 26). In the present case, the technical complications
of the previous lines are justiﬁed not by the objective of
obtaining the Gauss law but rather the aim of getting the ana-log of Amp /C19ere’s law, which will follow from the spacelike
part of the previous equations.
Therefore, we need to project Eq. (A16) using

where we have added and subtracted the same term on the
right just to recover the expression of the Lie derivative
lubox/C22Eb, which is the natural derivative along the world-
lines of the box observers. Notice that the term we added and
subtracted projects to zero (purely time-like) due to the third

tion corresponds to a natural proper time T /C17/C22xsderivative

Equations (A23) ,(A19) ,(A26) , and (A27) are Maxwell’s
equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds on the acceler-
ated (instantaneous rest) frame of the conﬁning box.
a. Consequences
We have recast the Maxwell equations in terms of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds as measured in the rest frame of
the accelerating box. It was a bit technical but the conse-
quences are quite simple and analogous to the familiar caseof a box at rest in an inertial frame. We will now see that, as
in the case of an inertial box, the Maxwell equations (plus
the standard physical assumption that the magnetic ﬁeld
inside the conductor is initially zero) applied to the accelerat-
ing box imply that
F
abðinside conductor Þ¼0: (A28)
More precisely, the idealization of perfectly conducting
walls requires ﬁrst the electric ﬁeld to vanish inside the con-
ductor, Ebox
aðinside conductor Þ¼0. In addition, right inside
the box and at the walls any parallel component of Ebox
ato
the walls must vanish: if not there would be a force rearrang-
ing surface charges to make this component vanish.33
Therefore, Ebox
ajbox/Nawhere Nais the normal to the walls.
Now, Eq. (A27) implies that the magnetic ﬁeld Bbox
amust be
time independent inside the conductor, where the electric
ﬁeld vanishes. Assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld was zero ini-
tially then we have that Bbox
aðinside conductor Þ¼0 for all
times. Equation (A28) now follows from Eq. (A11) .
Another important consequence of the vanishing of the
magnetic ﬁeld inside the box is that from Eq. (A26) , one can
prove—using Gauss’ law—that the normal component of
Bbox
aat the walls (on the inside of the box) must vanish. An
important consequence of this follows from a two lines cal-
culation that uses Eq. (A11) , the deﬁnition jbox

APPENDIX B: THE MASSLESS SCALAR FIELD
CASE
The result of Appendix A depends of the ﬁeld equations
only and in a generic manner, in the sense that no particu-lar solutions need to be considered for the proof. The ﬁrstimportant ingredient is the conservation of the energy-
momentum tensor in the bulk of the box (which follows
from the validity of the ﬁeld equations). The second is thebehavior of the divergence of j
box
ain Eq. (25),w h e r et h e
reﬂecting boundary conditions constrain the electric ﬁeld
(as measured in the box frame) to be orthogonal to thewalls, and the third is the orthogonality of j
box
ato the walls.
Both of these ingredients follow from the structure of the
ﬁeld equations at the boundary as shown in Appendix A 1 .
No speciﬁc solution needs to be chosen to prove these
properties: these are generic consequences of the equations
and the physical conditions at the idealized walls of thebox. Therefore, one would expect that the proof of the
Appendix A should be valid (with small adjustments) for
any massless matter model. We do not have a general proofof this; nevertheless, we can at least provide evidence by
exhibiting another simple example: the massless scalar
ﬁeld.
The ﬁeld equation of a massless scalar ﬁeld /is
(//C17r

where jis a source term (necessary to impose the boundary
conditions at the walls of the box). The stress-energy-
momentum tensor is given by
Tab¼r a/rb//C01
2gabgcdrc/rd/: (B2)
Direct calculation of the divergence of the stress-energy-
momentum tensor (B2) yields
raTab¼jrb/; (B3)
which in the absence of sources vanishes identically. When
the radiation is conﬁned inside a box, made of perfectlyreﬂecting walls (as in the Maxwell case) surface chargesappear. We write
j¼rd
box; (B4)
where rrepresents the surface charge density. This is the
analog of the surface electric charges and surface current in
a perfect conducting wall in electromagnetism. They areresponsible for imposing reﬂecting boundary conditions that,
in the present case, boil down to /¼0 at the box walls.
These sources ﬁx the normal derivative of the scalar ﬁeld:From Eq. (B1) and Gauss’ law applied to the vector ﬁeld

As in the case of Maxwell ﬁelds, we start from the deﬁnition
of the energy content of the box in the lab frame as in Eq.
(19). The argument follows the same lines from Eqs. (19) to(24), where the ﬁeld equations do not really enter. Things
change slightly when considering the current in Eq. (22)
whose divergence remains

of Eq. (26) is also valid for the scalar ﬁeld as long as the sta-
tionary condition (23) is satisﬁed for the scalar ﬁeld inside
the box. Now, the validity of Eq. (28) depends on the validity
ofjbox

29Notice that as the previous integral involves the notion of “ /C22x-direction” at
different points in the box, one would need, in principle, to parallel trans-port all these vectors at some reference point to be able to integrate (sum
up) all the contributions. It is easy to check that such parallel transport is
trivial in this case.
30Otherwise, the charges would move in response to the electric ﬁeld andneutralize any of its parallel components.
