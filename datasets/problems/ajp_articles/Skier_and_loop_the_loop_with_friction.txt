We solve analytically the differential equations for a skier on a hemispherical hill and for a particle
on a loop-the-loop track when the hill or track is endowed with a coefﬁcient of kinetic friction l.
For each problem, we determine the exact “phase diagram” in the two-dimensional parameter
plane.#2022 All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC

I. INTRODUCTION
Two classic homework exercises in an elementary
mechanics course are the skier on a hemispherical hill(Fig. 1) and the particle on a loop-the-loop track (Fig. 2).1
Both problems illustrate nicely the use of conservation of
energy (to ﬁnd the speed as a function of height) followed by
F¼ma(to ﬁnd the normal force).
It is interesting to consider what happens when the hill or
track is endowed with a coefﬁcient of kinetic friction l.
Somewhat surprisingly, the exact differential equations turnout to be analytically solvable.2–11Our purpose here is to
provide a uniﬁed treatment of the two problems, using onlyelementary methods that are easily accessible to undergradu-ates (e.g., linear ﬁrst-order differential equations). Thoughmost of our results have been obtained previously—as we
shall document in detail—they are somewhat scattered in the
literature. It may thus be of some modest value to have acomplete elementary derivation collected in one place.
The skier and loop-the-loop problems give rise to very
similar differential equations, which differ only by somesign changes. However, these sign changes lead to signiﬁcantdifferences in the qualitative interpretation of the solutions.Since the skier problem turns out to be somewhat simpler,
we treat it ﬁrst and give a complete solution; in particular,
we determine the exact phase diagram in the two-dimensional parameter plane. For the loop-the-loop, wesolve the differential equations only up to the ﬁrst time (ifany) that the particle halts or completes one cycle of theloop, so we obtain only a partial phase diagram. The fullphase diagram will (as we explain later) contain an inﬁnite
sequence of bifurcations, and we leave its computation to a
reader who wishes to take up where we have left off.
II. SKIER ON A HEMISPHERICAL HILL
Consider a skier of mass mon a hemispherical hill of
radius R(or more generally, any hill of circular cross sec-
tion) and coefﬁcient of kinetic friction l, entering at the top
with forward velocity v
0; lethdenote the angle from the ver-
tical (Fig. 1). Then, the radial and tangential components of
F¼maare12
N/C0mgcosh¼/C0mR_h2; (1)
mgsinh/C0lNsgnð_hÞ¼mR€h: (2)This is a pair of coupled differential equations for the
unknown functions hðtÞandN(t). We stress, however, that
these equations are valid only as long as N/C210; after that,
the skier ﬂies off the hill. Since it is clear that the skier will
only go down the hill, not up, we have _h/C210 throughout the
motion, and the factor sgn ð_hÞin Eq. (2)can be dropped.13
Differentiating Eq. (1)with respect to time yields
dN
dt¼/C0 ð mgsinhþ2mR€hÞ_h; (3)
and inserting €hfrom Eq. (2)[with sgn ð_hÞ¼1] yields
dN
dt¼/C0 ð 3mgsinh/C02lNÞ_h: (4)
Using the chain rule dN=dt¼ðdN=dhÞðdh=dtÞ, we can elim-
inate _hfrom Eq. (4), leading to
dN
dh/C02lN¼/C03mgsinh: (5)
This is a ﬁrst-order inhomogeneous linear differential equation
with constant coefﬁcients for the unknown function NðhÞ,a n di t
can be solved by the method of integrating factors. Here, the
integrating factor is e/C02lh, and the solution is14
NðhÞ¼N0e2lh/C03mge2lh/C0cosh/C02lsinh
1þ4l2; (6)
where N0¼Nð0Þ. We again stress that this solution is valid
only where NðhÞ/C210; at the ﬁrst angle (if any) where NðhÞ
crosses zero to a negative value, the skier ﬂies off the hill.
Evaluating Eq. (1)ath¼0, where the skier’s angular
velocity is _h¼v0=R, we obtain N0¼mg/C0mv2
0=R. In partic-
ular, if the dimensionless parameter k¼defv2
0=gRis/C211, then
N0/C200 and the skier immediately ﬂies off the hill;
we, therefore, assume henceforth that 0 /C20k<1. Inserting
N0¼ð1/C0kÞmgin Eq. (6), we obtain
NðhÞ¼ð 1/C0kÞmg e2lh/C03mge2lh/C0cosh/C02lsinh
1þ4l2;
(7)
which is the closed-form solution giving the normal force as
a function of angle.

In the absence of friction ( l¼0), Eq. (7)simpliﬁes to
NðhÞ¼ð 3 cos h/C02/C0kÞmg: (8)
This is a decreasing function of h, and skier ﬂies off the hill
when N¼0, i.e., when
h¼cos/C012þk
3/C18/C19
: (9)
In the usual textbook problem, one has also v0¼0 (i.e.,
k¼0), and we obtain the standard answer that the skier ﬂies
off at angle h¼cos/C01ð2=3Þ/C2548:19/C14.
When l>0, by contrast, the normal force is no longer a
decreasing function of h, nor is it guaranteed to reach
zero within the interval 0 /C20h/C20p=2. Indeed, dN=dhjh¼0
¼2lð1/C0kÞmg>0, so the normal force is initially
increasing.
We can also obtain the velocity as a function of angle. It is
convenient to deﬁne the dimensionless quantity K¼defv2=gR
¼R_h2=g; its value at h¼0 is what we have called k. Then,
from Eq. (1)we have immediately
N¼ðcosh/C0KÞmg; (10)
[which reduces to N0¼ð1/C0kÞmgwhen h¼0] or equivalently,
K¼cosh/C0N
mg: (11)
In particular, from N/C210 we deduce that K/C20cosh: This
gives the maximum speed that the skier can have at anygiven angle if she is to avoid ﬂying off the hill. Combining
Eqs. (7)and(11)gives the closed-form solution for the speed
as a function of angle as follows:15
KðhÞ¼cosh/C0ð1/C0kÞe2lhþ3e2lh/C0cosh/C02lsinh
1þ4l2:
(12)
Note, however, that this solution is valid only where
KðhÞ/C210; at the ﬁrst angle (if any) where KðhÞ¼0, the skier
comes to rest (perhaps only asymptotically as t!þ 1 ). The
solution (12) must therefore be supplemented by the two
inequalities 0 /C20KðhÞ/C20cosh.
From Eqs. (5)and(10)/(11), we see that KðhÞsatisﬁes the
differential equation,16

The solution of this differential equation with the initial con-
ditionKð0Þ¼kis of course Eq. (12).14
In the absence of friction ( l¼0), Eq. (12)simpliﬁes to
KðhÞ¼kþ2ð1/C0coshÞ; (14)
which is just the expression for conservation of energy:

The work-energy theorem asserts that dE/dtmust equal the
rate of work done by friction, which is /C0lNR_h; and this
equality is an immediate consequence of Eqs. (10),(13),
and (16). Conversely, the differential equation (13) could
alternatively be derived by combining the work-energy theo-rem with Eqs. (10) and(16).17It may be useful for students
to compare these two derivations: one directly from theNewtonian equations of motion, and the other from thework-energy theorem.
Finally, we can use Eq. (12) to obtain the time-
dependence of the motion. From K¼R_h
2=g, we have

We can now analyze the qualitative behavior of the
motion as a function of the two parameters l2½0;1Þand
k2½0;1Þ. We have seen that the skier halts when KðhÞ¼0

or ﬂies off the hill when KðhÞ¼cosh, whichever happens
ﬁrst; if neither happens for h<p=2, then the skier reaches
the bottom of the hill. (We will see later that this last casenever occurs.) The critical solution that separates these twoscenarios is given by the trajectory for which the skier haltsat an angle h
?(hence Kðh?Þ¼0) that also satisﬁes K0ðh?Þ
¼0: See the curve marked k¼k?in Fig. 3. Applying this
condition in Eq. (13)leads immediately to18
h?ðlÞ¼defarctan l: (19)
Substituting this in Eq. (12), we obtain the relationship
between the initial velocity and the friction coefﬁcient thatdeﬁnes the phase boundary,19
k?ðlÞ¼def4l2/C02þ2e/C02larctan lﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1þl2p
1þ4l2: (20)
Please observe that k?ðlÞis an increasing function of lthat
runs from 0 to 1 as lruns from 0 to 1(see Fig. 4).
In this way, we have obtained a phase diagram that divides
theðl;kÞplane into three possible qualitative behaviors:
•For 0 /C20k<k?ðlÞ, the skier halts after a ﬁnite time at
some angle hhaltðl;kÞ: This angle is an increasing function
ofkthat runs from 0 to arctan laskruns from 0 to k?ðlÞ.
•Fork¼k?ðlÞ, the skier comes to rest asymptotically as
t!þ 1 at the angle h¼arctan l.20•Fork?ðlÞ<k<1, the skier ﬂies off the hill at some angle
hflyðl;kÞ: This angle is a decreasing function of kthat
tends to 0 as k!1.
The curve k?ðlÞthus forms the boundary between the
“halt” phase and the “ﬂy-off” phase (see again Fig. 4).21In
particular, the skier always either halts or ﬂies off; she neverreaches angle p=2.
Some typical curves of KðhÞfor all three scenarios are
shown in Fig. 3. Note, in particular, that KðhÞ¼K0ðhÞ¼0
when k¼k?ðlÞandh¼h?ðlÞ; and note the fundamental
qualitative difference between the curves for k<k?ðlÞ,
which reach the K¼0 axis, and those for k>k?ðlÞ, which
do not.22
Some typical curves of hhaltðl;kÞas a function of kare
shown in Fig. 5, and some typical curves of hflyðl;kÞas a
function of kare shown in Fig. 6. Please note the discontinu-
ous change in behavior as the phase boundary k?ðlÞis
crossed: hflyðl;k?ðlÞÞ(the dotted curve in Fig. 6)i sm u c h
larger than hhaltðl;k?ðlÞÞ(the dashed curve in Fig. 5).23This
is a very simple example of sensitive dependence to initial
conditions, giving rise to a discontinuous phase transition—a
phenomenon pointed out already by James Clerk Maxwell in1876.24
Since the proofs of all the previous claims involve some
slightly intricate calculus, we relegate them to Appendix Ain the supplementary material.25

Let us remark, ﬁnally, that by the same methods one can
study the more general problem in which the coefﬁcient of
kinetic friction is an arbitrary function lðhÞof the position
along the hill: The Eq. (5)is still a ﬁrst-order inhomogeneous
linear differential equation for the unknown function NðhÞ—
albeit now one with nonconstant coefﬁcients—so can still be
solved by the method of integrating factors (though the result
may not be analytically expressible in terms of elementary
functions). We leave it to interested readers to pursue this
generalization.
Some recent related articles are Refs. 10,11, and 26,
which study a particle sliding down an arbitrary curve in the
presence of kinetic friction; Ref. 27, which uses the
Lagrangian formalism with Lagrange multipliers to analyze
a particle sliding without friction down an arbitrary concave
curve; and Ref. 28, which studies a ball rolling (initially
without slipping, later with sliding and kinetic friction) on an
arbitrary curve in the presence of gravity, including an
experimental realization.
III. PARTICLE ON LOOP-THE-LOOP TRACK
A block of mass mis injected with forward velocity v0
into a loop-the-loop track of radius Rand coefﬁcient of
kinetic friction l; lethdenote the angle up from the bottom,
as shown in Fig. 2. (In one common version of the problem,1
the block is released from rest at height hand slides to the
bottom via a frictionless track; in this case, v0¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ2ghp.) The
radial and tangential components of F¼maare
mgcosh/C0N¼/C0mR_h2; (21)
/C0mgsinh/C0lNsgnð_hÞ¼mR€h: (22)
As before, these equations are valid only as long as N/C210;
after that, the block falls off the track.
The loop-the-loop problem is more complicated than the
skier, for three reasons: The particle can cycle around the
track; it can reverse direction; and it can halt due to static
friction. Each time the particle reverses direction, we need to
apply Eq. (22) with a new value for sgn ð_hÞ; this repeated
switching between different equations seems quite compli-
cated, and probably needs to be handled by numerical solu-
tion.29To simplify matters, we will here follow the block
only until it ﬁrst reaches _h¼0 or falls off the track; we,
therefore, have _h/C210.
Proceeding as in Eqs. (3)–(5) leads to the differential
equation,
dN
dhþ2lN¼/C03mgsinh; (23)
for the unknown function NðhÞ; this equation differs from
Eq.(5)only by the replacement l!/C0 l. The solution is,
therefore,
NðhÞ¼N0e/C02lh/C03mge/C02lh/C0coshþ2lsinh
1þ4l2;(24)
where N0¼Nð0Þ. Applying Eq. (21) ath¼0, where the
block’s angular velocity is _h¼v0=R, we see that N0¼mg
þmv2
0=R. Using again the dimensionless parameter k¼defv2
0=gR,
we have N0¼ð1þkÞmgand henceNðhÞ¼ð 1þkÞmg e/C02lh/C03mge/C02lh/C0coshþ2lsinh
1þ4l2:
(25)
To obtain the velocity as a function of angle, we deﬁne
once again the dimensionless quantity K¼defv2=gR¼R_h2=g,
which takes the value kath¼0. Then, from Eq. (21) we
have
N¼ðcoshþKÞmg; (26)
[which reduces to N0¼ð1þkÞmg when h¼0] and
therefore30
KðhÞ¼/C0 coshþð1þkÞe/C02lh
/C03e/C02lh/C0coshþ2lsinh
1þ4l2: (27)
Since K/C210, we must have N/C21mgcosh; and when
N¼mgcosh, the block comes instantaneously to rest. After
that, the particle might either reverse direction or halt due to
static friction. As mentioned earlier, we refrain from follow-
ing the particle beyond the ﬁrst time it comes instantaneously
to rest.
The solution (25) must, therefore, be supplemented by the
two inequalities NðhÞ/C210 and NðhÞ/C21mgcosh. (Please note
that, unlike in the skier problem, both of these inequalities
point in the same direction; this radically changes the nature
of the qualitative analysis.) The block comes instantaneously
to rest when NðhÞ¼mgcoshor falls off the track when
NðhÞ¼0, whichever happens ﬁrst; if neither happens for
h<2p, then the block completes one full cycle of the loop-
the-loop. Now, the inequality NðhÞ/C21mgcoshis the more
stringent one in the lower half of the loop-the-loop (that is,
/C0p=2/C20h/C20p=2 modulo 2 p), while the inequality NðhÞ/C210
is the more stringent one in the upper half of the loop-the-
loop (that is, p=2/C20h/C203p=2 modulo 2 p). Therefore, the
block can come instantaneously to rest only in the lower half
of the loop-the-loop, and it can fall off the track only in the
upper half of the loop-the-loop.
In the absence of friction ( l¼0), Eq. (25)simpliﬁes to
NðhÞ¼ð k/C02þ3 cos hÞmg: (28)
Ifk/C202, then the block reverses direction at
h¼hmax¼defcos/C012/C0k

(a value that follows immediately from conservation of
energy) and oscillates forever between /C0hmaxandhmax;i f

; (30)
which lies between p=2 and p;i fk¼5, then the block
asymptotically approaches h¼past!þ 1 ;i fk>5, then
the block cycles forever around the track without loss of
energy.
In the presence of friction ( l>0), the analysis proceeds
as follows:

(1) The ﬁrst step is to determine the conditions under which
the particle halts in the ﬁrst quadrant (0 /C20h/C20p=2). The
particle halts at angle hwhenKðhÞ¼0, i.e., in case the

khaltðh;lÞis an increasing function of hin the interval
0/C20h/C20p=2 (as is intuitively clear: To reach a larger angle,
more initial velocity is needed). In particular, the particlereaches h¼p=2 with _h>0 if and only if

1þ4l2: (33)
(2) If the particle reaches angle p=2 without halting, the next
step is to determine the conditions under which the parti-cle ﬂies off in the second or third quadrant ( p=2/C20h
/C203p=2). The particle ﬂies off at angle hwhen NðhÞ¼0,
i.e., in case the initial velocity satisﬁes

(34)
Note that kflyðp=2;lÞ¼khaltðp=2;lÞ. Since@kflyðh;lÞ
@h¼3e2lhsinh; (35)
we see that khaltðh;lÞis an increasing function of hin
the interval from p=2t opand then a decreasing function
in the interval from pto 3p=2. The ﬁrst of these facts is
again intuitively clear: To survive to a larger angle with-
out ﬂying off, more initial velocity is needed. The second
fact implies that if the particle reaches angle pwithout
ﬂying off—that is, if
k/C21kflyðp;lÞ¼def2/C04l2þ3e2pl
1þ4l2; (36)
then it also reaches angle 3 p=2 without ﬂying off. This is
intuitively clear when there is no friction, but not so obvi-
ous in the presence of friction. This implies—analogouslyto what happens in the skier problem—a discontinuous
change of behavior as kpasses through k

(3) If the particle reaches angle p(and hence also angle
3p=2) without halting or ﬂying off, the next step is to
determine what happens in the fourth quadrant
(3p=2<h<2p). The particle halts at angle hin case k
equals the quantity khaltðh;lÞdeﬁned in Eq. (31). From
Eq. (32), we see that @khaltðh;lÞ=@his negative at
h¼3p=2 and positive at h¼2p, with a unique zero at

interval 3 p=2/C20h/C202p/C0arctan land increasing in the
interval 2 p/C0arctan l/C20h/C202p. Its maximum value in
the interval ½3p=2;2p/C138, therefore, lies either at h¼3p=2
or at h¼2p. Since we are in the situation k/C21kflyðp;lÞ

577 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 8, August 2022 D. Kufel and A. D. Sokal 577 04 October 2023 23:13:42
question is whether kis larger than khaltð2p;lÞor not. If
it is, then the particle reaches angle 2 pwithout halting. If
it is not, then the particle halts at some angle in the inter-
valð2p/C0arctan l;2p/C138, namely, the unique angle where
k¼khaltðh;lÞ. The ﬁrst of these cases always occurs
when kflyðp;lÞ>khaltð2p;lÞ, i.e., when 0 /C20l<lcrit
/C250:713 089. (See Appendix B in the supplementary
material25for the proof that there is a unique such value
lcrit.) When l/C21lcrit, then there is a “halt in fourth quad-
rant” phase at kflyðp;lÞ/C20k/C20khaltð2p;lÞand a “survive
to angle 2 p” phase at k/C21khaltð2p;lÞ. We record the
formula

Since khaltð2p;lÞ>0 in the survive to angle 2 pphase, we
have knew<e/C04plk: Thus, the kinetic energy is reduced by
at least a factor e/C04plat each revolution. The subsequent
motion can then be found by repeating the foregoing analysiswith kreplaced by k

The resulting phase diagram is shown in Fig. 8. Since
khaltð2p;lÞgrows extremely rapidly with l, we have usedﬃﬃﬃ

instead of kon the vertical axis, to compress the plot.
This phase diagram agrees with the one found by Kłobus
(Ref. 8, Fig. 2); the value of khaltð2p;1Þalso agrees with his.
All three phase boundaries are increasing functions of l: See
Appendices B1–B3 in the supplementary material.25
Of course, this phase diagram only follows the particle up
to the ﬁrst time that it reaches _h¼0o r h¼2p. A morecomplete analysis would show that the phase “survives to
angle 2 p” is itself divided into sub-phases “halts in the ﬁrst
quadrant” (2 p<h<5p=2), “ﬂies off the second quadrant”
(5p=2<h<3p), “halts in the fourth quadrant”
(7p=2<h<4p), and “survives to angle 4 p”; and this latter
phase is further divided into sub-phases; and so on inﬁnitely.We leave it to interested readers to work out the details ofthis inﬁnite sequence of bifurcations.

arbitrary curve in the vertical plane, using the Frenet–Serret formalism.
13Taking literally the Eqs. (1) and (2), the skier would reverse directionwhen _h¼0 and begin climbing back up the hill, but this is not, of
course, what actually happens. Rather, when the skier halts, static fric-
tion takes over, and the skier remains forever at rest; this occurs because
static friction is governed by the inequality jF
sj/C20lN, not the equality
jFsj¼lN.
14See also Ref. 4, Appendix A for an alternate approach to solving Eqs. (5)
and (13), which does not require the student to be familiar with the method
of integrating factors.

17This approach is taken, for instance, in Ref. 6, Eqs. (9) and (17); in Ref. 7,
Eq. (1); and in Ref. 11for an arbitrary curve in the vertical plane.

also gives analogous formulas for the parabola, cycloid, catenary, and
ellipse.
20It can be seen directly from the equations of motion (1)and(2)that this
“asymptotic equilibrium” position can only be h¼arctan l. To see this,
observe that sgn ð_hÞ¼þ 1 for all t/C210, and that _h;€h!0a s t!þ 1 .
Combining Eqs. (1)and(2)ast!þ 1 then yields N¼mgcoshand
h¼arctan l. This argument does notapply to the “subcritical” trajectories
in which the skier halts after a ﬁnite time, since in these trajectories _h¼0
but€h6¼0 at the halting time.

. The three
boundary curves are, from bottom to top, khaltðp=2;lÞ,kflyðp;lÞ, and
khaltð2p;lÞ, shown respectively in solid black, dashed blue, and dotted red.
The particle either halts in the ﬁrst quadrant (Q1), ﬂies off the second quad-
rant (Q2), halts in the fourth quadrant (Q4), or survives to angle 2 p.

shows the phase diagram for the parabola, cycloid, catenary, and ellipse.
22Compare Ref. 4, Fig. 2; Ref. 10, Fig. 3, or Fig. 4 in the arXiv version. The
latter plot shows different values of lfor the same k¼0:6, which is com-
plementary to our Fig. 3.

Knowledge, London, 1876); reprinted by Dover, New York, 1952 and
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010. After stating (p. 20) what
he sees as “the general maxim of physical science”—namely, “the samecauses will always produce the same effects”—Maxwell goes on to
observe (p. 21) that
There is another maxim which must not be confounded with
[this one], which asserts “That like causes produce like effects.”
This is only true when small variations in the initial
circumstances produce only small variations in the final state of
the system. In a great many physical phenomena, this conditionis satisfied, but there are other cases in which a small initial
variation may produce a very great change in the final state of
the system, as when the displacement of the “points” causes arailway train to run into another instead of keeping its proper
course.

29The qualitative behavior after the particle reverses direction is, however,
very simple. As will be seen below, the particle can come instanta-neously to rest only in the lower half of the loop-the-loop(/C0p=2/C20h/C20p=2 modulo 2 p). After this happens, the particle simply
oscillates back and forth, with constant amplitude if l¼0 and with
decreasing amplitude if l>0.
