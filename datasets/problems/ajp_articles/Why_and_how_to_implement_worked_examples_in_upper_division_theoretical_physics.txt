Studying worked examples has been shown by extensive research to be an effective method for
learning to solve well-structured problems in physics and mathematics. The effectiveness of
learning with worked examples has been demonstrated and documented in many research projects.In this work, we propose a new four-step approach for teaching with worked examples that
includes writing explanations and ﬁnding and correcting errors. This teaching method can even be
implemented in courses in which homework performance constitutes part of the grading system.This four-step approach is illustrated in the context of Lagrangian mechanics, which is ideal for the
application of worked examples due to its universal approach to solve problems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Worked examples are step-by-step solutions of exercises or
tasks. When well-structured worked examples are included inthe learning process of novices, they improve the initial acquisi-
tion of cognitive skills as compared to conventional problem-
solving activities (the so-called worked-example effect).1–3
Effective learning with worked examples can consist, for exam-ple, of studying several solutions and explaining them oneself
before solving a similar problem without add itional support
(example-problem pairs1).
The advantages of this method are often understood through
cognitive load theory.3This theory assumes that learning is
associated with cognitive load and describes what can facilitate
or impede learning. For example, the removal of extraneoustasks such as remembering how to complete mathematical
operations allows the student to concentrate on the main learn-
ing task. In addition, worked examples are considered cognitiveactivating, meaning that they cause the student to focus atten-
tion on the most important learning tasks (for an overview, see
Refs. 3–5). Learning with worked examples can be more effec-
tive than to conventional problem solving because when learn-ers are presented with a new topic, they often concentrate
cognitive resources on the technical aspects of solving the prob-
lem. In that case, less resources are available for the construc-tion of abstract schemata, which lead to transfer and can help to
solve related problems (cf. Ref. 6). The effectiveness of such a
worked example effect is well examined and proven in well-structured areas of mathematics and physics,
3,7–12a n da l s oi n
text comprehension,13and essay writing.14
However, worked examples are not always superior or
more efﬁcient in learning in comparison to classical problemsolving.15They need to be structured and designed in a way
that extraneous load is decreased and germane load is
increased such that learners proﬁt from them. For example,self-explanations by students turn out to be important.16Therequest for self-explanations (and also ﬁnding or ﬁxing
errors17,18) in our approach is an important difference from
the simple presentation of solved problems in lectures.
The added value of worked examples has also been dem-
onstrated for double integrals in calculus at university
level,19i.e., in a topic which is needed regularly in theoreti-
cal physics. Therefore, worked examples are a promisingtool for improving teaching in upper-division theoreticalphysics. They can be used as further methodical variation (in
addition to, e.g., peer instruction and small group tutorials)
for the transformation of upper-division physics courses
20–23
or to help students to overcome typical difﬁculties withmathematical tools.24–26
In addition to example-problem pairs (the simplest and most
often recommended scheme of worked examples1,11), other
approaches with additional intermediate tasks can be beneﬁ-
cial27such as including self-explanation prompts and succes-
sively removing more and more worked-out tasks in solutions.It is the purpose of this work to show that a four-step approachbased on worked examples can indeed be introduced in theoret-
ical physics. In Sec. II, we present the concept and explain its
introduction in exercise courses. Short notes on our experiencesfrom several courses are given in Sec. III, and conclusions are
drawn in Sec. IV. More details based on the relevant effects
from the cognitive load theory (cf. Refs. 1,3,11,16,17,a n d
27–36 ) relevant for the concept and our conclusions for worked
examples in theoretical physics can be found in supplementarymaterial 1.
37A detailed example of the four-step approach is
given in supplementary material 2.37
II. CONCEPT OF A FOUR-STEP APPROACH
APPLIED IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
The goal of the four-step approach is to strengthen the
worked example effect. It ensures that extended self-explanations are taken seriously by all students due to two

additional steps embedded between completely elaborated
worked examples and problem tasks without solutions.While the individual steps are known and tested, we proposean arrangement ideally suited for courses that assign problem
sets. A lecturer can implement the method with very little
additional preparation time, because it can be based on exist-ing textbook problems. It offers the students a broader vari-ety of examples without investing more time and theopportunity to acquire a deeper understanding of the under-lying principles used in the exercises. The concept is struc-
tured as follows.
The ﬁrst step in our scheme is a maximally elaborated
worked example with a detailed step-by-step solution. The
problem chosen for this step should be paradigmatic for thistype of physics task. To reduce extraneous load generated bythe necessary collection of information (split attentioneffect
3), the important aspects are highlighted in the problem
description, and the structure of the solution is explicitly
shown. Ideally, the calculation path and the explanation of
the different solution tasks are close together on the work-sheet. The students’ mathematical capabilities should deter-mine the amount of mathematical detail that is included.
After this preparation, we foster self-explanations in step
two by demanding written explanations from the students fora solution that is presented without explanations. This exam-ple can be simpler than the ﬁrst one to help students get
started. Since most learners are passive or superﬁcial self-
explainers,
16we recommend either an obligatory written
explanation for assignments that are submitted for grading orpeer discussions for assignments that are completed intutorials.
In step three, students are asked not only to explain the
work but also to identify and correct errors that are purpose-
fully included in the solution. This task should be more chal-
lenging than step 2; therefore, the chosen example should bemore difﬁcult again. We recommend 2–4 errors, such thatthe students continue to search after ﬁnding the ﬁrst error butthe wrong solution does not become too confusing. Thefocus should be on errors in the translation of the physicsproblem into its mathematical description. One calculation
error should be included for a quick boost of accomplish-
ment [see supplementary material 2 (Ref. 37) Sec. II B].
Step four consists of a problem without any solution, and
it is the student’s task to develop and provide a full solution,which is the typical last step of worked examples.
A detailed elaborate example for Lagrangian mechanics
can be found in supplementary material 2,
37which ﬁts in a
90-min exercise class or can be completed by students athome. All examples are typical textbook problems38,39(an
English version of the ﬁrst book is also available40) and can
be adopted easily. In addition, we provide a discussion aboutthe lessons we have learned using worked examples, how
they can be embedded in instruction, and their applicability
in other topics.
III. EXPERIENCES WITH THE FOUR-STEP
APPROACH
We used this or a similar structure of worked examples in
a set of different courses from mathematics refresher coursesto seminars accompanying classical mechanics, electrody-
namics, quantum theory, and thermodynamics/statistics lec-
tures. In all these setups, we observed strong interest of thestudents and their active participation. In each of our applica-
tions, the majority of the students was able to solve the last
problem correctly. Thus, we found that worked examplescan be productive for several teaching situations in
theoretical physics. The example presented in supplementary
material 2
37(on Lagrangian mechanics) was tested in a
90 min online seminar with a very satisfying performance of
the students. Some students were able to complete the whole
task within the seminar; a short homework (completing thelast example) remained for the others.
While our four-step approach is, in principle, very simple,
we want to emphasize the challenges. A great challenge is
ﬁnding of the correct level of difﬁculty for the learners.Novices with less prior knowledge need more explanations,
and error ﬁnding can overstrain them. However, redundant
information can reduce the learning effects for students withadequate prior knowledge. Those two sides on the scale
should be considered for every lecture and course.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Due to our positive experiences, we recommend the appli-
cation of worked examples in theoretical physics and invite
other lecturers to adopt and enhance the approach of workedexamples presented here in theoretical physics.
A nice side effect of worked examples with additional
tasks (written self-explanations and error ﬁnding) is that they
can also be used to assess the students’ performances.Suggestions on how this can be implemented can be found in
supplementary material 2.
Our presented scheme can be applied to every topic for
which a universal solution structure to problems exists andworked examples are usable in general. Very typical exam-
ples are Lagrangian mechanics of the second kind and solu-
tions to the time-independent Schr €odinger equation (see
Table I).
A systematic evaluation of the long-term performance of
the students after attending the worked-examples problem
courses has to be relegated to future research. This was not a

ity as compared to bare problem solving is desirable.Nevertheless, previous research indicates a beneﬁt of workedexamples in university environments.
