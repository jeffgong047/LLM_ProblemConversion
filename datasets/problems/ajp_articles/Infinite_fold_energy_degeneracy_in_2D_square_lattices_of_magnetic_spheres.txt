Infinite-fold energy degeneracy in 2D square lattices of magnetic

We show that a two-dimensional square lattice of magnets can be studied by placing small
cylindrical neodymium magnets inside plastic spherical shells and ﬂoating them on water, leavingtheir magnetic moments free to re-orient within the plane. Experimentally, anti-correlated dipole
orientations between nearest neighbors appear to be favored energetically. This motivates the
construction of a simpliﬁed single-variable energy function for a 2D square lattice of magneticdipoles. For odd numbers of spheres, this ansatz yields a continuum of dipole conﬁgurations with
the same energies, matching the observed behavior that the orientation of the dipoles in these
lattices can be rotated freely. The behavior of square lattices with even numbers of spheres isstrikingly different, showing strongly preferred orientations. While the energy calculated in this
simpliﬁed model is larger than that of the actual ground state for ﬁnite size clusters, its asymptotic
value in the limit where the number of spheres goes to inﬁnity is in good agreement with theliterature value. Additionally, rectangular arrangements of magnetic spheres with and without a
defect are analyzed within the class of the single variable energy function. Simple experimental
demonstrations qualitatively reproduce several interesting results obtained from all these analyses.

I. INTRODUCTION
Observing a pattern emerging from a many-body system
is exciting for both students and professional researchers.
Understanding this pattern requires making connections
between the large-scale behavior and the interactions among
system elements. A simple and appealing system in which
these effects can be observed and understood is an array of
permanent magnets. Permanent magnets—while themselves
having properties that are due to these many-body effects—
can also be used to study many-body effects due to the long-
range interaction between magnetic dipoles. Spherical neo-
dymium magnets are commercially available and have been
used without any modiﬁcation for the study of energetically
favorable magnetic assemblages,1–4self-assembly dynam-
ics,5and mechanical properties of assemblages.6,7These
magnets have also been incorporated into larger structures
including 3D polymeric spheres8and cork disks9in order to
study self-assembly.
In this work, we use a new type of magnetic object that
allows us to focus on the dipole interactions between mag-
nets in a two-dimensional cluster. It is a plastic spherical
shell with a small cylindrical or spherical neodymium mag-
net at its center. These shells are needed, because the mag-
netic force between bare neodymium magnets is quite
strong. When the bare magnets aggregate into a chain, it is
very difﬁcult to twist one of the magnets and see its effect on
the orientation of the others, since the chain tends to deform
in response to the large twisting force. However, such an
observation is crucial to understand the connection between
global properties of a magnetic system and the features of
local interactions among its constituent dipoles. Our compos-
ite magnetic object allows these studies, because the plastic
shell keeps the magnets separated, decreasing the magnetic
force. Thus, our magnetic spheres have rotational freedom
even when they are formed into a spatially tight aggregate.
Moreover, the spheres ﬂoat in water since their volumes aremostly made up of the air. Simply by tossing these magnetic
spheres into a water tank, one can create a 2D magnetic layer
at the air–water interface. Finally, even if it is an emptysphere with a tiny cylindrical magnet at the center, we can
regard it not only as a point-like magnetic dipole approxi-
mately but also as a uniformly magnetized spherical object
effectively.10In the following, we describe our ﬁndings from
straightforward experiments using these novel objects as
well as numerical studies to model their behavior.
II. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION
The magnetic sphere used in this work is a plastic spheri-
cal shell of diameter D¼30 mm with a magnet mounted at
its center. To make it, we employ commercially available
transparent plastic spherical cases (Schiller, Acryl-Kugel:
empty acrylic spheres used in decorations). Each of them can
be disassembled into two hemispherical shells conjugated toeach other. (Unnecessary protrusions were trimmed off for
our purpose.) First, we prepare a disk by cutting a sheet of an
acryl ﬁlm to be set into a circular groove engraved inside
one of the two hemispherical shells near its rim. A cylindri-
cal neodymium magnet (Ultra ND magnet NO-01, Dasan,
diameter: 5 mm, height: 5 mm) is glued to the center of the
disk (see Fig. 1(a), top panel). Inner surfaces of the transpar-
ent hemispherical shells are colored using marker pens in
either white or black to indicate magnetic polarity (see Fig.
1(a), top panel). Finally, the disk with the magnet attached is
set into the groove of a hemispherical shell before the shell
is capped by its partner for completion. A complete magnetic
sphere is shown in Fig. 1(a). We deliberately skipped the col-
oring step for the sample appearing in the photographs, soone can see the actual position of the magnetic core (a ruler
and lines appear in the bottom right panel of Fig. 1(a) for
guidance). A spherical neodymium magnet (diameter: 5 mm,
Daon Magnet) is also used as the magnetic core of our
spheres for a control experiment. In this case, a simple way

of determining magnet polarity is to align several magnets in
a chain parallel to the surface normal of a disk while the
adhesive hardens (see the bottom left panel of Fig. 1(a)). All
magnets in the chain are removed except the one at the bot-
tom before insertion of the disk into a plastic spherical shell.
An ordinary rectangular plastic box is used as a water tank.Four plastic rulers are used to make a rectangular or square-shaped boundary to conﬁne the magnetic spheres ﬂoating at
the air–water interface. A plastic pin is attached to a mag-
netic sphere by using a double-sided tape. This pin works asa knob to twist the sphere, which plays a role of the pilotingparticle to induce local disturbances.
The magnetic dipolar spheres form a straight chain with
north-to-south attraction when they are conﬁned within a
one-dimensional (1D) channel as expected
11(see Fig. 1(b)
and supplementary movie 112). This linear dipole alignment
collapses once one of the spheres in the chain is forcibly
twisted about an axis perpendicular to the chain axis. Whena sphere is twisted, neighboring spheres exhibit anti-correlated dipole orientations. This observation is illustrated
in Fig. 1(c)(see also supplementary movie 2
12). In order to
understand an overall energy landscape at the most rudimen-tal level of the magnetic interaction, we categorize the dipole
coupling in a two-body chain into three types: “correlated
orientation” where the two dipoles have the same orientationangle /with respect to the chain axis; “anti-correlated ori-
entation” where the two dipoles exhibit mirror symmetry
with respect to the chain axis oriented at angles 6/; and
“uncorrelated orientation” where one dipole orientation isﬁxed along the chain axis with /¼0 and the other is dis-
placed by an angle /(see Fig. 2(a)). The magnetic dipole-

ticles such that they have the same size (diameter: D)a n dt h e
same magnetic strength (magnitude of the dipole moment: m),
the dipole-dipole interaction energy for the anti-correlated type
of coupling is /C0a1þcos2//C0/C1

respectively, where astands for l0m2=4pD3. Figure 2(b)
shows the dimensionless energy per particle, u¼Uij=2a,a sa

Among these three types, the anti-correlated one is mostfavored energetically over the entire range of /ð/C0180

/C20//C20180/C14Þ. This property can be identiﬁed in Figs. 2(c)and
2(d), which are generated by treating particles’ dipole
moments independently without any constraint. In the energycalculations for this non-constraint coupling regime, the twodipoles are allowed to orient independently at the angles /

and/2in the plane. (An assembly of dipole moments must
always be coplanar with a ﬂat substrate to produce the lowest
energy, see Ref. 2.)
As shown in Figs. 2(c) and2(d), the energy landscape
shows a valley for the anti-correlated orientation thatincludes two small maxima at /¼690

vention, the positive/negative sign indicates the angle is inthe clockwise/counterclockwise direction, respectively),while the barriers to rotation are much higher for other orien-tations. A comprehensive study of dipole-dipole coupling

The acryl ﬁlms are used to orient the plastic pin.

Ref.13.
Before moving on to our main discussions of 2D square
lattices, we apply this single variable ( /) approach to a
closely packed 1D chain of Nidentical particles with anti-
correlated orientations between neighboring pairs. The totalinteraction energy of this chain can be deﬁned as a functionof a single variable /, the magnitude of the angle between
the chain axis and the dipole moments. The dimensionlessenergy per particle of this chain is obtained by adding allpossible dipole-dipole interaction energies (Eq. (1)) among
pairs involved in the N-particle chain and dividing the sum
byaN. The result is

(2)A detailed derivation of this formula can be found in the sup-
plementary material. 12This energy function has minima at
/¼0/C14and6180/C14as expected. There is an energy barrier
between the two minima, and the barrier height is given by
the terms within the curly brackets in Eq. (2)divided by N
(see supplementary Fig. 112). Both the minimum energy and
the barrier height converge to ﬁxed values in the limit that
the number of particles goes to inﬁnity, as the energy func-
tion in this limit is given by

Here, fis the Riemann zeta function, and f3ðÞ, known as

energy is /C02f3ðÞ, in agreement with previous works,1,14and
the barrier height is 1 :25f3ðÞ. The barrier to ﬂipping is
affected by long-range interactions, so it increases with the
number of particles and reaches 95% of its limiting value for
a chain of 31 particles.
Our main work was a systematic study of 2D square latti-
ces composed of identical dipolar particles based on the
single-variable energy function approach. For a closely
packed 2 /C22 square lattice, one has to consider six different
dipole pairs. Since we are compelling the dipole coupling

between nearest neighbors to be anti-correlated in this
approach, the total dipole-dipole interaction energy of thesystem is given by a function of /, the angle between a refer-
ence axis and the dipole moment of a reference particle asbefore. We conventionally choose a vertical line and the par-ticle at the bottom-left corner of the lattice as the references(see the supplementary material
12). A direct calculation
results in the dimensionless energy per particle,

whose minimum values occur at /¼/C045/C14and 135/C14. In gen-
eral, these two angles represent two different handednessstates. (Head-to-tail connections of the four dipoles make aclosed loop either in a clockwise direction or in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to the surface normal.)These two energy minima are separated by a barrier with itsheight of 3 =4ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
. These energy minima and the separation
barrier are clearly seen in our experiment when we releasethe spheres from an altered dipole conﬁguration (see Fig.3(a)and supplementary movie 3
12).
The origin of this energy barrier can be found from the
interactions between diagonal pairs. At the higher energy
conﬁgurations ( /¼45/C14or 225/C14), all the dipole pairs alongfour sides of a 2 /C22 square lattice are in energetically favor-
able coupling conﬁgurations, but the two diagonal pairs haveoppositely oriented dipoles, raising the system energy.
For a closely packed 3 /C23 square lattice (see Fig. 3(b)),
the total number of different dipole-dipole interaction pairsincreases to 36. In general, this number is given byN
2N2/C01 ðÞ =2 for an N/C2Nsquare lattice. The dimension-
less energy per particle of the 3 /C23 square lattice can be
obtained by a direct calculation (see the supplementary mate-rial12). Surprisingly, the energy is independent of /,

Unlike the 2 /C22 square lattice, while all the dipole interac-
tions still depend on /, the dependence cancels when all the
interaction energies are summed.
It must be emphasized here that this single-valued energy
continuum is not necessarily the global ground state. We areonly considering a speciﬁc energy function of a singleparameter that restricts all the dipoles to make the sameangle to the speciﬁed axis. Determining the true globalground state of a many-dipole system would be challenging.It is obvious that there exist dipole conﬁgurations more sta-ble than the ground states belonging to the class of the

single-variable energy function. When a 3 /C23 square lattice
of dipoles is formed by accumulating a column at a time,
naturally selected dipole conﬁgurations deviate from those
of the single variable energy mode (see Fig. 3(c)and supple-
mentary movie 412). A dipole conﬁguration in a 4 /C24 square
lattice, which is naturally selected while it is assembled by
accumulating a column at a time, also deviates from the
ground state of the single-variable energy mode (see Fig.3(d) and supplementary movie 512). However, this single-
variable model is successful in describing the quasi-stable
orientations of dipoles that we observe experimentally.
Given that the number of terms in the calculation rises
quickly with the lattice size N, for lattices with N>3w e
solve Eq. (1)numerically for the dimensionless energy per
particle. (We also solve numerically for N¼2;3 as a check
on our calculations.) The results of these calculations areorganized in Fig. 4. We see that the behavior is very different
forN¼even and N¼odd when Nis small, with odd lattices
displaying angle-independent energies. Even lattices haveminima at /¼/C045
/C14and 135/C14, but the barrier between these
minima decreases as Nincreases, so the discrepancy between
even and odd lattices decreases with increasing N. The bar-
rier height is plotted as a function of Nin Fig. 4(d). Its log-
log plot shows a slope of about /C01:93, which approaches /C02as we increase the upper bound of N. This result is an indica-
tion that the energy barrier becomes independent of the num-ber of particles as Nincreases, so the energy per particle is
proportional to N/C02(see the following discussion and the
supplementary material12).
Figure 4(c)shows a nearly linear dependence of the mini-
mum energy plotted as a function of N/C01, converging
towards asymptotic values of /C02:544 for even lattices and
/C02:568 for odd lattices as N!1 . While the difference
between these two values could be a consequence of the
small Nenergy anomaly for even lattices,15these numbers
are very close to the previously reported value.4,15
All these results are based on Eq. (1), the dipole-dipole
interaction. However, because neodymium magnets are notpoint-like objects, one should take into account higher order
multi-polar interactions as well. Fortunately, for the large
ratio of the diameter (3 cm) of our plastic shell to the diame-ter/height (5 mm) of our cylindrical magnet, the magneticﬁeld produced by a magnet in our 2D layer differs by only
1% from the dipole ﬁeld.
16Nonetheless, we decided to test
spheres with spherical neodymium magnets at the center. Itis well known that a uniformly magnetized sphere producesa dipole ﬁeld outside
17and, given the large separation
between magnetic cores in our system, the magnetization of

one magnet is essentially unchanged by the magnetic ﬁeld of
its neighbors.18Thus, the interactions between spherical
magnetic cores are dipolar if we can ignore manufacturing
defects. We clearly observe that spheres whose core is a
spherical neodymium magnet (5 mm diameter) behave quali-tatively the same as those of a cylindrical core (see supple-mentary movies 7 and 8
12). No quantitative analysis is made
in the present study, so additional experiments would be
appropriate.18It is also noteworthy that such a continuum of
energy equilibria in systems driven by the dipolar interactionhas long been discussed.19–23In particular, small magnets
ﬁxed onto a plane with rotational freedom within that plane
have formed a square lattice, constituting an experimental
setup for demonstrations of favored dipole conﬁgurationsemerging in 2D lattices,21a continuum of the degenerate
ground states has been identiﬁed in a cubic lattice of eightmagnetic dipoles,22and intriguing collective dynamic modes
emerge in a many-dipole system, based on the energy mode
discussed in the present study.23
Given the importance of a continuum of energy degener-
acy even if it is not the true global ground state, we havetried to ﬁnd a simple explanation of this peculiar symmetry.Section 5 of the supplementary material shows that pairs of
spins that are both along the same horizontal or vertical line
do not contribute to the energy barrier.
12Only pairs of spins
that are on diagonals have interactions that contribute to theenergy barrier to rotation. For that reason, we start by consid-
ering rectangular bases consisting of four particles and
examine the interactions along their diagonals. We denoteeach rectangular basis by specifying arbitrary positive inte-gers mandn, so that the four particles are at the corners of a
rectangle of dimensions mD/C2nD, where Dis the particle
diameter. For a D/C2Dsquare basis ( m¼n¼1), the dimen-
sionless energy is given by u
D/C2D¼aþbsin 2/ðÞ (this is the
same result as for the 2 /C22 square lattice, see Eq. (4)), where
aandbð>0Þare constants, and /is the same variable we
have deﬁned so far. This basis has an energy difference
Du¼2b¼uD/C2D/¼45/C14ðÞ /C0uD/C2D/¼135/C14ðÞ between the
maximum energy state and the minimum energy state, andthis energy difference is the origin of the barrier to rotationappearing in the 2 /C22 square lattice. For the 3 /C23 square
lattice, there exist total four such D/C2Dbasis squares. Each
of them behaves in a similar manner. However, each basis
counterbalances the horizontal or vertical neighbor, in thesense that if one basis produces an energy increasing withthe angle /, then its partner basis produces an energy
decreasing with /, and vice versa. Importantly, these four
basis squares yield a /-independent energy in total. In
addition to these D/C2Dbasis squares, there also exist two
D/C22Dbasis rectangles and two 2 D/C2Dbasis rectangles
whose energy in total becomes /-independent as well.
Finally, there is also a 2 D/C22Dbasis square, and this
square’s orientation energy is independent of u. This last
observation is actually an example of a general rule: the ori-entation energy is independent of ufor every nD/C2nDbasis
square, where nis an even number, and therefore, every
square basis belonging to this category can be ignored
completely during the analysis for /-dependency of the sys-
tem energy. To sum up, the total energy of the 3 /C23 square
lattice is barrier free, as observed experimentally. Section 6of the supplementary material illustrates more in detail the
process of energy neutralization with respect to the angle /
for the case of the 3 /C23 square lattice.Returning to the energy difference Duð¼u/¼45

This formula obtained from the rectangular basis approach
yields a graph that is in perfect agreement with the earlierresult shown in Fig. 4(d) (compare it with supplementary

12).
It is likely that similar counter-balancing pairings exist for
all bases with Du6¼0 within the odd square lattices. For any
N/C2Narray where Nis odd, there exists an even number of
ways that it can be divided into any set of basis rectangleswith mandnboth odd, and these basis rectangles always
counterbalance. For the basis rectangles in each type of thedimension to be fully paired, the number of them must beeven, and this least requirement can be proven by the follow-ing analysis. An N/C2Narray with an odd number Nis basi-
cally a pD/C2pDrectangle with an “even” number p. There
are total 4 ð¼2/C22Þdifferent ðp/C01ÞD/C2ðp/C01ÞDrectan-

Similarly, there are total 8 ð¼2/C24Þdifferent ðp/C01ÞD

12ð¼2/C26Þdifferent ðp/C01ÞD/C2ðp/C05ÞDrectangles, …,
2p/C02ðÞ different ðp/C01ÞD/C23Drectangles, and, ﬁnally, 2 p
different ðp/C01ÞD/C2Drectangles, and so on. Completeness
in pairing of the rectangular bases guarantees the neutralequilibrium of the overall system energy, giving rise to thebarrier-free rotation observed in odd lattices. However,the similar analysis leads to the conclusion that, for any N
¼even array, there is always one non-balanced basis rectan-
gle of each size, supporting the validity of Eq. (7). Namely,
the collective energy barrier in Eq. (7)is the accumulation of
barrier heights stemming from these sorts of residual bases.The rectangular basis approach is described in more detail inthe supplementary material.
12The summation factor in Eq.
(7)exhibits a rapid increase with Nup to around 30 or so,
and such behavior subsides afterwards displaying a plateauwith a slope close to zero (supplementary Figs. 2(c) and2(d)
12). Therefore, in this size-insensitive regime, the energy
barrier per particle is solely governed by the number of sys-tem constituents ( N
2) located in the denominator of Eq. (7)
(supplementary Fig. 2(b)12).
Up to this point, we have only discussed square arrays of
dipoles. However, many different types of arrangements can

be considered based on the single-variable energy function
approach. As an example, we analyze the dimensionlessenergy per particle of M/C2Nrectangular arrays, where M
andNare the number of columns and rows, respectively, by
performing numerical calculations (see supplementary mate-rial
12). Some representative plots of the energy as a function
of the typical variable /are in Figs. 5(a) and5(b). Figure

with nine different values of Nrunning from 2 to 10.
Similarly, Fig. 5(b) displays curves corresponding to 3 /C2N
arrays with eight different values of Nrunning from 3 to 10.
(Similar plots for larger arrays can be found in supplemen-tary Fig. S3.12) For any array in which either MorNis odd,
the ground state (within the class of our single variableenergy function) appears with anti-parallel dipole chainsaligned along a long side of the rectangular array, irrespec-
tive of its size. We saw earlier that there is no such a pre-
ferred direction of dipole chain orientations in the case of“odd/C2odd” square arrays. In contrast, any array of even
numbers assigned for both MandN, the ground state appearswith dipole orientations in a zigzag pattern. For instance, the
2/C24 array has the minimum energy at /between zero and
/C045
/C14, the characteristic angle for the minimum energy of
“even /C2even” square arrays. Note that we always choose
the particle at the bottom left corner of an array as our refer-ence to deﬁne the variable /. This deviation angle producing
the zigzag pattern gets smaller and smaller as the system size(i.e., N) increases, forming a straight dipole chain along a
long side of the array.
Figure 5(c)shows /
min, the reference particle’s dipole ori-
entation angle responsible for the minimum energy, formany different M/C2Narrays where both indices are even
numbers. Apparently, even /C2even square arrays minimize
their energy with the characteristic angle /¼/C045

spective of their size. As the aspect ratio ( N=M) of array
shape increases/decreases from 1, /mingets closer to zero (or

side of the arrays (Fig. 5(c)is produced within a domain of
/:/C090/C14/C20//C200). It is an interesting observation that only
the even /C2even type of arrays can have the ground state

with a zigzag pattern of dipole orientations. One superﬁcial
distinction could be found from the topological characteristic
of even /C2even arrays capable of embracing all emerging
dipole chains in closed forms. Other types of arrays cannever avoid creating open ends of dipole moments at the
edges.
An additional feature can be recognized in the overall
minimum energy landscape as shown in Fig. 5(d). A weak
kink emerges along the diagonal line of M¼N, the position
where the inﬁnite-fold energy degeneracy occurs, and it ﬂat-
tens as the array size increases. Although our analysis islocal belonging to a speciﬁc class of energy modes, this kind
of mapping still could be relevant to analysis of magnetic
interactions between small 2D clusters of dipoles. It mayprovide some ideas in understanding the dynamics of mag-netic layer growth.
Finally, we examine how an extra magnet added to the
regular pattern can alter the dipolar energy landscape asobserved in columnar bundles of dipolar chains.
24Although
dipoles in our 2D layer have planar orientations, it would be
an interesting task to investigate how an extra particle can
affect the energy of regularly organized dipole layers. Weattach an extra magnetic sphere to rectangular arrays to
make them irregular. Two different types of tip (magnetic
sphere) are considered. A regular tip is positioned at the topof the far right column of arrays, while a diagonal tip is posi-
tioned at the top right corner of arrays, making a clockwise
tilt of 45
/C14angle with a vertical line. Dipolar coupling of
the tip with its nearest neighbor is always anti-correlated-
orientation-wise in our calculations. The tip position and its
dipole orientation angle are precisely described in the sup-plementary material.12Figure 6(a) shows the dimensionless
energy per particle for 2 /C22 square arrays of magnetic
spheres with and without an extra tip. The addition of a tip,regardless of its type, raises the minimum energy per parti-cle, while the barrier heights decrease. A regular tip pushes
the angle /
mincloser to zero (i.e., dipoles preferentially align
along the direction elongated by the tip). A diagonal tip doesnot show such shift of /
min. It minimizes the barrier height
instead, working as a sort of an energy balancing agent.
Figure 6(b) shows the dimensionless energy per particle for
3/C23 square arrays of magnetic spheres with and without an
extra tip. Either a regular or a diagonal tip breaks the contin-
uum of energy degeneracy, lowering the minimum energybelow that of an intact 3 /C23 array. The lowest minimum
energy occurs with a diagonal tip at /¼45
/C14. Here, the tip
works as an agent providing a system in neutral equilibriumwith an extra site for dipolar coupling which breaks the sym-
metry of the well balanced collective energy mode. Similar
plots for larger systems are in supplementary Fig. 4.12
We make a qualitative experimental demonstration (see
supplementary movie 912) for these results of numerical cal-
culations. Indeed, an extra dipolar sphere attached to a typi-
cal 3/C23 lattice of dipolar spheres formed at the air/water
interface leads to a stable dipole conﬁguration of /¼45/C14
when the extra sphere is located at the corner of the lattice
working as a diagonal tip. Upon twisting the dipole conﬁgu-ration to make /closer to zero, the tip sphere turns around
switching its type from diagonal to regular, in good agree-
ment with the energy-level crossing realized in Fig. 6(b).
Similar behavior occurs when the dipole conﬁgurationchanges from /¼45
/C14toward þ90/C14, which is essentially the
same situation as the previous one.III. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
Simple and intuitive experiments showed that anti-
correlated dipole orientation coupling between neighboringdipoles is energetically favorable. This observation inspiredthe construction of a model energy function responsible for a2DN/C2Nsquare lattice of magnetic dipoles. The model
energy function has only one variable, allowing a completesurvey of the system energy to be performed. Numerical cal-culations show a continuum of dipole conﬁgurations repre-senting the same energy as that of anti-parallel dipole chainsknown as the ground state of a square lattice. This energy
value (per particle) converges toward roughly /C02:56 (dimen-
sionless) in the thermodynamic limit ( N!1 ), in good
agreement with the value previously reported.

An energy anomaly is observed for even lattices at the
small Nregion. Unlike odd lattices, they display twofold
degenerate energy states different from the anti-parallelchain conﬁguration. The two states have an energy valuelower than that of the anti-parallel chain, and they are

separated by an energy barrier that decreases as the system
size increases. Our approach relying on rectangular basespoints out that failure in searching for counter-bases to keepthe total interaction energy steady is unavoidable in the evenlattices. Such failure produces a residual rectangular basisthat does not have any counterpart, and it occurs at eachlevel of the basis dimension. Each residual basis yields anenergy difference between the two energy extrema of a giveneven lattice. The sum of all these energy differences deﬁnesthe collective energy barrier for the even lattice, and itsheight is an exact match of the numerical result obtained bythe exact formula for the dipole-dipole interaction. As N
grows, the energy barrier vanishes eventually, negating thedistinction between even lattices and odd lattices.
Several features of M/C2Nrectangular arrangements of
dipoles have been identiﬁed by numerical calculations per-
formed within the class of the single variable energy func-
tion. The ground states occur with anti-parallel dipole chainsaligned along a long side of the rectangular arrays, exceptfor the case of even /C2even rectangles whose ground states
emerge with zigzag patterns of dipole orientations. Thesezigzag dipole chains are straightened up as the aspect ratioof the arrays increases. Participation of an extra dipole as adefect alters the energy landscape of 2D rectangular arrays.An extra dipole attached to a corner of a rectangular arrange-ment of dipoles works as an agent either lowering or raisingthe minimum energy (per particle) depending on the type ofthe base array. It also controls the dipole conﬁguration of theground state. A simple experimental demonstration reprodu-ces some of the numerical results qualitatively well.
Our experimental setup is simple, and our mathematical
approach is not overly challenging. Therefore, our modelsystem could be utilized in physics classrooms to promotedemonstration-based learning about the elementary forcebetween magnets. Also, with their self-assembly capabilityon the macroscopic scale, the magnetic spheres used in thiswork may help identify characteristics of a true globalground state of a system driven by the dipole-dipole interac-tion, which is a current topic of research in condensed matterphysics.
20,21,25The size of plastic spherical shells could be
customized, different shapes and size of magnetic cores canbe chosen, and the buoyancy force exerted on the spherescan be adjusted. Such profound ﬂexibility enables controlover characteristics and strengths of the magnetic interac-tions, system’s dimension, lattice type, defects, and so on.All these are relevant not only to fundamental research butalso as a model system to study dynamics of dipolar colloidalaggregation under the inﬂuence of an external drivingsource, which has a direct connection to applications.

Small size actuators designed to enable internal control of
the magnetic core’s orientation could be utilized as a tool-kitfor studying the dynamics of active particles interacting in aﬂuidic environment. Furthermore, it may be equipped withexternal sources of either local or global time-varying mag-netic ﬁelds. The ratio of the Zeeman energy ( mB) to the max-

ﬁelds, one may use an arbitrarily designed array of neodym-ium magnets in rotation in a controlled manner. Thus, oursystem could be suitable for realization of emerging phe-nomena in 2D magnetic systems, for instance, recently dis-covered collective dynamic modes emerging in a 2D dipolarlayer.
23Interfacial random agitation or wave-like excitation
can be also considered as an additional means for placing themagnetic lattice in non-trivial conditions. Under the premiseof exquisite force/ﬁeld measurements and more elaboratecalculations fully considering magnet geometry permitted,systematic quantitative studies of long-range interactioneffects in a system of many dipoles will be feasible.
