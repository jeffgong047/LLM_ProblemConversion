The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV/C0) center in diamond is a model quantum system for
university teaching labs due to its room-temperature compatibility and cost-effective operation. Based on
the low-cost experimental setup that we have developed and described for the coherent control of the
electronic spin [Sewani et al. , Am. J. Phys. 88, 1156–1169 (2020)], we introduce and explain here a
number of more advanced experiments that probe the electron–nuclear interaction between the NV/C0
electronic and the14Na n d13C nuclear spins. Optically detected magnetic resonance, Rabi oscillations,
Ramsey fringe experiments, and Hahn echo sequences are implemented to demonstrate how the nuclearspins interact with the electron spins. Most experiments only require 15 min of measurement time and,
therefore, can be completed within one teaching lab.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent progress in the ﬁeld of quantum technolo-
gies—quantum computing, quantum communications, and
quantum sensors—has led to considerable commercial inter-
est from entities like the semiconductor industry, softwarecompanies, and consulting ﬁrms. Quantum technologies arepredicted to constitute a /C24$10 billion market within the next
decade,
2and the high demand for quantum-specialists, as
reﬂected by the high number of current job advertisements,3
corroborates this prediction. Universities need to cater to thisneed and provide their graduates with a thorough under-standing of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics,including experimental experience in how to perform quan-tum measurements and interpret results. However, theseskills are difﬁcult to convey in a university teaching lab, due
to the sensitivity of quantum systems to environmental dis-
turbances and the high cost of specialized measurementequipment.
As discussed amply in literature, the nitrogen vacancy
(NV
/C0) center in diamond possesses an electronic spin that
can be initialized and read out optically. It displays micro-second coherence times at room temperature in ambient con-ditions.
4This makes the NV/C0center a model system for
high-school or university teaching labs to perform magne-
tometry5–7and coherent spin control experiments.1,7–10
Based on the same low-cost experimental setup that we have
developed in Ref. 1, in combination with an off-the-shelf,
commercially available, high-quality chemical vapor deposi-tion (CVD) diamond sample from Element Six, we expand

the portfolio of experiments to include the characterization
of electron–nuclear spin coupling dynamics.
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we will give
an overview of the learning outcomes that can be conveyed
with the experiments in this paper. Section IIIwill then intro-
duce the NV/C0Hamiltonian with a focus on the terms
describing the nuclear spin of the14N nucleus and its interac-
tion with the electronic spin, and Sec. IVwill introduce the
Rabi formula that describes the time evolution of a spin dur-
ing spin resonance. In Sec. V, we will detail the changes
made to the equipment with regard to Ref. 1, and in Sec. VI,
we will present different experiments with a special empha-
sis on how the coupling of the electron spin to the14N
nucleus manifests in the optically detected magnetic reso-nance (ODMR) spectrum (Subsection VI B ), Rabi oscilla-
tions (Subsection VI C ), and Ramsey fringes (Subsection
VI D ). Finally, we show how the coupling to the bath of13C
nuclei manifests in the Hahn echo decay (Subsection VI E).
II. LEARNING OUTCOMES
The experiments described below are a set of advanced
experiments that build upon the basic ones described in
Ref. 1. The basic experiments taught students fundamental
concepts such as the NV/C0center structure, the spin initializa-
tion and readout procedure, the features of the ODMR spec-
trum, the development of pulse sequences, the rotating frame,
magnetic resonance, two-axes control, the Bloch sphere, and
dynamical decoupling. We will assume knowledge of theseconcepts for this manuscript and build upon them in order for
students to
•develop a detailed understanding of the system’s
Hamiltonian and the ability to map the observed experi-
mental features to its properties.
•comprehend the effect of experimental non-idealities like
power-broadening and spectral detuning.
•observe the interaction between the NV/C0electronic spin and
the14N nuclear spin, mediated by the hyperﬁne interaction.
•experience how the electron–nuclear interaction manifests
in both the frequency domain and the time domain, andhow those are linked by the Fourier transform.
The concepts demonstrated with these experiments will
provide students with an advanced understanding of quantumexperiments and a detailed knowledge of electron–nuclear
spin interactions. They are applicable to the state-of-the-art
research on NV
/C0centers in diamond,11–13other types of
color centers in diamond14,15and silicon carbide,16donor
spins in silicon,17–19and even gate-deﬁned quantum dots.20
III. THE NV2CENTER IN DIAMOND
The NV/C0center in diamond consists of a substitutional nitro-
gen atom adjacent to a vacant lattice site and exists along fourdifferent crystallographic orientations ( ½111/C138;[1
11];[/C2211/C221], and
[111]).1,4,5These four orientations are, in principle, equivalent
but lead to different alignments of the NV/C0center axes with
respect to an externally applied static or oscillating magnetic
ﬁeld. The natural abundance of14N is 99.6%, and its nuclear
spin number is I¼1, which means that the electron spin in
almost all NV/C0centers is coupled to a nuclear spin. We, there-
fore, need to extend the ground state Ham iltonian of the NV/C0
center to account for the coupled14N nuclear spin. The static
Hamiltonian H0contains three main terms:H0¼H SþH IþH SI; (1)
where HSis the electron spin Hamiltonian, HIis the nuclear
spin Hamiltonian, and HSIdescribes the interaction of the
electron spin with the nuclear spin.
The electron spin Hamiltonian
HS¼DS2
zþceB0/C1S (2)
corresponds to the well-known Hamiltonian from Ref. 1,
where D/C252:87 GHz is the zero-ﬁeld splitting of the ground
state jgiandSis the vector of electron spin matrices
½Sx;Sy;Sz/C138for an S¼1 system. The electron gyromagnetic
ratio, which deﬁnes the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting,is given by c
e¼28 GHz/T, and B0is the external magnetic
ﬁeld vector. As in Ref. 1, we write the Hamiltonians in units
of frequency, as this is more relevant to experiment.
The nuclear spin Hamiltonian
HI¼PI2
z/C0cnB0/C1I (3)
is the corresponding term for the14N nuclear spin.
P/C25/C05:01 MHz is the nuclear quadrupole moment of14N,I
is the vector of nuclear spin matrices ½Ix;Iy;Iz/C138forI¼1, and
cn¼3:077 MHz/T is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio of
14N.21–23Since cnis roughly a factor 10 000 smaller than ce,
the interaction between the nuclear spin and the external B0
ﬁeld is not observed in our experiments as it would require a
ﬁeld of several 100 mT to be resolved.
The ﬁnal term in H0describes the interaction of the NV/C0
electron spin with the14N nuclear spin:
HSI¼AjjSzIzþA?ðSxIxþSyIyÞ; (4)
where Ajj¼2:14 MHz and A?¼2:7 MHz are the parallel
and perpendicular components of the hyperﬁne tensor withrespect to the NV/C0center axis, respectively.21
In Fig. 1(a), we show a schematic of the energy levels of
the system (not to scale) according to the Hamiltonian H0in
Eq.(1). We start with the bare ground state energy level jgi
of the NV/C0center on the left side. Turning on the zero-ﬁeld
splitting Dthen lifts the degeneracy between the different
S¼1 levels, by raising the ms¼61 levels by D¼2.87 GHz
above the ms¼0 level. Next, we include the electron
Zeeman interaction as given by ceB0/C1S. Assuming that B0
is applied along the z-axis, the Zeeman interaction raises the
ms¼þ1 level by 2 ceBzabove the ms¼/C01 level. Finally,
we include the14N nuclear spin. The quadrupole component
Plifts the degeneracy between the different I¼1 nuclear
spin levels by raising the mI¼0 level by 5.01 MHz above
themI¼61 levels [see Eq. (3)], and the hyperﬁne interac-
tion between electron spin and nuclear spin further splits them
I¼þ1 and mI¼/C01 levels by j2Ajjjfor the ms¼61e l e c -
tron spin states [see Eq. (4)]. The nuclear spin Zeeman interac-
t i o na sd e ﬁ n e db y cnB0/C1Iin Eq. (3)is not included in this
schematic as it is too small to be observed in our experiments.
IV. RABI FORMULA
One of the learning outcomes is the understanding of
experimental non-idealities. A very common non-ideality is adriving ﬁeld that is detuned in frequency from the spin reso-nance transition and that is strong in power. This will lead tonon-perfect rotations of the spin and the power-broadening of
551 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Yang et al. 551 04 October 2023 23:13:02
the ODMR resonance lines, which prevents the observation
of ﬁne features of the spectrum at high driving powers. The
effect of both can be easily understood via the Rabi formula,
which describes the probability of ﬂipping a spin (or any two-
level system) as a function of pulse time when a coherent
driving pulse is applied,24

of the Rabi oscillations. If the amplitude is plotted as a func-
tion of the frequency detuning D, the result is a Lorentzian
lineshape that has a half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of
DHWHM ¼XR. This means that for a detuning of D¼XR, the
spin can still be rotated with 50% amplitude, clearly showing
how a high Rabi frequency caused by a large B1amplitude
leads to a large linewidth in the ODMR spectrum.The second part of Eq. (5)is the time-dependent quantity

tromagnets, measured using the photodiode. Each column of the 2D map corresponds to a single ODMR scan for a certain magnetic ﬁeld strength. The electr on
spin resonance transitions split with increased magnetic ﬁeld strength due to the Zeeman effect as described by Eq. (2). The eight different transitions arise
from the four different orientations of the NV/C0center axis, of which two pairs have approximately the same angle with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld
B0[see also Fig. 3(c)]. The dashed lines are the calculated transition frequencies using Eq. (2).

experiments being performed at a frequency detuning D6¼0
is that the Rabi oscillations are faster and have a smalleramplitude than in the resonant case. This can be visualized
by imagining a state on the Bloch sphere that starts at the
south pole and rotates about different axes (see Fig. 2). For a
rotation axis along the equator of the Bloch sphere, the path
that the state would describe on the Bloch sphere would take
it all the way to the north pole (i.e., large amplitude), as seenin Fig. 2(a). However, when the rotation axis cants closer to
one of the poles, the path that the state describes on the
Bloch sphere would not take it very far away from the south
pole (i.e., small amplitude), as seen in Fig. 2(b).
V. EQUIPMENT
The experimental setup used for the experiments in this
manuscript is almost identical to the one introduced in detail
in Sec. IV of Ref. 1. A few improvements have been intro-
duced to enable the observation of nuclear interactions in theexperiments. First, while a photodiode is sufﬁcient to per-
form the measurements presented here and was, in fact, used
for acquiring the data presented in Fig. 1(d), the signal-to-
noise ratio can be improved by using an avalanche photodi-ode (APD), e.g., Excelitas Technologies SPCM-AQRH. As
with the photodiode, the APD can simply be connected
to the lock-in ampliﬁer input (in voltage mode), where thelow-pass ﬁlter will average over the short voltage pulses.When these experiments were implemented in the teaching
labs at UNSW Sydney, students performed all experiments
using standard photodiodes.
Second, as shown in Fig. 1(c), we have added a pair of
homemade electromagnetic coils, powered by a DC labpower supply, to generate a well-deﬁned and homogeneous
B
0ﬁeld. Each coil is constructed from a reel and an
L-shaped mount (see Fig. 8in the Appendix ). A hole at the
center of the reel allows the addition of a core (in our case, asupermendur cylinder) to further increase the magnetic ﬁeld.
The advantage over permanent magnets is that the magnetic
ﬁeld strength can be easily tuned by adjusting the currentgoing through the coils, and the magnetic ﬁeld direction isknown as well. In the Appendix , we present more details on
the design and geometry of the homemade electromagnets.
A low-cost, commercial solution is the Adafruit Industries3875 electromagnet (see, e.g., Digi-Key 1528-2691-ND). An
alternative way to measure a more homogeneous ensemble
of NV
/C0centers would be to interchange the multi-mode ﬁber
for detection with a single-mode ﬁber to collect signal froma smaller sample volume.
The sample used for the experiments presented here is a
commercially available, off-the-shelf, h100i-oriented CVD
diamond sample from Element Six28and is used without any
processing. The dimensions of the sample are 2 :6/C22:6
/C20:25 mm, and the nitrogen concentration is <1 ppm. In
Appendix C of Ref. 1, there is a comparison between this
sample and a high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) dia-mond sample that was used for the experiments in Ref. 1.
The CVD sample has a /C241000 times lower PL signal, and
while the spin signal decreases proportionally, we obtain
high-quality data with only /C2410 times longer measurement
times. In contrast, the CVD sample has a much longer coher-ence time than the HPHT sample, on the account of the
lower N concentration, which allows the observation of
effects originating from coupling to nuclear spins. Morerecently, we have also started using a commercially availablesample from Element Six with an NV center density of
/C24300 ppb, optimized for quantum experiments.
29The
ODMR signal from this sample is over 50 /C2higher than the
signal obtained from the CVD sample;28this larger density
sample was used for the experiments in Fig. 4(a).
VI. EXPERIMENTS
All experiments described here are based on the electron
spin resonance (ESR) technique, which allows us to coher-
ently control the electron spin of the NV/C0center and per-
form different types of measurements depending on theexact pulse sequence. More precisely, the type of ESR exper-
iment that we perform here is termed ODMR, since the elec-
tron spin state is read out (and initialized) via optical means,i.e., laser excitation and spin-dependent photon emission viaphotoluminescence (PL). The exact process was already
described in Ref. 1and many other publications.
4,5,7,8
As introduced in Ref. 1and can be seen in Fig. 1(a), there
are a number of different ESR transitions that can be drivenwith an oscillating or rotating magnetic ﬁeld B
1. For
B0¼0 T and neglecting the nuclear spin, all transitions are
degenerate and centered around D¼2.87 GHz. When the
magnetic ﬁeld is turned on, the Zeeman splitting [Eq. (2)]
lifts this degeneracy and leads to different resonance fre-
quencies for ms¼0$ms¼/C01 and ms¼0$ms¼þ1.
When the interaction with the14N nuclear spin is included,
there are six possible transitions—two each for mI¼/C01
(red arrows), mI¼0 (orange arrows), and mI¼þ1 (green
arrows). These transitions will keep the nuclear spin state
unchanged but modify the electron spin state.

matic of the alignment of the crystallographic axes with respect to the
applied B0and B1magnetic ﬁelds. The B0ﬁeld is oriented along the
½0:67;0:74;0:02/C138direction. The red sphere indicates the N atom of the NV/C0
center, while the black spheres indicate the four possible lattice sites for the
vacancy. In this orientation, B0results in similar Zeeman splittings for the
½111/C138and½/C221/C2211/C138, and the ½1/C221/C221/C138and½/C2211/C221/C138NV/C0orientations, respectively,
while the orientation of B1results in similar Rabi frequencies XR.

A. Magnetic field dependence
We start by measuring the ODMR spectrum of the dia-
mond sample as a function of magnetic ﬁeld B0. The CVD
diamond chip has {100} faces, i.e., perpendicular to theh100idirections, and the four orientations of NV/C0centers
are along the [111], [1 /C221/C221], [/C2211/C221], and [ /C221/C2211] directions (see
Fig. 3). The B1ﬁeld created by the printed-circuit-board
antenna is applied along the [001] direction, and therefore,
perpendicular to the sample surface. The B0ﬁeld created by
the coils of the electromagnet is applied parallel to the samplesurface. By rotating the CVD sample on the sample holder,different B
0directions with respect to the crystallographic
axes can be created. More speciﬁcally, when the sample ismounted in a square orientation [i.e., like /H11623, as shown in Fig.
3(a)], the B
0ﬁeld acts along the [100] direction. This results
in all four NV/C0orientations experiencing the same effective
angle between their NV/C0axes and B0and having the same
two ODMR frequencies. However, when the sample ismounted in a diamond orientation [i.e., like /H17003,a ss h o w ni n
Fig.3(b)], the B
0ﬁeld acts along the [110] direction, resulting
in the same effective angle for the [111] and [ /C221/C2211], and the
[1/C221/C221] and [ /C2211/C221] orientations, respectively, and a total of four
ODMR frequencies. In order to lift the degeneracy of all four
NV/C0orientations and see eight different transitions appear,
B0needs to be additionally rotated out of the sample plane.
We mount our sample roughly in the diamond orientation
(i.e., like /H17003), i.e., with B0directed along the [110] direction;
however, we introduce a slight misalignment and let studentswork out the exact orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld. They canachieve this by recording B
0-dependent ODMR spectra and
mapping the observed splittings onto the calculated transition
energies from Hamiltonian HS[Eq. (2)] using MATLAB.
We plot such a magnetic ﬁeld map in Fig. 1(d). Here, the
magnitude of B0can be increased without altering the mag-
netic ﬁeld direction by increasing the current through theelectromagnet (see top x-axis) from 0 to 1.0 A in 21 steps.
For each B
0magnitude, ODMR spectra were recorded to
build up the 2D ODMR map. Students then ﬁt the simple
electron spin Hamiltonian HSto the data to work out the coil
constant that describes the relationship between current andB
0ﬁeld. The dashed lines in Fig. 1(d) show the best ﬁt for
these data. The ﬁt indicates that B0is applied along the [0.56
0.83 0.03] direction, and the coil constant is 11.9 mT/A.
Note that the resistance of the electromagnetic coils is about
15X, and that it increases when the coils heat up at larger
driving currents. It is, therefore, important to use a current
source to control the magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore, the coils
will also heat up the diamond sample and, therefore, the NV/C0
center environment. At a high current, the ODMR spectrumwill shift according to the temperature dependency of thezero-ﬁeld-splitting dD=dT¼/C074:2 kHz/K.
30For our experi-
mental setup, a current of 1 A heats up the diamond sample by/C2440 K and shifts the zero-ﬁeld splitting by /C243M H z .
In the teaching labs at UNSW Sydney, students recorded
eleven ODMR spectra for electromagnet currents between 0
and 0.5 A in 0.05 A steps. Each spectrum was measured from2.65 to 3.09 GHz in 221 steps with a wait time per point of600 ms using the photodiode. This resulted in a total mea-surement time of /C2425 min. While the measurements were
running, the students were given a prepared MATLAB scriptto examine the relationship between the coil constant and the
magnetic ﬁeld orientation. The students were then able to
iteratively extract the relevant B
0parameters by ﬁtting theirvalues to the measurement data, comfortably within the allo-
cated time frame of the lab. This exercise addresses the ﬁrstlearning outcome in Sec. II.
B. Spectral signature of hyperfine-coupled14N
Having mapped out the Zeeman splitting of the S¼1
NV/C0center electron spin in Fig. 1(d), we can now take a
closer look at the ODMR spectrum to examine the spectralsignature of the hyperﬁne-coupled14N nuclear spins. Owing
to the optical properties of the NV/C0center, the electron–
nuclear spin interactions for the native14N nucleus can be
seen directly in the ODMR spectrum. The14N hyperﬁne
interaction tensor [see Eq. (4)] splits each electron energy
level [see Fig. 1(a)], causing the electron spin transitions to
become nuclear spin dependent, with a 2.16 MHz splitting inbetween the different I
zprojections. The different colored
arrows in Fig. 1(a) represent the allowed electron spin transi-
tions for the different nuclear spin orientations mI¼/C01
(red), mI¼0 (orange), and mI¼þ1 (green). These splittings
can be resolved with a high-quality, low-concentration NV/C0
center ensemble sample ( /C201 ppm31) with a high ODMR fre-
quency resolution and a low microwave power.32
In Fig. 3(c), we show the ODMR spectrum at a magnetic
ﬁeld of B0¼1:3 mT along the [0.67, 0.74, and 0.02] direc-
tion (as estimated from the spectrum). The ﬁeld is onlyslightly misaligned from the [110] crystallographic axis [seealso the inset in Fig. 3(c)], leading to similar Zeeman split-
tings and overlapping transitions for the ½111/C138and½/C221/C2211/C138, and
the½1/C221/C221/C138and½/C2211/C221/C138NV
/C0orientations, respectively. All the
coherent control measurement results in Secs. VI C ,D, and E
(i.e., Figs. 4,6, and 7) are taken based on this ﬁeld strength
and orientation. Each peak in Fig. 3(c) displays a triplet
structure that corresponds to the three different nuclear spinorientations. In Secs. VI C ,D, and E, we will examine
closely what effect the presence of the hyperﬁne lines has incoherent control experiments such as Rabi oscillations,Ramsey oscillations, and Hahn echoes.
From the Rabi formula (see Sec. IV), we know that a lower
microwave (MW) power results in a narrower HWHM ofthe peaks in the spectrum. We map out this dependency inFig.4(a), where we plot ﬁve ODMR spectra recorded for dif-
ferent MW powers (open circles), together with a ﬁt to thesum of three Lorentzian peaks with equal width and area(solid lines). At the lowest MW power, the three hyperﬁnepeaks are clearly separated, while the power broadening at thehigher powers leads to an overlap of the individual peaks.
We, therefore, need to work with low MW powers if we
want to resolve the hyperﬁne splitting without power broad-ening. This requires a balance between resolution and signalstrength; we noticed that it is advantageous to work at lowmagnetic ﬁelds where the quenching of the photolumines-cence is insigniﬁcant, and the electron spin transitions fromtwo different NV
/C0orientations with slightly different angles
overlap. For all following experiments, however, we choosea MW power that leads to some overlap between peaks [sim-ilar to the þ3 dBm curve in Fig. 4(a)] in order to observe
effects of simultaneously driving neighboring transitions.
In principle, it is also possible to work with NV
/C0centers
of a single orientation. To achieve this, a slightly misalignedand higher magnetic ﬁeld is needed to split the electron spintransitions associated with the four different NV
/C0orienta-
tions.33Figure 4(d) shows an example spectrum of the elec-
tron spin transitions between ms¼0 and ms¼þ1a t

C. Rabi oscillations in the presence of
14N
Applying a microwave pulse in resonance with one of the
three hyperﬁne lines (caused by the14N nuclear spin) induces
coherent electron spin oscillations between the ms¼0a n d
ms¼61 spin eigenstates, a phenomenon known as Rabi
oscillations. However, it is important to realize that the micro-
waves are simultaneously driving the detuned hyperﬁne tran-sitions, due to the ﬁnite linewidth of the individual lines as
well as the power broadening as described by the Rabi for-
mula [e.g., see overlap of peaks in Figs. 4(a),4(c),a n d 4(d)].
Figure 4(b) shows a Rabi oscillation experiment, driven
with the microwave frequency in resonance with the m
I¼0
transition [middle peak of the left triplet in Fig. 4(a)], and the
data are ﬁtted to the sum of two exponentially decaying sinus-oids A
asinð2pfaÞexpð/C0s=TaÞþAbsinð2pfbÞexpð/C0s=TbÞ
(black line). The frequencies for the two sinusoids correspond
to the on-resonance drive of the mI¼0 transition and the
detuned drive of the mI¼61 transitions. The two oscillation
frequencies become apparent when taking the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) of the Rabi oscillation experiment data[see inset of Fig. 4(b)], showing peaks at Xres
R/C250:7 MHz and
Xdet
R/C252:3M H z .
According to the Rabi formula [Eq. (5)], the Rabi oscilla-
tion frequency is given by

Therefore, the Rabi frequency of XR¼0:66760:005 MHz
in Fig. 4(b) corresponds to a ﬁeld amplitude of B1¼0:034
mT, and we keep it ﬁxed to this value for all coherent control
experiments. The faster frequency of Xdet

in Fig. 4(b) corresponds to Rabi oscillations on the
detuned hyperﬁne transitions and agrees well with the one cal-
culated using Eq. (6), where DA¼2:16 MHz is the detuning

data points, while the solid lines are ﬁts to three Lorentzian peaks with equal width and area. The curves are offset by multiples of 0.25 for better visi bility. At

neity of the B1ﬁeld over the sample area.26
The effect of power broadening and cross-talk between
the different hyperﬁne lines can be well visualized in a so-
called Rabi chevron experiment, where the MW frequency
and the pulse length are both swept—or, in other words, aRabi oscillation measurement is performed for various MWfrequencies. Note that due the large number of data points, a
Rabi chevron is usually outside of the scope of a teaching
lab. Figure 4(c)shows such a measurement for the same trip-
let of peaks as in Figs. 4(a)and4(b). Each of the three hyper-
ﬁne lines shows its own chevron fringes, overlapping with
the neighboring lines, and leading to the deviation from asingle, decaying sinusoid in Fig. 4(b).
In principle, a simultaneous drive of all three hyperﬁne
lines with similar strength can be achieved by applying a
MW drive with stronger power to increase the Rabi oscilla-
tion frequency beyond the hyperﬁne coupling (2.16 MHz).
26
However, in our experiments, the MW power was purpose-
fully kept low, so that the effect of hyperﬁne transitions can
be observed. This allows students to develop an intuitiveunderstanding of the consequences and origin of powerbroadening, fulﬁlling the second learning outcome in Sec. II.
The Rabi experiment discussed in this section is the gate-
way between performing spin resonance spectroscopy andapplying discrete gate operations in pulse sequences.Extracting the Rabi frequency X
R¼0:667 MHz allows us to
calibrate the lengths of our MW pulses to perform controlled
rotations around the Bloch sphere. Here, a p-pulse corre-
sponds to a MW pulse of correct length sp¼0:75lst o
rotate the electron spin 180/C14around the Bloch sphere, e.g.,
from ms¼0t o ms¼/C01. A p=2-pulse of length sp=2¼0:38
ls rotates the electron spin by 90/C14, e.g., from the ms¼0 state
to the jþyi¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
ðj0iþij/C01iÞsuperposition state at the
equator of the Bloch sphere. Once the pulse lengths have
been calibrated, experiments using pulse sequences, such asthe coherence times measurements in Secs. VI D andE, can
be implemented. See also Ref. 1for a more detailed discus-
sion and visualizations on spin rotations.D. Ramsey fringes in the presence of14N
A Ramsey experiment measures the free-induction decay
orT/C3
2coherence time of a spin or a spin ensemble. The T/C3
2
time is affected not only by noise during the pulse sequence
but also by detunings between the transition and the MW fre-
quency. This is because the sequence does not contain any
refocusing or echo pulses, in contrast to the Hahn echo and
Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) sequences discussed
in Sec. VI E.
Figure 5shows the pulse sequence that we use in our
experiments and the outputs of the individual channels
(CH0–CH3) of the Pulse Blaster. The spins are initialized into
thej0istate by the ﬁrst laser pulse and read out by the second
laser pulse (CH1). The MW pulse sequence (CH2 and CH3)
is applied only during the ﬁrst half-cycle for the lock-in
ampliﬁer (CH0), so that the lock-in detection scheme is sensi-
tive to changes in the photoluminescence caused by the MW
pulse sequence (see also Ref. 1). The ﬁrst microwave p=2-
pulse, applied along the X-axis, rotates the NV/C0electron spins
from j0ito the Y-axis of the Bloch sphere, corresponding
to the jþyi¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
ðj0iþij/C01iÞsuperposition state in the
rotating frame. We then let the spins dephase freely for a
duration s, before applying a second microwave p=2-pulse
along the X-axis to transfer the NV/C0spin polarization from
jþyitoj/C01ifor readout. A free induction decay curve can
be recorded by varying the free precession time s, and the
resulting data show an exponential decay in j/C01ipopulation
as a function of swith decay time T/C3
2caused by decoherence
and inhomogeneities.34For NV/C0, the main inhomogeneities
come from the variations in local strain and electric ﬁelds as
well as temporal and spatial ﬂuctuations of the surrounding
13C nuclear spin bath.4In addition, a constant frequency
detuning between the spins and the MW drive will lead to a
sinusoidal modulation of the data. This is because the spins
precess at the speed of the detuning in the reference frame
of the MW source, causing them to rotate from jþyitoward
jþxiorj/C0xiand onward, depending on the sign of the
detuning. As the second p=2-pulse in the sequence maps
jþyi!j/C0 1i;jþxi!jþ xi;j/C0yi!j 0i,a n d j/C0xi
!j/C0 xi, the constant detuning manifests as a sinusoidal
oscillation in the j/C01ipopulation at the end of the sequence.
As a consequence, a Ramsey sequence is often used for the
accurate estimation of shifts in the spin qubit resonance fre-
quency, as is important in magnetometry experiments.35
In Fig. 6(a), we show in blue the Ramsey data obtained
for driving the NV/C0in resonance with the mI¼0 transition
[same as the Rabi oscillations in Fig. 4(b)]. The data
show the exponential decay superimposed with a sinusoidal
modulation. We ﬁt the data to the function
expð/C0s=T/C3
2ÞPn
i¼1½Aisinð2pfiÞ/C138, where ncorresponds to the
number of expected transitions.36Looking at the correspond-
ing FFT of the data in Fig. 6(c), we can clearly see two
peaks. The peak at low frequencies indicates a slight detun-ing of our MW source to the m
I¼0 transition frequency.
The smaller peak at /C242 MHz corresponds to the signal from
the detuned mI¼61 hyperﬁne lines, which are detuned
from the mI¼0 transition by DA¼2:16 MHz.
In Fig. 6(b), we show very similar data with the Ramsey
experiment performed in resonance with the mI¼/C01 transi-
tion. The data now show two discrete modulation frequen-
cies: one for the mI¼0 electron spin subsystem that is
detuned by DAand a second one for the mI¼þ1 subsystem
that is detuned by 2 DA. The two frequency components canFig. 5. Ramsey pulse sequence used for the measurements in Fig. 6.
Channel 0 (CH0) provides the reference for the lock-in ampliﬁer, channel 1
(CH1) modulates the laser output for the optical initialization and readout
pulses, channel 2 (CH2) modulates the “I” output, and channel 3 (CH3)
modulates the “Q” output of the MW IQ modulator. The second p=2-pulse
is either applied along the X-axis to implement the standard Ramsey
sequence Xp=2/C0s/C0Xp=2or about the Y-axis to implement the modiﬁed
Ramsey sequence Xp=2/C0s/C0Yp=2.

be clearly seen as peaks in the Fourier-transform of the decay
data in Fig. 6(d).
For both Ramsey experiments in Figs. 6(a) and6(b),w e
also show data that are obtained by applying the second
microwave p=2-pulse along the Y-axis (purple data). This
modiﬁes the mapping of the spin before readout to jyi!j yi;
jxi!j 0i;j/C0yi!j/C0 yi, and j/C0xi!j/C0 1i. As the pro-
jection pulse along the Y-axis (purple data) is shifted by p=2
in phase with respect to the projection pulse along the X-axis
(blue date), the sinusoidal modulations are also shifted in
phase by p=2 as seen in Figs. 6(a) and6(b). The possibility
to modify the projection axis by adjusting the phase of the
MW source forms the basis for quantum state tomography37
and allows the extension of the teaching labs to include fur-ther experiments.
E. Hahn echo in the presence of
13C
The Hahn echo experiment is designed to cancel out con-
stant detunings and frequency offsets by adding an extrap-pulse to the sequence. The p-pulse inverts the spins half-
way through the precession and as such refocuses variations
in their Larmor precession frequency.38We have already
introduced this experiment in Ref. 1for the purpose of
dynamical decoupling, where it helps to improve the trans-verse relaxation time of the relevant spins, allowing the
coherence time to be extended beyond the free induction
decay time.
The MW pulse sequence we implement for the Hahn echo
measurement is X
p=2/C0s/C0Xp/C0s/C0Xp=2. In this sequence,Fig. 6. (a) Ramsey fringes measured on the ms¼0$/C0 1t r a n s i t i o nf o r mI¼0a tB0¼1:3 mT. The blue circles correspond to the standard Ramsey sequence
Xp=2/C0s/C0Xp=2, while the purple circles correspond to the modiﬁed Ramsey sequence Xp=2/C0s/C0Yp=2. The solid lines are ﬁts to the data with T/C3

the electron spins are initialized in the j0istate and rotated into
the superposition state jyi¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
ðj0iþij/C01iÞusing a MW
p=2-pulse. The spins are then left to freely precess for a length
of time s, after which they are inverted on the Bloch sphere
with a p-pulse. The spins are again left to precess for the same
amount of time, causing them to refocus before being rotated
back into the j0istate with another p=2-pulse for optical read-
out. The spin signal is then measured as a function of the free
precession time s,a n dt h e THahn
2coherence time is given as the
time constant of the exponential decay of the signal.
The Hahn echo can also be used to reveal interactions
between spins—in this case, the hyperﬁne coupling to the
13C nuclei in proximity to the NV spins that have a natural
abundance of 1.1%. The randomly distributed13C nuclei of
the diamond lattice produce a local magnetic ﬁeld that is
modulated by their Larmor precession frequencies, effec-
tively resulting in an oscillating background magnetic ﬁeld.Since the Hahn echo sequence can only remove slowﬂuctuations in detuning, the Larmor precession of the nuclei
will lead to gradual decoherence of the electron spin.
However, if the refocusing pulse occurs after exactly one
period of nuclear spin precession, the background ﬁeld mod-
ulation in both free precession intervals is exactly the same
and the coherence reappears.
In Fig. 7(a), we present the Hahn echo signal measured at a
magnetic ﬁeld of B
0¼1:3 mT. From the exponential decay,
we extract THahn
2¼11:760:2ls. Upon further investigation,
a measurement at a higher magnetic ﬁeld of B0¼5:84 mT
reveals the presence of the above-mentioned coherence
revival within the Hahn echo signal, as shown in Fig. 7(b).
The decay and revival in Fig. 7(b) are attributed to the
weak hyperﬁne coupling to the13C spins near the NV center
lattice sites.39The signal revival at 2 s/C2430ls corresponds
to a frequency of /C2466:7 kHz, which is consistent with the
fC¼cCB0¼62:5 kHz Larmor precession frequency of the
spin-1
2nuclei with cC¼10:705 MHz/T and B0¼5:84 mT.39,40
Fig. 8. Design details of the electromagnet. (a) Sketch of the reel. The M5 tapped hole is used to fasten the reel to the mount [see panel (b)] using a stain less
steel screw. In addition, we have added 12 mm long supermendur cylinders with a 4 mm diameter into the holes to slightly increase the magnetic ﬁeld
(optional). The 1 mm diameter hole (drilled at a 45/C14angle) allows the inner end of the copper wire to pass through. The copper wire we used is American Wire
Gauge (AWG) No. 22 with a 0.644 mm diameter and 52.96 m Xresistance per meter. Several 1 mm thick and 5 mm spaced cooling fences allow for better heat
dissipation. We chose brass as material due to its non-magnetic properties and ease of manufacturability. (b) Sketch of the L-shaped mount. The 5.3 mm diam-
eter hole is used to mount the reel, while the 1 mm diameter trench allows the copper wire from the reel to pass through. The connected reel and mount are
screwed onto the optical breadboard via two 6.4 mm diameter holes on the L-shaped mount. (c)–(e) Magnetic ﬁeld simulation results. The results were ob tained
by calculating the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the wire loops using the Biot–Savart law in MATLAB. The simulation is done under the condition that the dis -
tance between the two reels is 32 mm, and a 1 A current is passing through the coils. The supermendur cylinders were not included in the simulations. Two
black areas in (c) and (d) indicate the physical locations of the coils. (c) A 2D map of the total magnetic ﬁeld along the radial and axial directions of th e coils,
with (d) showing the axial magnetic ﬁeld component along the axial direction at r¼0 m and (e) along the radial direction at x¼0 m. The magnetic ﬁeld at the
center is 14.5 mT [see also dip in (d) and peak in (e)], and the simulated power consumption is 10.6 W. The real power consumption is slightly higher due to
the heat generated by the coils causing an increase in the copper wire resistance. The negative values in (e) indicate that the axial component of the ma gnetic
ﬁeld is pointing along the negative x direction. The gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld is smallest at the center between the two reels, providing the most ho moge-
neous magnetic ﬁeld in both strength and direction.

The black line is a ﬁt of the spin signal to two inverted
Gaussian peaks whose amplitude follows an exponential d ecay
/exp½/C0ð2s=THahn
2Þ/C138, which gives THahn
2¼63610 ls.
According to Ref. 40,t h e THahn
2of an NV/C0ensemble can be as
long as 600 ls at room temperature. However, the coherence
time reduces when the magnetic ﬁeld is not parallel to the NV/C0
axis, as is the case in our samples and experiments.
As the coherence revival rate is linked to the Larmor pre-
cession frequency of the13C nuclei, and therefore, propor-
tional to the applied magnetic ﬁeld, this revival is not presentin Fig. 7(a) where the lower magnetic ﬁeld of B
0¼1:3m T
would have led to a revival at 2 s¼144ls, longer than the
THahn
2coherence time.
VII. CONCLUSION
Using the cost-effective, room-temperature teaching setup
described in Ref. 1, along with some small improvements
(electromagnet and lower NV/C0density diamond sample), we
have presented here a set of more advanced experiments thataim to provide students with an in-depth understanding ofphysical concepts that are important for various quantumtechnologies. The experiments are designed to highlight theinteraction of the NV
/C0centers with surrounding nuclear
spins via the hyperﬁne interactions. The experiments allow
the students to gain a better understanding of experimentalimperfections as well as experience the manifestation ofspin–spin interactions with the intrinsic
14N nuclear spin and
the bath of surrounding13C nuclear spins. These interactions
become visible in the presented Rabi oscillation, free induc-tion decay, and Hahn echo experiments.
Despite the weaker signal intensity of the lower-density
NV/C0diamond sample used here, the experiments work
robustly on a standard desk in room light and have partiallybeen implemented in a fourth-year undergraduate course atUNSW Sydney. Furthermore, the possibility for students todesign their own pulse sequences and collect measurementdata in real-time makes this setup also an interesting optionfor more complex experiments in an undergraduate thesis.
