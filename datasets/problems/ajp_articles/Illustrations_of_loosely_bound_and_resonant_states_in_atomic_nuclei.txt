Using the one-dimensional potential well with realistic parameters for atomic nuclei, we illustrate the
movement of the poles of the S-matrix and the transmission coefﬁcient when the well supports an
anti-bound state. We calculate the phase shift of the atomic nuclei5He using the three-dimensional
potential well and compare it with the experimental one. The paper gives an introduction to some of the
properties found in realistic loosely bound and resonant nuclear systems, using mathematics accessibleto undergraduate students.

I. INTRODUCTION
Resonance is important in both classical and quantum
mechanics. In classical mechanics, resonance is associated
with an increase in amplitude when the frequency of anexternal force coincides with a natural frequency of the sys-
tem. In quantum mechanics, resonances are often deﬁned as
peaks of the transmission coefﬁcient. They are also deﬁnedas isolated poles of the S-matrix or as rapid variations of the
phase shift. In this article, we explore these deﬁnitions of res-
onances using the analytic solutions of the one and three-
dimensional potential well, and we show how this model canbe used to illustrate some of the properties of atomic nuclei.
We begin by reviewing resonances in the familiar damped
harmonic oscillator (Sec. II) and then consider the well-known
bound and scattering solutions of the one-dimensional potential
well in Secs. III A andIII B. The less-known solution of the
problem using the S-matrix formalism is developed in Sec.
III C. In order to present resonances in three-dimensional
space, we illustrate the phase shift in Sec. III D using the solu-
tion of the three-dimensional potential well.
In Sec. IV A , we illustrate how the different kinds of poles
of the S-matrix evolve from resonances to bound states for
the one-dimensional potential well. In this section, we also
compare the poles of the S-matrix with the peaks of the
transmission coefﬁcient. In Sec. IV B, we use the one-
dimensional potential well as a toy model to show the char-
acteristic behavior of the loosely bound state wave function
of the deuteron. We also connect some of the poles ofSec. IV A with the bound and anti-bound states of the deu-
teron. In the second part of Sec. IV B, we illustrate
the characteristic behavior of the resonant phase shift in the
5He nucleus using the three-dimensional potential well.
Finally, in Sec. V, we summarize our results.
II. DAMPED HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
We begin by reviewing the well-known solution to the
classical damped harmonic oscillator so that in Secs. IV A
andIV B, we can point out some commonalities with the
quantum mechanical problem. The equation of motion for a

The complex poles of GðxÞimprint their signature in the
shape of jGðxÞjand also in Arg½GðxÞ/C138. For weak damping,
i.e.,c/C28x0;jGðxÞj2has two resonant peaks with width 2 c
centered at x/C256x0, while the function Arg½GðxÞ/C138changes
byp, centered at p=2 and 3 p=2, in a narrow range around
each one of the resonant frequencies. These characteristicsare shown in Fig. 1forc¼0:1x

classical resonance is characterized by two isolated polesclose to the real axis.

Classical and quantum resonances show some common
characteristics; in particular, this kind of peak also appears
in the experimentally measured resonant scattering cross sec-
tion as a function of the energy in nuclear physics. In this
context, a Lorentzian parametrization like Eq. (6)is called
Breit–Wigner distribution (see, for example, pp. 23–24 of
Ref. 1). This characteristic behavior of Arg½GðxÞ/C138shown in
Fig.1can also be reproduced in a simple quantum mechani-
cal model, such as the one introduced in Sec. III D.
For the limit c!x0, we ﬁnd that both poles converge at
x1¼x2¼/C0ix0. So the pole structure of GðxÞchanges
from two isolated single poles to a second-order pole at
x¼/C0ix0. Figure 2shows this transition for three values of
c. We can see the two peaks approach and merge into a sin-
gle one. We also observe that the argument of GðxÞchanges
from two jumps to a single smooth jump of 2 p.
III. QUANTUM MECHANICAL SCATTERING
In this section, we consider resonances in quantum
mechanics. In Secs. III A andIII B, we obtain the negative
and positive-energy solutions of a one-dimensional
Schr€odinger equation for a square potential well. Then in
Sec. III C, we introduce the S-matrix for the one-dimensional
system. Finally, in Sec. III D, we consider resonances within
the phase shift formalism for a 3D model.
A. Bound states
Let us consider two particles of masses m1andm2limited
to move in one dimension, subject to an attractive interaction
V¼/C0V0(V0>0) when their separation is less than R. This
problem can be mapped onto a one-dimensional Schr €odinger
equation for a single particle with reduced mass l¼m1m2=

We look for the bound state solutions, i.e., /C0V0<e<0,
with the usual boundary conditions at x¼6R. With the

B. Scattering states
In this section, we solve the Schr €odinger Eq. (8)for the
eigenvalues e>0. In this case, the energies are continuous
and the solutions can be expressed as a linear combination ofplane waves,

At this stage, we have to decide whether the particle is
coming from the right or left. Either of these two options
must give the same physical result; the calculated observ-ables cannot depend on this choice. In the S-matrix approach,
both options will be considered simultaneously, but for this
section, let us assume it comes from the left, so that D¼0.
By matching conditions at x¼6R, we obtain the following

wave packet can be formed from plane waves and the max-
ima may be interpreted as the constructive interferenceinside the well.
C.S-matrix
In the S-matrix approach, the scattering process is divided
into three stages. In the ﬁrst one, the particles move towardeach other, but they are so far apart that one can neglect theirmutual interaction. In the second stage, the particles areclose enough to interact, while in the ﬁnal stage they are faraway and do not interact any more. The operator that trans-forms the initial stage into the ﬁnal stage is called S-matrix
or scattering matrix. In a time-dependent framework, the ini-tial and ﬁnal stages correspond to the remote past and future,respectively. In our time-independent formulation, the S-
matrix connects the wave functions of the two asymptoticregions: x</C0Randx>R. In this section, we calculate the
S-matrix for the one-dimensional potential well.
Let us start by considering the scattering states e>0 for
jxj/C21Rfor particles incident from the left and right:

(19)
The coefﬁcients tandrcorrespond to the transmission and
reﬂection amplitudes in the asymptotic regions jxj/C21Rfrom
Sec. III B, i.e., Eqs. (14) and(15). On the other hand, t0and
r0are the corresponding magnitudes for the reverse process,
i.e., a particle coming from the right, with t0¼tandr0¼r.
The general solution is a linear combination of uLðxÞand

where AandA0are the amplitudes of the wave function as it
approaches to the interaction region, also called incomingamplitudes, while ~Aand ~A0are the outgoing amplitudes, as
shown in Fig. 3.

Using Eqs. (14) and (15) for the transmission t(k) and

Up to now, we have considered the momentum variable k
to be a real number, or, equivalently, we have consideredreal energies. However, it is very useful to consider the trans-mission and reﬂection amplitudes as functions of the com-plex wavelength or complex energy. Doing so, we get theanalytic extensions of t(k) and r(k), and then, the analytic
extension of the S-matrix. At the common complex zeros of
the denominator of tandr, each element of the matrix Swill
have a pole; we refer to these common poles of the matrix
elements as poles of the S-matrix.
The S-matrix in Eq. (22) connects the amplitudes of the
wave function before and after the interaction, and thus itcontains information about the system. In particular, its polesgive the energies of the bound and unbound states of the sys-tem. For ﬁnite-range potentials (for further details the readermay consult Refs. 1and4), the poles of the S-matrix can be
classiﬁed into three categories as shown in Fig. 4: (i) bound
states poles, which are sitting on the positive imaginary axison the complex wave number k-plane (ﬁlled circle); (ii) anti-
bound states, which lie on the negative imaginary axis (ﬁlledtriangle); and (iii) resonant poles, symmetrically placed withrespect to the imaginary axis in the lower half plane (ﬁlled

stars). Figure 4also shows the corresponding positions of
these poles in the complex energy plane. Notice that both
bound and anti-bound states have real negative energies,
since they are the square of a purely imaginary number. InSec. IV A , we will show examples of all these poles.
To illustrate property (i) for the potential well, let us
search for the zeros of the common denominator of the ele-ments of the S-matrix of Eq. (24)in the complex k-plane,

. Notice that, if we use the disper-
sion relation e¼/C22h2=2lk2, with k¼iq, the magnitude Kis
the same as the one in Eq. (13)for bound states. By using the
identity 2cot ð2uÞ¼cotðuÞ/C0tanðuÞ, we obtain
cotðRKÞ/C0tanðRKÞ¼K

K: (27)
The above equation has the structure s/C0s/C01¼f/C0f/C01,
with s¼cotðRKÞandf¼K=q, which can be cast into the
formðs/C0fÞð1þsfÞ¼0, with the solutions s/C0f¼0 and
1þsf¼0. Using these solutions for Eq. (27), we get
q¼KtanðKRÞ;
q¼/C0KcotðRKÞ;
which are the equations we found in Sec. III A for the bound
solutions of the potential well. As a curiosity, notice thatwhile in Sec. III A we found these relations by searching for
even and odd solutions independently, here we get both ofthem from a single condition, Eq. (26).
In Sec. IV A , we will illustrate numerically properties (ii)
and (iii) by searching the zeros of Eq. (26) for anti-bound
states and resonances. Now let us come back to the interpre-tation of the poles of the S-matrix in the complex energy
plane. Using the dispersion relation, we can map the upperand lower halves of the wave number k-plane onto two com-
plex energy planes, see Fig. 4. These two energy planes may
be combined to form a single surface with two sheets calledRiemann surface (see, for example, Chap. 2 of Ref. 5). Thebound states sitting on the positive imaginary kaxis are
mapped to the negative real axis of the ﬁrst sheet, called
physical sheet (ﬁlled dots). The anti-bound states, found on
the negative imaginary kaxis, are also mapped to the nega-
tives real axis, but to the ﬁlled triangle on the second energysheet, the so-called nonphysical Riemann sheet. Finally, the
symmetrical pair of resonances are mapped from the k-plane
to the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants, respectively, of the secondRiemann sheet (ﬁlled stars). They are located symmetrically
with respect to the real axis.
Let us summarize the physical interpretation of the poles
of the S-matrix. Bound states represent bound quantum sys-
tems, such as a nucleon (proton or neutron) in a nucleus (we
will see an example in the ﬁrst part of Sec.
IV B). Anti-
bound states and resonances represent unbound systems.6
Resonances show up as sharp maxima in the cross section as
a function of the energy or as a rapid variation of the phase
shift (we will see an example in the second part of Sec.IV B). The physical interpretation of the anti-bound states is
more elusive. We have mentioned that they have negative
energies, like bound states, but they are not normalizable.
We found that they lie in the second Riemann sheet, whichmakes clear why this sheet is called nonphysical. An inter-
pretation of an anti-bound or virtual state is that if the inter-
action were a bit stronger, the anti-bound state wouldbecome a bound state.
7,8In Sec. IV A , we will illustrate this
transition for the potential well.
D. Phase shift
The last picture we will use to illustrate resonances is the
phase shift in a three-dimensional spherical potential well.
As for the one-dimensional model, we write the Schr €odinger
equation in terms of the reduced mass and, for simplicity, we
neglect the spin–orbit interaction,

The above equation looks very much like the one-
dimensional Schr €odinger equation with an extra term called
centrifugal interaction. This term depends on the orbital
angular momentum l, with l¼0;1;2;…. In order to intro-

tions, respectively.9The coefﬁcients Slfor the partial waves

ior of a phase shift as a function of the wave number kin

In order to visualize that dlis associated with a shift in

which justiﬁes the name of phase shift for dl(for more details
about the physical interpretation of the phase shift, see, for
example, Sec. VIII C in Ref. 11).
As a ﬁnal observation before moving to the applications,
let us connect the properties of the amplitude GðxÞof Sec. II
with the cross section for a quantum resonance. The partial
wave cross section rlcan be expressed in terms of the phase
shift11
rl¼4p
k2ð2lþ1Þsin2ðdlÞ: (34)
Fordl¼p=2, the cross section will be a maximum, and that
maximum will be sharp if the phase shift rapidly changes
around this value. These are the properties shown in Fig. 1
for a resonance in the classical damped harmonic oscillator.
Then, it is possible to write the phase shift as the right side
of Eq. (7)with c!C=2, and x0!er, where erandCare

By replacing this expression of the phase shift in Eq. (34),
we get
rl¼4p
k2ð2lþ1ÞC2=4
ðe/C0erÞ2/C0C2=4: (36)
This is the so-called Breit–Wigner formula. Notice that this
parametrization resembles that of the right side of Eq. (6).
The condition C=er/C281 is equivalent to a sharp structure of
the cross section. This ratio is like the one between the
damping coefﬁcient cand the resonant frequency x0we con-
sidered in Sec. II, where we found that the sharp structure
occurs when c=x0/C281.
In summary, at the resonant energy, the phase shift takes
the value p=2 and it rapidly changes in a small interval of k
or energy, while the cross section shows a sharp maximum
around the resonant energy as a function of the energy. In
Sec. IV, we will see some examples of phase shift in the
atomic nucleus.
IV. APPLICATIONS
In this section, we are going to illustrate the concepts
developed in the previous one using some realistic parame-
trization for the potential well. In Sec. IV A , we study the
movement of the poles of the S-matrix and the behavior of
the transmission coefﬁcient for the one-dimensional potentialwell.
12–14In Sec. IV B, we use the three-dimensional poten-
tial well to illustrate the characteristic of the loosely bound
state of the deuteron and the resonant phase shift of thenucleus
5He.
A. Moving poles in the one-dimensional potential well
The goal of this section is to illustrate the three categories
of poles of the S-matrix presented in Sec. III C. We also
show the transitions between bound, anti-bound and resonant
states. We will calculate the poles of the S-matrix Eq. (24) as
a function of the potential strength V0with R¼2.1 fm and
2l=/C22h2¼0:024 MeV/C01fm/C02. The reason for these parameter
choices will become clear in Sec. IV B.
We start by calculating the ﬁrst four bound states using
Eqs. (9)and(10), which are shown in Fig. 5as a function of
V0. We see that for any value of the strength there is always
a bound state with even parity; as the strength increases this
state becomes more bound. A new bound state, with odd par-ity, appears for V
0/C2423:3 MeV. As the strength increases,
more states appear with interleaved parity.
Next, we study the locations of the ﬁrst three states of
Fig.5in the complex k-plane by ﬁnding the zeros of Eq. (25)
for different values of V0. The left panel of Fig. 6shows the
movement of the ﬁrst even state (x’s) and ﬁrst odd state
(circles), while the right panel shows the evolution of thesecond even state (triangles). The ﬁrst even bound state starts
with k¼0 and moves along the positive imaginary axis as V
0
increases, implying a state that becomes increasingly more
bound as the well gets deeper. The ﬁrst odd state, however,
starts at a large negative value along the imaginary axis. It
moves upward along the negative imaginary axis as V0

increases, reaching the origin and becoming a bound state at
V0¼23:29 MeV, consistent with Fig. 5.
The second even state is missing as a bound state in Fig. 5
for small values of the potential strength. In order to ﬁnd itsevolution, we search for complex zeros of Eq. (25) with a
non-zero real part for V
0small; i.e., we search for resonan-
ces. The right panel of Fig. 6shows the evolution of a pair of
symmetric poles ( n¼3 of Ref. 12), which moves upward in
the third and fourth quadrant of the k-plane. This pair of
poles merges on the negative imaginary axis at k’/C00:5i
fm/C01(V0’83 MeV) into a second-order pole. Afterward,
one of the poles moves up and the other moves down, both
along the imaginary axis. Eventually, as the strength V0
keeps growing, one pole moves to positive imaginary values
ofkand becomes the second even bound state (right triangle)
that appears in Fig. 5forV0/H1140783 MeV.In summary, we have shown in Fig. 6how the different
kinds of poles of the S-matrix evolve as a function of the
strength. Let us remark on a detail which will be relevant toSec. IV B: for a one-dimensional potential well, there always
exists at least one bound state for any value of V
0; this is not
the case for a three-dimensional well.
Let us now study the behavior of the transmission coefﬁ-
cient T, Eq. (17), as a function of the real wave number k, for
two values of the strength, V0¼33:84 and 21.76 MeV (these
ﬁgures correspond to the bound and anti-bound strengths forthe deuteron of Sec. IV B). The left and right panels of Fig. 7
show TforV
0¼33:84 and 21.76 MeV, respectively, with
the scale on the right. Both curves show the characteristicbehavior of T, with some resonant peaks for which T¼1;
these peaks widen as kincreases. Notice that the right ﬁgure
has a very narrow peak close to k¼0.
In Fig. 7, we also show the poles of the S-matrix as func-
tions of the complex kas ﬁlled squares, with the scale on the
left side. For a better visualization of the position of the poleswith respect to the peaks of T, the scale of the left axis is
inverted. We observe that the real part of the poles is close tothe position of the peaks, and that the agreement deterioratesas the imaginary part of the pole increases. We also observethat as the peaks widens, the imaginary part of the polesincrease. The broadening of the peaks with the increment ofthe imaginary part of the poles is reminiscent of the one wefound for jGj
2in Fig. 2as the damping coefﬁcient increases.
The pole on the positive imaginary axis in the left ﬁgure cor-responds to a bound state, while the pole on the negativeimaginary axis on the right ﬁgure corresponds to an anti-bound state.
B. Loosely bound and resonant states in real nuclei
In this section, we will connect the bound and anti-bound
states found in Fig. 7with the corresponding states of the
deuteron. We also will show the behavior of the phase shiftfor the nucleus
5He.

First, let us consider the one-dimensional potential well as an
approximation for the interaction in the deuteron, the nucleusof the heavy hydrogen atom,2H. It can be solved by reducing
the two-body proton-neutron system to a one-body problem
with reduced mass l, with 2 l=/C22h2¼0:024 MeV/C01fm/C02.T h e
strength V0measures the interaction between the proton and the
neutron. For the parameter Rof the well, we take the experi-
mental radius of the deuteron R¼2.1 fm (p. 40 in Ref. 15).
Notice that these are the parameters used in Sec. IV A to study
the positions of the poles of the S-matrix. The experimental
binding energy of the deuteron is e¼/C02:225 MeV.16
In our one-dimensional potential well, the ﬁrst bound state is
an even state; then, in order to describe the deuteron, we haveto consider the second bound state of the one-dimensionalpotential well, i.e., the ﬁrst odd state. Using the value
V
0¼33:84 MeV, we reproduce the ground state energy
/C02.225 MeV of the deuteron. It appears as a bound state pole
in the left panel of Fig. 7, at the value k¼þi0:231 fm/C01.T h e
deuteron has an unbound state at e¼/C00:066 MeV,1which is
found, in our one-dimensional potential well for V0¼21:76
MeV. This state appears as an anti-bound pole on the right
panel in Fig. 7, at the value k¼/C0i0:040 fm/C01. Different val-
ues of V0were needed to describe the bound and anti-bound
states of the deuteron because of our oversimpliﬁed model. Amore realistic description of the deuteron would require a more
complex interaction.
The deuteron is an example of a loosely bound nucleus. The
characteristic of loosely bound nuclei is that the wave functionextends well beyond the radius R. In order to gain intuition
about this property, we artiﬁcially increase the strength toV
0¼46 MeV; the energy of this state is e¼/C08:1M e V .
Figure 8shows the wave function of this state with that of the
deuteron. We observe that the wave function of the state withenergy e¼/C08:1 MeV decays much faster than that of the deu-
teron, with energy e¼/C02:225 MeV.
As a ﬁnal example of real nucleus, let us consider the5He
isotope. Experimentally, it is found that the separationenergy of this nucleus is negative,16meaning that it is
unbound. From the nuclear shell model, the5He nucleus is
modeled as a two-body system, a4He core plus a neutron
with intrinsic spin s¼1/2. The spin scouples to the orbital
angular momentum lto give the total angular momentum
j¼lþs. In this picture, the valence neutron may be in the
p3=2orp1=2(with pindicating the orbital angular momentum
l¼1 and j¼3/2 or j¼1/2). The reduced mass of the4He
plus neutron system yields 2 l=/C22h2¼0:0385 MeV/C01fm/C02,
while the value for the parameter Rwas set equal to 2.15 fm.
Since we are not considering the spin–orbit interaction, thestates p
3=2and p1=2are degenerate in a single pstate.
The strength of the potential well V0¼53:18 MeV was cho-
sen to have dp¼p=2 at the experimental16resonant energy
e3=2/C0¼0:735 MeV. Using Eq. (32), we calculate the phase
shift dpshown by a solid line in Fig. 9. The proﬁle of the cal-
culated phase shift dpis reminiscent of the function Arg(G)
of the damped harmonic oscillator of Fig. 1. From the experi-
mentally measured cross section as a function of the energy,one may extract the phase shift for the different quantumnumbers. In Fig. 9, we show the experimental phase shift for
p
3=2andp1=2(data from Ref. 17). We observe that the calcu-
lated phase shift dpin our simpliﬁed model follows closer
the shape of the experimental phase shift dp3=2, i.e., the reso-
nant behavior of the5He nucleus. Better agreement with the
experimental data would require the inclusion of the spin–or-bit interaction.
The condition C=e
r/C281 is usually used to characterize an
observable resonance,1,7with erthe energy of the resonance
andCits width. From Fig. 9, we can calculate the width,18

er¼0:373 MeV :
Then, by taking the ratio between the width Cand the experi-
mental resonant energy er¼0:735 MeV (Ref. 16) for the
5He, we get C=er¼0:51 MeV. Since this ratio is not as

small as for the harmonic oscillator, the jump in Fig. 9is
somewhat less pronounced that in Fig. 1.
V. SUMMARY
We started by reviewing the behavior of the amplitude
and phase of the classical damped harmonic oscillator nearresonance. Then we applied the usual matching procedure to
ﬁnd the bound and scattering solutions of the one-
dimensional well potential. After that, we deﬁned the S-
matrix for the one-dimensional potential well and introducedthe its analytic extension to the complex wave number plane.We classiﬁed the poles of the scattering matrix and made the
connection between its poles in the complex wave number
and energy planes. Finally, we introduced the phase shift inthe three-dimensional spherical potential well.
In the applications, we showed the movement of the ﬁrst
few poles of scattering matrix for the one-dimensional poten-
tial well in the complex wave number plane as a function of
the strength of the potential. We showed how the ﬁrst state isalways present for any value of the strength and how the sec-ond state becomes a bound state starting as an anti-bound
state. The movement of these two states in the energy plane
is as follows: the ﬁrst state moves always on the physical(ﬁrst) Riemann sheet along the negative real axis from zerotoward negative inﬁnity as the strength increases, while the
second state also moves along the negative real axis but it
starts on the nonphysical (second) Riemann sheet and thencontinues along the negative real axis on the physicalRiemann sheet. The third bound state has an anti-bound part-ner; both these states started as resonances from small values
of the strength and they merged on the negative imaginary
axis, as it was found for the classical harmonic oscillator.Also, for the one-dimensional potential well, we illustratedthe relation between the isolated poles of the scattering
matrix and the maxima of the transmission coefﬁcient. We
found that the agreement departed as the imaginary part ofthe poles widens. We showed that the anti-bound stateshowed up as a narrow peak in the transmission coefﬁcient
very close to the origin.
By using the one-dimensional potential well, we compared
the loosely bound state wave function of the deuteron with amore tightly bound state and showed how the former extendsmuch more in the space than the latter. As an example of an
experimentally observable resonance in nuclear physics, we
used the three-dimensional potential well as an approximatemodel to illustrated the unbound
5He nucleus. We found the
usual rapid variation of the phase shift that characterizes a
resonance.The use of the potential well in one and three dimensions
allowed us to build toy models of real nuclei which wereanalytically solved. The concepts and equations presented inthis article will allow advanced students and instructors tounderstand resonant properties in real nuclei by themselves,varying the parameters that deﬁne the Schr €odinger equation.
