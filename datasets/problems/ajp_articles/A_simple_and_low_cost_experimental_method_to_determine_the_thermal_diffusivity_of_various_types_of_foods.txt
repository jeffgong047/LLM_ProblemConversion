A simple low-cost method was used to measure the thermal diffusivity of nine different types of
foods: potato, sweet potato, pumpkin, taro, radish, eggplant, lemon, tomato, and onion. We cut the
foods into spherical shapes, inserted thermocouple sensors into their centers, and immersed them in
boiling water. Fitting the time dependence of the center temperature to a heat-conduction modelyielded a value for the thermal diffusivity with good consistency between spheres of different
radii. This method can be generalized to determine thermal diffusivity of a wide variety of
samples.

I. INTRODUCTION
Thermal diffusivity controls the heat transfer process via
the equation $2T¼a/C01ð@T=@tÞ, where Tis the temperature
andais the thermal diffusivity. This equation describes one
of the most important physical phenomena governing theworld-heat transfer and exchange. Thermal diffusivity is
expressed mathematically as a¼k/qc, where ais the thermal
diffusivity in m2/s,qis the density (kg/m3), and cis the spe-
ciﬁc heat (J/(kg K)).
In 1979, Unsworth and Duarte presented a simple method
to determine the thermal diffusivity for rubber spheres by
measuring the rate of cooling of their centers.1The process
required gluing a spiral-shaped thermocouple to the center ofa rubber hemisphere and joining two hemispheres to make awhole sphere. Probably due to the difﬁculty of preparing thesamples, only spheres of a single diameter were studied. We
show that, by varying the diameter of the spheres, students
can discover for themselves the simple scaling relationshipbetween diameter and time, and by making the spheres out ofa variety of foods, they can easily prepare interesting samples.
II. THEORETICAL MODEL
Solving the diffusion equation is simpliﬁed by our experi-
mental method that uses spherical samples. For this geome-try, the solution was derived in Refs. 1and2, and we will
present it brieﬂy here. With spherical symmetry, the diffu-
sion equation simpliﬁes to

In our numerical calculation, the ﬁrst 16 terms of Eq. (3)are
used. However, to understand the experimental results, it is
helpful to make further approximations. In Sec. IV,w ew i l l
measure the time required for the center temperature toincrease from its initial value ( T
i/C2420/C14C) to Tc¼75/C14Cw h e n
immersed in boiling water ( Th¼100/C14C). We can solve for

In this case, a nearly exact solution is found if the ﬁrst term is
0.356, so that the next term is (0.356)4¼0.016, and later terms
are even smaller. To a good approximation (within 4%), we
can keep only the ﬁrst-order term and ﬁnd that the timerequired for the center of the sphere to reach T

Within this approximation, there is a quadratic relationship
between the required heating time tand the radius R. This
relationship should make qualitative sense to students, asheat must travel through the surface of the sphere, so one
might predict that the time required to reach a particular tem-
perature would scale as the surface area, that is, the square ofthe radius. However, most students will not be aware of this
result, and we suggest that students can be allowed to deduce
this relationship experimentally in a “discovery lab” usingthe following procedure.
III. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
Our method is similar to Unsworth and Duarte’s work,
1but
we extend their method in the following ways: (1) We insert

a straight, rather than spiral shaped, thermocouple into the
spherical sample. In Unsworth and Duarte’s work, a spiralshaped thermocouple was used, intended to slow any poten-
tial thermal leakage through the thermocouple itself. We
found that a straight thermocouple works well enough, andthe small-sized thermocouple tip can be inserted directly intothe spherical sample. Hence, the process of preparing thesample and the measurement setup is simpler than that ofRef. 1. (2) We take the diameter of the sphere as an addi-
tional experimental parameter. We measure the time depen-dence of the center temperature with multiple samples ofdifferent diameters, which adds an independent parameter
through which the model can be tested. (3) We apply this
method to measure some interesting materials: various typesof food.
Nine types of food were used in this project: potato, sweet
potato, pumpkin, taro, radish, eggplant, lemon, tomato, andonion. All the food samples were shaped into spheres withradii ranging from 15 to 31 mm. Figure 1shows three of
these samples.
The sample preparation process is straightforward.
Spheres of potato, sweet potato, pumpkin, taro, radish, and
eggplant were shaped manually with a regular kitchen vege-
table “Y” peeler such as a Westmark Gallant Vegetable YPeeler, taking about 5 min. For samples such as onion,lemon, and tomato, we started with foods that were alreadynearly spherical and with diameters very close to what wewant for the ﬁnal samples; thus, we only needed to removethe skin, since shaping these foods would be difﬁcult.
During the sample shaping process, calipers were used to
monitor diameter of the sample. For any spherical sample
used in this work except for onion, lemon, and tomato, the
maximal deviation between ten measurements of diametersin random orientations was less than 1 mm. In addition, wealso measured the weight of each sample and then calculatedthe density. For the same material, the difference in the den-sities between different samples was less than 4%. For onion,lemon, and tomato, the maximal deviation in diameterbetween random orientations was less than 2 mm.
Because we need to measure the temperature at the center
of the sample, the size of the temperature sensor head needs
to be small. A Proster digital temperature thermometer was
used, which included K-type thermocouple probes, shown inFig. 2. The thermocouple probe has a diameter of around1 mm and connects to the meter via 1 m wires. The plastic
insulation coating wrapped around the thermocouple’s con-
ductive wires is about 0.75 mm in thickness. The small tip,i.e., the junction of the thermocouple, is exposed. The ther-mocouple is inserted into the center of the spherical
food sample to measure the temperature rising as a function
of time during the heating process with an uncertaintyof61
/C14C.
After the thermocouples are inserted, the samples are
immersed but suspended in boiling water (100/C14C), as shown
schematically in Fig. 3. We then track the center temperature
increase as the function of time.
The total cost for the materials, tools, and instruments used
in this project is about $100. The thermocouple and its volt-
meter come together with the thermocouple cost $60, and allthe food materials cost less than $50. It takes about 10–30 min
to measure each sample, depending on the sample diameter,
and the measured results are consistent and accurate.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

function of time of ﬁve spherical potato samples with radii
from 16 to 30 mm.

In a course in which students are not asked to fully under-
stand the solution to the diffusion equation, the data shownin Fig. 4may not be very meaningful. We suggest two
approaches for these students. The ﬁrst would be to ask them
to consider the time required for the center to reach a particu-lar temperature: We plot the time required to reach 75
/C14Ci n
Fig.5. The dashed curve is a best-ﬁt quadratic relationship.
Depending on the amount of time available to the class, this
plot could be created by individual lab groups, or it could becreated by sharing data for a single radius from each labgroup among the entire class. If desired, students could then
apply Eq. (5)to ﬁnd the thermal diffusivity, a, which for
these data is a¼1.47/C210
/C07m2/s.
The second approach further conﬁrms that the heating
time has a quadratic relationship with the radius of the sam-ple. In Fig. 6, we normalize the time (dividing by the square
of the radius) and replot three heating curves for samples
with radii of 16, 23, and 30 mm, respectively, vs the normal-ized time. This process of collapsing a dataset onto a singlecurve to verify an equation is an important tool of experi-
mental physics that is seldom illustrated in the introductory
labs, and that students may ﬁnd very convincing.A careful look at the ﬁt of the heating curves reveals some
small but signiﬁcant discrepancies. Figure 7shows the mea-
surement result (dots) for a potato sample with a radius of23 mm. The two theoretical curves use different thermal dif-fusivities: For the solid curve, a¼1.32/C210
/C07m2/s, and for
the dashed curve, a¼1.42/C210/C07m2/s. The solid curve ﬁts
the measured data almost perfectly for t>400 s. However,
the dashed curve ﬁts the experimental data better during theinitial phase (0–250 s). This discrepancy may be due to thetemperature dependence of thermal diffusivity, which is notincluded in our model. We also observe that the potatoeschange their physical properties as they are heated (they
“cook”), and that, where the literature includes separate ther-
mal diffusivities for cooked and uncooked potatoes,
5the dif-
fusivities are lower for cooked potatoes, consistent with ourresults.
More measurement results and simulations for other sam-
ples, including several other types of foods, can be found inthe supplementary material.

sample, we provide both a low-end value and a high-end
value, since, as discussed in Sec. IV, the data are not per-
fectly ﬁt by the use of a single thermal diffusivity. We sum-marize these data and compare to values from the literaturein Table I.
We observe that our values are in good agreement with
those in the literature,
3–14especially given the range of pub-
lished values, which may reﬂect both variations within thefood categories and also measurement uncertainties.
Some additional sources of measurement uncertainty
include:
(1) Due to the sample’s non-ideal spherical shape and mate-
rial’s non-rigid nature, there is an error in determiningthe sample’s diameter. The deviation from a perfectspherical shape introduces an additional error. We try toreduce the error by measuring the diameter with ran-domly picked orientations and then using the averagediameter value from the ten measurements. Furthermore,we also measure the weight of each sample and then cal-culate the density using the diameter and the weight. Forthe same material, the calculated densities betweendifferent samples vary by less than 4%, so we suspect
that the variations from spherical shape are not the pri-mary source of variations between measurements of ther-
mal diffusivity.
(2) Our method requires measuring the temperature in the
center of the spherical sample. There is an error in posi-tioning the thermocouple sensing tip. Furthermore, thethermocouple sensor tip has a size of about 1 mm. Thetemperature it measures is an average in a small volume,which also introduces an additional error.
(3) Since the sample is immersed in boiling water during the
measurement, the thermocouple sensor tip might move
in position during the heating process. Such a problemmight cause some temperature data irregularity, particu-larly towards the later part of the heating process, asindicated in Figs. S2 and S3 of the supplementarymaterial.

VI. SUMMARY
Nine different types of foods, including potato, sweet
potato, pumpkin, taro, radish, eggplant, lemon, tomato, andonion, were measured, and their thermal diffusivities wereexperimentally determined. We cut the foods into spherical
shapes, inserted small and thin thermocouple sensors into
their centers, and then immersed the samples in the boilingwater. The center temperature was recorded through theheating process, and then we compared the heating curve as
Fig. 6. Replotted three heating curves (radii of 16, 23, and 30 mm, respec-
tively) with a normalized time scale. The time is normalized by dividing the
time in seconds by the square of the radius in millimeters, i.e., t/R2(s/mm2).

thermal diffusivity is used as the ﬁtting parameter. Thismethod allows us to intentionally vary the diameter of thespheres, i.e., adding another variable in order to validate theresults. We are able to determine all the thermal diffusivitydata with a good matching between the measurement dataand the simulation results. This method can be generalizedto determine thermal diffusivity of a wide variety ofsamples.
