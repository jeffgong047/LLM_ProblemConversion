While visiting Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
(Fermilab) several years ago, I was surprised—and amused—as I approached the main accelerator ring to see this “roadsign” directing me to the left if a proton and to the right if anantiproton. Equally surprising, I haven’t seen an image of thispublished in the literature, so I would like to share it with yourreaders. My students certainly appreciated it, although none of
us has been able to decipher any deep physics meaning in theaccompanying “NO FISHING” sign. Perhaps just more
Fermilab humor?

The coefﬁcient of rolling friction is usually very small
when a smooth ball rolls on a smooth surface, making it hard
to measure. However, Minkin and Sikes1have described a
relatively simple method, where a ball is allowed to roll back
and forth along a curved track. At any given time, the kinetic
energy of the ball is given by KE¼1

where sis the total distance traveled by the ball during its

vfis the speed after traveling the distance s.
Equation (1)is based on a phenomenological deﬁnition
of friction, where the frictional force equates directly to a
decrease in kinetic energy through the relationship
DKE¼/C0Fs. However, students may ﬁnd this deﬁnition con-
fusing, since we also teach that when an object rolls withoutslipping, the only friction force (other than air resistance) isthe static friction that acts on the point of contact. Therefore,
this static friction might reasonably be called rolling friction.
Static rolling friction provides the force that decreases the
translational speed of the ball, but it does no work. In a simi-
lar way, static rolling friction provides the force to acceleratea vehicle, but the work is done by the motor. If a ball rolls ona horizontal surface, then the normal force N¼mgand the
friction force F

For the decelerating ball, the torque due to the friction force
acts in a direction to increase the rotational speed x. The
reason that vandxboth decrease with time is that the nor-
mal reaction force, N, acts at a point located a distance, D,
ahead of the middle of the ball.2The normal force is actually
distributed over the whole contact region, but the net effect is
equivalent to a single force Nacting at a point ahead of the
center of mass since the compression force at the front of the
ball is larger than the expansion force at the rear of the ball.
The opposing torque, ND, is larger than the torque due to fric-
tion, FsR. Since s¼FsR/C0ND¼Icmdx=dt;Fs¼/C0mdv=dt

The model presented by Cross uses a different deﬁnition
of the coefﬁcient of rolling friction than ours. There are mul-tiple published deﬁnitions for the coefﬁcient of rolling fric-tion; ones similar to our deﬁnition appear in Refs. 1and2.
We wrote in our paper, “we use a phenomenologicalapproach that presumes the magnitude of the rolling frictionforce f
ris proportional to the normal force Nand has a direc-
tion opposite to the motion.” Our model uses a work–energytheorem approach that does not refer to any forces presentthat do zero work (such as static friction). The term “rollingfriction” related to energy loss is not the static frictionrequired for rolling without slipping. Our model does assumethat the object must be rolling without sliding, whichrequires a static friction to exist, but the magnitude of thestatic friction is not considered in our model.
This phenomenological model allows a generalized
approach to considering rolling resistive friction, whereas adetailed force vector analysis is limited to speciﬁc instances.For example, the model provided by Rod Cross assumes that
the surface is rigid and the rolling object is deformable. The
forces in that model differ from the forces when a rigidobject rolls on a deformable surface, or, as is surely more
common, a case where both the object and the surface aredeformable.
Our model starts with the statement made in Ref. 3that
the accounting of friction is in fact like a book-keeper’s
accounting: If some part of energy disappears in the uselessform, we can call it friction. We are conﬁdent that thisapproach should not cause confusion.
The purpose of our original article was to describe a lab
experiment for students to calculate a parameter to describeenergy loss for rolling objects rather than a rigorous mecha-nism analysis, and we believe that our lab experiment
achieves that goal.
