A Brief History of Timekeeping. Chad Orzel. pp.
BenBella Books, Dallas, TX, 2022. Price: $16.95 pb.ISBN 97819532935600. (Michael A. Lombardi, Reviewer.)
Scholarly and specialized books that delve into the details
of particular types of clocks, as well as books that explorethe history of calendars, are relatively common. However,
general interest books that provide a broad overview of the
science and history of timekeeping are relatively rare. Thislikely stems from the fact that the subject of timekeeping is
both vast and esoteric, and thus covering everything, from
the earliest solar and mechanical clocks to present dayatomic clocks, can be a daunting task. Some notable efforts
include Audion and Guinot’s The Measurement of Time
(Cambridge University Press, 2001), McCarthy andSeidelmann’s Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics
(Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 2018), Jones’s
Splitting the Second: The Story of Atomic Time (CRC Press,
2000), and the less technical but perhaps more engaging
From Sundials to Atomic Clocks: Understanding Time and
Frequency , by Jespersen and Fitz-Randolph (Dover, 1999,
originally published as a U.S. government monograph).
Chad Orzel’s new book, A Brief History of Timekeeping:
The Science of Marking Time, from Stonehenge to AtomicClocks , is the latest contribution to this ambitious genre.
With a title that is an obvious nod to the Stephen Hawking
classic (one of the few science books that became a #1 best-seller), and a subtitle that is perhaps an unintentional nod to
Jespersen, Orzel’s book is aimed at a general audience, not
just to physicists, engineers, horologists, or time metrolo-gists. In that sense, it relates more closely to the Jespersen
work than to the other aforementioned titles. The goal here
seems to be to cover the subject as thoroughly as possiblewithout losing the general interest reader.
For the most part, Orzel does that well. A physics profes-
sor at Union College, and the successful author of four othergeneral-interest science books, Orzel is a skilled and experi-
enced writer. He has the uncommon ability of being able to
mix a well-researched historical narrative with personalanecdotes, while at the same time providing enough scien-
tiﬁc detail to avoid oversimpliﬁcation.
Orzel weaves a compelling story that reminds us how
many esteemed scientists and engineers have contributed,
either directly or indirectly, to the science of timekeeping.
The staggering litany of names that grace his pages include(among others) Galileo Galilei, Robert Hooke, Sidney
Coleman, Christiaan Hyugens, Jean Richer, John Harrison,
Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, IsaacNewton, Tobias Mayer, Sandford Fleming, Henri Poincar /C19e,
Albert Abraham Michelson, Ernest Rutherford, Max Planck,
Niels Bohr, William Shortt, Warren Marrison, NormanRamsey, Dave Wineland, and of course, Albert Einstein.One especially interesting section is found in the “Quantum
Clocks” chapter (chapter 13). It describes the work of JosephFraunhofer, a German glassmaker, who developed diffrac-tion grating around 1815. This allowed Fraunhofer to mea-
sure the absolute wavelengths of various colors of light and
to discover spectral lines. Orzel links Fraunhofer’s work,which occurred some 50 years before the initial suggestions
of Lord Kelvin and some 125 years before the initial experi-
ments of Isidor Rabi, to the origins of the atomic clock. Thisconnection was previously unknown to the reviewer.
Orzel is also especially adept at explaining physics to non-
physicists, a skill he displays throughout the book. For exam-ple, Chapter 5, entitled “Drips and Drops,” goes beyondmost texts when describing water and sand clocks. Instead of
just glossing over them brieﬂy as relics of the past, Orzel
explains the physics of how the changing ﬂow rates of waterclocks and the size and shape of the aperture of sand clocks
affected their accuracy. Chapter 14, entitled “Time and
Gravity,” provides easy-to-follow explanations of generalrelativity through the familiar context of an elevator. Alongthe way, Orzel deftly explains the bending of light, the
Doppler shift, and the gravitational red shift, and how they
relate to timekeeping.
Despite its numerous strengths, the book has some short-
comings. At times, Orzel’s obvious interest and skill in teach-
ing physics causes him to stray a bit too far off topic, perhapsoccasionally losing sight of the fact that its main subject is
timekeeping. The book’s general organization could be better,
and its balance may not satisfy all readers. Lengthy sectionson calendars precede the ﬁrst mentions of early water andsand clocks, and it could be argued that too much of the book
is devoted to providing fun facts and anecdotes about calen-
dars (about three of its 16 chapters). In addition, quartzclocks, ﬁrst covered in Chapter 15, are introduced after quan-
tum clocks and GPS, which ﬁrst appear in Chapter 15. This
creative alignment is perhaps not without artistic merit, but itdoes hinder the natural ﬂow and rhythm of the narrative andmight limit the general reader’s understanding. Finally, while
it’s not really a negative, Chapter 11 is predictably entitled
“Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?”. This provesyet again that it seems impossible to write about timekeeping
without a nod to the 1970 hit by Chicago.
All in all, the strengths of the book far outweigh its short-
comings, and A Brief History of Timekeeping is well written,
informative, and entertaining. It serves as a nice introduction
to a fascinating topic and is recommended reading for any-one interested in the subject of timekeeping.
