Analogous to the famous Euler angle parametrization in three-dimensional Euclidean space, a
reﬂection-free Lorentz transformation in (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski space can be decomposed
into three simple parts. Applying this decomposition to the Wigner rotation problem, we are able to
show that the related mathematics becomes much simpler and the physical meanings more
comprehensible and enlightening. VC2023 Author(s). All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed

I. INTRODUCTION
First discovered by Silberstein, then rediscovered by
Thomas,1,2the phenomenon that two successive non-parallel
boosts (i.e., Lorentz transformations that contain neither
rotation nor reﬂection) lead to a boost and a rotation is gener-
ally called the Wigner rotation.3It has been studied by many
authors for almost a century,4–9yet the conclusion is still
“paradoxical” for most people. “The spatial rotation resulting
from the successive application of two non-parallel Lorentz
transformations has been declared every bit as paradoxical asthe more frequently discussed apparent violations of com-
mon sense, such as the so-called ‘twin paradox’…” said
Goldstein in his classic work Classical Mechanics .10
To explain how the puzzlement arises, we start with the
classical counterpart of a boost transformation, the so-called
Galilean transformation between two inertial frames withrelative velocity ~V¼½V
x;Vy;Vz/C138,
x0¼x/C0Vxt;
y0¼y/C0Vyt;
z0¼z/C0Vzt;
t0¼t: (1)
From a geometrical point of view, the ﬁrst three lines of Eq.
(1)constitute a time-dependent passive translation. It
implies that a Galilean transformation follows the rules of a
three-dimensional translation, e.g., the composition of two
translations leads to another one, and this net translation
does not depend on the order in which the original two areundertaken. Being the relativistic version of Galilean trans-
formation, a boost is often believed to possess this same
property.
As a matter of fact, relativistic boosts do not commute
unless their directions are parallel, i.e., their composition is
order-dependent in general. Moreover, as mentioned earlier,
the composition of two non-parallel boosts is not a single
boost, but a boost along with a rotation. This is quite
counter-intuitive since the rotation seems to emerge out ofnowhere from the three-dimensional point of view. Getting
to the bottom of the matter, it is inappropriate to analogize
boost to translation since the former is essentially a sort ofrotation (or more precisely a pseudo-rotation) in four-
dimensional spacetime. Therefore, the Wigner rotation may
be regarded as a geometric problem that involves both rota-tion and pseudo-rotation, and the mathematical complexity
is enough to cloud those subtle physical meanings.If the mathematics could be substantially simpliﬁed, we
believe the physical meanings of the Wigner rotation would
become clear, and people would ﬁnd this phenomenon is notso counter-intuitive as usually thought. To achieve this goal,we develop a formulation analogous to the Euler angle
parametrization of SO(3), i.e., decomposing a reﬂection-free
Lorentz transformation in (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski
space into a product of two rotations and one pseudo-rotation (Sec. II). As a demonstration of its effectiveness, we
show how simple it is to derive important rules about the
Wigner rotation problem (Sec. III) and how little mathemati-
cal knowledge is needed to calculate the most generalWigner angle (Sec. IV). Physical insights into Wigner rota-
tion via this decomposition are discussed in Sec. III, and a
rigorous proof of this decomposition is provided in theAppendix .
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. (211)-dimensional Minkowski space
Although physical spacetime is the (3 þ1)-dimensional
Minkowski space R
3;1, physicists work on its subspace in
many cases without losing generality. For example, when
discussing a pure (i.e., rotation-free and reﬂection-free)Lorentz transformation between two inertial frames with theMinkowski coordinates ðx;y;z;ctÞandðx
0;y0;z0;ct0Þ, where c
is the light speed, we may assume the relative velocity ~Vis
along the x-direction and consider just the transformation
between ( x,ct) and ðx0;ct0Þ, which is represented by the
formula
x0
ct0/C18/C19
¼c/C0bc
/C0bc c/C18/C19
x
ct/C18/C19
¼coshg/C0sinhg
/C0sinhgcoshg/C18/C19
x
ct/C18/C19
; (2)
where b¼tanhg¼V=candc¼coshg¼1=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1/C0b2p
:This
transformation is usually called a boost along the x-direction
or an x-direction boost. From a geometric point of view, it is
a pseudo-rotation around (0, 0) in the (1 þ1)-dimensional
Minkowski space R1;1:
Similarly, since the Wigner rotation problem involves
only two relative velocities, it is legitimate to put them in thexy-plane so that none of the z-components show up in the
calculations. Therefore, our discussion will be restricted to
the (2þ1)-dimensional Minkowski space R2;1, which is suf-
ﬁcient for us to derive all of the related results.

It is apparent x2/C0c2t2is an invariant under the transfor-
mation represented in Eq. (2). When we use this invariant as
the criterion for the (1 þ1)-dimensional Lorentz transforma-
tion, the reﬂections such as x!/C0 xorct!/C0 ctwill be
included as well. It is straightforward to generalize this crite-rion to (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski space, i.e., we may
deﬁne the Lorentz transformation in this space as the one
that preserves x
2þy2/C0c2t2. Clearly, both of the x-direction
andy-direction boosts as well as the xy-plane rotation are
special cases of this (2 þ1)-dimensional Lorentz
transformation.
There are many similarities between R2;1and the three-
dimensional Euclidean space R3. For example, the three-
dimensional rotation by the angle habout the axis
½/C0sin/;cos/;0/C138takes the form

represents a pseudo-rotation around the corresponding axis
½/C0sin/;cos/;0/C138inR2;1, and it meets the criterion of being
a( 2þ1)-dimensional Lorentz transformation. However,
note that the product of the three transformation matrices inEq.(3)is an orthogonal matrix, i.e., its transpose is equal to
its inverse, while that of Eq. (4)is a symmetric one, i.e., its
transpose is itself.

it is easy to see that the necessary and sufﬁcient condition
for a 3 /C23 matrix Lto represent a (2 þ1)-dimensional
Lorentz transformation is L>gL¼g, where the superscript >
represents taking transpose of the matrix. Accordingly, if wehave two (2 þ1)-dimensional Lorentz transformation matri-
ces, say L
1andL2, then both L1L2andL2L1are also Lorentztransformations of this kind. (For the sake of brevity, we will
henceforward not distinguish between the transformation
and its matrix representation.)
B. Euler angles and their Minkowski counterparts
The theory of Euler angles guarantees that any proper
(i.e., reﬂection-free) rotation in R3can be decomposed into
three simple proper rotations with each of them keeping one
coordinate axis ﬁxed. Among those commonly used Euler
angle parametrizations, the one suits us most is

Based on the analogy between Eqs. (3)and(4), it is rea-

of Eq. (6)takes the form

C. (211)-dimensional velocity
A boost transformation takes place between two inertial
frames; hence, each boost is deﬁned by a constant velocity
that is the relative velocity between the frames. When a
(2þ1)-dimensional velocity undergoes a boost Bð~VÞwith ~V
being the relative velocity, the formula W0¼Bð~VÞWis anal-
ogous to the boost transformation of spacetime coordinates,
where the column matrices WandW0represent the (2 þ1)-
dimensional velocities in the old and the new frames, respec-
tively. Conversely, the inverse boost transformation W
¼Bð~VÞ/C01W0allows us to calculate the (2 þ1)-dimensional
velocity in the old frame from that in the new one.
Note that for an object with the spacetime coordinates ( x,
y,ct), its (2 þ1)-dimensional velocity Wis deﬁned as
W>¼dx

¼dt

where sis the proper time of this object, ~v¼½vx;vy/C138is the
two-dimensional velocity with respect to the coordinatetime, and

Assume the object at rest in the new frame. Since its two-
dimensional velocity relative to the old frame equals the rel-ative velocity ~Vbetween those two frames, transforming its
(2þ1)-dimensional velocity in the new frame back to that in
the old reveals the information of the boost velocity,

This reveals that the boost velocity ~V¼½Vx;Vy/C138

possible boosts in R2;1.
When a problem involves three inertial frames and two
successive boosts, say ﬁrst Bð~V1Þthen Bð~V2Þ, the (2 þ1)-

be transformed to that in the ﬁrst byW¼Bð~V2ÞBð~V1Þ/C2/C3/C010

The two-dimensional velocity contained in this (2 þ1)-

III. WIGNER ROTATION
A. Three rules
By employing the Euler decomposition, we can derive
three important rules about the Wigner rotation problem sys-
tematically and effortlessly. To be concise, the followingshorthand notations will be used:
Rð/Þ¼cos/ sin/0
/C0sin/cos/0

and
B/ð/C0gÞ¼Rð/C0/ÞBxð/C0gÞRð/Þ: (18)

Rule 1. Two successive boosts are equivalent to a boost
followed or preceded by a rotation, which may be taken as
the deﬁnition of Wigner rotation.
Proof: As discussed in Sec. II A, for any two boosts
B1andB2inR2;1;their product B2B1must be a Lorentz
transformation in this space. Since these boosts contain no
reﬂection according to Eq. (4), neither does their product.
Hence, we may apply the Euler decomposition to this prod-uct and demand that
B
2B1¼Rð/C0wÞBxð/C0gÞRð/Þ: (20)
549 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 7, July 2023 Leehwa Yeh 549 04 October 2023 22:53:47
Note that the corresponding coordinate transformation is
x0
y0
ct00
@1
A¼B2B1x
y
ct0
@1
A; (21)
i.e., the boost B1takes place before B2.
Referring to Eq. (18), Eq. (20) can be rearranged in two
different ways,
B2B1¼Rð//C0wÞB/ð/C0gÞ¼Bwð/C0gÞRð//C0wÞ; (22)
wherein the product Rð//C0wÞB/ð/C0gÞcorresponds to a boost
followed by a Wigner rotation, while Bwð/C0gÞRð//C0wÞto a
boost preceded by the same rotation.
If the boosts B1andB2are parallel, i.e., their directions are
the same or differ by 180/C14, then it is easy to prove w¼/
and Rð//C0wÞ¼I. On the other hand, w6¼/implies
B1andB2are not parallel. In other words, the non-
parallelism of boosts B1andB2is a necessary condition for
the existence of a non-trivial Wigner rotation. It is also a suf-ﬁcient condition as will be proved in Sec. IV B.
Rule 2. If the order of the boosts in Rule 1 is exchanged,
then the sense of Wigner rotation is reversed.
Proof: Since the boost matrices are all symmetric and rota-
tion matrices all orthogonal, this rule can be proved by tak-ing the transpose of Eq. (22),
B
1B2¼B/ð/C0gÞRðw/C0/Þ¼Rðw/C0/ÞBwð/C0gÞ: (23)
For convenience sake, w/C0/will be called Wigner angle
from now on.
Rule 3. The two-dimensional velocities corresponding to
B2B1andB1B2in the previous rules differ only by a Wigner
angle.8,9
Proof: According to Eq. (15), the two-dimensional veloci-
ties~V1/C82and~V2/C81are generated by B2B1andB1B2, respec-
tively, via the following formulas:
W1/C82¼ðB2B1Þ/C010
0
c0
@1
A; (24)
W2/C81¼ðB1B2Þ/C010

Substituting Eq. (20)into Eq. (24)gives us

A¼csinhgcos/

Similarly, substituting the transpose of Eq. (20)into Eq. (25)
leads to

A¼csinhgcosw

(27)
Thus, we ﬁnd ~V1/C82¼ctanhg½cos/;sin//C138and ~V2/C81
¼ctanhg½cosw;sinw/C138, i.e., their magnitudes are the same
while their directions differ by a Wigner angle w/C0/.The physical meaning of Rule 3 is as follows: Consider
three inertial frames KA;KB;and KC.I f KBresults from
boosting KAbyB1andKCfrom boosting KBbyB2;then a
rest observer in KAﬁnds the two-dimensional velocity of KC
isctanhg½cos/;sin//C138. On the other hand, if KBis from
boosting KAbyB2andKCfrom boosting KBbyB1;the same
observer will ﬁnd KCmoving with the same speed but
toward the direction ½cosw;sinw/C138.
B. Two kinds of Wigner rotations
Assume the spacetime coordinates of an inertial frame K
are ( x,y,ct). Applying Eq. (23) to this frame yields two
equivalent results. Both of them correspond to the sametransformed frame K
0with the coordinates ðx0;y0;ct0Þ,

Although being mathematically equivalent, they convey sig-
niﬁcantly different physical meanings. According to a restobserver in the original frame K, the ﬁrst Rðw/C0/Þoperates
on a rest frame, i.e., Kitself, while the second is responsible
for rotating a moving frame, which is Kboosted by B
wð/C0gÞ.
In comparing them, the ﬁrst rotation is more intriguing.
This is because

/C2Rð/þ180/C14Þ:
The physical meaning of the second line of Eq. (29)is the
following. When we apply B/ðgÞtoK0to obtain a rest frame,
the new frame will differ from the original rest frame by aWigner angle w/C0/. In other words, it is possible to engi-
neer a Wigner rotation in two-dimensional Euclidean spacesince the rotation of a rest frame does not involve the tempo-ral dimension.
IV. WIGNER ANGLE
In principle, for any two (2 þ1)-dimensional boosts
B
1andB2, we can always use Eq. (9)to calculate the corre-
sponding ð/;g;wÞand obtain Wigner angle w/C0/for the
product B2B1. In practice, there is an easier way as shown in
the following two examples.
A. Perpendicular case
If the directions of B1andB2are perpendicular to each
other, it is legitimate to specify

where g1andg2are positive. As discussed in Sec. III A,w e
may write
B2B1¼Rð/C0wpÞBxð/C0gpÞRð/pÞ; (31)
where the subscript pdenotes “perpendicular.”
Now instead of using Eq. (9)to express ð/p;gp;wpÞin
terms of those elements in B2B1, we calculate the following
(2þ1)-dimensional velocities:

Comparing these results with Eqs. (26) and(27), we obtain
what we are looking for, namely,
cos/p¼sinhg1coshg2=sinhgp;
sin/p¼sinhg2=sinhgp;
coshgp¼coshg1coshg2;
coswp¼sinhg1=sinhgp;
sinwp¼coshg1sinhg2=sinhgp: (34)
The beneﬁt of this method is there is no need to perform any
3/C23 matrix multiplication.
Once obtaining Eq. (34), with the help of the identity
sinh2gp¼ðcoshg1coshg2þ1Þðcoshg1coshg2/C01Þ;
(35)
we are able to calculate the sine and cosine functions of

cosðwp/C0/pÞ¼coshg1þcoshg2

B. General case
If the directions of the two boosts differ by an arbitrary
angleH¼2h2½0;p/C138, the calculation of Wigner angle
becomes complicated and is usually performed usingadvanced mathematical tools.6–8With the aid of Euler
decomposition, however, it is not necessary to introduce anynew tool and the derivation is just a little longer than that ofthe perpendicular case.
In order to make the most of the symmetry, we consider
the following two boosts without losing generality:
B
1¼B/C0hð/C0g1Þ¼RðhÞBxð/C0g1ÞRð/C0hÞ; (42)
B2¼Bhð/C0g2Þ¼Rð/C0hÞBxð/C0g2ÞRðhÞ; (43)
where g1andg2are positive. It is obvious that their products
are
B2B1¼Rð/C0hÞBxð/C0g2ÞRð2hÞBxð/C0g1ÞRð/C0hÞ (44)
and
B1B2¼RðhÞBxð/C0g1ÞRð/C02hÞBxð/C0g2ÞRðhÞ: (45)
We will denote the Euler decompositions of these two prod-
ucts by Rð/C0wÞBxð/C0gÞRð/Þand Rð/C0/ÞBxð/C0gÞRðwÞ,
551 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 7, July 2023 Leehwa Yeh 551 04 October 2023 22:53:47
respectively. There is no need to provide a subscript for the
parameters because the current case is no less general thanthe one discussed in Sec. III A.
The perpendicular example suggests it might be wise to
use the (2 þ1)-dimensional velocities corresponding to B
2B1
andB1B2as shortcuts, so our calculation begins by writing
down the inverses of these two products,
ðB2B1Þ/C01¼RðhÞBxðg1ÞRð/C02hÞBxðg2ÞRðhÞ
¼Rð/C0/ÞBxðgÞRðwÞ; (46)
ðB1B2Þ/C01¼Rð/C0hÞBxðg2ÞRð2hÞBxðg1ÞRð/C0hÞ
¼Rð/C0wÞBxðgÞRð/Þ: (47)
Combining Eqs. (46)and(26)leads to

(50)
coshg¼coshg1coshg2þcos 2hsinhg1sinhg2: (51)
Similarly, Eqs. (47)and(27)together give us

The similarity between Eqs. (48) and(52) enables us to
obtain the following two relations from Eqs. (49)and(50)by
change of notation,
sinhgcosw¼coshðcos 2hsinhg1coshg2
þcoshg1sinhg2Þþsinhsin 2hsinhg1;
(53)
sinhgsinw¼sinhðcos 2hsinhg1coshg2
þcoshg1sinhg2Þ/C0coshsin 2hsinhg1:
(54)
Now we are equipped to ﬁnd out sin ðw/C0/Þand
cosðw/C0/Þ, but it is better to make a detour to calculate
tan½ðw/C0/Þ=2/C138ﬁrst. This is because the identitytanw/C0/
2/C18/C19
¼sinw/C0sin/
coswþcos/(55)
eliminates the common sinh gterm when calculating the
ratio, and the calculation will be simpler.
Substituting Eqs. (49),(50),(53), and (54) to the right
hand side of Eq. (55)and ignoring those sinh g’s, we ﬁnd the
numerator is proportional to
sinhðcos 2hþ1Þðcoshg1sinhg2þsinhg1coshg2Þ
/C0coshsin 2hðsinhg1þsinhg2Þ
¼coshsin 2hðcoshg1sinhg2þsinhg1coshg2
/C0sinhg1/C0sinhg2Þ; (56)
and the denominator proportional to
coshðcos 2hþ1Þðcoshg1sinhg2þsinhg1coshg2Þ
þsinhsin 2hðsinhg1þsinhg2Þ
¼coshcos 2hðcoshg1sinhg2þsinhg1coshg2
/C0sinhg1/C0sinhg2Þþcoshðcoshg1sinhg2
þsinhg1coshg2þsinhg1þsinhg2Þ: (57)
Thus, Eq. (55)can be expressed as

¼sinH

whereH¼2h2½0;p/C138, and

Since both g1andg2are positive, Xis always ﬁnite and
Eq.(58) leads to the conclusion that w/C0/¼0 implies
H¼0o rp. Therefore, the non-parallelism of B1andB2is a
sufﬁcient condition for the existence of a non-zero Wignerangle. Once the range of His restricted to ð0;pÞ, we can
deduce from 1>X>1 that 0 <w/C0/<H.
Next step is to use Eq. (58) to derive the sine and cosine
functions of the half angle,

V. CONCLUSION
The Euler decomposition introduced in this paper is the
most natural and powerful tool for studying the Wigner rota-
tion problem. Once the mathematics is substantially simpli-
ﬁed, the physical meanings are easier to comprehend evenfor the beginners.

APPENDIX: VALIDITY OF EULER
DECOMPOSITION
In this appendix, we provide a rigorous proof for the valid-
ity of Euler decomposition of the reﬂection-free Lorentztransformation in the (2 þ1)-dimensional Minkowski space
R
2;1. Our proof begins with considering a general Lorentz
transformation in this space,
L¼L11L12L13
L21L22L23
L31L32L330
@1
A: (A1)
From the discussion in Sec. II A, we know the matrix Lis
neither symmetric nor orthogonal in general. Instead, itsatisﬁes the condition L>gL¼g, which implies det ðLÞ¼61
andLis invertible. This condition and its equivalent LgL>¼
gtogether generate 12 relations among the elements in L
(not totally independent of course), wherein the followingfour will be used in our proof:
L

13þL2
23¼L2
33/C01; (A2)
L2
31þL2
32¼L2
33/C01; (A3)
L11L31þL12L32¼L13L33; (A4)
L21L31þL22L32¼L23L33: (A5)
To exclude reﬂections from the transformation Eq. (A1),
we ﬁrst rule out those with det ðLÞ¼/C0 1, e.g.,
/C0100
01 0
00 10
@1
A;coshg 0/C0sinhg
0 /C010
/C0sinhg0 cosh g0
@1
A;
and
cosh sinh 0
/C0sinhcosh0
00 /C010
@1
A: (A6)
Then among the L’s with positive determinant, we have to
rule out those with negative L33, which correspond to the
transformations containing both spatial and temporal reﬂec-
tions, e.g.,
/C010 0
010
00 /C010
@1
A;/C0coshg0 sinh g
010
sinhg 0/C0coshg0
@1
A;
and
cosh sinh 0
sinh/C0cosh0
00 /C010
@1
A: (A7)
Since L2
33/C211 according to Eq. (A2) or Eq. (A3), once the
negative part is ruled out, the range of L33is reduced to
½1;1Þ.
In summary, for Eq. (A1) to contain no reﬂection, the
matrix Lhas to satisfy: (i) det ðLÞ¼1 and (ii) L33/C211.12
Equations (A2) and(A3) also tell us that L33¼1 implies
L13¼L23¼L31¼L32¼0, and accordingly Ldegenerates
to a rotation which corresponds to a special case of Eq. (7),

It is obvious that the Euler decomposition is valid for this
degenerate case, but with the result that the parameters/andware not unique.
After we exclude all reﬂections and the degenerate case, a
one-to-one correspondence can be built between Eq. (A1)
and the transformation matrix in Eq. (7)
553 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 7, July 2023 Leehwa Yeh 553 04 October 2023 22:53:47

This correspondence may be achieved through the follow-
ing three steps.
(1) Since L33>1, we can always ﬁnd a unique positive g
such that L33¼coshg, and accordingly sinh g¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2
33/C01p
>0.
(2) Since Eq. (A2) is the same as ð/C0L13Þ2þð /C0 L23Þ2
¼L2
33/C01, a unique w2½0;2pÞexists such that
/C0L13¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2
33/C01q
cosw¼sinhgcosw; (A10)
/C0L23¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2
33/C01q
sinw¼sinhgsinw: (A11)
For the same reason, Eq. (A3) guarantees there is a unique
/2½0;2pÞsuch that
/C0L31¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2
33/C01q
cos/¼sinhgcos/; (A12)
/C0L32¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2
33/C01q
sin/¼sinhgsin/: (A13)
(3) So far we have obtained Eq. (9)which allows us to
determine a unique set ð/;g;wÞby the matrix elements
L13;L23;L31;L32, and L33. What remains is to verify that Eq.
(9)is consistent with the other four relations,
L11¼coshgcoswcos/þsinwsin/;
L12¼coshgcoswsin//C0sinwcos/;
L21¼coshgsinwcos//C0coswsin/;
L22¼coshgsinwsin/þcoswcos/: (A14)
This is equivalent to proving the following four equalities:
L11¼ðL33L13L31þL23L32Þ=ðL2
33/C01Þ;
L12¼ðL33L13L32/C0L23L31Þ=ðL2
33/C01Þ;
L21¼ðL33L23L31/C0L13L32Þ=ðL2
33/C01Þ;
L22¼ðL33L23L32þL13L31Þ=ðL2
33/C01Þ: (A15)
Taking Eqs. (A3) –(A5) into account, these four equalities
can be reduced to the following two:
L21L32/C0L22L31¼/C0L13; (A16)L31L12/C0L32L11¼/C0L23: (A17)
In order to prove Eqs. (A16) and(A17) , we express the
determinant of Las (adopting the summation convention)
detðLÞ¼1
3!/C15ijk/C15pqrLipLjqLkr¼1; (A18)
then transpose one of the two Levi-Civita symbols to the
other side of the equal sign13
/C15pqrLipLjqLkr¼/C15ijk: (A19)
Since L>gL¼gis equivalent to gLg¼ðL>Þ/C01, the above
equality can be transformed to
/C15pqrLipLjq¼/C15ijkðgLgÞkr: (A20)
Both Eqs. (A16) and(A17) are special cases of Eq. (A20) ,
the former corresponds to ðr;i;jÞ¼ð 3;2;3Þand the latter to
ðr;i;jÞ¼ð 3;3;1Þ:Q.E.D.
