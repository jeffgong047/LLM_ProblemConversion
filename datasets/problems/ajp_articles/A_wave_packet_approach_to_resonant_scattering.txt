Resonant transmission occurs when constructive interference results in the complete passage of an
incoming wave through an array of barriers. In this paper, we explore such a scenario with one-dimensional models. We adopt wave packets with ﬁnite width to illustrate the deterioration of
resonance with decreasing wave packet width and suggest an approximate wave function for the
transmitted and reﬂected components, derived from aspects of both the wave packet and plane
wave approaches. A comparison with exact numerical calculations shows excellent agreement and
provides insight into the scattering process.

I. INTRODUCTION
Scattering experiments are one of the most effective
ways of probing matter. Physicists have been throwingprojectiles at objects to learn something a bout the projec-
tile, the object, or the interaction between the two forcenturies.
Over the course of the last century, however, scattering
experiments have been associated more with learning aboutthe object. A classic example is the series of alpha scatteringexperiments by Geiger and Marsden
1with guidance from
Rutherford. In this experiment, alpha particles were used tolearn about the inner structure of the atom. Modern particleaccelerators use higher energy particle beams to probe theinternal structure of the nucleus. Experimenters utilize thesame principle with larger scale targets, be they molecules orsolids, by using x rays or neutron beams. In each case, theincoming energy can be varied, and the scattering proﬁle canbe measured as a function of the angle and outgoing energy.These are all three-dimensional problems, and our under-standing of them is well developed partly because we focuson the simpliﬁed scenario where the incoming and outgoingprojectiles are well-described by a plane wave. In this paper,we move beyond the plane wave approximation to considerincoming and outgoing wave packets. To keep things rela-tively simple, we follow the traditional procedure used in theplane wave approach by ﬁrst restricting ourselves to onedimension. The two- or three-dimensional case is consider-
ably more complicated and is beyond the scope of this
article.
Several recent descriptions of one-dimensional quantum
scattering have emphasized the wave packet approach.

All of this work has explored the conceptual advantages ofreal-time wave packet scattering over the stationary planewave approximation found in standard undergraduate quan-tum texts; in addition, two of these groups have adopted alattice approach. For example, Ref. 5emphasized the differ-
ences with the continuum approach and focused on narrowwave packets. In Ref. 6, one simulation focused on a dimer
(two-impurity) barrier where resonant transmission wasknown to take place and modeled the time-dependent scatter-ing interference. Our group
2,3,6has exploited a remarkable
feature: the lack of spreading for reasonably broad Gaussianwave packets on a lattice for certain wave vectors. Suchwave packets maintain their qualitative characteristics duringpropagation and, therefore, make the effects of the scatteringprocess clearer.In this work, we do two things. First, we generalize the pos-
sibilities for resonant transmission by considering any numberof barriers. Various aspects of this problem have alreadyappeared in the literature
10,11with some variation of what we
consider here, so we will merely provide a brief overview ofthe theory. More speciﬁcally, we consider scattering from aperiodic array of Nidentical impurities/barriers, each spaced
mlattice sites apart. This problem is likely to be more familiar
to the reader in the continuum limit and has been addressedthrough the transfer matrix formalism in Ref. 12.T h et i g h t -
binding limit of various models of this problem on a latticehas also been treated in Refs. 2,3,8,a n d 9. For completeness,
a derivation is presented in the supplementary material. Theresult of this derivation is that, given a barrier conﬁgurationconsisting of Nimpurity potentials, each with strength V,
spaced mlattice spacings apart, then, for a particular disper-
sion relation, there will exist a number of plane waves withﬁxed wave vector that will yield unit transmission and zeroreﬂectance.
However, there is a conceptual shortcoming with a time-
independent plane wave approach: it does not give a com-
plete qualitative understanding of the scattering process,especially during resonant transmission. From a plane wavedescription, we can calculate the transmission and reﬂectioncoefﬁcients, but the components themselves are always planewaves before and after the scattering process. At resonance,the reﬂected component is exactly zero. Using a Gaussian
wave packet that retains its shape under propagation and
nonresonant scattering, we can show that the reﬂected wavepacket proﬁle at resonance is non-zero, contrary to the wavepacket description. It is also no longer Gaussian. Thisreﬂected shape proﬁle is derivable from a plane wavedescription of sufﬁciently broad wave packets.
Therefore, our second goal is to study how the scattering
proﬁle changes when a Gaussian wave-packet with real-space width a<1is used. (As a!1 , we approach the
plane wave description.) In this case, even at resonance, thetransmission will be less than unity, and a reﬂected portionwill appear. We can study the dependence of the reﬂectedportion on the wave packet width. Numerically, we ﬁnd avery peculiar shape for the reﬂected packet, while the trans-mitted portion remains essentially Gaussian. In addition, wederive a closed approximate analytical formula, which worksremarkably well, both in describing the reﬂection and trans-mission, and in giving the detailed form of the scatteredwave packet proﬁle. We examine the validity and limitationsof this approximation by comparing it with exact numerical

solutions. It will be clear that when barriers with extended
spatial structure are used, increasingly wide wave packets
are required to recover the plane wave results.
As mentioned earlier, when the scattering problem is
deﬁned on a lattice, wave packets with a speciﬁc centroidwave vector do not spread with time,
2,3,6unlike the contin-
uum case. The lattice model requires the use of the tight-
binding formalism (see the supplementary material fortechnical details) but allows for a much clearer description
of the scattering process. Senior undergraduate students
should be able to understand the content of this paper andfollow the required numerical work. These students should
also be able to reproduce most of the paper’s content as a
long-term project, assuming they have completed a prerequi-site numerical methods course.
II. PLANE-WAVE SCATTERING ON A LATTICE
FROM A FINITE PERIODIC ARRAY
Following Ref. 6, we adopt as a basis the site representa-
tion, where, using bra-ket notation, each (orthonormal) basis
state, j‘i/C17c
†
‘j0i, represents a particle at position x‘/C17‘a,
with abeing the lattice spacing and ‘being an integer. Here,
c†
‘(c‘) represents the creation (annihilation) operator for a
particle at site ‘, and j0iis the vacuum state, i.e., the
empty lattice state, and ‘is one of Llattice sites. In principle,
L!1 while, in practice, Lis some large integer. We also
adopt periodic boundary conditions.
Initially, we imagine a plane wave impinging from the
left; without barriers this wave would continue unimpededtowards the right. Propagation consists of “hops” from one
site to another, and for simplicity, we consider here nearest-
neighbour hops only. This part of the Hamiltonian consti-tutes the kinetic energy part, denoted by H
0, and is written as
H0¼/C0t0X
‘c†
‘c‘þ1þc†
‘þ1c‘/C16/C17
; (1)
where t0is the hopping amplitude. The eigenstates of
this Hamiltonian alone are Bloch states with wave vector
ka/C172pn=Landnan integer with domain /C0L=2<n/C20L=2.
These eigenstates are given by
c†
k¼1ﬃﬃﬃ
LpX
‘0eik‘0c†
‘0; (2)
where the summation is over all sites. Application of the
hopping Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), to this state conﬁrms that it is
an eigenstate with eigenvalue Ek¼/C02t0cosðkaÞ.
In general, there is a ﬁnite barrier region, starting at site I1.
This barrier consists of None-body potentials arranged peri-
odically with a barrier lattice spacing of ma, where mis a
positive integer. The Nbarriers are localized at sites I1,
I2/C17I1þm,I3/C17I1þ2m,…, IN/C17I1þðN/C01Þm, and the
Hamiltonian describing the interaction with the incomingparticle (described for now as a plane wave) is

where the second equality follows since we assume all bar-
rier strengths to be equal (hence, the barrier has periodicstructure). Since the barrier is ﬁnite, it has a total width given
by

tary material, where appropriate plane wave solutions are
assumed to the left and right of the barrier region (as is donein textbooks in the continuum limit). Using the transfer
matrix formalism (brieﬂy reviewed in the supplementary
material), we ultimately derive the simple result8for the
transmission Ton a lattice with spacing a, of a plane wave
with wave-vector k, through Nbarriers, each mlattice spac-
ings apart, and each with strength V,

quantities are further discussed in the supplementary mate-
rial along with the amplitudes qðkÞandsðkÞ, where R/C17jqj2
andT/C17jsj2. A version of Eq. (6)applicable to free electrons
in the continuum seems to have been ﬁrst derived in Ref. 10
for an array of d-functions, and in Ref. 11for a more general
array; see references therein for earlier related work. See
also Ref. 12for further discussion on transmission in the
continuum limit.
From the general transmission relation Eq. (6),w ec a nc a l c u -
late the barrier parameters for which unit transmission (reso-
nance) occurs. Unit transmission occurs obviously for V¼0,
i.e., no impurities, or when UN/C01ðhkÞ¼0 for a non-zero value
ofV. The non-trivial resonant condition is, therefore,

For a single impurity, N¼1, only the trivial solution exists
since U2
N/C01ðhkÞ¼U2
0ðhkÞ¼1 for all k, hence, no resonance
can occur with a single impurity. For a barrier conﬁgurationwith N/C212 impurities, a potential Vand wave vector kcan
always be found that satisfy Eq. (11)for a given impurity lat-
tice spacing maand number of impurities N.
Examples of transmission across different barriers, of
potential strength V¼1:0t
0, are shown in Fig. 1for selected
values of Nandm. It is clear from Eqs. (10) and(11), and as
shown in Fig. 1, the resonant transmission ( T¼1) is possible
at many different values of the wave vector k, and the num-
ber of these resonant points increases with increasing barrierparameters Nandm. Plots similar to Fig. 1can be found in
many references, for example, Refs. 2,3,8, and 10–12 .
These plots all convey the idea that resonant transmission ispossible at certain energies (i.e., values of wave vector k),
whose values depend on the speciﬁc parameters and details
of the barriers. Students are taught that this is due to con-structive interference effects for a plane wave description.However, how are the resonant transmission and (lack of)reﬂection altered when wave packets are used? Beforeaddressing this question, we brieﬂy review how wave pack-
ets are constructed on a lattice.
III. THE WAVE PACKET DESCRIPTION
As mentioned in the introduction, there are many reasons
to favor a wave packet description of the incoming particle,
not least of which is that it allows exploration of the time-
dependent evolution of the actual scattering event. Wefollow previous prescriptions for such a wave packet descrip-
tion
2,3,6by constructing a set of eigenstates for the
Hamiltonian that is the sum of Eq. (1)and Eq. (3). Then the
eigenstates can be written formally as
jni¼X
‘anðÞ
‘c†
‘j0i; (12)
where aðnÞ
‘are the eigenvector coefﬁcients for the ntheigen-
state with eigenvalue /C15n, both obtained through numerical
matrix diagonalization. It follows that the time-dependentwave packet is

and the initial proﬁle is described by a Gaussian
/x‘ðÞ¼1
2pa2ðÞ1=4e/C01=4x‘/C0x0 ðÞ2=a2þik0x‘/C0x0 ðÞ: (16)
Here, x0andk0are the mean position and mean wave vector
of the wave packet, respectively, and ais the initial uncer-
tainty in position (i.e., spread) of the wave packet. Once the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated, a straightfor-
ward summation in Eq. (14)produces the wave function pro-
ﬁle at any time thereafter.
In general, this summation is relatively straightforward to
implement in an empty lattice (i.e., no barriers whatsoever).
It would give the novice student both the practice required totackle the problem with a barrier in place and the satisfaction
of seeing a moving wave packet in motion [given in Eq.
(14)] that also does not spread if k
0a¼p=2 is used for the
mean wave vector.15–21
One of the primary reasons for using wave packets speciﬁ-
cally deﬁned on a lattice is that a wave vector can be found for
which the intrinsic spreading is essentially eliminated. A verygood approximation to the time-dependent wave function, pre-
viously derived in Refs. 2and3for an empty lattice, is given
byFig. 1. Transmission Tvska=p, across barriers with strength V¼1:0t0and
various values of N,m, and wBas indicated above in the various panels.
Only positive values of k, with range 0 <ka=p<1, are plotted. The energy,
Ek¼/C02t0cosðkaÞ, increases monotonically from /C02t0toþ2t0over this
range. Note the many instances of resonant transmission ( T¼1). As V
changes, the value of the wave vector where resonance will occur will
change according to Eq. (10). Note that ka¼p=2 is special for wave packet
propagation, as spreading with time is limited at this wave vector, given the
nearest-neighbor hopping model we have adopted. Among these six exam-
ples unit transmission is clearly seen to occur at this wave vector for all four
cases beyond the ﬁrst row ( N¼2).

where E0

k0, respectively, refer to the ﬁrst and second
derivatives of the dispersion relation Ekwith respect to wave
vector k, evaluated at k0. For nearest-neighbour hopping, the
dispersion relation is given by Ek¼/C02t0cosðkaÞ. It follows
in this case that the spread of the wave packet, as a functionof time, will be constant for k
0a¼p=2, and is given by the
initial width a.
As an example, in Fig. 2(a)we show a sequence of snap-
shots of a travelling wave packet, with k0a¼p=2, that
encounters two ( N¼2) barriers set side-by-side ( m¼1) at
x‘¼1500 aandx‘¼1501 a. No spreading is predicted to
take place on an empty lattice. Two snapshots ( t¼0 and
t¼250/C22h=t0) are shown before scattering takes place, and
two snapshots ( t¼750/C22h=t0andt¼1000 /C22h=t0) are shown for
times after scattering. “Before” and “after” here are looselydeﬁned and are meant to signify that the wave packet proﬁleis entirely to the left and right of the barrier region, respec-tively, as viewed by eye in such a ﬁgure. Since a Gaussianhas tails this is necessarily a loose deﬁnition. The middlepanel, showing the scattering event as the wave packet strikesthe barrier, displays considerable disruption in the wavepacket. More detailed descriptions of these transient phenom-ena can be found in the simulations in Ref. 6. It should be
clear from the two times chosen before and after the scatteringthat no spreading takes place, as the peak heights remain the
same. In particular, it is true that no spreading takes place in
either the transmitted or reﬂected wave packets. A sizablereﬂectance takes place in Fig. 2(a) of approximately 20%.
From the curve shown in Fig. 1(N¼2,m¼1), it is clear that
the transmission is indeed expected to be approximately 80%for this barrier conﬁguration.
In contrast, in Fig. 2(b) we show snapshots of a wave
packet with k
0a¼2p=3, for which spreading is anticipated
based on Eq. (17). Referring back to Fig. 1(N¼2,m¼1),
we see that unit transmission is anticipated for this wave vec-tor. Sure enough, inspection of Fig. 2(b) shows a small
decrease in amplitude of the wave packet due to spreading astime progresses. Notice that the wave packet travels a little
more slowly than the one in Fig. 2(a)since the group veloc-
ity, v
grðkÞ/C17ð dEk=dkÞ=/C22h¼2t0asinðkaÞ=/C22h, is maximal at
k0a¼p=2. It appears that on this scale, no reﬂectance
occurs, in apparent agreement with Fig. 1(N¼2,m¼1).
A closer look, however, indicates that some reﬂectance
does indeed occur, as is illustrated in Fig. 3, which is a
greatly expanded version of Fig. 2(b). Several characteristics
are of note. First, the reﬂectance is non-zero. In fact, theamount of the wave packet reﬂected is indeed very tiny (seethe scale!) and can readily be adjusted by changing the widthaof the initial wave packet. These results are shown for
a¼50a, but a larger choice of the width awould reduce the
reﬂectance accordingly. Essentially, the spread in wave vec-
tor about k
0a¼2p=3 is inversely proportional to a. The
larger ais, the more the wave packet approaches a mono-
energetic wave packet with only k 0a¼2p=3 and therefore
perfect unit transmission (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 6).Second, the reﬂected component is no longer Gaussian; in
fact it appears to be a split wave packet with the peaks travel-
ling coherently. Third, distorted as these split wave packetsare from the original in Fig. 2(b), they nonetheless retain
their shape as a function of time. Note that because
k
0a¼2p=3, the wave packets do spread slightly with time,
though it is difﬁcult to see on this ﬁgure. For k0a¼p=2,
they do not spread at all, and the split Gaussian remains as it
is for all the times shown. It is this remarkable line-shapethat we want to more fully understand. As we will show in
Sec. III A, this split wave function can be described analyti-
cally by a single function that travels with wave vector k
0.
A. Analytical approach to describe reflected
and transmitted wave packets
The analytical expression for a wave packet in Eq. (17)
follows from an integration over all wave vectors centeredFig. 2. Plots of ajwðx‘;tÞj2as a function of lattice site for ﬁve different times (in
units of /C22h=t0) for (a) off resonance and (b) on resonance. The barrier (vertical
bars) consists of two impurities, each with strength V¼1.0t0located at sites
1500 and 1501, and the wave packet has a¼50a. We have illustrated wave
packets for times well before scattering (the ﬁrst two) and well after scattering
(the last two). The wave-packet is initially centered at x‘¼600a.I np l o t( a )
k0a¼p/2 and no spreading occurs because of the choice of k0, but a signiﬁcant
amount of reﬂection does occur. Note that no spreading occurs after scattering,
in both the transmitted and reﬂected wave packets. In plot (b) k0a¼2p/3 and is
chosen according to the resonance condition Eq. (10)so that no reﬂection should
occur, as appears to be the case here. On the other hand, wave packet broadening
occurs as a function of time, as is (just barely) evident in the decreasing ampli-
tude as a function of time. The actual presence of a small reﬂected component is
shown in Fig. 3 . In both cases, the scattering is elastic and the reﬂected (transmit-
ted) wave packet propagates to the left (right) with the same initial wave vector
magnitude, k0.

around k/C25k0. The spread of the wave packet in real space a
assures that only a small domain of wave vectors ( Dk/1=a)
surrounding k0is required, so that the energy dispersion can
also be expanded around k0.
A similar expansion applies to both transmitted and
reﬂected components (see Eq. (12) in Ref. 3). The reﬂected
component is

: (19)The reﬂectance amplitude can be determined from the plane
wave theory established in Sec. II. Since this is an elastic
scattering event, the reﬂected wave packet travels with thesame energy as before the scattering event but in the nega-tivexdirection. The amplitude /

to have been evaluated for /C0k0, as will be the reﬂectance
amplitude qðkÞand the energy dispersion Ek.
By expanding E(k) and qðkÞin Eq. (18)around /C0k0, using
the ﬁrst order correction of qðkÞand the Gaussian form of

Equation (21) describes a “split” Gaussian function. The
Gaussian is split because of the factor of y2ðtÞthat pre-
cedes the exponential. The lower two panels in Fig. 3
make clear what a split Gaussian looks like. Note that fork

describes a travelling split Gaussian whose width remainsconstant as a function of time for these particular wavevectors.
To understand how well Eq. (21) works, we examine the
reﬂection probability R(k), which is determined from the
reﬂectance amplitude as RðkÞ¼jqðkÞj

amplitude is given by qðkÞ¼M12=M22as deﬁned in the sup-

off(k) for N¼2 and m¼1 is given below. Since we choose

expansion, qðk0Þ/C25q0ðk0Þðk/C0k0Þ, and, therefore,

in the two lowest panels was notvisible in Fig. 2(b). Note also that the reﬂected
wave packet proﬁle ( t¼750/C22h=t0and 1000 /C22h=t0)does not consist of a single
Gaussian wave packet; rather, twopeaks are present for each time, and the
expected centroid of the reﬂecting wave packet is precisely at the node between
the two peaks. The reﬂected wave packet proﬁle, though non-Gaussian, remains

This result is shown for k0a¼2p=3 in Fig. 4(dashed red
curve) since this is the wave vector for resonance to occur
with V¼t0. This approximate expression for the reﬂection
probability clearly compares favorably with the full reﬂec-tion probability R(k) computed from Eq. (9)(solid green
curve) only for a limited range of wave vectors close to k
0.
Going to higher order in k/C0k0is possible and straightfor-
ward. For example, using that fðkÞ/C17vkUN/C01ðhkÞ, for the
case N¼2 and m¼1, we ﬁnd
fðkÞ¼VcoskaðÞþV=2t0/C0/C1

By expanding both cos ðkaÞand sin ðkaÞaround k0in the
above expression, and by using the resonant condition Eq.(10)that gives us cos ðk

where the correction in the next order of aðk/C0k0Þis now
included. Substituting Eq. (27) into Eq. (9), expanding about

results in

which is also shown in Fig. 4as the dotted-dashed blue
curve. This result agrees with the full plane-wave result fromEq.(6)over a more extend range of kvalues around k
0com-
pared to the ﬁrst order result. This correction may be usefulas the wave packet width decreases, requiring more andmore accuracy in the reﬂection coefﬁcient for wave vectorsfurther away from k
0. Nonetheless, in the comparisons that
follow we will use Eq. (25), which corresponds to just the
ﬁrst term in Eq. (28).
B. More detailed comparisons
In general, as the barrier width increases (i.e., as both N
andmincrease), we expect that the accuracy of this approxi-
mation will deteriorate (see Fig. 1). We wish to assess the
analytic expression for the reﬂection probability given by
Eq.(21), for a variety of barriers. For this purpose, we show
in Fig. 5the reﬂection probability as a function of position at
some time (here, t¼1000 /C22h=t0)well after the incoming wave
packet has scattered off the barrier. Note the vertical scale;we are zooming in on a very tiny amount of reﬂected wavepacket. As in Fig. 3, we are using resonant scattering condi-
tions in all cases, (i) N¼3,m¼1, (ii) N¼3,m¼9, (iii)
N¼6,m¼1, and (iv) N¼6,m¼9, but here k
0a¼p=2 and
V¼1:0t0for all barriers. The solid blue curve denotes the
numerical calculation, while the dashed red curve denotesthe analytical approximation given in Eq. (21). As is evident,
when the width of the wave packet agreatly exceeds the
width of the barrier region w
B(cases (i) and (iii)), the
approximation is excellent. As the barrier region width
increases (cases (ii) and (iv)), the approximation begins tofail. Note that we are using k
0a¼p=2, so there is no deterio-
ration of the Gaussian (or split Gaussian in the case of thereﬂected amplitude) as a function of time, and an identicalresult would hold for a later time as well. The accuracy of
the analytical approximation in the two cases where the
extension of the barrier is not so large (ﬁrst and third panels)is remarkable given that the accuracy of the reﬂection proba-bility used is similar to that shown in Fig. 4, and clearly
works on a rather limited range about k
0.
More general conditions for resonance can be readily
determined. For example, for V¼t0, there is a resonant
transmission that occurs at k0a¼p=2 in all cases in which m
is odd. A straightforward expansion of f(k) [deﬁned follow-
ing Eq. (9)] for modd, V¼t0andk0a¼p=2 results in
fðkÞ/C25/C0 2maðk/C0k0Þfor N¼3; (29)
fðkÞ/C25/C0 4maðk/C0k0Þfor N¼6; (30)
and similar formulas can be derived for other cases.
As expected, the agreement indeed deteriorates both as N
increases and as mincreases, as is apparent in Fig. 5(a).A t
the same time, we should remind the reader that we are cap-turing a tiny reﬂected component, so in some sense the sec-ond and fourth panels still show excellent qualitativeagreement. For example, the fact that the original simple
Gaussian wave packet shape has now been divided into a
split Gaussian is captured magniﬁcently by the approximateresult shown here, based on Eq. (21).
To illustrate how improved agreement can be obtained
systematically with increasing wave packet width, we showin Fig. 5(b) the results from Fig. 5(a), but now for the wider
wave packet with a¼200a. There is clear quantitative
improvement for all panels, most evident in the second and
fourth panels. Clearly one of the issues with the poorer
agreement in Fig. 5(a)is that the barrier width is comparable
to the width of the wave packet. For example in the fourthpanel the barrier width w
Bis 45 a, which is very close to the
width of the wave packet a¼50athat is used. With a waveFig. 4. Plot of the reﬂection probability R(k)v s ka=p(solid green curve).
Also shown for comparison is the ﬁrst order correction (Eq. (25), dotted red
curve) along with the next order correction (Eq. (28), dotted-dashed blue
curve). The range of agreement is clearly extended by the next order correc-
tion. The parameters here are k0a¼2p=3,V¼t0,N¼2, and m¼1.

packet width of a¼200a, we arrive at a situation where the
wave packet width is much greater than any length scaleassociated with the barrier, and of course, for still larger val-ues of athe agreement with the numerical results improves
still further.
Conversely, for smaller values of a, the agreement deterio-
rates considerably. In Fig. 6, we show the same four cases as
in Figs. 5(a) and5(b), but now with a¼5a. Even for just
three barriers (located at sites 1500, 1501, and 1502), there isno remnant of a split Gaussian, and in fact there is even adeterioration of the lineshape as a function of time,indicating that the expansion behind the analytical derivation
of Eq. (17) has lost its validity. The approximate result pro-
vided in Eq. (21) is shown in the ﬁrst panel only (dashed red
curve) and is qualitatively incorrect. The results for such anarrow wave packet cannot be described with the help of the
plane wave theory, as scattering events at the individual
components of the barriers are disconnected, and can no lon-ger interfere with one another.
IV. SUMMARY
We have formulated the one-dimensional scattering prob-
lem on a lattice to study the effect of a non-inﬁnite wave
packet width on the transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients.
As much as possible, we have focused on the wave vectork
0a¼p=2 so that the Gaussian wave packet that we use
retains the same width for extended periods of time. We
emphasize that having a constant width as a function of time

place at the barrier, as a function of lattice site for t¼1000 /C22h=t0for (a), and
t¼1750 /C22h=t0for (b), and the various barrier conﬁgurations as indicated in
the panels. The barrier, consisting of Npotentials with V¼1:0t0, starts at
x¼1500 ain (a) and at x¼3000 ain (b) (both off-scale to the right). The
results are determined both numerically (solid blue curves) and analytically
through Eq. (21) (dashed red curves). The wave packet has k0a¼p=2, and
starts at t¼0 from x0¼600awith a¼50ain (a), and from x0¼1000 a
witha¼200ain (b). In all these cases the transmission resonance condition
is satisﬁed (see Eq. (10)). Note that the vertical scale is different in various
panels and requires a multiplication by the value multiplying y. For
example, in the upper left panel the actual vertical scale values indicated are
1:5/C210/C06and 4 :5/C210/C06, while in the upper right panel they would be
1:5/C210/C08and 4 :5/C210/C08, and similarly for the other panels. These are all
very small, consistent with the expectation that these components are nomi-
nal. All analytical results are in qualitative agreement with numerical ones
and quantitatively improve as the wave packet width is increased with
respect to the barrier length.Fig. 6. As Fig. 5but now for a narrower wave packet with a¼5a. As before
we show only the reﬂected components of ajwðx‘;tÞj2as a function of the
lattice site for t¼1000 /C22h=t0and the various barrier conﬁgurations as shown.
The barrier starts at x¼1500 a(off-scale to the right). The results are deter-
mined both numerically (solid blue curves) and analytically through Eq.
(21) (dashed red curve in the ﬁrst panel). The reﬂected portion is still small,
though the vertical scale is now several orders of magnitude higher than in
Fig.5. The numerical results have signiﬁcantly distorted shapes and can no
longer be described by split Gaussian wave packets.

is an approximate result based on a Taylor expansion in the
exponential, but the numerical results presented in this paperdo not use this approximation, and nevertheless demonstratethis characteristic for the time scales involved in the scatter-ing process. This makes the use of these wave packets ahelpful tool, since all changes can be attributed to the scatter-ing process, and notto the general time evolution of the
wave packet itself. Moreover, conceptually, it is easier tothink of these wave packets as the particles used in the beamexperiment — they actually move towards and scatter offand move away from the target as a function of time. This isin contrast to the plane wave description, where time has dis-appeared from the problem, and incoming, scattering andoutgoing particles appear to the novice to be present at alltimes and in all places in a sort of steady-state condition.
We also focused on barrier potentials that result in resonant
transmission for a mono-energetic plane wave, namely,
V¼t
0for the four cases considered in the last three ﬁgures.
Then any reﬂection can be attributed to the fact that a ﬁnitewidth wave packet was used in the scattering process. Wefound numerically that a minute amount was reﬂected, but thereﬂected component had a well-deﬁned and peculiar splitGaussian proﬁle. Based on these results we devised anapproximation for the reﬂected component, Eq. (21) which,
when combined with a simple approximation for the reﬂectiv-ity as a function of wave vector, yields excellent results com-pared to the exact numerical results. For reasonably largewave packet widths, we ﬁnd quantitative agreement for thereﬂected wave proﬁle, and a good understanding of its accu-racy based on the initial Gaussian width. In this way a combi-nation of plane wave-based reﬂection coefﬁcients (Fig. 1),
together with analytical wave packet dynamics allows us amore insightful understanding of the time dependence of scat-tering from simple barriers. At the same time, for wave pack-ets whose width is less than the characteristic barrier lengthscale, the scattering description in terms of plane wavesbreaks down completely, as the results of Fig. 6show.
