Projectile motion with quadratic drag
John L. Bradshaw
91(4), p. 258
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0095643Projectile motion with air resistance is a staple topic of
dynamics courses. If the resisting force is proportional to theinstantaneous speed (Stokes drag), the equations of motioncan be solved explicitly for velocity and position as a func-tion of time, but this is not possible if the force is propor-tional to the square of the speed (Newtonian drag); one mustthen invoke numerical methods. However, if the equations ofmotion are formulated in terms of the angle between theinstantaneous velocity vector and the horizontal direction, itis possible to solve analytically for the velocity components
in the case of Newtonian drag, although position components
must still be obtained numerically. This paper explores thisangular formulation and presents numerical examples forbaseball-sized objects. Corresponding spreadsheets are madeavailable for student use. Appropriate for intermediate-leveldynamics students.
A charge analysis of non-invasive electrical brain
stimulation
Maurice M. Klee
91(4), p. 264
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0085625Instructors looking for new applications to teach in their
electricity and magnetism courses will enjoy reading this anal-ysis of charges and electric ﬁelds in the brain. The simplecomputational model can form the basis of student problemsand projects and could also be used in a non-calculus-based
course for students interested in biology and medicine.
Electromagnetic induction: how the “flux rule” has
superseded Maxwell’s general law
Giuseppe Giuliani
91(4), p. 278
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0138144In the second volume of his 1873 Treatise , James Clerk
Maxwell derived a general law of electromagnetic inductionto explain the phenomenon discovered by Michael Faraday
in 1831. However, most courses and textbooks on electro-magnetism explain induction through the so-called “ﬂux
rule,” which states that the induced electromotive force in a
circuit is determined by the time-variation of the magnetic
ﬂux going through the circuit ðe¼/C0 d=dtÐÐ~B/C1~dSÞ.
However, the “ﬂux rule” is not a physical law (it is non-local), and it isn’t even true in all circumstances. Instead,
Maxwell’s general law is a genuine physical law, provided
one considers the motion of the charge carriers, whichMaxwell did not know existed. This article aims to
rehabilitate Maxwell’s general law and to understand why
it has been mostly forgotten. Appropriate for history of
science classes or for an interlude on the foundations of
electromagnetism.
Modeling the frequency response of an acoustic cavity
using the method of images
Frank Rice, Teresa Riedel, and Isaiah Curtis
91(4), p. 288
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0124415Most instructors are familiar with the method of images as
a beautiful trick to solve boundary condition problems in
electrostatics. But did you know that the same trick can be
used to model the frequency response of a resonant cavity?
This paper describes how students can measure and analyze
this frequency response as part of a multi-week laboratoryproject. Parts of the analysis can be done fairly simply, and it
can also be extended to challenge even the most advanced
students.
Fundamental properties of beamsplitters in classical
and quantum optics
Masud Mansuripur and Ewan M. Wright
91(4), p. 298
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0102760Beamsplitters are fundamental elements of quantum optics
experiments, and, as shown in demonstrations such as the
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference dip, their behavior can behighly counter-intuitive (see the next paper by DiBrita and
Galvez). This paper derives magnitude and phase relations
between probability amplitudes and applies them to under-stand the behavior of photon-number states incident on
beamsplitters, showing that the result is consistent with the
standard treatment using photon creation and annihilation
operators. This manuscript will be highly useful to teachers
of quantum optics.

The Hong–Ou–Mandel experiment demonstrates funda-
mental quantum-mechanical concepts such as wavefunctionsymmetry and particle indistinguishability. In this quantum-optics experiment, when two photons entering separatebeamsplitter input ports are made indistinguishable in allpossible ways, the interference of probability amplitudesresults in both photons always leaving the same beamsplitteroutput port. This paper presents a simpliﬁed version of theHong–Ou–Mandel experiment that is suitable for the under-graduate instructional laboratory. The use of a ﬁber-coupledbeamsplitter greatly simpliﬁes the required optical align-ments and waveplates and a translation stage are used tovary the distinguishability of the photons. The paper presentsa theoretical description of the experimental effect at theintroductory quantum mechanics level, along with a discus-sion of the apparatus alignment procedure.
An economical smoke chamber and light-sheet
microscope system for experiments in fluid dynamicsand electrostatics
Karl D. Stephan
91(4), p. 316
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0122766A new idea for an advanced lab: imaging particles of
MgO in a smoke chamber. An inexpensive apparatus allowsstudents to explore Brownian motion and particle agglomer-
ation, and it could be extended to other topics such as lami-
nar and turbulent ﬂow. This laboratory exercise would be
especially interesting for astronomy students who are study-ing the process by which particles clump together in the
early stages of planet formation. A video abstract accompa-
nies the online version of this paper.
Eccentricity and orientation of Earth’s orbit
from equinox and solstice times
B. Cameron Reed
91(4), p. 324
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0127980The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit can be estimated
using the lengths of time between solstices and equinoxes.This analysis takes advantage of the fact that the eccentricity
is small in order to greatly simplify the calculation.
