Why and how to implement worked examples in upper
division theoretical physics
Philipp Scheiger, Holger Cartarius, and Ronny Nawrodt
91(10), p. 764
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.015612Some of the problem-solving techniques that we teach in
upper-level physics require students to follow somewhat for-
mulaic procedures. These techniques include setting up aproblem in Lagrangian mechanics, solving boundary-value
problems in electrostatics, and ﬁnding the time evolution of
non-stationary wave functions. For learning to solve thesesorts of problems, the authors show that a four-step method
of using worked examples can be very beneﬁcial.
Supplementary material includes useful background on cog-nitive load theory and a set of worked examples for
Lagranian mechanics.
Damped harmonic oscillator revisited: The fastest route
to equilibrium
Karlo Lelas, Nikola Poljak, and Dario Jukic ´
91(10), p. 767
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0112573Just when you thought you fully understood the damped
harmonic oscillator, this article may surprise and delight
you. Students and instructors will be intimately familiar with
the claim that a critically damped harmonic oscillator returnsto equilibrium more quickly than all others. While this is
true in an idealized and asymptotic sense, the situation is
more subtle if experimental resolution is taken into consider-ation. If we only require the oscillations to drop below a
given threshold, a particular underdamped oscillator is more
efﬁcient than the critically damped one. This paper discussesthis optimal damping coefﬁcient, how to ﬁnd it, what advan-
tage it offers over the critically damped oscillator, and
explores a variety of other fascinating avenues.
An analysis of the large amplitude simple pendulum
using Fourier series
Brennen Black and Vetri Vel
91(10), p. 776
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0130943The authors start with an excellent question: since pendu-
lums exhibit periodic motion, why not use the Fourier series
to analyze their motion outside the small-amplitude approxi-
mation? Undaunted by the realization that normally we needto know the frequency in advance in order to use the Fourier
series, they proceed to develop a creative approach that not
only leads to accurate approximations but also—in thehigher-order corrections—lets instructors introduce students
to perturbation analysis.
A magnetic field based on Ampe `re’s force law
Chananya Groner, Timothy M. Minteer, and Kirk T.
McDonald
91(10), p. 783
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0134722When I teach magnetic ﬁelds, currents, and cross products to
introductory students, I sometimes ﬁnd students staring at me,thinking, “Why is she making this so hard? Surely there mustbe an easier way to formulate these ﬁelds and forces!” In this
paper, the authors explore a different formulation of magnetic
ﬁelds that could have been developed when electromagnetism
was studied in the 19th century. Students may be disappointed
to learn that it’s not easier. However, the paper presents an
interesting alternate history for the development of electromag-netism, and, in reading that alternate history, readers will gainmuch information about the actual history. Additionally,
instructors who want to create new problems in vector calculus
will ﬁnd many excellent examples in this paper.
Acceptable solutions of the radial Schr €odinger equation
for a particle in a central potential
J. Etxebarria
91(10), p. 792
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0141536This paper presents a new argument for why the radial
part of the wave function cannot diverge at the origin.
Complementarity and entanglement in a simple model
of inelastic scattering
David Kordahl
91(10), p. 796
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0141389The interaction of a particle or beam with a harmonic oscilla-
tor is treated in three ways: classically, with a quantized har-
monic oscillator, and with both the beam and the harmonicoscillator quantized. Since these situations can all be solved
without advanced mathematical methods, this interaction pro-
vides quantum mechanics students an excellent opportunity toexplore both complementarity and entanglement.
Scattering of identical particles by a one-dimensional
Dirac delta function barrier potential: The role of
statistics
P. R. Berman and Alberto G. Rojo
91(10), p. 805
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0139531The authors present a wave packet analysis of 1-D scatter-
ing that illustrates the important role of particle statistics -

boson versus fermion - even for noninteracting particles.
Two identical particles incident on a delta-function barrierfrom opposite directions are scattered in the same directionif they are bosons or in opposite directions if they are fer-mions. The analysis is appropriate for a ﬁrst course in quan-tum mechanics. A Mathematica notebook allows readers toexplore the model.
Treating disorder in introductory solid state physics
Dunkan Mart /C19ınez, Yuriko Baba, and Francisco Dom /C19ınguez-
Adame
91(10), p. 812
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0133701In 1977, Ph ilip Anderson won the Nobel Prize in physics for
his seminal study of electron transport in disordered lattices.Disordered systems exhibit many interesting and importantproperties, including electron localization, band-splitting, andmetal-insulator transitions. However, because of the lack oftranslational symmetry, the standard theoretical analysis ofthese materials is quite complex and – up until now – beyondthe scope of undergraduate coursework in solid state physics.Starting from the tight-binding approximation, the authorsdevelop the coherent potential approximation and use this tool
to ﬁnd the electron density of states in 1-D binary alloys. Thisis all accomplished without advanced mathematical techniques,making it highly instructional and suitable for inclusion inintroductory solid-state courses.
All objects and some questions
Charles H. Lineweaver and Vihan M. Patel
91(10), p. 819
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0150209This manuscript presents an overview of the thermal his-
tory of the Universe and the sequence of objects (e.g., pro-tons, planets, and galaxies) that condensed out of thebackground as the Universe expanded and cooled. Its“Figures of Everything” are especially detailed, colorful, andwell presented. The is valuable not only to instructors butalso to professionals because it so strikingly provides anoverview of how the Universe has evolved, allowing physi-cists to see the big picture through its carefully constructedﬁgures in addition to its well written text. A video abstractaccompanies the online version of this paper.
On numerical solutions of the time-dependent
Schr €odinger equation
Wytse van Dijk
91(10), p. 826
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0159866This paper discusses how an explicit algorithm can be
implemented for numerically solving the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation to arbitrary levels of precision.Numerical examples of how the algorithm works are givenfor several systems.
Generalized Gaussian integrals with application to the
Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation
Krzysztof Byczuk and Paweł Jakubczyk91(10), p. 840
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0141045Graduate-level courses in statistical and many-body physics
make use of Gaussian integrals, especially in the Hubbard-
Stratonovich transformation. This paper ﬁlls a hole in standard
textbooks, providing a careful derivation of the transformation.
An undergraduate physics experiment to measure the
frequency-dependent impedance of inductors using an
Anderson bridge
Andrew James Murray and Carl Hickman
91(10), p. 847
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0148114Electronics instructors are surely familiar with the
Wheatstone bridge, but they may not be familiar with theAnderson bridge that enables measurements of inductance. Theauthors show how to incorporate this measurement technique in
a laboratory class and also show how it can be used to measure
and understand nonlinearities in inductors that occur due toskin depth, winding proximity, eddy currents, and core effects.
A note on combined sliding and rolling friction
Rod Cross
91(10), p. 855
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0149826Kinetic friction with sliding objects and the behavior of
rolling objects are standard fare for introductory-leveldynamics students. It is rare, however, to encounter problems
where both phenomena are in play simultaneously. This
paper reports video analysis of images of billiard balls pro-jected on a ﬂat felt surface by using a cue to give the balls asmall amount of backspin so that they slide for a couple
tenths of a second before beginning pure rolling motion.
Results are consistent with a model where the coefﬁcient offriction is treated as including two contributions, a rolling
component and a part that depends on the acceleration of the
contact point of the ball with the surface. Appropriate forintroductory and intermediate-level dynamics students.
The emergence of classical mixtures from an entangled
quantum state
Mark G. Kuzyk
91(10), p. 858
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0063636Much of the formulation of many-body quantum mechan-
ics was done in the context of closed quantum systems, in
which coupling of the system under consideration to its envi-ronment is ignored. However, analysis and design of quan-
tum technologies typically require an open quantum systems
formalism, which relies on the density matrix. Though thisfull formalism is clearly a topic for upper-level students, thegrowing importance of quantum information makes it advis-
able to introduce key concepts like entanglement in introduc-
tory quantum courses. This note suggests a similarintroductory pedagogical approach to the density matrix
through a simple exercise that shows how apparent classical
mixtures arise through entanglement of a system to itsenvironment.
