The most important parameters in the study of low-energy scattering are the s-wave and p-wave
scattering lengths and the s-wave effective range. We solve the scattering problem and ﬁnd two useful
formulas for the scattering length and the effective range for any angular momentum, as long as theWigner threshold law holds. Using that formalism, we obtain a set of useful formulas for the angular-
momentum scattering parameters of four different model potentials: hard-sphere, soft-sphere,
spherical well, and well-barrier potentials. The behavior of the scattering parameters close to Feshbachresonances is also analyzed. Our derivations can be useful as hands-on activities for learning scattering
theory.

I. INTRODUCTION
The natural way to learn about the forces acting between
particles is to observe their mutual interaction. Most of whatwe know about the micro-world has been established by means
of collision processes. In physics, a well-studied collision pro-
cess is the scattering of an incident particle from a stationarytarget. A free particle (or rather a beam of such particles) withknown characteristics collides with a target particle, interactswith it, and scatters into a modiﬁed free state. One then mea-sures the energy, angular distribution, and other characteristicsof the scattered beam and infers from them the nature andstrength of the forces which, during the collision, actedbetween the projectile and the target.
1In the theoretical analy-
sis of a scattering process, the asymptotic free states of the
scattered particles are the most relevant. Therefore, it is notnecessary to give an interpretation, or even to have a detailedknowledge, of the state vector of the entire system when theparticles are close and interact strongly. This remark is impor-tant in connection with quantum ﬁeld theory, where the inter-pretation of the states of strongly interacting ﬁelds is extremelydifﬁcult, if possible at all. However, it is relatively easy to dis-
cuss the asymptotic free states.
1
Low-energy scattering parameters are fundamental in the
theoretical description of interacting many-body systems. Bylow-energy, we mean that the energy of the particles is muchsmaller than the typical excitation energy of the target. Theequations of state of dilute Bose and Fermi gases depend onthese parameters, which account for the full inter-atomicpotential if the density is low enough;
2,3that is, the range of
the interaction is much smaller than the interparticle distance
/C24q/C01=3. In particular, the so-called universal regime is the one
in which the interaction is fully described by a single parame-ter, the s-wave scattering length. In the universal regime, any
potential with the same scattering length gives the sameenergy, independently of its particular shape. However, whenthe density of the system is increased, effects of the shape ofthe potential arise, and we need to consider more scatteringparameters such as the s-wave effective range. In some recent
studies, these effects have been reported.
4,5In this work, we
ﬁnd both scattering lengths and effective ranges. This leads toa kind of inverse problem; that is, we know a few scatteringparameters of the physical system and the goal is to ﬁnd amodel potential with the same scattering parameters. Then, we
can use this model potential to study the many-body propertiesof the system. Obviously, the solution is not unique, and model
potentials as simple as possible are sought for this purpose.
This paper presents a well-detailed method that leads to
integral expressions that allow the calculation of the scatter-
ing parameters for any angular momentum of the system, as
long as the Wigner threshold law holds, that is, potentialsdecaying at large r faster than 1 =r
nwith n>2lþ3 for each
partial wave. This procedure is not only useful for research-
ers who want to know the value of the scattering parametersbut also for students learning scattering theory. The scatter-
ing problem has been widely studied, and there are many
procedures leading to similar expressions. Bethe found theexpressions for l¼0 scattering,
6and the generalization for
any angular momentum lwas done by Madsen in 2002.7
We show that the low-energy scattering parameters can be
accurately calculated by an integral equation method, allowing
their determination for any angular momentum. Using this result,
we discuss some properties of the scattering parameters around aFeshbach resonance.8The Feshbach resonance occurs when the
energy of a scattering state is very close to the energy of a bound
state and the scattering length diverges. When the divergence iscrossed, a bound state appears. We apply the formulas for getting
analytical results of the angular momentum scattering lengths
and effective ranges for the following potentials: hard-sphere,soft-sphere, spherical well, and well-barrier potential.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec. IIintro-
duces basic relations for low-energy scattering. Section III
contains the derivation of the formalism for the calculationof the scattering length and effective range for any angular
momentum l. In Sec. IV, the behavior of the parameters and
the Feshbach resonance are addressed. Section Vis orga-
nized around the four considered potentials: Subsection VA
corresponds to the hard-sphere potential, Subsection VB to
the soft-sphere potential, Subsection VC to the spherical
well potential, and Subsection VDto the well-barrier poten-
tial. Finally, the main conclusions are discussed in Sec. VI.
II. LOW-ENERGY SCATTERING
The study of low-energy scattering events requires the
characterization of scattering parameters such as the

scattering lengths and ranges. One convenient approach to
ﬁnd these parameters is to study the phase shift due to theeffect of a potential. We need to have in mind that the
phase shift is related to the scattering parameters as they
contain information of the potential. Consider two wavesthat are initially in phase. One wave is sent through aninteracting system (or interacts with a target), while the
other is sent through free sp ace. When the ﬁrst wave
emerges from the interacting system (or target), it will nolonger be in phase with the second wave. Thus, we candescribe a relation between the potential associated with aninteracting system and the phase shift such a system
imparts on particles. Due to that, the relations we will ﬁnd
will depend on the potential and the wave function, bothknown quantities.
This is precisely what we will ﬁnd in this section.
Afterwards, we will see that if we expand the expression ofthe phase shift for low energies, the coefﬁcients of the expan-
sion are the scattering parameters, which are obviously related
to the potential. We begin with the radial Schr €odinger equa-
tion for a central potential V(r),

and UðrÞ¼2lVðrÞ=/C22h2,lbeing the
reduced mass and ulðrÞthe reduced radial wave function.
When there is no potential and the energy is zero, the solu-tion of Eq. (1)is just a combination of power functions

lðrÞ¼Nrlþ1þMr/C0l ½/C138 ; (2)
with NandMbeing two integration constants to determine.
If the potential is zero but the energy is not, the wave func-tion is a combination of spherical Bessel functions
u
lðrÞ¼ArjlðkrÞþBrn lðkrÞ; (3)
with AandBbeing two integration constants to determine.
The boundary condition that we will always apply is that thewave function must vanish at r¼0. This must happen
because we are using the reduced wave function, deﬁned as
rR(r), where R(r) is the radial part of the true wave function.
If we want R(r) to be ﬁnite at the origin, u
lð0Þmust be zero.
Ifulð0Þ¼0, then B¼0. We recall that the spherical Bessel
function nlðkrÞis divergent at the origin, while jlðkrÞis ﬁnite.
Then ulðrÞreduces to
ulðrÞ¼ArjlðkrÞ: (4)
At large distances, the potential can be neglected, letting us
more easily compare the solutions in order to ﬁnd the phase
shift. Equation (3)is the wave coming out from an interact-
ing system at large distances as it is the general solution,while Eq. (4)is the wave coming out from the non-
interacting system with the boundary condition explained
above as in this case the wave function exists in all the space.As we want to compare what happens at large distance, weneed to know the asymptotic behavior of the Bessel func-tions for large values of kr,

we will determine later on.
The phase shift dis determined by considering that the
large-distance solution of the interacting system is the sameas the solution with no potential at the origin but with an
additional phase. Hence, we include it in Eq. (4)

In Eq. (8), we use /C22Ainstead of Ato keep the constant Acom-

If we compare Eqs. (7)and(8), we can see that B1¼cosd;
B2¼/C0sind, and /C22N¼/C22A. Therefore, the large-distance solu-
tion of the interacting system in terms of the phase shift is
ulðrÞ¼ /C22Nr j lðkrÞcosd/C0nlðkrÞsind ½/C138 : (9)
We need to be sure that the constant /C22Nmakes this solution
(9)compatible with the zero-energy solution (2). We want
this because we want our large-distance solution to be also
valid at zero energy. To this end, we introduce the x!0
expansions of the Bessel functions, with xbeing a generic

This expansion (Eq. (14)) is already known, and it can be

want Eq. (14) to be ﬁnite, the cotangent must diverge. In Eq.
(14),alis the scattering length, and reff
lis the effective range.
Right now, the scattering parameters are only the coefﬁcients
of the expansion; later on, at the end of Sec. IIIand in Sec.
IV, we will give them a physical meaning. Although we
have introduced here the expansion of the cotangent without
proving it, we show that the tangent, and hence the cotan-
gent, can be expanded in the manner of Eq. (14) at the begin-
ning of Sec. IIIin Eq. (33). However, we point out that Eq.
(14) is not usually deﬁned as we have done. In some of the
references given above, it is written as
k2lþ1cotd/C25/C01

The reason why we do not use Eq. (15) is the fact that a/C3

ing parameters do not have dimensions of length. However,
using Eq. (14),alandreff
lalways have dimensions of length.
Additionally, we factor out Bl=Albecause we want al¼R
for any lin the case of a hard-sphere potential with diameter
R(see Sec. II of supplementary material II12). As we men-
tioned right below Eq. (14), the scattering parameters are the
coefﬁcients of the expansion: alis the coefﬁcient of the zero
order term, and reff
lis the one proportional to k2. If we invert
equation (14) and we apply the limit k!0, we can ﬁnd M,

The next step is to relate the phase shift dto the potential

With expression (27) we can know the phase shift, but we

Therefore, we calculate the cotangent from expression (27)
by considering an expansion. First, we consider that the tan-

III. SCATTERING PARAMETERS
In this section, we will ﬁnd the expressions for the scatter-
ing parameters in terms of the potential and the wave func-
tion. In Eq. (28), we split the expression of the tangent into
two terms, one proportional to k2lþ1and another proportional
tok2lþ3, whose coefﬁcients have been found at the end of
Sec. II. Now, we break Eq. (27) in two parts in order to com-
pare both expressions and ﬁnd the coefﬁcients, hence ﬁndingthe scattering parameters.
Everything done in this section is under the assumption of
a regular potential, that is, a potential with no divergences
(except at the origin) that decays faster than 1 =r
nwith n
>2lþ3 for each partial wave at inﬁnity (Wigner threshold).
We will break the integral
tand¼/C0Alklþ1ð1

in two parts in order to obtain terms proportional to k2lþ1and
k2lþ3. To this end, we expand the Bessel function (Eq. (10))

of the expansion. The series (32) has only even terms. The
odd terms are zero because the radial Schr €odinger equation
depends on kask2, causing ulðr;kÞ¼ulðr;/C0kÞ. With this,
one obtains

For any l, the integrand vanishes in the limit r!1 since in
this limit the wave function squared matches the power func-tions. If the wave function were to have this behavior every-
where, not only at inﬁnity, the effective range would be zero.
As, in general, this is not the case, the effective range takes
into account the separation between the true solution and the
dominant terms of the large distance scattering solution.
The above formulas are equivalent to the ones found by

Our expressions for the effective range are simpler to use
than the ones from Ref. 7(our Eq. (54)), since they only
include integrals that converge, whereas Eq. (54) addition-
ally requires setting the limits k!0 and R!1 . Apart
from that, the effective ranges are deﬁned in two slightly dif-
ferent ways (see Sec. III of supplementary material I12).

IV. RESONANCE SCATTERING
In this section, we discuss the meaning of positive and
negatives values of the scattering length and when divergen-ces appear.
For any l, the scattering length is the point where the
large-distance behavior of the wave function extrapolates to
94 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 J. Pera and J. Boronat 94 04 October 2023 22:49:11
a value of zero, as seen in Fig. 1. This fact comes from the
large distance solution ulðrÞ¼rlþ1/C0a2lþ1
lr/C0l.I f r¼al,
ulðrÞis zero. This picture allows us to have an idea about the
scattering length without looking at the explicit formulas.For example, if the potential is repulsive, then at distancesclose to the origin the wave function will be small, and as wemove away from it, the wave function will increase. We willhave a concave up function and, thus, the intersection of thelarge-distance solution with the horizontal axis will be posi-tive. This can also be veriﬁed looking at Eq. (55): if all the
terms inside the integral are positive, the integral, and hencea
l, will be positive.
The case of attractive potentials is richer than that of
repulsive potentials since the strength of the attractive poten-tial must be considered. Weakly attractive potentials exhibitthe opposite behavior of repulsive potentials. In the weakly
attractive case, the tendency to be near the origin is larger,
making the wave function to be concave down with a nega-tive scattering length. If we increase the strength of thepotential, the concavity will decrease, and the scatteringlength will become more negative. Once we reach a criticalvalue of the potential, the intersection distance will be atnegative inﬁnity. This point is particularly interesting, andwe will comment on it later on (Feshbach resonance). Aftercrossing this point, the scattering length becomes divergent,but at positive inﬁnity. From this situation, the evolution willbe the same as the one we have explained: With increasingpotential, the scattering length will start to diminish, willbecome zero, and then will start approaching negative inﬁn-ity. After crossing the divergence, the cycle will be repeated.This process is illustrated in Fig. 1, where we plot four casesusing a soft-sphere potential for Fig. 1(a) and a spherical-
well potential for Figs. 1(b),1(c), and 1(d). The ﬁrst case
(1(a)) corresponds to a repulsive potential and the intersec-tion with the raxis is positive. In Figs. 1(b),1(c), and 1(d),
we plot the wave function for three attractive potentials ofincreasing strength in order to show the regimes explainedabove. In Fig. 1(b), the potential is weak, and we have not
reached the critical value. In Fig. 1(c), we have crossed the
Feshbach resonance. In Fig. 1(d), we show a case which is
before the second Feshbach resonance.
We want to analyze the critical point, that is, the situation
in which the scattering length diverges, going from negativeto positive inﬁnity. The Schr €odinger equation always has
two kind of solutions: scattering states and bound states.Scattering states can have any positive energy and at inﬁnitybehave like a non-normalizable wave. Bound states form a
discrete set of solutions that have negative energy, vanish at
inﬁnity, and are normalizable. Upon increasing the strengthof an attractive potential, as bound states are discrete, therewill be certain values in which a scattering state withvery low energy will become a bound state with negativeenergy close to zero. As bound states vanish at inﬁnity, theycannot be described with the large-distance solution(u
lðrÞ¼rlþ1/C0a2lþ1
lr/C0l) that we have used to this point. The
large-distance solution of a bound state is Nr/C0l, with N¼0i f
l¼0. In order to be able to normalize the mode, the term
a2lþ1
lr/C0lshould dominate rlþ1. This anomaly causes the scat-
tering length to diverge. In fact, in this very limit (called theunitary limit), the scattering length is undeﬁned because itcan be61. This process in which a scattering state transi-
tions to a bound state as the scattering length diverges from
Fig. 1. The wave functions (solid blue lines) are shown for four different potentials, along with linear approximations to their behavior at large r(orange dotted
lines). The point at which the linear approximation crosses zero yields the value of the scattering length, a0. The potentials are all zero for r>1 and take the
values V0¼20,/C02,/C05, and /C021.5 for r<1.

negative to positive inﬁnity due to an increasingly attractive
potential is called a Feshbach resonance.8
This divergent behavior around certain values of the
potential can be modelled if we Taylor-expand the inverse of
the scattering length around these values

Feshbach resonances appear when the energy of a scatter-
ing state matches the energy of a bound state. Although in
the procedure explained above, we have crossed the reso-nance by means of increasing the strength of the potential,
we can leave the potential unchanged and make use of exter-
nal sources such as magnetic ﬁelds to vary the effective
interaction and cross the resonance either-way. Magnetically
tunable Feshbach resonances are very important in ultracold
quantum gases. Their use provides means of varying the
scattering length almost at will.13For instance, one can go
from a Fermi gas with pairing (BCS) with a<0t oa
Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) with a>0 by crossing a
Feshbach resonance.14
As we have found a compact formula for the effective
range, it is interesting to explore the behavior of the effective
range whenever alis zero or 61. The case al¼0 is only
interesting from a mathematical point of view. Physically, it
is not relevant because what matters is the product of reff
l
times a2lþ2
l. This product is the constant c2introduced in
Sec. II, which is one of the coefﬁcients of the expansion of
the tangent of the phase shift. On the other hand, the case
al¼61is physically important, since this corresponds to
the behavior around the Feshbach resonance. To this end, wewrite a compact expression of r

V. EXAMPLES
In this section, we apply the scattering formalism to obtain
the scattering length and effective ranges of model potentials
96 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 J. Pera and J. Boronat 96 04 October 2023 22:49:11
that can be analytically integrated. We just present the ﬁnal
formulas, the development can be found in supplementary
material II.12Moreover, in supplementary material II,12we
have computed the parameters for the P €oschl–Teller poten-
tial. However, this case has been done numerically, not ana-
lytically, and this is why it is not presented here.
A. Hard-sphere potential
The hard-sphere potential is one of the simplest potential
models. It only has one parameter, which is the size of the
repulsive core. We point out that the formulas derived inSec. IIIdo not work for this particular potential due to its
divergent behavior at the core. The well-known hard-sphere
potential is given by

with albeing the scattering length and rlbeing the effective

see, for hard spheres the scattering length is Rat any l,
whereas the effective range is also proportional to Rwith a
value that is positive only for l¼0,r0¼2=3R.
B. Soft-sphere potential
In contrast to the hard-sphere interaction, the soft-sphere
potential takes into account that the core, although being repul-
sive, may be penetrated. This correction results in the model
potential having two parameters: The strength of the potential
and the core size. The soft-sphere potential is given by

In Fig. 2, we plot the functions (77)–(80) . The scattering
lengths a0anda1are zero when k0Ris zero and are equal to
R(hard-spheres solution) when k0Rbecomes large. In con-
trast, r0andr1diverge for k0Requal to zero, and when k0R
increases we recover the value of hard-spheres, which is
2R=3 and /C06R=5, respectively.
An alternate way of ﬁnding the scattering parameters of
the soft-sphere potential is shown in the Appendix of supple-mentary material II.

C. Spherical well potential
In Sec. VB, we solved the soft-sphere model potential,
where we have a potential barrier. The spherical well poten-tial is the same idea of the soft-sphere potential but taking it
as an attractive potential
VðrÞ¼/C0V
0ifr/C20R
0i f r>R:/C26
(81)
For the spherical well, where the potential is negative, we
can use the expressions that we have obtained for soft-
spheres by simply changing k0to/C0ik0. Note that since k0depends on the square root of V0, a sign change in V0results
ink0becoming imaginary. If we apply this change in sign to
V0, then we arrive easily to the general formulas for any l.

As we discussed in Sec. IV, in an attractive potential and at
certain values of the potential strength, the scattering lengthdiverges (Feshbach resonance). This means that a boundstate appears. For the spherical well potential, the resonanceforl¼0 occurs at k
0R¼ð2n/C01Þp=2 and for l ¼1a t
k0R¼np, with n/C211. In Fig. 3, we plot the scattering
lengths and effective ranges for l¼0 and l¼1. We observe
the predicted divergences: a0diverges at k0R¼p/2, 3p/2,
and 5 p/2.a1diverges at k0R¼p,2p, and 3 p.
If one looks to the shape of the effective ranges, one can
see some divergences appearing. As we proved in the end ofSec. IV, the divergences of the effective ranges are related to
the divergences of the scattering length and to its zero value.In particular, for r
0the divergences occur when a0¼0,
while for r1, we see divergences coming from both limits,
that is when a1¼0 and a1¼61. From that, we can also
understand why we were not seeing a divergence in theeffective range, r
0, near the region of the ﬁrst divergence of
the scattering length. This is because, before the ﬁrst diver-gence of a
0,a0is already negative and we do not see a
change in the sign (hence, passing through zero) until we goto the second divergence of a
0.
D. Well-barrier potential
This model potential is more involved than the previous
ones. It is a combination of a spherical-well potential and asoft-sphere (barrier) potential. Due to this combination, withthis model potential, we have four parameters at our dis-posal: The strengths and the sizes of the spherical-well andthe barrier. This model potential is very well suited whenworking with perturbative expansions of many-body systemsthat contain the three most important scattering parameters(a
0,a1andr0) as it more easily ﬁts them than in the previous
model potentials. It is given byVðrÞ¼/C0V1ifr/C20R1

The formulas found for a0andr0coincide with the ones in
Ref. 15. The analytic expressions for the rest of parameters
are too large, and we do not show them in this work.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have re-analyzed the scattering problem
to ﬁnd expressions for obtaining the scattering length andeffective range for any angular momentum value las long as
the potential decays faster than 1 =r
nwith n>2lþ3 for
each partial wave at inﬁnity. We have ﬁrst worked out theprocedure that leads to integral formulas allowing the calcu-lation of the scattering parameters for any angular momen-tum. The procedure consists of relating two apparentlydifferent formulas that calculate the phase shift. Afterlengthy manipulations, one obtains the expressions for thescattering parameters. Also, we discuss the Feshbach reso-nance and how the scattering parameters behave around itwith special emphasis on the importance of the resonance inthe study of ultracold quantum gases.
As model examples, we have obtained the exact expres-
sions of the scattering length and the effective range for anyangular momentum lfor the cases of hard-sphere, soft-
sphere, spherical well, and well-barrier potentials. As themore useful parameters are a
0,a1, and r0, we also particular-
ize the general formulas for these cases.
The results obtained for the analyzed model potentials can
be useful for researchers working on perturbative expansionsused in many-body theory when the interaction strength issmall.
2,3,11They can also be useful when working the inverse
problem, where one tries to build potentials, which fulﬁll
some a-priori known low-energy scattering parameters.
Finally, Secs. II–IV can be used as a guide for students
studying scattering theory, and the model problems in Sec. V
can be used as hands-on applied exercises.
