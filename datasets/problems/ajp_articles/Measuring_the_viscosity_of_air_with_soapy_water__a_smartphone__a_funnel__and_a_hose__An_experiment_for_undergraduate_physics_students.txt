We investigate the spontaneous motion of a soap ﬁlm in a conical geometry connected to a long tube
and show how it can be used to measure the dynamic viscosity of air. In contrast to other techniques
that are complicated to implement and require expensive and sophisticated equipment, this
measurement method relies only on soapy water and three everyday life objects: a smartphone, afunnel, and a hose. More precisely, to determine the viscosity of air, we use a smartphone to record
the spontaneous motion of a soap ﬁlm placed in a funnel when the motion of the ﬁlm is quasistatic
and the ﬂow of air escaping the geometry is viscously dominated. This simple experiment should beof value to undergraduate physics students in learning about effects of both ﬂuid viscosity and surface
tension (another ﬂuid property which they could also measure with a smartphone; Goy et al. ,P h y s .
Teach. 55, 498–499 (2017)), and the usefulness of reasonable approximations in physics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Two of the main parameters associated with ﬂuid dynam-
ics are a ﬂuid’s viscosity, which characterizes its resistance
to ﬂow and surface tension, which is the energy needed to
increase the surface area of a ﬂuid interface by one unit.2We
regularly see effects of surface tension in our everyday life,e.g., whenever we blow soap bubbles.2,3Because of surface
tension, the liquid ﬁlm forming the bubble minimizes its sur-
face area to seek a spherical shape. Like surface tension, a
ﬂuid’s viscosity originates from molecular effects and its
consequences can be seen at a macroscopic level: When
shaking a jar of honey, physics students at any level guess
correctly that it is a highly viscous liquid compared to water.Sophisticated and expensive equipment for tensiometry and
rheology can be used to fully characterize these two ﬂuid
parameters. It is interesting to note, however, that the litera-
ture documents simple and inexpensive ways that students
can measure the air–liquid surface tension or the viscosity of
a liquid. Therefore, these methods could be useful in
introductory-level physics laboratories.1,4For instance, liquid–
air surface tension can be determined using the camera of a
smartphone and a ruler to characterize the shape of a pendantdrop.1Also, liquid viscosity can be measured using a weight-
controlled capillary viscometer,4measurements being based in
this case on the simple determination of the rate at which liquid
drains from a tank through a capillary tube.
In sharp contrast with measuring the viscosity of liquids,
measuring that of gases is not an easy task. For example, the
dynamic viscosity of air is ga¼18:1lPa s at 20/C14C, roughly
50 times smaller than that of water, and too small to be mea-
sured with standard rheometry because of the mechanical
friction inherent in this type of equipment. Instead, one canuse a custom-built viscometer that can be complicated to
implement, such as a friction-free electromagnetic spinningsystem based on the diamagnetic levitation of graphite.5As
an alternative to these complicated experiments, in thispaper, we present a device that allows students to measurethe viscosity of air at low cost with simple equipment: soapy
water, a funnel, some tubing, and a smartphone camera.
The experiment consists of recording and analyzing the
spontaneous motion of a soap bubble ﬁlm in a funnel thathas a long and narrow neck. Such a ﬁlm moves on the slop-ing sides of a funnel from its wide opening toward its narrow
end, and, as it moves, it pushes air out through the neck of
the funnel. The outward motion of air is resisted by itsdynamic viscosity. By timing this motion, we learn how fastthe air is pushed out, and knowing the geometric parametersof the funnel and air–liquid surface tension, the viscosity of
air can be found. This experiment resembles a recent study
in which we discuss different scenarios of shrinking surfacesoap bubbles sitting on a thin solid with an oriﬁce locatedunder the apex of the bubble.
6In one of these scenarios, also
driven by Laplace pressure,7a bubble remains hemispherical
as it shrinks so that the contact angle made by the bubblewith the solid remains close to p=2 as the base of the bubble
moves toward the oriﬁce. The differences between theseexperiments are that the soap bubble in this experiment
moves on an incline instead of a ﬂat surface, and the air ﬂow
satisﬁes Poiseuille’s law rather than Bernoulli’s principle. Itis worthwhile noting that the described experiment can alsobe seen as a simple self-propelling system with which stu-
dents would observe soap ﬁlms moving against gravity.
Other studies found in the literature discuss methods that areoften costly and difﬁcult to implement and rely on suitablesurface chemistry or controlled surface topography to pro-duce the self-propulsion of ﬂuids on solids.
8–10For example,
the use of controlled gradients of surface chemistry of a solid
can make a drop of water run against gravity.11Other studies

have shown that gradients of cross-sectional areas can also
make capillary forces trigger the spontaneous motion of
drops, bubbles, and meniscii in conical wires and tubes and
wedges.12–15Here, we investigate the hitherto unreported
case of soap ﬁlms.
Section IIdescribes the materials and procedures needed
to record and analyze the temporal evolution of the position
of a soap ﬁlm moving spontaneously toward the narrow end
of a funnel. In Sec. IV, where we model the ﬂow using the
assumptions and approximations discussed in Sec. III,w e
show that this spontaneous motion is driven by capillarity.
Indeed, as discussed Sec. IV, capillary effects associated
with the pressure drop across the curved soap ﬁlm make itmove from large to small funnel radius. This motion isresisted by viscous friction produced by the air ﬂowing out
of the geometry. Working within experimental conditions
described in Sec. III, we use these simple physical arguments
to determine the equation of motion of a ﬁlm. Our results
show that the duration of motion depends on ﬁve known geo-
metric and physicochemical parameters and only oneunknown quantity, the viscosity of air. Hence, this experi-ment allows the determination of air’s viscosity from the
measurements of the duration of motion of a curved soap
ﬁlm in a funnel. The resulting predictions compare well tosystematic experiments in Sec. V. It is interesting to note
that our experiment can be viewed as a capillary viscometer
working for gases instead of liquids. A capillary viscometer
is a common laboratory apparatus employed to determinethe viscosity of a liquid by measuring the duration of motionof a liquid meniscus over a deﬁned distance in a tube. Here,
we measure the viscosity of a gas instead of that of a liquid,
the soap ﬁlm, and the funnel playing the role of the liquidmeniscus and tube, respectively. We ﬁnish with a few con-
cluding remarks in Sec. VI.
II. EXPERIMENTS
Figure 1(a) shows the equipment needed to conduct
experiments: soapy water, a funnel, and some tubing. Before
an experiment begins, the inner wall of the conical geometry,
i.e., the funnel, is wetted with the soap solution used in ourstudy (2 wt. % Palmolive Original (Colgate-Palmolive) and98 wt. % de-ionized water). Herein, cdenotes the air-soap
solution surface tension. The other relevant physicochemical
parameters that are speciﬁed in Fig. 1(b) are the density and
dynamic viscosity of air, q
aandga, respectively (see Figs. 1
and2which deﬁne the variables at play). Once the inner
wall of the funnel is wetted, the wider end of the funnel of
radius Ris immersed into the solution a few millimeters
below the free surface. It is convenient to move the funnel
using either a manual laboratory scissor jack or a vertical lin-
ear stage (Aerotech ACT115DL) whose speciﬁcations can befound in a previous study.16However, the accuracy and pre-
cision of the measurements are unchanged if the funnel is
moved by hand. We then remove the geometry quasistati-
cally (the typical rate of motion is a few mm/s) with its axisof symmetry perpendicular to the liquid surface. When a cir-cular ring of radius Ris used instead of a funnel, we have
shown in a previous study that the process produces a cate-
noid made of a soap ﬁlm between ring and free surface.
17
This surface of revolution becomes unstable above a critical
height ( /C250.66R) between geometry and free surface and col-
lapses to leave a planar ﬁlm on the ring and a surface bubbleon the free surface.17,18Here, the process produces the samesurface of revolution. However, in our experiments, the tube
is closed before the critical height is reached so that the col-
lapse of the catenoid yields the formation of a surface bubble
and a curved soap ﬁlm having the shape of a spherical cap
on the wider end of the cone as shown in Fig. 1(b). If the
tube is reopened, surface tension causes the curved ﬁlm to
self-propel toward the narrow end of the funnel (Fig. 1(c)).
The propulsion of the ﬁlm sets the air present in the funnel
into motion.
During the preparation of our experiment, once the ﬁlm
with radius of curvature Rcis formed, the tube is reopened to
allow the ﬁlm to move toward the narrow end of the funnel
in the direction /C0^z(Fig. 1(c)). It is stopped by closing the
tube (length ‘and radius a) when it reaches a desired initial
position z0(see Figs. 1(c) and2). We start the time ( t¼0)
when we reopen the tube and we record with a smartphone
the temporal evolution of its position z(t) (see Figs. 1(c)and
2) until it reaches a ﬁnal one at zf¼a=tana(Fig. 2) where it
stops; ais the radius of a tube, and ais the half of its opening
angle. In the experiment, we record the position z, but the
analysis is performed in terms of Z¼z=cosa; as shown in
Fig.2, Z is the distance between the apex of a cone and the

point of contact of a ﬁlm on a funnel wall, which is also
equal to the radius of curvature of the ﬁlm, Rc. For the unidi-
mensional motion of a soap ﬁlm studied here, the free image
analysis software ImageJ is used to ﬁnd Z(t).19Image proc-
essing consists of placing a line on an experimental moviealong a soap ﬁlm’s trajectory and creating a single imagewhose vertical axis is this line plotted for each frame of the
movie as a function of time (horizontal axis of the image).
Coordinates of each pixel of a binary version of the imagecan then be saved in a ﬁle that is imported with a free graph-ing software
20to plot the position of a ﬁlm as a function of
time.
III. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS,
APPROXIMATIONS AND KEY VARIABLES
For these experiments and the interpretation of experimen-
tal results, we make ﬁve assumptions and/or approximations.As mentioned earlier, this study could teach undergraduatestudents that non-trivial measurements can be performed
with common and inexpensive equipment. It could also teach
them about the importance of approximations and assump-tions in physics.•First, we assume that air is incompressible and that a soap
ﬁlm is impermeable to this gas during the time of anexperiment; hence, the mass and volume of air are con-served so that the volumetric ﬂow rate, q, of air in a tube
is given by the temporal variations of the volume of
entrapped air in a cone.
•Second, in addition to the geometric and physicochemicalquantities deﬁned in Figs. 1and2, one could imagine that
the thickness of a soap bubble ﬁlm eor that of the ﬁlm ini-
tially deposited on the inner wall of a geometry play a role(via gravity effects) in the experiment; ﬁlms with differentthicknesses are prepared using a method discussed in a pre-vious work.
16We use a spectrometer (Avantes AvaSpec-
2048) to measure the thickness of a ﬁlm. Experimentsperformed with the same geometry but different thicknessesof the deposited ﬁlm (10–30 lm in our study) exhibit
the same dynamics. Gravity effects (i.e., the estimate of theweight of a curved soap ﬁlm 2 pZ
2
0eð1/C0cosaÞq‘gwith the
gravitational acceleration g) should dominate over capillary
action (i.e., the estimate of the total capillary force in thez-direction 4 pZ
0csina) when the thickness of a ﬁlm eis
larger than a threshold ec¼2j/C02Z/C01

where j/C01¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
c=ðq‘gÞp
is the capillary length;21ecis
deﬁned as that value of efor which the ﬁlm weight equals
the capillary force. Using typical values of the anglea¼22
/C14and initial position Z0¼0:1 m, the threshold
thickness is larger than about 700 lm, which is hundreds
times larger than the thickest ﬁlms used in our study(e¼1–10 lm). Hence, we determine that gravity can be
n e g l e c t e dw h e nc o m p a r e dt os u r f a c et e n s i o ni no u rs t u d ya tthe beginning of an experiment. To compare these twoeffects when a ﬁlm moves over time, we assume that e
remains constant between t¼0a n d t¼t
f. In order words,
we assume that the liquid escapes through the meniscus onthe wetted inner wall of the conical geometry as the ﬁlmmoves and its width decreases over time. Since the aboveexpressions of the weight of a ﬁlm and surface tension varyasZ
2andZ, respectively, with Zdecreasing over time, sur-
face tension prevails for the whole dynamics and effects of
gravity can be neglected over time. We would have liked todismiss gravity as an important variable by showing thatﬁlms moving in its direction or against it give the samedynamics for the same experimental conditions.Unfortunately, results are altered when ﬁlms move in thedirection of gravity because some of the liquid move alongthe walls of the geometry and inside the tube.
•Third, we consider the idealized motion of soap ﬁlmswithin a quasistatic limit that neglects the viscous dragacting on the meniscus linking a ﬁlm to the wall of a cone.In other words, we consider that the contact angle the ﬁlmmakes with the inner wall of a cone is p=2 at any time so
that the radius of curvature of a soap ﬁlm is R
c¼Zin our
study (see Figs. 1(c) and2, which deﬁne the variables at
play). As shown by the illustrative example reported inFig. 1(c), experimental observations made when the base
of a ﬁlm moves on the inner wall of a cone validate this
assumption. Such an approach has been successfullyemployed to describe the motion of a single foam lamellaﬂowing through a porous medium under applied pres-sure.
22,23More recently, we have shown that this quasi-
static approach can help to rationalize one of the dynamicsobserved for shrinking surface bubbles.6
•Fourth, our modeling work considers that air is containedinside a complete cone instead of a truncated one attached

ric and physicochemical parameters. (b) Temporal variations of the posi-
tion of a ﬁlm zobtained by processing a movie of an experiment using the
method described in the text. As shown, the motion of the ﬁlm begins at z0

experimental position is close to the expected value a=tana¼7:7 mm. In
these measurements, the geometrical parameters are: a¼3.2 mm, ‘¼1
m, and a¼22:5/C14.

to a tube. In other words, we model air ﬂow with an excess
volume of air pa3=ð3 tan aÞcorresponding to the cone of
height zf¼a=tanaand base with radius awhose contour
is shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 2. Hence, the volume
of air is V¼ð2p=3ÞZ3ð1/C0cosaÞ. This approximation
seems reasonable since the excess volume is not a function
of time and the model of the ﬂow presented in Sec. IV
uses the time derivative of the volume, i.e., the ﬂow rate.
•Finally, we will show in Sec. IVthat the air ﬂow can be
described by Poiseuille’s equation that relates the pressure
drop across the ﬂow geometry, the ﬂow rate, and the
hydrodynamic resistance of the funnel. The studied geome-try is a serial combination of a cone and a cylindrical tube.
Hence, its total hydrodynamic resistance is R
h¼RhcþRht
with RhcandRhtthe resistances of the cone and the tube,
respectively. As discussed more quantitatively in Sec. IV,
the Reynolds number Reassociated with the air ﬂow is small
enough for this ﬂow to be described by the Stokes equation
so that the resistance of a tube can be expressed in the well-
known form Rht¼8ga‘=ðpa4Þ.24,25T h er e s i s t a n c eo ft h e

expression is valid for small angles a, and it is calculated
within lubrication theory assuming a no-slip boundary
condition.26When comparing the leading term of this resis-
tance [8 ga=ð3pa3tanaÞ] with that of a tube, we ﬁnd that Rhc
can be neglected when compared with Rhtwhen
‘/C29a=ð3t a n aÞ. In our experiments, for a typical funnel
with a¼22/C14, this condition becomes ‘/C290:825awith
a¼1:5/C05 mm, which is easily met experimentally
when working with tubes having a length in the range
‘¼0:01/C010 m. In this limit of long tubes, the hydrody-
namic resistance of a cone is negligible compared to that of
the tube, so we choose to work in this simplifying limit. In
other words, Rh/C24Rhtin what follows.
IV. MODEL OF THE FLOW
We consider that the motion of a ﬁlm is driven by its cur-
vature, i.e., by the Laplace pressure
Dp¼4c
Z; (1)
which is the pressure difference across the curved ﬁlm, from
the air on one side of the ﬁlm to the air on the other; cis the
air–liquid surface tension.2Indeed, surface tension, which is
an energy per unit surface area, can also be interpreted as a
force per unit length acting on curved ﬂuid–ﬂuid interfaces,such as the studied soap ﬁlm moving in a conical ﬂow geom-
etry. In this case, surface tension produces an overpressure
(well-known as the Laplace pressure) between the front of a
ﬁlm and the end of a tube at atmospheric pressure. The
Laplace pressure is equal to the surface tension cmultiplied
by (i) the sum of the two principal radii of curvature (here
1=ðZþeÞþ1=Z’1=Zþ1=Z) and (ii) a factor 2 that
accounts for the two ﬂuid–ﬂuid interfaces forming a ﬁlm;
hence, Eq. (1)reads Dp¼2/C22c=Z.2,27Such a ﬁlm then
moves from high pressure (position of a ﬁlm) to low pressure
(end of a tube) regions.
The motion of a ﬁlm is limited by the air ﬂow that we con-
sider to be one-dimensional and viscously dominated.Hence, the considered laminar air ﬂow should satisfy the
Poiseuille’s equation that reads
Dp¼Rhq; (2)
where qis the air ﬂow rate and Dpis the pressure difference
between the position of a curved ﬁlm and the end of a tubing,which is at atmospheric pressure. For this experiment, as dis-cussed in Sec. III, the ﬂow can be considered to be laminar
when the characteristic Reynolds number R
eis smaller than
2000.24,28,29In our experiment, this dimensionless quantity
is obtained by comparing inertial [ /qav2=ð2aÞ] and viscous
[/gav=ð2aÞ2] body forces and reads Re¼2aqav=ga;29vis
the average velocity of the air ﬂow and qais the air density,
as illustrated in Figs. 1(b) and2. The velocity vcan be writ-
tenq=ðpa2Þand, using Eqs. (1)and(2),qcan be written
4c=ðZRhÞso that Re¼8qac=ðpaZR hgaÞ. As we have shown
in Sec. IIIthat it is reasonable to approximate the total resis-
tance Rhby that of the tube Rht¼8ga‘=ðpa4Þ, the Reynolds
number reads

At the beginning of the motion of a ﬁlm, Z¼Z0is typically

using Eq. (3), the condition for laminar ﬂow Re<2000 is sat-
isﬁed when ‘>1:7 mm for the tube of smallest radius
a¼1.5 mm and ‘>62:5 mm for the largest tube’s radius

model the air ﬂow with an initial volume of air largerthan the experimental one (see Sec. III), the predicted time
t
fshould be very close to its experimental counterpart.
67 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January 2022 Delvert, Panizza, and Courbin 67 04 October 2023 23:00:25
Hence, knowing the geometric parameters of an experiment
and the values of the liquid–air surface tension, measure-
ments of tfshould allow one to determine the viscosity of air.
Similar physical arguments are used to determine the col-
lapse time of a bubble in a deﬂating bubble experiment.29In
such an experiment, a bubble placed on one end of a cylin-
drical tube deﬂates when the other end of the tube is opened
and the pressured air in the bubble escapes through the
tube.29The predicted collapse time can be used to determine
the air–liquid surface tension of soap solutions.30,31
However, these experiments with a non-moving bubble foot
require a good image analysis program to obtain accurate
data.29Here, as discussed at the end of Sec. II, analyzing an
experiment only requires simple image processing performed
with a free software.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we compare our model to experimental
results. We investigate the motion of a ﬁlm by varying either
the opening angle of a cone 2 a[Fig. 3(a)], or the length of a
tube ‘[Fig. 3(b)], or its radius a[Fig. 3(c)], while maintain-
ing other parameters ﬁxed. As shown in these ﬁgures that
report the temporal variations of the normalized position
Z=Z0for these sets of experiments, the response qualitatively
resembles that of Fig. 2(b) for all varied parameters: the nor-
malized position is a monotonically decreasing function oftime until the ﬁnal position of a ﬁlm is reached. When the
experimental ﬁnal time t
fis plotted as a function of aforgiven values of Z0,‘anda, we ﬁnd experiments are in quali-
tative agreement with predictions. Indeed, the inset of Fig.
3(a) shows that tfincreases with aand its predicted expres-
sion derived in Sec. IVvaries as (1 /C0cosa) which for small
enough aincreases as a2. Similar to these results, when the
motion of a ﬁlm is investigated for various ‘and ﬁxed a,Z0,
anda[see the inset of Fig. 3(b)], the results obtained for a
wide range of tube length suggest that tfincreases linearly
with ‘as predicted. Our experimental ﬁndings show much
stronger dependence of the time tfon the radius a[see the
inset of Fig. 3(c), which reports these variations for ﬁxed Z0,
‘anda] when compared to its variations with the length ‘
[inset of Fig. 3(b)]. Indeed, to increase the time at which a
ﬁlm stops by an order of magnitude, one can either increase
the length of a tube by a factor of 50 or divide its radius by 2
[see Figs. 3(b) and3(c)]. This result is also consistent with
the predicted time tf, which varies both as ‘and 1 =a4.
To provide a more quantitative comparison between
experiments and modeling, Fig. 4shows the variations with
time of ðZðtÞ=Z0Þ4for the experiments shown in Fig. 3.A s
expected by the form of Eq. (7), we ﬁnd that the plotted
quantity is a linearly decreasing function of time. Hence, the
motion of a ﬁlm is well-described by the quasistatic modelwith an air ﬂow that satisﬁes Darcy’s law and we can now
compare measurements of the duration of motion with our
prediction.

a¼15/C14/C030/C14;Z0¼60/C0120 mm, a¼1:5/C05 mm, and
the length of a tube ‘that is varied over more than three
orders of magnitude (0 :01/C012 m). As shown in Fig. 6, these
data can be used to determine the dynamic viscosity of air.All of our data points are within 20% of the tabulated value
of air viscosity ( g
a¼18:1lPa s) for the temperature at
which data were taken (20/C14C); more than 80% of the data
are within 10% of this expected value (see Fig. 6). It is also
important to note that the average value (17.75 lPa s) of the
air viscosity deduced using our method is only 2 :5% smaller
than the tabulated value which is remarkable considering thenumerous approximations made to establish our model based
on simple physical arguments. It is also worth mentioning
that the standard deviation rgfor the measurements shown
in Fig. 6is quite small, rg¼1:54lPa s. Hence, our experi-
ment offers a simple and inexpensive way to measure thedynamic viscosity of air.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have discussed a simple method to measure the vis-
cosity of air that is directly applicable to the classroom. Theexperiments are easy to perform and analyze at low cost, and
the physics behind them can be taught to students in under-
graduate physics courses. We have described ﬁve keyassumptions and/or approximations so that students can alsolearn about the importance of reasonable approximations in
physics research. In addition, using the setup described here,
students will have the opportunity to observe a soap ﬁlm pro-pel itself against gravity. While beyond the scope of ourpaper, it is worthwhile mentioning that this experiment can
be extended to other situations that would require a more
sophisticated experimental system. For instance, it could beused to determine the viscosity of other gases or that of air at
different temperatures or relative humidity since a gas vis-
cosity is a function of these physical quantities. Of course inthat case, these measurements would demand not only amore reﬁned setup but also the systematic determination of
surface tension, which decreases with the increasing temper-
ature (at a given relative humidity) or relative humidity (fora given temperature).

APPENDIX: COMPARISON BETWEEN PREDICTED
AND EXPERIMENTAL TIMES AT WHICH A FILMSTOPS
Here, we discuss the validity of our model, which is based
on several assumptions and approximations, including a
slightly overestimated volume of air (see Sec. III). In what

Eq.(7)describing the motion of a ﬁlm is the solution of the
following ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equation:

In our experiments, typical values of the initial ( Z0) and
ﬁnal ( Zf) positions of a ﬁlm are 10/C01and 10/C02m, respec-
tively. Hence, the value of the term ðZf=Z0Þ4in Eq. (A2) is
10/C04so that texp
fshould typically be 99 :99% tth

the assumptions and approximations made to establish our
model seem reasonable since the predicted time should com-
pare very well with the measured one.
