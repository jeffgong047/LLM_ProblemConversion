A straightforward method of determining the eccentricity of Earth’s orbit and the position of
aphelion and perihelion relative to the vernal equinox from solstice and equinox times is described.The only assumption made is that the orbital eccentricity is small. Using dates for these phenomena
adopted from a desk calendar gives the eccentricity to an accuracy of about 10%.

The eccentricity of Earth’s orbit is related to the elapsed
time between successive equinoxes and solstices; the timerequired to travel from northern hemisphere autumnal equi-nox (AE) through winter solstice (WS) to vernal equinox
(VE), about 179 days, is less than that required to go from
vernal equinox through summer solstice (SS) and back to theautumnal equinox, about 186 days. The difference corre-sponds to only about 2% of the orbital period, so the eccen-tricity must be slight; also, we can infer that perihelion mustoccur during the northern winter months, a fact known to theancient Greeks.
Several papers have presented various approaches to
determine the eccentricity of Earth’s orbit from solstice/equi-nox timing data; there are also some textbook treatments. A1989 paper by Snyder summarizes several older treatmentsand presents a model where the orbit is treated as a
Ptolemaic-like offset circle of varying speed.
1However, as
Snyder and others point out, these approaches all suffer fromlimitations such as assuming that the orbit is circular or thatperihelion and winter solstice coincide; some involve awk-ward transcendental functions or series expansions.

An ingenious variant of the circle method was developed
by Oostra, who has the Earth in a circular orbit about the ori-gin. The radius of the orbit can be taken to be unity, and heplaces the Sun offset from the origin at coordinates ( x,y),
where xand yare presumed to be small compared to the
radius. Lines parallel to the xandyaxes are projected from
the Sun until they intersect the orbit; this divides the circleinto four sectors whose areas are greater or less than p=4
according as the areas of thin rectangles dictated by the val-
ues of xandy. The intersection points of these lines with the
circle are taken to deﬁne the positions of solstices and equi-noxes. By Kepler’s second law, the sector areas must be pro-portional to the known durations of seasons; a consistentchronological ordering of the sectors with the seasonsbecomes apparent, and ratios of areas to times for differentseasons can be used to establish values for xand y. The
eccentricity is then recovered as the ratio of the offset dis-tance to the radius of the circle.

For students familiar with Kepler’s laws, however, the
offset-circle method may be confusing, since they know that
orbits should be ellipses. To avoid this problem, this note
describes an alternate method of estimating the eccentricityof Earth’s orbit and the location of aphelion/perihelion rela-tive to the vernal equinox. While the end result is equivalent,it starts with the more familiar assumption that the orbit is alow-eccentricity ellipse.Of course, planetary orbital data can be looked up in any
online almanac, where timings will be quoted to an accuracy
of a minute. However, to adopt such data to test the method
developed here would be disingenuous: Such almanacs are
generated by software already programmed with the eccen-
tricity. To keep to the spirit of imagining an ancient butpatient observer who determines the relevant dates by noting
equinoxes as when the Sun rises due east and solstices as
those of longest and shortest noontime shadows, I use dates
rounded to one day, adopted from my desk calendar. It turns
out that even with this one can do reasonably well, determin-
ing the eccentricity to an accuracy of about 10%. I do give
precise data for comparative purposes, but the intent is to
simulate an “eyeball” approach. This analysis would likely
be nothing new to a Kepler or Newton, but I have not foundit described in any readily accessible source.
The situation is sketched (not to scale) in Fig. 1. In the top
sketch, the ellipse represents Earth’s orbit as viewed from
above the North pole of the Sun; the eccentricity is greatly
exaggerated. The thin horizontal solid line passing through
the Sun is the major axis of the orbit. I put the summer sol-
stice just somewhat past aphelion. In reality, this occurs
about two weeks before aphelion, but the diagram is drawnfor convenience, and this will not affect the following argu-
ment. The apsidal angle /is measured counterclockwise
from the major axis with aphelion corresponding to /¼0
o.
Ultimately, the goal is to determine the positional angle of
vernal equinox, /VE, relative to this direction. In effect, this
is reversed from the usual astronomical practice of treating
the equinox position as “ﬁxed” and determining the location
of aphelion or perihelion, but this makes the formulation
more straightforward.
A key argument in this analysis is that solstices and equi-
noxes are separated by 90oin apsidal angle. For readers
unfamiliar with this notion, it can be argued as follows.
Figure 1(b) shows a view in the plane of the ecliptic, perpen-
dicular to the WS-Sun-SS line ( notperpendicular to the
major axis of the ellipse). At summer solstice, the Sun will
appear overhead as far north as it ever does. To have the
same extreme southern latitude at winter solstice on the leftside of the sketch, the summer and winter solstice positions
must be 180
oapart. An identical argument can be made for
the positions of vernal equinox and autumnal equinox; they
too must be 180ofrom each other.
Now imagine looking toward the Sun from this external
vantage point. The Sun can be over the equator only at the
moment when Earth is directly in front of or behind it as
viewed from this direction. Thus, the SS-WS and VE-AE

lines must be perpendicular, hence the 90oclaim. This is a
quite general result, independent of any eccentricity of theorbit.

Ifeis small, the denominator in the integrand of Eq. (1)
can be treated with a ﬁrst-order binomial expansion to give
t/1!/2/C24Að/2/C0/1Þþ2eðsin/2/C0sin/1Þ ½/C138 : (3)
With terms of order e2and higher neglected, then the Aof
Eq.(2)reduces to A¼T=2p, which renders this solution
equivalent to Oostra’s offset circle. This is to be expected as
both methods are accurate to the ﬁrst order in e.

Table Ilists timing data for 2022/2023 phenomena as
determined by the United States Naval Observatory; these
are included for readers who might wish to undertake moreprecise calculations. The last column lists the number of
elapsed calendar days, not including the day of the “prior
event.” These sum to 365, so we can naturally expect some
inaccuracy in the results. If you replicate such calculations
for other years, beware of subtleties, for example, as mea-sured in Universal Time, the 2022 autumnal equinox occurs
in the early hours of September 23, but in the Eastern time
zone which my calendar keeps this occurs late in the eveningof September 22.
Equation (8)gives s
1¼/C03=4, from which Eq. (9)gives
/VE/C24262o; Eq. (10) then gives e/C240:0152. (There will be
two solutions to Eqs. (8)and(9)separated by 180o, but one
of them will give an unphysical negative eccentricity.) The
true eccentricity is /C240:01671; the estimate is good to /C249%.
The precise USNO numbers give /VE/C24256:6oand
e/C240:0167. Perihelion and aphelion occur about two weeks
after winter solstice and summer solstice, around January 4
and July 4, respectively. The sensitivity of results to changes
in the intervals can be judged by adding a quarter-day in theSS-to-AE calendar interval (when Earth is moving slowly) to
account for the true orbital period; this gives /
VE/C24260o

Rounding the USNO intervals to the nearest tenth of a daygives /
VE/C24256oande/C240:0166, which essentially elimi-
nates the error. However, this would require patient observa-tion over many years with good timekeeping and calendars.
It is important to point out to students that Earth’s orbit
and axial rotation are never the beautifully closed, endlesslyrepeating cycles of textbook drawings; we are constantlysubject to gravitational tugs from every body in the solar sys-tem. The differential gravitational force of the Sun on theEarth, for example, leads to a precessional motion of thevernal equinox of about 50 s of arc per year. This causesthe date of perihelion to advance by about one calendarmonth every 2000 years, although the effect is not uniform.In Newton’s time, perihelia occurred in late December asopposed to the present /C24January 4. Figure 2shows thedistribution of 400 computed perihelia dates from 1701 to
2100. We have to take the model presented here within the
context of these limitations, but it is instructive to see how
simple observations served as the foundations of celestialmechanics. A good class exercise might be to have students
dig out old calendars and repeat the analysis for various
years as a consistency check.
