In recent years, more courses in electromagnetism are using the “Syste `me International” (SI) units
as opposed to Gaussian-cgs. The confusing notation used to formulate SI with origins in the early19th century still persists in instruction. This work shows that electromagnetism may be taught
relatively painlessly in the units that virtually everyone uses by employing a new presentation that
makes the equations nearly as simple as those in the Heaviside–Lorentz system commonly used by
theoretical physicists. Introducing a new coupling constant jand some new notation for the ﬁelds,
it is possible to dispense with /C15
0andl0and the conceptual framework from which they come. As a
result, it is possible achieve much greater clarity, while using all the same symbols and relations as
in the extant literature. #2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION
For decades, instructors have struggled over the choice of
picking units and notation when presenting classical electro-magnetism. The Syste `me International (SI) conventions are
by far the most commonly used for actual measurements, butthey come encumbered with confusing notation, reﬂecting anobsolete conceptual framework. Two other possibilities, theGaussian-cgs (Gcgs) and Heaviside–Lorentz (HL) systems,are used in some places but have other signiﬁcant drawbacks,especially from a practical point of view.
While it is interesting to come up with ways of parame-
terizing multiple possible systems of units, with variablesthat allow switching between them,
1this is not the goal of
this work. It is instead to formulate a notation for thecommonly used SI units so they are easier to teach stu-
dents and are not discordant with modern approaches to
ﬁeld theory.
This article will show that SI units themselves are not
confusing; if one presents them properly, all the equationsare essentially as simple in SI as they are in any other unitsystem. The problem is instead with the use of the quanti-ties/C15
0andl0. The deﬁnitions of these constants originate
within the 19th century framework in which the electricand magnetic ﬁelds had their seat in the stresses andmotions of the luminiferous aether. It is for reasons buriedin more than a century and a half of history that the nota-tion imposes an unwieldly and non-Lorentz invariant“symmetry” ðE;/C15Þ$ð B;lÞ. This choice turns the Lorentz-
invariant notation, such as the construction of the relativis-tic notation for the ﬁeld tensor F
l/C23, into a hodgepodge of /C150
andl0. Because of these issues, many instructors ﬁnd the
notation distasteful and students ﬁnd it bewildering. Thechoice of name for /C15
0, “permittivity of the vacuum,”—
which implies that the vacuum should be regarded as pos-
sessing some sort of dielectric property—is drastically out
of line with the modern viewpoint.
This article will start from ﬁrst principles and outline a
new presentation of the electromagnetic relations, one thatallows for the use of SI units without introducing /C15
0andl0.
Maxwell’s equations will take a simple and memorableform, and the connection to relativistically invariant notationwill be straightforward without extraneous factors of 4 por
coupling constants in unexpected places.II. THE BASICS OF THE NEW PRESENTATION
We begin our discussion with Coulomb’s law, which
states that the force Fbetween two charges q
iis of the form
F/q1q2
r2^r: (1)
We explain this proportionality by viewing each charge as
setting up a ﬁeld in space that acts on the other. Even before
we formulate the ﬁeld precisely, we can already see that thisfunctional form by itself indicates that there is the “same
total amount” of ﬁeld crossing each concentric spherical
shell at any radius, furnishing the explanation of the 1 =r
2in
the force law2and motivating the inclusion of a 4 pin the
denominator as well. We, therefore, parameterize Coulomb’slaw as
F¼j2q1q2
4pr2^r: (2)
Here, j(the greek letter kappa) represents the ability of a
charge to either create or react to an electric ﬁeld. There
are two factors of jbecause one particle creates the ﬁeld
and the other reacts to it.3
Before proceeding, we can validate our choice of the 4 pin
the denominator by considering what the force law looks
like in other numbers of dimensions. We may not be able to
know what would happen in more than three dimensions, but
we can actually construct a two-dimensional experiment.
Using only the force law, as parameterized in Eq. (2), we can
do an integral to determine the force per unit length F
between two long parallel charged wires, which corresponds
to two point charges in two spatial dimensions. The integralyields
F¼j2k1k2

where lis the separation of the wires and kiare their charges
per unit length. This validates the formulation of Coulomb’s
law as

inddimensions, where Snis the n-dimensional surface area
of a unit n-sphere.4One can do the same sorts of integrals in
other dimensions to see that it ﬁts together in the general
case.
To complete the formalization of Coulomb’s law, we need
to deﬁne a unit to measure charge and then determine the
constant j. We will put off the full discussion of this until
Sec. V. For the moment, we will call this unit U, which will
be a stand-in for the coulomb in SI units, a statcoulomb in
Gcgs, etc.
III. THE “ONE j” CONVENTION
We now quickly assemble the electromagnetic relations.
Using superposition, deﬁne the electric ﬁeld eby
eðxÞ¼F
jq1¼j
4pðqðx0Þðx/C0x0Þ
jx/C0x0j3d3x0; (5)
where qis the charge density. This is equivalent to the
Maxwell equation
r/C1e¼jq: (6)
This deﬁnition differs from the c onventional one, because
it implements the observation given in Sec. IIthat the ﬁeld
is setup by one charge with one power ofj. This formula
refers only to the ﬁeld’s creation, not its subsequent
interactions.
Though this one jconvention is different from usual,
there is a method to the madness here. The dimensions of the
ﬁeld edo not involve the unit of charge U; they are
kg1=2=ðm1=2sÞ. This yields a substantial simpliﬁcation of the
formulas because jcannot appear in relations involving only
ﬁelds and no charges.
The use of the one jconvention means that the other j
will go into the Lorentz force law as
F¼jqðeþv/C2bÞ; (7)
where bis the magnetic ﬁeld. Notice that we are following the
SI convention of having no cin the Lorentz force formula,
and so eandbdiffer in dimension by a factor of velocity.
Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum are
r/C1e¼jq; (8a)
c2r/C2b/C0@
@te¼jJ; (8b)
r/C1b¼0; (8c)
r/C2eþ@
@tb¼0; (8d)
where Jis the current density (measured in U =ðlength2/C1timeÞ)
andcis the speed of light. These are pretty clean and easy to
remember: a factor of jalways goes with a charge or current
and nowhere else. This is an example of the restriction noted
above on the places jcan appear. The c2in Maxwell equations
(8b)is understood from dimensional considerations.
To see how these ﬁt into relativistic notation, we can
assemble the three-dimensional ﬁelds into the ﬁeld tensor asFl/C23¼0/C0ex/C0ey/C0ez

Maxwell’s equations are

where J/C23¼ðcq;jx;jy;jzÞis the current density four-vector.

IV. THE CONVENTIONAL FIELDS
Section IIIshowed the simplicity of the relations when the
onejconvention is followed. In the usual presentation, the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned by the Lorentz forcelaw, but with both of the factors of jincluded in the ﬁelds.
That is,
F¼qðEþv/C2BÞ; (16)
implying
E¼jeand B¼jb: (17)
If we wish to present Maxwell’s equations (Eq. (8a)–(8d) )
for the conventional ﬁelds, simply replace the one j(lower
case) ﬁelds with the conventional (upper case) ﬁelds and putj
2on the right wherever jappears.
Unfortunately, using conventional ﬁelds starts to become
messy when the other quantities are considered. For exam-
ple, the Poynting vector is
S¼c2
j2E/C2B: (18)
689 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 9, September 2022 Mitchell Golden 689 04 October 2023 23:16:22
There are no charges present in the computation of the
Poynting vector and absent the analysis presented here, acoupling constant in this expression might be unexpected. Itspresence implies that care must be taken when going to the
limit of the free ﬁeld theory, where j!0, and charged par-
ticles decouple from the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
At any rate, we can proceed to deﬁne the conventional
potentials
ðU;AÞ¼ð j/;jaÞ;
E¼/C0 rU/C0
@
@tA;
B¼r/C2 A: (19)
It must be emphasized to students that in introducing the
onejconvention, we are notintroducing new ﬁelds. Using
both upper- and lower-case letters is just a notational trick to
save writing, same as /C22hforh=2p,o rplforP
/C23gl/C23p/C23. The
onejﬁelds are simpler as theoretical constructs, but for con-
venience and to match the literature, we use Eas a shorthand
forje. There’s nothing deeper than that going on.
The lower-case/upper-case notation applies only to the
ﬁelds and potentials e/E,b/B,//U, and a/A(and in Sec. VI,
we will discuss DandH). Other than these six entities, the
use of upper and lower case letters to represent unrelatedquantities goes on as usual.
In practice, direct measurements of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are not all that common, so using lower-case ﬁelds
during theoretical discussions imposes little cost. Likewise,the vector potential Ais a strictly theoretical construct, and
the lower case acan be used in its place without penalty.
Potential differences in volts (i.e., V¼U¼j/), on the
other hand, are ubiquitous. Any class teaching electromagne-tism is going to have to deﬁne the conventional potential anduse it extensively when examining circuits. The quantities
based on it—capacitance, resistance, inductance, etc.,—will
be deﬁned by the usual relations involving Vrather than /,
and no one jquantities need be used.
V. PICKING UNITS
We are now ready to choose a unit of charge, which was
postponed in Sec. II.
Given the advantages of the one jformulation, one obvi-
ous possibility is simply to deﬁne U so j¼1 and the upper
case and lower case ﬁelds are the same. This is what is doneto deﬁne the HL units, used nearly universally in theoreticalphysics—usually with the additional choice of setting cto 1.
However, the unit of charge and many of other dimensionsare of impractical sizes. (The unit of current in the cgs ver-sion of HL is only 94 pA.)
Another common choice is the Gcgs units,
6where
j2¼4p. The purported advantage of these units is that the
force law has no coefﬁcient in three dimensions. Since theunit of charge differs from that of HL only by a factor ofﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
4pp
, it doesn’t go very far to rectify the practicality prob-
lems. Furthermore, this choice of jresults in many of the
relations, when expressed in the conventional ﬁelds, beinglittered with factors of 4 pin unexpected places. Aside from
the rareﬁed Land u, the 4 pinﬁltrates even the simplest
quantities such as capacitance of parallel plates, which isA=ðj
2sÞ, where Ais the area of the plates and sis their
separation.While the Gcgs system still has a bastion in some text-
books and courses, it seems to be gradually being supplantedin instruction by the SI units, which were expressly designed
to be conveniently sized.7Since 2019, the coulomb has been
deﬁned so that the elementary charge e(i.e., the charge on a
proton) is exactly 1:602 176 634 /C210/C019C. With this choice,
the value of jis a measurable constant of nature, which
determines “how much ﬁeld” a coulomb of charge produces.
One can use the measurement of the ﬁne structure constant,
deﬁned by the relation a¼ðj2e2Þ=ð4p/C22hcÞ, to compute8

Going back to the force law in Eq. (2)and comparing it to
the usual SI notation F¼ðq1q2Þ=ð4p/C150r2Þ^r, we can see that

VI. FIELDS IN MATTER IN THE ONE j
CONVENTION
We now turn to macroscopic electromagnetism, involving
the quantities D,H,P, and M. The polarization Pis deﬁned
as electric dipole moment per volume with SI units C =m2,
and the magnetization Mis magnetic dipole moment per vol-
ume with SI units C =ðmsÞ.
One advantage offered by the use of the one jconvention
is that there is a delineation between sources (measured inunits with U in the numerator), ﬁelds (measured in unitswithout U), and “conventional ﬁelds” (measured in units
with U in the denominator).
9
From this, it is clear that PandMare sources, and accord-
ingly there is no reason to consider lower-case quantities forPandM.
In the SI system, DandHare constructed to obey the
macroscopic Maxwell equations
r/C1D¼q
f;r/C2H/C0@
@tD¼Jf; (22)
where qfand Jfare the “free” charge and current, respec-
tively. They are different from the corresponding Maxwell
equations for EandB; the coefﬁcients c2andj2have been
absorbed into the deﬁnitions of DandH, and so their units
are the same as PandM, respectively. The quantities Dand
Hact like some sort of ﬁeld but carry the units of a source.10
Using the standard SI relations for bound charges in an
object at rest, qb¼/C0 r/C1 PandJb¼r/C2 Mþ@P=@t, one
can derive
D¼1
jeþP;H¼c2
jb/C0M: (23)
In contrast, in the Gcgs and HL systems, DandHare deﬁned
so as to obey the same corresponding Maxwell equations as
EandB(though because of the different convention in the
Lorentz force law, creplaces c2in Maxwell equation (8b),
and a factor of cappears in the magnetization current11).
Therefore,
Gcgs =HL ½/C138 :D¼jeþj2P;
Gcgs =HL ½/C138 :H¼jb/C0j2M: (24)
690 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 9, September 2022 Mitchell Golden 690 04 October 2023 23:16:22
This choice has the some signiﬁcant advantages: DandH
have dimensions of conventional ﬁelds, and they are equal toEandB, respectively, in empty space. In addition, one can
use the lower-case notation for the ﬁelds dandhwith the
result that jonly appears when there is a coupling to
charge.12
Equations (23) show that the one japproach cannot be
applied to the SI DandH. The selection of equations to use
forDandHis separated from the units themselves, and if
one deﬁnes “unconventional conventional ﬁelds” DuandHu
to follow the EandBMaxwell equations, SI would have
du¼eþjP,hu¼b/C0ðj=c2ÞM. Teslas rather than ampere-
turns/meter measure Hu. Whether the introduction of these
new entities improves students’ understanding is a decisionto be made by the instructor.13
VII. CONCLUSION
Over the past few decades, instruction in electromagne-
tism seems to be gradually moving away from the Gcgs sys-tem to SI. As this transition proceeds, it is worthwhile forinstructors to re-evaluate the historic notation in which elec-tromagnetism has been taught. Most of the simplicity of theHL equations is available in the SI units, if one eliminatesthe obsolete conceptual framework and the constants /C15
0and
l0through the use of the one jconvention.

2This argument is less persuasive if one regards the electrostatic force as an
action at a distance.
3One might ask whether there could be a separate jfor the creation and the
response to the ﬁeld. This would be forbidden by CPT symmetry and,
thus, by quantum ﬁeld theories.
4Our familiar sphere, which embeds in three dimensions, is called a two-sphere. Interestingly, there is one additional pat each odd dimension.
5One can measure ﬁelds without deﬁning a unit of charge using the uresult.
Place a positive charge on a plate of a parallel-plate capacitor and an equalnegative charge on the other. Connect the plates via a resistive wire.Without reference to the charges, one knows that the heat Qgenerated in
the resistor during discharge is the energy originally contained in the elec-
trostatic ﬁeld between the plates. If the separation of the plates is smallcompared to the other dimensions, the electric ﬁeld is uniform between the
plates and nearly zero outside. Thus, e

9This distinction is usually hidden in the Gcgs and HL units, because
charge is treated as a derived unit. However, one can keep track of dimen-
sions by measuring charge in U even in Gcgs and HL systems, by usingthe relation U

11Note that ein the different systems differs only by the choice of length and
mass units, and bdiffers in addition by the factor of c.
12This analysis also reveals that PandMcan be considered as having differ-
ent units from DandHin the Gcgs and HL systems, since the latter are
conventional ﬁelds measured with U in the denominator and the former
are sources measured with U in the numerator, cf. J. D. Jackson, Classical
Electromagnetics , 3rd ed. (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), p. 780.
13Since measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld Hare sometimes seen, Hstill
has to be introduced to students. One plus is that Hu¼l0H, a quantity
that is often encountered.
