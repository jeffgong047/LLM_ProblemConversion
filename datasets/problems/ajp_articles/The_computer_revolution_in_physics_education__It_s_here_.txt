LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Letters are selected for their expected interest for our readers. Some letters are sent to reviewers for advice;
some are accepted or declined by the editor without review. Letters must be brief and may be edited, sub-ject to the author’s approval of signiﬁcant changes. Although some comments on published articles andnotes may be appropriate as letters, most such comments are reviewed according to a special procedure
and appear, if accepted, in the Notes and Discussions section. (See the “Statement of Editorial Policy” at
http://www.kzoo.edu/ajp/docs/edpolicy.html.) Running controversies among letter writers will not bepublished.

In the April 2023 issue of AJP, William Flannery1cited a
paper Jack Wilson and I wrote 34 years ago2in which we
predicted that computers would produce a revolution in
physics education. He asked when it was going to happen
and what would it take to make it happen. Thanks for that! It
was great to look back and see what we were envisioning in
those early days.
But…not happening? I think you’re missing a lot, and
you’re missing a lot of the message we were stating in our
papers. You stress the value of computational physics, par-
ticularly solving differential equations numerically. While
this was one of our messages (strongly stressed in some ofour papers3,4), our vision was broader.
When graphical user interfaces (GUIs) came out in the
late 1980s, Jack and I immediately saw many of the possibil-
ities. In addition to the use of computers for calculation that
we had stressed in the M.U.P.P.E.T. project,5we saw that
the computer was going to produce a revolution that enabled
going beyond a ﬁxed text-based curriculum. It could lead to
•modularity for ﬂexibly matching courses to populations,
•integrated use of computer tools for visualization and
exploration as well as calculation,
•sharing materials from multiple sources.
We created a demonstration product to show how this
might be done, modestly (?) named, “The comprehensive
uniﬁed physics learning environment,” or CUPLE. This
product, published by John Risley’s Physics Academic
Software in 1994, showed how to use existing software prod-
ucts to create modular readings, bring in videos and data col-
lected by computers, use 2D and 3D graphers to explore
functions, use a spreadsheet to analyze data and solve differ-
ential equations, use simulations, and more. We discussed
these ideas in the M.U.P.P.E.T. papers. Figure 1shows a les-
son palette (left) and the Toolbox (right) from CUPLE. Note
computational tools (Turbo Pascal), a spreadsheet, and anequation explorer.
What Jack and I missed in 1989–1991 when we were cre-
ating CUPLE was the web. We saw that sharing materials
was one of the most exciting possibilities of the new com-
puter environments. In the last chapter of the CUPLE
Developer’s Manual, we talked about connecting and build-
ing a community through a Listserv (anyone remember
Listservs?) and setting up an ftp site for exchangingmaterials. The web (and URLs!) was only a few years away,
but by the time it became widely available, Jack and I hadmoved on—Jack climbing up the ladder in university admin-
istration and me drilling down into physics education
research.
However, has the computer revolution happened? You
bet! Here are some of the things you can do with currentlyavailable shared computer tools:

Need the ﬂexibility to adapt to a speciﬁc population? In
the last year, I taught before the pandemic ﬁnally drove meinto retirement, I was teaching an Introductory Physics forLife Sciences (IPLS) class. Did I adapt my class to my popu-lation using modular materials? Sure did!
I created a textbook, Living Physics ,
7drawn from the
NEXUS/Physics open-source wiki8with integrated auto-
graded “check-your-understanding” questions, videos fromYouTube, simulations from the University of ColoradoPhET simulations,
9and “dig-deeper” links to articles in
Wikipedia.10
Our laboratories have students taking data from videos
(sometimes with microscopes studying biological sys-tems),11using spreadsheets to analyze data in the lab and to
do homework exploring functional dependence and solvingdifferential equations.
Homework problems are drawn from the open-web
NEXUS/Physics problem collection in ComPADRE.12
These can be auto-graded in a commercial environment(ExpertTA). Students do readings, review the lecture slides,

and even do some of their homework on supercomputers
they carry in their pockets and backpacks.
It looks so much like what Jack and I had envisioned that I
am both amazed and delighted. Figure 2shows a screenshot
of some of the tools a student can use today.
What I had notenvisioned was the way that the computer
revolution would change how instructors can interact withstudents. In my new high-tech classroom, I had three projec-
tors and screens. Multiple cameras let me show demos, my
writing on the (physical) desktop, and a video all at once. Icould ask the class questions and collect and display theresponses in live time. (CUPLE was pre-clickers!)
When the pandemic hit, I was able to run classes and hold
ofﬁce hours over Zoom, recording lectures and making themeasily available to students who missed classes because asibling had to use the single computer in the house for anelementary-school class. When we had to cancel live labs, Iwas able to create an on-line simulation using a publiclyavailable GitHub simulation that worked like a charm.

While I was excited by this and I see myself as an early
adopter (I ﬁrst used computers—mainframes!—in one of myclasses in 1981), Millennials and Gen-Xers are digitalnatives. Watching them teach with computers can be thrill-ing and awe-inspiring. I watched one of my former grad stu-dents
14be head instructor in one of our IPLS classes in a
SCALE-UP15setting using computers like a true wizard.
He had the students do random-walk coin-ﬂip experiments
at their seats and enter their data in a common Google docsspreadsheet which he then could show to the class as a nor-mal distribution emerged. He used Kahoot
TMto set up short
games where students competed to learn to estimate. Whilestudents were working in groups to solve problems on stand-ing whiteboards, he walked around with his tablet, using itscamera to show notable results to the entire class, and heldwhole class discussions where students tossed a microphonewrapped in a small pillow to the next speaker.Want to include more computing in your class?
