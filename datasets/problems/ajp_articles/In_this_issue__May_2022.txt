Resource letter MDS-1: Mobile devices and sensors
for physics teaching
Mart/C19ın Monteiro and Arturo C. Mart /C19ı
90(5), p. 328
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0073317As the use of mobile devices (smart phones and tablets)
has risen, so has their computational power and connectivity.In addition, with the inclusion of a broad array of built-insensors, mobile devices can provide physics experimentalapparatus to students, especially during the pandemic. This
Resource Letter serves a guide for physicists interested in
teaching a wide variety of experimental physics topics usingthe built-in sensors available in mobile devices.
Quantitative analysis of a smartphone pendulum beyond
linear approximation: A lockdown practical homework
R. Mathevet, N. Lamrani, L. Martin, P. Ferrand, J. P.
Castro, P. Marchou, and C. M. Fabre
90(5), p. 344
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0010073The clever mounting scheme for this smartphone pendulum
reduces frictional loss ( Q/C24500) and allows analysis within
the simple harmonic oscillator (point mass) approximation.For more advanced students, the high quality of the acceler-
ometer data enables students to apply increasingly reﬁned
data analysis techniques that quantify the small non-linearitiesin the system. This exercise was implemented as a take-homelab for undergraduate students but could also be appropriatefor students in an advanced laboratory course who are learn-ing about data analysis and model development.
Gravitational effects of ice sheets on sea level
Douglas A. Kurtze
90(5), p. 351
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0067924Gravity can surprise you! The author considers the gravi-
tational attraction between the Greenland and Antarctic icesheets and the surrounding oceans. This attraction is greatenough that, while the melting of the ice sheets would resultin catastrophic average sea level increases of 7 m and 58 m
respectively, the sea level on the shores of Greenland andAntarctica would actually decrease because of the decreasedgravitational attraction. This effect is illustrated using aseries of models of increasing complexity and accuracy,
starting with a ﬂat-earth point-mass model that could be pre-
sented in an introductory mechanics course and proceedingthrough more realistic models that make good use ofLegendre polynomial expansions taught in introductory
mathematical methods courses.
Simple apparatus for demonstrating factors that
influence lift and drag
Leont /C19yna/C20Sl/C19egrov /C19a and Jan /C20Sl/C19egr
90(5), p. 359
https://doi.org/10.119/10.0009681
This paper shows how to construct a simple apparatus that
enables measurement of the lift and drag forces on an airfoil
as functions of not only air speed but also the airfoil’s proﬁleand angle of attack.
Electrically connected and magnetically coupled
inductors: Aiding or opposing fluxes?
Joseﬁna Mar /C19ıa Silveyra and Juan Manuel Conde Garrido
90(5), p. 365
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0067939Inductors connected in series and parallel, taking mutual
inductance into account, are rarely dealt with in introductory
physics courses. Some surprising behaviors result from the rel-
ative orientations, and the resulting insights could potentiallylead to interesting laboratory circuits and new applications.
Michelson interferometry with a diode laser
Abdulaziz M. Aljalal
90(5), p. 373
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0062798Diode lasers are easily accessible in the teaching laboratory,
and therefore are frequently used in Michelson interferometers.
This paper shows that diode lasers can lase in multiple longitu-dinal modes simultaneously. Instructors of introductory labswill want to be aware of these multiple modes because theycan result in interference signals that may confuse students,
and instructors of more advanced optics labs may ask students
to use the interferometer signal, possibly combined with high-resolution spectrometers, to study these modes.
Simulating epidemics via the theory of dynamical
systems
Georgio Mantica
90(5), p. 380

The author discusses a deterministic agent-based version
of an SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) epidemiologymodel and discusses how it is related to the usual probabilis-tic model because the deterministic model is chaotic. Thesuggested simulations and problems embedded in the textguide the reader to an exploration of the model and underly-ing concepts such as chaos, ergodicity, and networks.
A note on Newton’s shell-point equivalency theorem
B. Cameron Reed
90(5), p. 394
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0072584We all know that the gravitational force due to a spheri-
cally symmetric mass is the same as if all its mass werelocated at a point at its center. That’s Newton’s shell-pointequivalency theorem. But did you know that the equivalency
also holds for the harmonic potential? Or that these are the
only two potentials for which the equivalency holds? This
brief note provides simple proofs of these statements, andalso shows that, unlike the case of Newtonian gravity, the
harmonic oscillator potential yields a non-zero force inside
the shell.
