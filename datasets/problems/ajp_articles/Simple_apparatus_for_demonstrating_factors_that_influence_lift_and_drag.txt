Although the inaccurate explanation of lift based solely on the Bernoulli equation can still be found
in textbooks, there are many places where interested readers can gain a correct understanding.
However, it is complex and involves several physical phenomena. In this paper, we describe asimple device that can be used in teaching to support the understanding of the correct mechanism
of the generation of lift either during lecture demonstrations or in undergraduate laboratory
measurements.

“It is amazing that today, almost 100 years after
the first flight of the Wright Flyer, groups of
engineers, scientists, pilots, and others can gathertogether and have a spirited debate on how an
airplane wing generates lift. Various explanations
are put forth, and the debate centers on whichexplanation is the most fundamental.”
Professor John D. Anderson on occasion
of the centenary of the Wright brothers’ flight
I. INTRODUCTION
People tried to imitate the ﬂight of the birds from antiq-
uity. Many scientiﬁc observations of birds’ ﬂight were
made by Leonardo da Vinci, as we can tell from his diaries.In 1895, Lord Kelvin famously stated that “heavier-than-
air ﬂying machines are impossible” (although he said this
with respect to the energy efﬁciency of engines availableat the time). Figure 1(a) from the very same year shows
Otto Lilienthal making one of his over 2000 successful
ﬂights. Details of historical development can be found inRef. 1or2.
The concept of the lift was for the ﬁrst time introduced by
Georg Cayley in the early 19th century. Brothers Wilbur and
Orville Wright built a simple wind tunnel in 1901, in whichthey measured over two hundred wing proﬁles. They decidedto use thin, highly cambered airfoils resembling the cross
sections of birds’ wings with the thickness to main chord
ratio of 1:24 in their Wright Flyer (Fig. 1(b); for the deﬁni-
tion of the chord see Fig. 2). From today’s point of view,
they chose incorrect scaling due to lack of understanding of
the Reynolds number and details of airfoil ﬂows, but onDecember 17, 1903, they managed to get the Flyer off the
ground using a 12-horsepower engine in Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina.
Even college textbooks explain lift generation by applying
the Bernoulli equation,
3and the same explanation can be found
in ofﬁcial documents of the Federal Aviation Administration.4
Klaus Niermann analyzed German language textbooks and
found that explanations based on Bernoulli’s law have domi-
nated since the 1920s. He found the same to be true for a sur-
vey of contemporary American and English textbooks.5For
details, see, for example, Ref. 6.
According to the Bernoulli principle, the wing must have
the correct shape with the contour line in the upper part
being longer than the lower contour line. The generation ofthe lift force is then explained with the airﬂow around the
upper part of the wing proﬁle ﬂows at a higher speed
Pþ1
2qv2þqgh¼const :
The ﬁrst term here represents pressure energy, the second rep-
resents kinetic energy per unit volume, and the third repre-
sents potential energy per unit volume, qbeing the density of
the ﬂuid, Pthe pressure, and vthe velocity. The higher speed
of the airﬂow around the upper part of the wing is claimed tobe responsible for lift. In the upper part of the wing, where thevelocity is higher, a lower pressure is generated with respectto the ambient pressure; in the lower part of the proﬁle, thespeed of the ﬂow is lower; thus, there is an overpressure.
This explanation is often referred to as the “theory of the
equal transit times,” because it relies on the assumption thattwo air particles separated on the leading edge of the winghave to meet on the trailing edge. This, however, can be
disproved by timestamped images from a wind tunnel (see
Fig.3). Aside from that there is no enclosing channel around
the wing (as we see in many illustrations of the Bernoulliprinciple), so a relatively large volume of air is affected. Forexample, Waltham
7calculated that Cessna 152, a standard
two-seat trainer, signiﬁcantly affects many tonnes of air persecond at a speed of 30 m /C1s
/C01. With turbulent or transient
ﬂow, the situation is even more complicated.
One source of the more correct (but still simpliﬁed) expla-
nation of lift was presented by Babinski (ﬁrst paper,9extended
version10): Planes ﬂy because they divert air downwards and
receive an upwards lift thanks to Newton’s third law. Asidefrom the asymmetrical shape of the wings that directs the airpassing over them downwards instead of straight behind, thereis one crucial parameter usually overlooked by the equal tran-sit time theory: The angle of attack. Airplane wings areattached at an angle, so they divert the air down, and the air-foil shape lets them do so efﬁciently (more efﬁciently than asimpler shape such as a wing with a rectangular cross sec-
tion). Details can be found in Ref. 7or11.
Lift occurs on bodies because they give air circulation.
This mechanism was discovered more than 100 years ago byNikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky and Martin WilhelmKutta.
12Circulation means that the air leaves the trailing
edge of the proﬁle at a different angle than it ﬂows to theleading edge. This change in the air’s momentum creates anaerodynamic force; its vertical component is called lift.

However, the true nature of lift generation is more com-
plex. A recent paper in The Physics Teacher by Doug
McLean13draws attention to the non-uniform velocity and
pressure ﬁelds around the airfoil, which is a consequence ofchanges in ﬂow speed and direction of the air mass.
According to McLean, the cause-and-effect relationship
between pressure and velocity is a reciprocal interaction: Thelifting pressure is a consequence of Newton’s third law; any
upward force on the plane must correspond to a downward
force on the air. However, a combination of Bernoulli’s equa-tion and Newton’s second law explains the path of the air
mass around the wing and its downward diversion that corre-
sponds to the upward force on the wing. There is no “either/or” choice between explanations according to Bernoulli and
explanations according Newton’s third laws, one needs, both
but Bernoulli’s equation must be used correctly.
II. EXAMPLE CALCULATION
As a simple exercise, let us calculate the necessary take-
off speed for an Airbus A380.
14The upper part of the wing
proﬁle is only 1.5% longer than the lower side. (A380 wing
can be approximated at the root as NASA SC(2)-0610 airfoil,
and the tip airfoil is a NASA SC(2)-0606;15both airfoils are
available from on-line database NASA Airfoil Tools16and
lengths of top and bottom parts can be easily calculated.)
According to the same-transit-times theory, the ﬂow velocityshould be 1.5% higher on the upper side of the proﬁle. From
the Bernoulli equation, we ﬁnd
1
2q1:015v2/C0v2 ðÞ ¼Dp; (1)
where qis the density of air, vis the velocity of the aircraft
relative to the air, which we assume is the same as the speedon the lower side of the wing, and Dpis the over-pressure on
the lower side of the wing.
The take-off weight of fully loaded Airbus A380 is 592
tonnes, and the effective area Aof the wings is 1014 m2.
Minimal over-pressure, thus, should be 5 730 Pa. If we useEq.(1)to calculate necessary take-off speed, we ﬁnd (assum-
ing air near sea level at normal atmospheric pressure has a
density of about 1.25 kg /C1m
/C03) the value of take-off speed of
550 m /C1s/C01, more than speed of sound in the air. The actual
airspeed of the Airbus A380 on its last approach to a landing
or as it takes off is 300 km /C1h/C01or roughly 80 m /C1s/C01.
We can work the problem in the opposite direction: If we
know the real take-off speed, we can calculate the lift gener-
ated according to the equal transit times theory from Eq. (1),
ﬁnding Dp¼121 Pa. The lift calculated with the Bernoulli
equation is an order of magnitude less than the value
required for take-off.
It should be noted that this does not mean that the
Bernoulli equation does not apply to the generation of lift. Ina wing ﬂow at high Reynolds number, signiﬁcant direct
effects of viscosity and turbulence are conﬁned to a rela-
tively thin boundary layer adjacent to the surface and a thinwake downstream. The ﬂow outside this viscosity-affected
region behaves as if it was nonviscous and is referred to as
the “outer ﬂow.” Bernoulli’s equation applies accurately inthe outer ﬂow but not in the boundary layer or wake.

III. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS
A simple apparatus was constructed to measure the depen-
dency of lift force on the angle of attack and the shape of the
airfoil. Sections of four airfoils were designed in CAD soft-ware (see Fig. 2) based on the NACA proﬁles from the
UIUC Airfoil database
18and printed using a conventional
3D printer. The 3D prints have chord lengths ranging from
Fig. 1. Otto Lilienthal gliding ﬂight (a) and the ﬂyer built by Wright brothers (b).

58 mm (proﬁle C) to 61 mm (proﬁle B). These 3D models
are available in the supplementary material.19
These airfoils were attached to a dynamometer (see Fig. 4)
that could measure lift and drag forces. The mounts could bepivoted to change the angle of attack. The dynamometer canbe a simple mechanical (Newton) balance; for the laboratory
measurements, a load cell with an ampliﬁer was used to
make the data collection easier.
The standard strain gauge load cell was used with a metal
body made of aluminum to which the strain gauge is secured.This can be obtained for about $10 from many e-shops withelectronics and DIY parts.
20,21The strain gauge is usually con-
structed as a Wheatstone bridge (four balanced resistors with a
known excitation voltage). Ampliﬁers for strain gauge voltagesare widely available; we used a breakout board with a HX711microchip. The HX711 consists of a low-noise voltage ampli-ﬁer and a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which can
be easily connected to an Arduino board via digital pins.
Figure 5shows the connection of the HX711 board to the
load cell and to the Arduino. We strongly recommend twist-ing the excitation wires (red and black) together and signalwires (white and green) together too. This method signiﬁ-
cantly increases the stability of the reading taken by the
Arduino board. Very simple code was used to read the loadcell data, which is also available in supplementary materialand on the web page of the authors.
19
The measured data have to be calibrated. It was necessary
to determine the velocity of the airﬂow. This calibration was
done with an UT363S digital anemometer22placed in the air
stream. The deformation of the strain gauge was convertedto the force units. The strain gauge was gradually loadedwith weights, and the magnitude of the gravitational force at
different load values was determined. Thus, it was possibleto compile the resulting dependence of the lift and drag forceon the speed of the air stream. Air ﬂow was generated by lec-ture demonstration fan allowing continuous adjustment andwith a maximum power of 1 000 W (see author’s website
19
for details and photos).
IV. RESULTS
Figure 6(top images) shows the measured dependencies
of the lift force on the airﬂow velocity for different angles ofattack hfor the 3D-printed wing sections. Fits of function
L¼kv
2were added to the image. If the same transit times
theory were correct, the lift force would be nearly indepen-dent of the angle of attack. However, it is evident from thegraphs that with increasing the angle of attack, the lift forcealso increases. The same conclusion can be made for allmeasured wing proﬁles, including the symmetrical one.
There are evident differences between the proﬁles that are
caused by the fact that sections A and C have a large asym-metry between the top and bottom proﬁles, relative to thesymmetrical section B.
It should be noted that the dependence of drag function on
angle is much smaller than the dependence of lift on angle.
In the ordinary operating range of an airfoil, the drag is
typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the
lift. In these measurements, the values are only some 20%lower, which is very likely caused by the low aspect ratio ofthe models (about one order of the magnitude compared tothat of a typical wing) and to a lesser extent by the frame towhich the wings were attached.
Reynolds numbers for the measured proﬁles at different
velocities can be calculated according to the formula
Re¼
vl
/C23;
where vis the velocity of the ﬂuid, lis a characteristic length
(here, the chord width of the airfoil), and /C23¼1:42/C2
105m2/C1s/C01is the kinematic viscosity of air at sea level.
(Experiments were not performed at sea level, but the kine-matic viscosity is independent of pressure.) For the 3D-printed sections of wings with characteristic lengths rangingfrom 58 to 61 mm, we got values Re ¼3:8/C09:2/C210
4for
velocities from 9.5 to 22 m /C1s/C01.
It should be noted that the reported chord Reynolds num-
bers are in quite low relative to those seen in full-scale

aviation (e.g., 7.5 /C2107for previously mentioned Airbus
A380). These calculated numbers are more in line with thoseof model airplanes ﬂown outdoors by hobbyists. In wind tunnel
testing on reduced-size models of aircraft, several so-called
similarity parameters have to be matched. (For example, theMach number for speeds is high enough that compressibilityeffects are important.) Since the Reynolds number depends onﬂow speed, viscosity, and physical size, it can only be matchedin an actively cooled, pressurized wind tunnel. Airfoils operat-ing in the low-Reynolds-number range can display odd behav-ior. This is especially important in ﬂight because a thickcambered airfoil has a critical Re where its performancechanges drastically. While matching the Reynolds number isessential to testing real aircraft wings, the principles of lift anddrag can be illustrated in the classroom even with these lowvalues of the Reynolds number.
For the lift force, we can write

area projected in a horizontal plane at zero angle of attack.From the measurements, we have the constant kin depen-

qA:
In Table I, there are parameters kandCLfor individual
wing proﬁles. Figure 7shows the dependence of the lift coef-
ﬁcient CLon the angle of attack. It is clear that the angle of
attack is very important for the lift generation, which wouldnot be true if the lift depended only on the equal-transit-time
theory and Bernoulli’s equation. Lift also depends on the
wing camber: Lift at angle of attack h¼0
/C14is zero for proﬁle
B, as expected for a symmetrical section, and from 0.1 to
nearly 0.3 for the cambered sections. Maximum lift at the
right-hand end of the scale is also higher for the cambered
sections, as can be seen from Fig. 7.

V. MAPPING OF THE PRESSURE FIELD
AND FLOW FIELD
It should be noted that experiment studies only the inte-
grated surface forces. Understanding how this surface forceoriginate requires understanding what happens in the ﬂowoff the surface. Demonstrating the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties is
more difﬁcult than the surface forces, but it is worth consid-
ering. Streamlines can be marked by smoke in air or dye inwater. This can be experimentally difﬁcult and too time-consuming for a classroom demo. (Tips for construction ofsuch a device can be found, for example, in Ref. 23or24.)
As an alternative, ﬂow-ﬁeld features can be more easilyexplored with numerical models.There are many possibilities, and the best one can be cho-
sen according to what can help students in their furtherstudy. Good choices for physics students include the compu-tational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulation toolbox
25or simple
2D potential ﬂow simulator script26for M ATLAB or CFD
scripts for use in PYTHON .27Civil or mechanical engineers
might prefer to use CFD tools in the design of software thatthey will use in future. For example, there is a built-in CFDanalytic tool in Solidworks software with many tutorialsavailable.
28,29
For students with no prior background in computer simula-
tions, the cellular automaton can be a good choice.30In this
model, ﬂuid consists of discrete particles that move on a ﬁxedgrid. If a particle meets another particle, both particles adopt anew heading according a set of simple rules. If a particle hitsa foreign object, it bounces off and travels in the opposite
direction. This set of simple rules leads to complex behavior
that follows the natural properties of the ﬂow around bodies.
If the main goal is only to show the properties of the ﬂow
ﬁeld and the lecturer decides not to take this opportunity toteach the topic numerical simulations, simple programs thatdo not require any knowledge of programming or numericalmethods can be used, such as the Flowsquare software,

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a simple apparatus is described that can be
used in the lecture demonstrations to prove the importantrole of the angle of attack for the magnitude of the lift force.
There is also a signiﬁcant effect of wing camber, which is
clearly visible in the C
Lplots. The very same setup can be
used in undergraduate laboratory exercises to consolidatethis knowledge. Although the results obtained using thedescribed equipment are rather qualitative, they are in accor-dance with the theoretical prediction and should help stu-dents understand the factors that affect lift.
