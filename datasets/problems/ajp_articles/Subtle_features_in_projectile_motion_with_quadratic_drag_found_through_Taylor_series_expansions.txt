Many attempts have been made at ﬁnding the trajectory for the projectile problem with quadratic
drag. However, no complete analytical solution is possible due to the nonlinear coupling between
differential equations describing the horizontal ( x) and vertical ( y) velocity components that
result in the ﬁnal trajectory solution, y¼f(x). Over the years, a number of approximate analytical
methods, including Taylor series expansions, have been applied to the problem. However,
whereas prior works expanded Vxby assuming Vx¼Vx(t), the expansion here is based on the
faster converging 1/ Vx(t), whose reciprocal better captures the monotonically decreasing nature
ofVx.#2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the oldest physics problems in human history is at
what angle and how fast something has to be thrown in order
to hit a target of interest. Humans mastering those tech-
niques, from hunting to warfare, were more likely to hit theirprey and be victorious in a battle. Sports, in many of theirvarious forms, encompass a wide range of different methodsto transfer energy to a projectile in order to hit a target, forminganother area where a substantial amount of effort has beenplaced in understanding the nuances of projec tile motion.
1–3
Thus, in all of its applications, it is not surprising that projectile
motion has played major roles in the formal development ofdynamics and even in digital computer design starting withENIAC, the ﬁrst programmable, electronic, general-purpose
digital computer initially developed for the United States
Army to calculate artillery ﬁring tables.
4
In physics education, projectile motion may be studied with
the use of a lab-scale catapult. A typical trajectory, as shownin Fig. 1, begins at the origin (0, 0) in the ascent phase of seg-
ment I when the catapult releases the projectile with a givenlaunch angle and velocity. The projectile rises to a peak at(x
p,yp) and then returns to the plane of origin ( xr,0 )i nt h e
descent phase of segment II. In studies of projectile motion,the trajectory is often limited to segments I and II. SegmentIII is included here to add generality to the trajectory since
projectiles can also be launched from elevated positions.
Thus, if the motion extends past the plane of origin, theprojectile continues to the ﬁnal position ( x
f,yf) in segment III.
In a classroom environment, the projectile’s horizontal
range, whether at the end of segment II or III, is one of thesimpler results to measure compared to component velocitiesand positions as functions of time. However, in order to com-pare the measured range with predicted values, a moresophisticated approach than the standard vacuum trajectorymodel is needed. The model must include drag.
5
Which drag model to use in a particular application
depends on variables such as shape of the projectile, its
speed, and properties of surrounding ﬂuid. These conditions
are typically captured in the non-dimensional Reynolds num-ber, R
e, which expresses the ratio of inertia and viscous
forces.6ForRe/C281, linear models, where the drag force is
proportional to the velocity, are typically used. Linearmodels are relatively straightforward and often included in
ﬁrst-year calculus-based college physics textbooks, wheresolutions are composed of simple elementary functions.
7,8
When Re/C291, the case of interest here, the drag force is
proportional to the square of the velocity. The resulting non-linear equations do not have closed form solutions in termsof elementary functions. A number of different approaches
have been investigated that result in varied approximate ana-
lytical solutions.
9–17Generally speaking, these solutions
qualitatively capture the trajectory but lose their accuracy as
the projectile transitions from segment I to segment II, and
this tendency worsens as launch angles increase.
Solutions using series expansions have also been
reported.18–20However, because of the nonlinearity of the
problem, series components are arduous to calculate and the
resultant truncated series typically have poor applicability dueto slow convergence and eventual divergence. Nevertheless,
Das and Roy
18report a good match with a fourth-order
Runge-Kutta (RK4) solution using a 12th-order series and thePad /C19e approximant, where the series coefﬁcients were found
numerically.
21,22
This work uses a series expansion approach to address
speciﬁc characteristics of the quadratic drag trajectory.However, the goal is not to ﬁnd another approximate solution
for the trajectory but to better understand the nature of the
trajectory by deriving and analyzing analytical expressionsfor the Taylor series coefﬁcients up to sixth order, concen-
trating mostly on the horizontal component in segments I
and II of Fig. 1. The derived expressions describe important
changes in the trajectory as a function of launch angles and
velocities. These results provide insight into why approxi-
mate solutions lose their validity over segments I and II.
The following analysis grew from trying to adapt various
approximate quadratic drag models in the college classroom
for catapults using table tennis balls as projectiles.
23However,
the analysis is scalable to other projectile applications, becausethe model only requires the projectile’s launch angle h, initial
velocity V
0, and terminal velocity Vt, to be known.
II. THE BASIC PROBLEM

motion is proportional to VV, where V¼VxiþVyjis the

where mand Aare the projectile’s mass and cross-
sectional area, respectively, q0is the air density, and cdis a

24Thus, the inﬂuence of the pro-
jectile’s shape on the trajectory is roughly captured
through Eq. (3).
III. RUNGE-KUTTA SOLUTIONS
Figure 2shows the RK4 spreadsheet generated curves for
the accelerations of Eqs. (1)and(2)at angles of 15/C14,4 5/C14,
and 75/C14, for a table tennis ball with an initial launch velocity
of 7.00 m/s. The terminal velocity from Eq. (3)for this pro-
jectile ( m¼0.0027 kg, A¼0.001 26 m2) at sea level ( q0
¼1.225 kg/m3) is about 8.279 m/s using cd¼0.5.24These
values result in k/C250.143/m. Both accelerations in Fig. 2
experience some ﬂuctuations, but the horizontal accelera-tion’s ﬂuctuations at low angles eventually turn into local
maxima at higher angles. (When the launch angle is mostly
or purely vertical ( V
x0!0), Eqs. (1)and(2)are trivial to
solve. For small angles /C2815/C14, a number of small angleapproximations can be used to simplify the problem. For fur-
ther discussions on very small and very large angles, see, for
example, Sec. IVbelow and Ref. 17.)
Figure 3shows the RK4 solutions for Vx,Vy, and Vfrom
Eqs. (1)and(2)for the same conditions as in Fig. 2. The hor-
izontal velocity, Vx, continuously decreases but experiences
ﬂuctuations due to the maxima in the horizontal accelerationof Fig. 2(a), which, in turn, are due to the minima in Vin
Fig.3(c).
We see in Fig. 3(c)that as angles increase, the minima in
Vbecome deeper and the ﬂuctuations in V
xin Fig. 3(a)
become more pronounced. This causes a greater departure
from a strictly decreasing function in Vxthat would be
expected when drag is the only force acting on an object, forexample, as seen in the linear drag horizontal solution
(where there is no coupling between the xandycomponents)
or if V

horizontal. For completeness, Fig. 4gives the trajectories,
y¼f(x), for the conditions given in Figs. 2and 3, and
includes travel into segment III of Fig. 1. The curves in
Fig.4were found from numerical integration of the velocity
curves in Fig. 3to ﬁnd y(t) and x(t).

where anandbnare the Taylor series expansion coefﬁcients
anda0andb0are the initial conditions Vx0andVy0, respec-
tively. The higher orders are derived from the nth deriva-tives, f

Thendots over the variables in Eqs. (6)and(7)refer to their
nth time derivative. Calculating higher order coefﬁcients of
Eqs. (4)and(5), although straightforward, is cumbersome
and laborious due to the nature of Eqs. (1)and(2). However,
the ﬁnal expressions can be somewhat simpliﬁed by using
the relationships Vx0¼V0cos(h) and Vy0¼V0sin(h) and the
deﬁnition R¼V0/Vt. The results up to third-order are given
in Tables IandII.

V. A FASTER AND MORE INTERESTING
EXPANSION
Because the Taylor series solutions of Eqs. (4)and(5)con-
verge very slowly, and by their nature do not provide any imme-diate insight, it is worth looking at a different function whose
expansion converges faster and provides a different and more
interesting perspective. The approach involves expanding 1/ V
x
and analyzing the results for Vx. References 18–20 also use a
form of 1/ Vxin part of their analysis but not to the extent here.
The motivation to expand 1/ Vxis that this expansion yields
a polynomial with a leading term tnin the denominator
instead of in the numerator. This expansion could better cap-
ture the nature of Vxgiven by the RK4 curves of Fig. 3(a)
with fewer coefﬁcients. However, the expansion is not neces-sarily useful for calculating most other trajectory quantitiessuch as range. Its usefulness comes in analyzing trajectorybehavior. (It is not necessary to examine the vertical solutionsince the V
xexpansion alone provides the needed informa-
tion for the trajectory analysis of interest here.)

The coefﬁcients derived above have a common 1 =Vx0term;
thus, the horizontal velocity to sixth order can be written as

(16)where cn¼Vx0fnt¼0ðÞ and the ﬁrst two terms are given
explicitly to show similarity to the previous derivation inEq.(9). As in the previous case for the V
xcoefﬁcients in
Table I, the coefﬁcients of Eq. (16) can be further expanded
in terms of handR. The results are given in Table IIIup to
fourth order.
The expansion coefﬁcients in Table Ialternate signs
based on their order but never change signs as a function ofthe launch angle, initial velocity, and terminal velocity(h,R¼V
0/Vt). However, some of the coefﬁcients in Table
IIIdo change signs depending on these three values. These
are listed in Table IV. The conditions in Table IVcan be
readily veriﬁed through visual inspection of the expressionsin Table IIIforc
0–c4. The expressions for c5andc6,f r o m
Eqs. (14) and(15), are too complex for simple analysis;
however, the behaviors for these two orders were foundfrom numerically analyzing the expressions over a range ofhandRinput values. Curves generated from Eq. (16) for
each order and for the same conditions in Figs. 2and3are
shown in Fig. 5.
The truncated Taylor series expansions of Eqs. (4)and(5)
will eventually result in inﬁnite quantities as t!1 depend-
ing if the two series are truncated at even or odd orders.However, the polynomial in Eq. (16) may have singularities
if a particular order has real positive roots at chosen initialconditions. Focusing on segments I and II of the trajectories,
when these roots occur well outside of segments I and II,
their appearance is mostly unimportant since they have littleinﬂuence on the area of interest.

Forh!90/C14andR/C291(V0!1 orVt!0), Eq. (17) gives
tð2Þ
r!2V0/g, which is the time for a round trip of an object
thrown vertically in the air without drag.
The second-order root in Eq. (17) may occur past seg-
ments I and II for most, if not all, values of angles and veloc-ities. In the 15
/C14case of Fig. 5(a), the second-order curve
ﬂattens near 2.5 s and begins to curve upward, correspondingto the second-order singularity at tð2Þ
r/C256.4 s.
For the larger angles in Figs. 5(b) and5(c), the second-
order behavior is clearly displayed. As launch anglesincrease, tð2Þ
rmoves toward segments I and II, and since c 2is
always negative, the second-order minimum, where the
curve begins to increase, moves into segments I and II at a
time given by
t2ðÞ
m¼V0
gsinhðÞ; (18)
which is independent of Rand, for h!90/C14, is the time an
object thrown vertically into the air without drag reaches its
peak.
The behavior of the second-order coefﬁcient takes on
greater signiﬁcance when tied to the third-order coefﬁcient
and the third-order polynomial. The coefﬁcient, c3, changes
signs as a function of handR. The angle, hd, where the sign
change occurs is found by setting the third-order coefﬁcient
in Table IIIequal to zero. The equation for sin( hd) has the
solution
sinhdðÞ¼/C0R2þﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
R4þ4p
2: (19)
For the table tennis catapult with R¼V0/Vt/C250.846, Eq.
(19) gives hd/C2544.8/C14. (As a note of interest, when R¼1,
sin(hd)¼(/C0u,1 /u), where uis the golden ratio ¼1.618 03
…. The positive root is the golden ratio conjugate, 1/ u, giv-
inghd/C2538.2/C14.)
The coefﬁcient c3is an important system parameter
because, as it approaches zero with changing launch angle, it
causes the third-order polynomial in Eq. (16) to have a posi-
tive root. Being a third-order polynomial, the time of the sin-
gularity can be given in the closed form but is too
cumbersome to calculate, express, and use. What is more
useful is the time of the third-order polynomial’s minimum,
which requires ﬁnding the root of its second-order derivative.
The minimum occurs at

The root of Eq. (20) is real only when the expression
under the radical in the numerator is positive. This condition
deﬁnes the critical angle, hc, given by
sinhcðÞ¼/C0R2þﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
R4þ6p
3: (21)
Thus, third-order minima only occur when h/C21hc. When
this occurs, the maxima in Fig. 2(a) appear, and the third-
order coefﬁcient, in conjunction with the second-order
coefﬁcient, critically inﬂuences the higher-order solutions in
segments I and II as shown in the changes in the fourth and
higher-order curves from Figs. 5(a)–5(c) . This is not surpris-
ing, since the third-order coefﬁcient is related to the deriva-
tive of the acceleration shown in Fig. 2(a). In essence, hc
provides a marker where analytical approximations begin to
worsen in their ability to model the trajectory.
The graphs in Fig. 5clearly show the long-range effects
in the higher orders due to the second and third-order coef-
ﬁcients. They also show how much faster Eq. (16) con-
verges compared to Eq. (4), where, for the latter equation,
at mid to higher angles many higher orders are required to
approximate just the ascent phase.18For the table tennis

example, the small difference between the second and third
orders in Fig. 5(b) is due to hc/C2537.8/C14andhd/C2544.8/C14being
just under 45/C14.
Although, as stated earlier, calculating trajectories is not
a goal of this work, it is of some interest to at least considerwhat the calculated ranges would be from the curves ofFig. 5. From visual inspection, one can conclude that the
range calculations over segments I and II from the numeri-cally integrated horizontal velocities of Fig. 5(a) should
show good to excellent agreement between the RK4result and the various polynomial integrations with thisagreement decreasing as the launch angle increases in Figs.5(b) and5(c). Figure 6compares the range, x(t), between
the RK4 solution and the sixth-order polynomial for 75
/C14
from Fig. 5(c). At the return to launch plane point, RK4
gives a range of 1.63 m at t/C251.20 s, whereas the sixth-
order polynomial gives 1.70 m at the same time.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
An analytical solution for projectile motion with quadratic
drag cannot be obtained due to the nonlinear couplingbetween the differential equations describing the horizontaland vertical components. Although a number of approximatetrajectory solutions have been derived, these approximatesolutions have the common limitation of worsening aslaunch angles increase and as the projectile transitions fromthe ascend phase to the descend phase. In this paper, detailedTaylor series coefﬁcients, up to the sixth order, were derivedfor a projectile’s horizontal velocity when expressed as thereciprocal of the expansion of 1/ V
x(t). The coefﬁcients were
given in terms of the launch angle hand the ratio of the ini-
tial velocity to terminal velocity, R¼V0/Vt. The solutions
include expressions for the critical times and angles thatdeﬁne when important changes in trajectory characteristicsoccur. The derived relationships clearly demonstrate whyapproximate solutions fail as the launch angles approach thederived critical angle, and why their performance dropsdramatically in time as they enter the descending segment ofthe trajectory. A question that remains open is whetherapproximate analytical solutions exist that can capture the
required, albeit subtle, trajectory characteristics presented
here.
