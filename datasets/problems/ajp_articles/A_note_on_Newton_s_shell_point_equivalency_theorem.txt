An isotropic sphere or shell of matter can be regarded as acting as a point mass at its center so far as
its gravitational force on an external test mass is concerned. This is well-known, but what is often
not appreciated is that this behavior also holds for a central potential of the harmonic form V(r)/C24r2.
This paper proves this assertion and shows that only the gravitational and harmonic potentials
possess this property. #2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION
Newton’s theorem that an isotropic shell or sphere can be
regarded as acting as a point mass located at its center when
computing the force it exerts on an external test mass is acornerstone of his gravitational theory and its application tocelestial mechanics. This beautiful result can be regarded
as a manifestation of the inverse-square nature of the gravita-
tional force or, equivalently, of its corresponding inverse-ﬁrst-power potential. Richard Feynman describes thistheorem in almost supernatural terms: “When we add theeffects all together, it seems a miracle that the net force is
exactly the same as we would get if we put all the mass in
the middle!”
1
Proofs of this theorem and its corollary that a test mass
trapped within a uniform spherical shell experiences no netforce can be found in Feynman and many mechanics and
dynamics texts in common use; these usually proceed by
integrating the potential and then extending the argument toa solid sphere.
2–7An exception is Goldstein’s venerable
Classical Mechanics , where he probably considered the
proof too trivial for this more advanced text.8Grifﬁths ana-
lyzes the equivalent electrostatic case for a uniform shell of
electrical charge via both Gauss’s law and direct integrationof the potential, leaving to an exercise a direct integration ofthe electric ﬁeld.
9Another approach to the interior of a uni-
form shell beng force-free is to imagine an off-center test
mass equipped with an observer who looks at patches of theshell in opposite directions which subtend the same solidangle. Since the areas of the patches will be proportionalto the squares of the observer’s distances to them but the
forces they exert depend on the inverse squares of these dis-
tances, the forces exerted by the two patches are equal andcancel; the argument is then extended to cover the entiresphere. If the force were not inverse-square, this argument
would obviously break down and the test mass would experi-
ence a net force; this point will be revisited later. This force-free behavior inside the shell is, however, entirely irrelevantto Newton’s issue of wanting to prove that the force exertedby the shell on an external test mass acts as if the entire mass
of the shell were concentrated at its center; a priori , there is
no reason that gravity hasto be inverse-square.
More advanced students may be aware that if gravity were
instead a linear attractive force, planetary orbits would stillbe closed ellipses, albeit with the attracting mass being
located at the geometric center of the ellipse as opposed to
being at one of the foci; this motion also arises with a mass
attached to springs that extend off to the xandydirections.
While these are obviously quite different scenarios, it isstriking that both inverse-square and linear forces give rise
to closed elliptical orbits. It can be shown that the gravita-
tional and harmonic potentials are, in fact, the only integer-
power ones that can support closed orbits. This behavior is
now regarded as a manifestation of Bertrand’s theorem,
which received its own section in the second edition of
Goldstein’s book. A paper recently published in this journal
offers a more advanced look at the dynamical symmetries
underlying this powerful theorem.
10However, none of these
sources point out that the harmonic potential also satisﬁes
shell-point equivalency just like its gravitational cousin, and
that it is the only other power-law potential which does so. A
proof of this assertion is a straightforward extension of the
usual gravitational case and is developed here. This is not a
new result, but it seems not to be well known in the physics
teaching community. That this is the case ﬁrst came to my
attention when it appeared in a paper on cosmology,although this is likely not the ﬁrst source to point this out.11
The purpose of this paper is to bring this behavior to wider
attention. To give this development a motivation for class-
room use, pose the following situation to your students:
“Imagine that you are Newton, but you can use the full
machinery of calculus and potential theory now taught to
physics students. You hypothesize that gravity is a central
power-law force such that the force exerted by an element of
mass dMof a uniform shell on an external test mass mis
F¼þKnmðdMÞrn/C01^r, where ris the element-to-test mass
distance and ^ris a unit vector from the element to the test
mass. The potential energy is then UðrÞ¼/C0 KmðdMÞrn, and
the potential function is VðrÞ¼UðrÞ=m¼/C0KðdMÞrn. Now
consider these two questions. First, for what value(s) of the
power ndoes point-shell equivalency hold? Second, of these
possible values, which gives a period-distance behavior con-
sistent with Kepler’s Third Law, T2/r3? For this latter
question, assume a circular orbit and invoke a simple cen-tripetal force argument.” Note that if K<0a n d n<0(n>0)
the force will be repulsive (attractive) and the reverse
for K>0, but these considerations do not affect the
conclusions.

II. SHELL-POINT EQUIVALENCY
See Fig. 1. A spherical shell of radius Rand areal mass
density ris located with its center at the origin. As usual, a
ﬁeld point is located at distance zfrom the center along
thez-axis, and a patch of surface of area of the shell dA
¼R2sinhdhd/is located at spherical coordinates ðh;/Þ.
The patch will have mass dM¼rR2sinhdhd/. Let the
patch-to-ﬁeld-point distance be r; from the law of cosines
r2¼z2þR2/C02zRcosh: (1)
As described above, the potential is written in the generalized
power-law form V¼/C0KðdMÞrn¼/C0KrR2rnsinhdhd/,
where nis intended to be an integer. The units of Kwill depend
on the choice of n;w h e n n¼–1 ,s e t K!Gto recover the
Newtonian case. The total potential at the ﬁeld point is, after
accounting for a factor of 2 pwhen integrating over /,
V¼/C02pKrR2ðp
0rnsinhdh: (2)
Setting a¼z2þR2;b¼2zRand making the substitution
w¼bcoshsimpliﬁes this to
V¼pKrR
zð/C0b
bða/C0wÞn=2dw: (3)
Forn6¼/C02 (which is discussed below), this integral is
straightforward and reduces to
V¼/C0KM
2ðnþ2ÞzRðzþRÞnþ2/C0ðz/C0RÞnþ2hi
; (4)
where Mis the total mass of the shell. This form assumes
z>R;i fz<R, replace ðz/C0RÞwithin the square brackets by
ðR/C0zÞ. For K¼Gandn¼– 1, this reduces to the standard
form/C0GM=z.
Assume that n>/C02. The two terms within the square
bracket can then be expanded using the binomial theorem

The force on the test mass is then

/C2ðnþ1/C0jÞzn/C0jRj/C01^z: (6)
Clearly, no even- jterms will survive because of the term
in square brackets.
Shell-point equivalency means that all terms in Fmust be
independent of R. Cases of interest can be analyzed very
directly:
(a) If n¼– 1, the only surviving term in the sum will be
that for j¼1, giving F¼/C0 ð KMm =z2Þ^z, the Newtonian
result.
(b) For n¼0, again only j¼1 contributes, but the factor of
ðnþ1/C0jÞwithin the sum vanishes. There is no net
force, exactly as one would expect for V¼constant.
(c) For n¼þ1, there are non-vanishing terms in the sum
forj¼1 and j¼3. The ﬁrst of these is independent of
Ras in case (a) above, but the second gives a term of
the form R2=z, destroying point-shell equivalency.
(d) For n¼þ2, the harmonic potential, the non-vanishing
terms in the sum are again j¼1 and j¼3. In this case,
however, the contribution from the j¼3 term vanishes
because ðnþ1/C0jÞreduces to zero. The j¼1 term
yields F¼ð2KMmz Þ^z, which possesses point-shell
equivalency. If K>0 as with the Newtonian case, this
will be a repulsive force. This might seem strange but
can be understood via energy conservation. The poten-tial in this case is V¼/C0KMz
2. A repulsive force will
endow a test mass with increasing kinetic energy; as z
increases, the potential energy must correspondingly
become more negative.
(e) For n>2, there will be terms arising from j¼1;3;
5;…, but terms from the factor of Rj/C01in Eq. (6)will
survive, destroying point-shell equivalency.
As for other possibilities, setting n¼– 2 in Eq. (3)leads to
a logarithmic form for Vwhere terms in Rremain; similarly,
forn</C02, the terms in the potential cannot be brought to a
common denominator without the appearance of offendingR-terms. For non-integer values of n, the ﬁnite binomial
expansions will become inﬁnite binomial series, not all of
the terms of which can be forced to vanish through the fac-tors of ðnþ1/C0jÞ, so point-shell equivalency will be impos-
sible. Only n¼– 1 and n¼þ2 can give equivalency.
The question regarding Kepler’s third law is easier to deal
with. For a satellite of mass min a circular orbit of speed v
and radius raround an attractor mass, the magnitude of the
centripetal force must be mv
2=r. Set v¼2pr=Tto get this in
terms of the period T. For our general power law, the magni-
tude of the force is jKnjmMrn/C01, which gives
T2¼4p2
jKnjMr2/C0n: (7)

Only n¼– 1 satisﬁes the empirical form of Kepler’s third
law. For the harmonic case where n¼2, the period is
independent of the orbital radius, analogous to how the
period of a mass-spring system is independent of its initial
displacement.
As implied in the Introduction, another point of differ-
ence between the harmonic and Newtonian cases is that
the net force is notzero within the shell for the harmonic
case: F¼/C0 ð 2KMmz Þ^z.I fK>0ð<0Þ, the force will be
attractive toward (repulsive from) the center with the
result that the center will be a point of stable (unstable)
equilibrium. Worthwhile student exercises might be
to check this by direct integration and also to use the
solid-angle reasoning to conﬁrm the stability/instability
conclusion.
That the harmonic and gravitational potentials both give
closed orbits and shell-point equivalency is presumably not acoincidence; I leave it to readers with more advanced com-
mand of dynamics to explore what underlying similarities
make this so. Sometimes, a fresh look at an old problem
reveals new insights.
I am grateful for comments and suggestions from
reviewers who considered an earlier version of this paper. Inparticular, one reviewer encouraged me to consider the
development of Eq. (6)more closely.

Reference 31 of the original paper1contains two arithmet-
ical errors and one bibliographical error. The conclusion,however, remains correct. The footnote should read:
The book The Second Law by P. W. Atkins (Scientiﬁc
American Books, New York, 1984) promotes the idea that
entropy is a measure of homogeneity. (This despite theeveryday observation of two-phase coexistence.) To buttressthis claim, the book presents ﬁve illustrations (on pages 72,74, 75, and 77) of “equilibrium lattice gas conﬁgurations.”Each conﬁguration has 100 occupied sites on a 40 /C240 grid.
If the occupied sites had been selected at random, then theprobability of any site being occupied would be 100/1600,and the probability of any given pair of sites both beingoccupied would be ð1=16Þ
2. The array contains 2 /C240/C239
adjacent site pairs, so the mean number of occupied adjacentpairs would be 2 /C240/C239/C2ð1=16Þ2¼12:19. The actual
numbers of occupied adjacent pairs in the ﬁve illustrations are
7, 3, 7, 4, and 3. A similar calculation shows that the mean
number of empty rows or columns in a randomly occupiedarray is 2 /C240/C2ð15=16Þ40¼6:05. The actual numbers for
the ﬁve illustrations are 5, 5, 4, 4, and 0. I am conﬁdent thatthe sites in these illustrations were occupied not at random,but rather to give the impression of uniformity.
