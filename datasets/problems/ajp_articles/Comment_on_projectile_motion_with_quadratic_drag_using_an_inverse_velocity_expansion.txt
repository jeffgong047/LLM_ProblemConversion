I. INTRODUCTION
In a recent paper,1I derived an inverse series expansion
for the horizontal velocity of a projectile with quadraticdrag. The expression is given by
V
x¼Vx0
c0þc1tþc2t2=2!þc3t3=3!þ/C1/C1/C1; (1)
where Vx0is the initial velocity and the coefﬁcients c0(¼1)
through c6are given in my referenced paper.2The derived
expression converges faster than a traditional Taylor seriesand does provide new insight into the motion. However, I do
not use Eq. (1)to calculate ﬁnal trajectories, because it does
not easily lead to workable solutions using the horizontal andvertical equations of motion directly from Newton’s second
law. Nevertheless, as discussed below, with some further
manipulations, Eq. (1)can lead to trajectory solutions.
Although pursuing this problem may seem unimportant
considering the ubiquitous use of numerical computer
methods, it is still educationally instructive to look at these
solutions to better understand the physical nature of theproblem. See, for example, Ref. 3, where student experi-
mental trajectory results were compared to numerical simu-
lations. Just as experimentation is an integral part of astudent’s education, analytical solutions, even if approxi-
mate, add an extra degree of understanding to any physical
problem.
II. CALCULATING VELOCITIES
AND DISPLACEMENTS
Das and Roy
4investigated trajectories using the horizontal
and vertical velocities, Vxand Vy, respectively, in terms of
new variables p¼1/Vx and q¼Vy/Vx. They showed
substituting these expressions into Newton’s second lawresults in the relationships

They went on to show in Ref. 4that Eq. (2)relationships do
not lead to any new or signiﬁcant improvements to the qua-dratic drag solution.
However, using the deﬁnitions of qandpin the dq/dt term
on the far right of Eq. (2)gives the direct relationship
between the velocities asV
y¼/C0 gVxðdt
Vx: (3)
Substituting Vxof Eq. (1)into Eq. (3)gives the vertical
velocity as
Vy¼/C0 g/C0Vy0=gþtþc1t2=2!þc2t3=3!þ/C1/C1/C1
1þc1tþc2t2=2!þ/C1/C1/C1: (4)
The term /C0Vy0/g in Eq. (4)is the constant of integration
from the requirement Vy(t¼0)¼Vy0.
The horizontal and vertical displacements, x(t) and y(t),
respectively, are found from integrating Eqs. (1)and(4)by
partial fractions resulting in5

ytðÞ¼ð
VytðÞdt¼b1tþb2t2þXn
i¼1Biln½1þt=ri/C138dt:(6)
The r iterms in Eq. (5)are the roots of Eq. (1),a n dt h eA iterms
are the coefﬁcients determined in the partial fraction process.
The coefﬁcients b iand B iin Eq. (6)are also related to the roots
of Eq. (1),a n dt h eb iterms speciﬁcally arise from reducing the
improper fraction of Eq. (4)to a proper fraction before inte-
grating. The constants of integration are included in the expres-
sions of Eqs. (5)and (6)where x(t¼0)¼y(t¼0)¼0.
Examples using Eqs. (5)and(6)are given below.

Similar equations were derived by Warburton et al. ,6assum-
ingVy/C28Vx(equivalent to assuming small launch angles) in
the original equations of motion from Newton’s second law.
Setting Eq. (8)to zero gives the time to reach the peak, tp,
as

The peak range and height are found by substituting Eq. (11)
into Eqs. (9)and(10), respectively. The trajectory, y(x),i s
found by solving Eq. (9)fortand placing the result into Eq.

The range, or value of x when the projectile returns to the
launch plane, is found by setting Eq. (12) to zero and solving
for the root xr. Since Eq. (12) is transcendental, a number of
approaches can be used to ﬁnd the range and time of ﬂight
including simple expansions of the exponential term,
Newton’s method (or similar methods), or the Lambert func-tion as explained in Ref. 6.
B. Second-order solution
The second-order solutions from Eqs. (1)and(4)–(6) are
given by

As an example of the ﬁrst and second-order solutions, we
look at representative values for a javelin thrown in athleticcompetitions using a terminal velocity of V
t/C25207 m/s and an
initial velocity of V0/C2528 m/s. The expansion coefﬁcients are
deﬁned in terms of the initial launch angle, h, and a unitless
parameter deﬁned as R¼V0/Vt. For the javelin case, R/C250.14.
Using a Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical solution
for comparison, the ﬁrst-order, second-order, and RK4trajectories for h¼45/C14are indistinguishable graphically,
except at very high resolutions. However, the calculated peaktimes in seconds for the ﬁrst-order, second-order, and RK4solutions are 2.006, 2.008, and 2.008, respectively. Therespective ranges, in meters, are 78.603, 78.934, and 78.832with the return times in seconds of approximately 4.020 for
the ﬁrst and second order cases and 4.022 for the RK4
solution.
Using R/C252.25 (for example, a golf ball), the ﬁrst and
second-orders agree quite well with the RK4 results upthrough mid-range angles. Although golf ball trajectories sel-dom occur at angles much greater than 45
/C14, we can still
examine projectiles with the same approximate Rvalue but
released at a higher angle. At h¼65/C14, the separations in the
three solutions from Eqs. (7)–(10) , for the ﬁrst-order, and
Eqs. (13)–(16) , for the second-order, can be seen in Fig. 1.
C. Higher order solutions
Adding higher orders does not change the fundamental alge-
braic nature of the solutions. Finding VxandVyfrom Eqs. (1)
and(4), respectively, only involves determining the required
coefﬁcients but no changes in computational methods them-
selves. However, as I mentioned in Ref. 1, calculating higher
order coefﬁcients becomes increasing burdensome, althoughthere are several simpliﬁcations that makes ﬁnding higherorder coefﬁcients somewhat easier. Including those methodshere takes us too far from the main discussion of interest.Nevertheless, the next three coefﬁcients of the V
xexpansion
are given in Table I.
Solving for x(t)of Eq. (5), as more orders are added, aside
from ﬁnding the roots, is still a straightforward process.
However, the calculation for y(t) of Eq. (6) requires
Fig. 1. First-order, second-order, and RK4 ranges for R¼2.25 and h¼65/C14.

calculating the band Bcoefﬁcients, which becomes more
algebraically difﬁcult as higher orders are added.
An interesting aspect as Rincreases for higher-orders is the
second-order dominates the overall solution and a common root
is retained in the denominator of Eq. (3)and in the numerator of
Eq.(4). Having these common approximate roots allows factor-
ing them out which reduces the complexity of ﬁnding the roots
of the mid-range third and fourth-order expressions.
Figure 2shows the sixth-order, seventh-order, and RK4
curves for the same case of Fig. 1. Although it seems, based
only on the range, the higher order solutions are not improve-
ments to the second order of Fig. 1, note as the orders increase,
the solutions do follow the RK4 curve further into segment II
compared to lower order solutions with the ﬁnal range point
ﬂuctuating about and approaching the RK4 value.
D. Special case solution: sin( h)ﬁ90/C14
We now examine the case of the projectile released at a
steep angle. At steep angles, the sine terms in the Vxexpan-
sion are /C251, and the resultant expressions roughly cancel
leaving only the leading term in R. Under these conditions,
the coefﬁcients break out into two distinct sine and cosineseries. Therefore, the resultant expression from Eq. (1)forV
x
is given by

V0/C18/C19
: (20)Equation (17) is similar to the result given in Ref. 6.
However, Eq. (19) differs from their result by having the
additional secant function due to the differences in method-ologies and assumptions used here and those used in Ref. 6.
If the projectile is released at exactly 90
/C14, then Vx0¼0,
Vy0¼V0, and Cvy¼0, thus leaving only the tangent function
of Eq. (19), which is the solution for a projectile launched
vertically. Another important difference between the resultshere and the corresponding solution in Ref. 6is the latter
process required splitting the problem into ascent anddescent solutions resulting in two different solution sets. Theresults here apply through the trajectory’s ascent and
descent.
The equations for x(t)andy(t)are found from integrating
Eqs. (17) and(19) and are given by

The results above can be used to ﬁnd the various quantities
of interest as in the earlier cases.
The trajectories from Eq. (24) compared to RK4 trajecto-
ries show good correlations for R<1, but worsen as R
increases. Figure 3shows trajectories from Eq. (24) against
the RK4 trajectory for an arrow, or arrow like projectile withh¼80

E. Conclusions
The performance of approximate quadratic drag trajectory
solutions typically is measured by how well they perform asa function of the launch angle only, where it is often the casethat accuracy decreases as angles increase. However, theexpansion method used here emphasizes both the launchangle hand the ratio of the initial and terminal velocities
(expressed as the parameter R) are equally important in
determining model accuracies, and several representativeexamples were given with fair to excellent results. However,even for those cases where the equations perform poorly forparticular combinations of handR, the explicit introduction
of the Rparameter provides insight into the basic physics
and dynamics of the quadratic drag problem. Coupled withthe simplicity of the equations and their derivations, theypotentially have great utility in physics education. They pro-vide a simple and relatively accurate framework to verifyand compare initial conditions and other input parameters to
the results of classroom demonstrations or student experi-
ments. As mentioned in the introduction, a physical model,
even if approximate, adds an extra degree of understandingto any physical problem. Often this important link is some-
times overlooked, lost, or difﬁcult to see in numerical
simulations.
