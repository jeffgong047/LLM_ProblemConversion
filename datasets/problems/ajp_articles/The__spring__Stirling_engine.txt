I. INTRODUCTION
In a previous paper published in this journal, we devel-
oped an alternative approach for the Stirling cycle thatachieved theoretical results, which showed better agreementwith experimental data than the usual textbook approach.
1
Using expressions developed in that work and inspired by atoy Stirling engine known as the “marble” engine, we pro-pose here a new theoretical Stirling engine.
2This engine,
which we call the spring engine, possesses the same essentialphysics as the marble engine but can be analyzed with stan-
dard analytic techniques.
II. FROM THE MARBLE TO THE SPRING ENGINE
The marble engine can be built very cheaply and easily,
and its operation can be understood through the behavior ofan ideal gas.
3In this device, the air displacer of a Stirling
engine is replaced by glass marbles within a test tube; themarbles cyclically sweep the working gas (air) from one endof the tube to the other. Typical values of the period sare
experimentally found to be of the order of 1 s, and the enginecan run for hours so long as there is a sufﬁcient temperaturedifference between the tube ends. However, a detailed analy-sis of the performance of the marble engine is difﬁcult as itinvolves chaotic dynamics.
In order to quantitatively address the essence of the marble
engine, we make the following modiﬁcations (see Fig. 1): (i)
The marbles are replaced by a single cylinder of mass m,
length d, and a cross-section slightly smaller than the cross-
section of the tube. This cylinder displaces the air in the tubefrom the cold side to the hot side and vice-versa. (ii) Thetube is ﬁxed and lies horizontally. Inside the tube is placedan ideal spring of constant kwith one of its ends attached to
the displacer and the other to one end of the tube. Asdescribed below, this arrangement produces a periodicmovement of the displacer that simulates the recurrent move-ment of the marbles in the original device. By imagining that
we can use some of the engine’s work to secure the dis-
placer’s oscillation, we allow ourselves to disregard friction.(iii) The original power piston is replaced by a liquid pistonconsisting of a U-tube partially ﬁlled with liquid and con-nected to one end of the tube; the other end of the U-tube isopen to the atmosphere (pressure P
0). The volume of the gas
changes due to the motion of the liquid piston, and the workproduced by the engine acts on the liquid.
Our theoretical analysis of the spring engine, which is
summarized in Sec. III, assumes that there exists two zones
that can be distinguished by their uniform temperatures inthe volume occupied by the gas; we label these as 1 and 2.Zone 2 is the hot zone where the gas is in contact with thereservoir at the external temperature T
h, which is maintained
by the candle, and zone 1 is the cold zone where the gas is in
contact with the external environment at temperature Tc. The
gas is never completely in either the hot or the cold zone, butits pressure Pis the same everywhere. Consequently, the gas
density must be different in each zone to keep the same pres-
sure with different temperatures. Zone 1 includes the gas inthe right side of the liquid.
To start the engine, we must set the liquid and/or the dis-
placer in motion. One way to do this could be to start with
the liquid at rest, move the displacer out of its equilibrium
position, and then release it. With the displacer in motion,energy transfer between the hot and cold zones begins and
can be described as follows; we focus on the movement of
the displacer, supposing the liquid to be at rest. When thegas is swept by the displacer to the hot (cold) zone (throughthe loose ﬁt that connects both chambers) it expands (con-
tracts), the gas pressure increases (decreases), and the gas
pushes the liquid down (up). The air pressure on the rightside of the liquid depends on the displacer’s motion, but that,
at left side, remains at atmospheric pressure; this pressure
difference sets the liquid in motion. If we now incorporatethe motion of the liquid, the net motion of air between zones
1 and 2 depends on the phase of the relative motions of the
displacer and the liquid, which results in a cyclical transferof energy from the high temperature zone 2 to the liquid pis-ton of zone 1. The phase of this motion is a crucial parameter
for the efﬁciency and the power delivered by the engine. We
show below that the optimum phase is around /¼p=2.
III. DYNAMICS OF THE SPRING ENGINE
In this section, we offer a brief analysis of the theory
behind the spring engine; a real device is not likely to behave
so ideally. Because the gas pressure on both sides of the dis-placer is the same, the movement of the displacer will be due
only to the spring. We model this as a harmonic oscillator
with a frequency given by

with displacement

So far as the dynamics of the liquid are concerned, the
pressures on its right side ( P) and left side ( P0) give rise to a
net force proportional to P/C0P0. We also introduce an exter-
nal force proportional to the velocity of the liquid which will
be responsible for dissipating the useful power delivered bythe gas to the liquid. Overall, the dynamics of the liquid are

ment z,

where qis the liquid density, ais the cross-sectional area,
lis the length of the liquid column, bis a damping coefﬁ-
cient, and gis the acceleration due to gravity. To solve this
equation for z(t), an explicit expression for the dependence
ofPon the parameters of the system is required. In a previ-
ous work, we obtained a generic analytic solution for thepressure inside a Stirling engine that depends on the volumesV
1andV2of the respective zones and on the total gas volume
V¼V1þV2; this is Eq. (18) of Ref. 1,

V1,V2, and V, respectively, and bis a parameter called poly-
tropic index. Typical values of bare such that 1 /C20b/C20c,
with c¼1:4 for a diatomic gas. In Eq. (4), we have set the
gas pressure inside of the engine as P0when the volumes
have their initial values.
Assuming that both the test tube and U-tube have the
same cross-section area a, the volumes of the zones 1 and 2
can be expressed as (see Fig. 1)
V1¼V10þaðxþzÞ;V2¼V20/C0ax; (5)
where the displacements xandzare taken from their initial
positions when the engine is not yet running; we take these tobex¼z¼0. Substituting Eqs. (5)in Eq. (4)gives the
explicit dependence of Ponxandz. This dependence is rather
complicated and implies that Eq. (3)is a non-linear differen-
tial equation in z. Therefore, Eq. (3)does not necessarily have
periodic solutions in general, in which case, the system couldnot be used as a cyclical engine. However, the engine can be
designed in such a way that the geometry of the hot and cold
volumes satisfy the following reasonable relations:
ajxj=V
10/C281;ajzj=V10/C281: (6)
In this case, the left-hand sides of Eq. (6)can be treated as
perturbations in Eq. (4). Keeping only the ﬁrst terms in bothzandxof the expansion and substituting in Eq. (3), a linear

From Eq. (10), it is clear that the engine generates no work if
a¼1 (that is, if there is no temperature difference between
the reservoirs) or /¼0, and also that, from Eq. (11), the
amplitude zsis maximized if xp¼xd(/¼p=2). Moreover,
when a!1 ,zstends to a ﬁnite value. The theoretical pres-
sure–volume ( P–V) diagram can be obtained using Eqs. (2),
(4),(5), and (9).

Using Eqs. (2),(4),(5),(9), and (12) and the conditions of

This result indicates that the work per cycle is constant,
dictated by the initial volumes of the hot and cold zones ofthe tube and the initial position of the displacer.
We have run numerical simulations for the spring engine,
setting dimensions and values for the various parameters tobe similar to those of the marble engine. Results of thesesimulations, including a P–Vdiagram, can be found in the
supplementary material.
4Our simulations indicate periods of
the order of s/C240:1s .
IV. FINAL REMARKS
The dynamics of the spring engine can be solved using
standard techniques to linearize and solve a second-order dif-ferential equation. Our main theoretical conclusions are asfollows: (i) The work per cycle is constant, dictated by theinitial volumes of the hot and cold zones of the tube and theinitial position of the displacer; (ii) the phase /betweenthe liquid and the displacer determines the power of the
engine, with maximum work achieved at a resonance when/¼p=2; and (iii) to extract work from the engine, the tem-
perature ratio T
h=Tcmust exceed unity, with the work
becoming independent of this ratio as Th=Tc!1 .
The drawbacks of the spring engine are that it will not be
as easy to construct as a marble engine, and since it willhave a shorter period than the marble engine, any energy-loss compensation mechanism will have to be more sophisti-cated. Constructing such a device could be a good termproject for advanced students. Possibly helpful ideas alongthis line are discussed in the supplementary material.
