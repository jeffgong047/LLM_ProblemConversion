LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Letters are selected for their expected interest for our readers. Some letters are sent to reviewers for advice;
some are accepted or declined by the editor without review. Letters must be brief and may be edited, sub-ject to the author s approval of signiﬁcant changes. Although some comments on published articles and
notes may be appropriate as letters, most such comments are reviewed according to a special procedure
and appear, if accepted, in the Notes and Discussions section. (See the Statement of Editorial Policy atajp.aapt.org.) Running controversies among letter writers will not be published.

Readers of articles1,2in this Journal on the fact that a golf
ball may roll into the “cup” (vertical cylinder) and then rollback out may be interested in a vectorial analysis of this phe-nomenon given by Milne (1948) in a little-known textbook.

Just after the publication of my paper about the golfer’s
curse (Am. J. Phys. 90, 657 (2022)), I received an e-mail
from Kirk McDonald bringing to my attention the little-known textbook by Milne ( Vectorial analysis , 1948) in
which the equations of motion of the golf ball, especially its
vertical oscillations, are also derived.
The method of Milne consists of three points: (1) to substi-
tute, in the time derivative of the angular momentum about
the center of mass, the reaction force as given by the linearmomentum balance; (2) to make appear explicitly the radial
contribution of the golf ball rotation velocity; (3) to multiply
vectorially the condition of rolling contact by the radial unit
vector (it rotates around the vertical axis). Putting togetherall of that and rearranging, the result is a linear equation
between three independent vectors and the coefﬁcients ofeach is an equation for the golf ball behavior.
This approach is close to the one I used in my 2007
paper (Eur. J. Phys. 28, 379 (2007)) and last month in AJP
in the sense it uses vectorial tools, but it differs in theexplicit use of the vectorial product (point 3). KirkMcDonald’s email allowed me the pleasure of readingMilne’s approach, and I hope his Letter to AJP will do thesame for others.

Motion of a charged particle in the electric field of a uniformly charged

A recent article1in this Journal discussed the motion of a
charged particle in the magnetic and electric ﬁelds of an inﬁ-
nite wire, ﬁnding an interesting class of “trapped” motions
about the wire. The more realistic case of a ﬁnite wire/rod
with uniform electric charge density also leads to “trapped”
motion2,3(a kind of electric bottle), as can be seen in a
delightful video taken at the NASA space station.4

Falling toast

The mathematical analysis of falling toast by Mahajan1is
entertaining, but there are other possible outcomes. The free-body diagram in Fig. 1 shows only the gravitational and nor-mal forces. If a static friction force is added then the toast canremain at rest on the rounded edge of the table with its centreof mass beyond the edge. The equilibrium is stable since thetoast can oscillate with small amplitude without slipping andfalling, like the bus hanging over the edge of a cliff in “TheItalian Job” movie. In that case, the question of landing butterside up or down does not arise. Another outcome arises if the
initial horizontal velocity of the toast is taken into account. It
is very unlikely that buttered toast will arrive at the edge of atable with zero speed. As the initial speed increases, the torque
on the toast acts for a shorter time so the toast rotates through
a smaller angle as it falls and is more likely to land butter sideup. The latter effect is easily demonstrated by sliding a blockof wood off a table at various horizontal speeds and has been
analysed theoretically by Matthews.
