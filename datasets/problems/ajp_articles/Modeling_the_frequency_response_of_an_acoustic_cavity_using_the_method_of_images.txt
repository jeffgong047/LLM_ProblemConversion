We demonstrate the ability of a simple algorithm based on the venerable method of images
(MOIs), to accurately model the detailed frequency response of a multidimensional, rectangular,
lossy resonant cavity. The convergence properties of the model’s inﬁnite series solution are shown
to be determined by the cavity’s quality factor Q. A 1D example demonstrates that the MOI series
converges to the exact solution. Next, a comparison to precisely measure 2D cavity data conﬁrms
that a straightforward extension of the 1D algorithm to multiple dimensions provides accurate
results. The algorithm is short, easily understandable by undergraduate students and relativelyundemanding to code. An example using

I. INTRODUCTION
Midway through their sophomore year, our physics majors
are introduced to the rigors and the joys of experimental sci-
ence by a required and quite difﬁcult lab course. Having just
completed a one-term lecture course introducing the analyses
of oscillations, waves, and normal modes (albeit mostly in
one dimension), they now learn how to collect and analyze
frequency and energy spectra generated by a variety of phe-
nomena. These experiences during lab provide students witha useful working knowledge of several subjects later covered
in detail by upper division lecture courses.
One of the lab course’s more popular experiments
involves the determination of the dispersion relation of
sound waves in air by observing and analyzing the normal
mode frequencies of a small acoustic cavity. Figure 1is a
photo of the apparatus, and Fig. 2shows a high-resolution
measurement of the cavity’s frequency response. The
expected normal mode wave numbers are calculated from
the rectangular cavity’s measured dimensions, and these are
matched with the corresponding peaks in its measured fre-quency response. The rectangular cavity has thick acrylic
side walls and a thinner top surface. Its bottom surface is
provided by the sturdy aluminum base plate upon which it
rests. The source sound transducer (speaker) is mounted in a
side wall near the cavity’s bottom right corner in the photo.The response transducer (microphone) is mounted beneath
the center of the base plate. (The small opening for this trans-
ducer is visible in the base plate just to the left of center of
the cavity’s upper side wall.) Moving the cavity around on
the base plate changes the relative position of the responsetransducer within it.
The data plotted in Fig. 2consist of (response transducer)/
(source transducer) signal voltage amplitude ratios (gains)
measured at 2070 frequencies with the transducers posi-
tioned near diagonally opposite corners of the cavity. As
expected, the frequency response peaks correspond to the
cavity’s normal modes. If air is nondispersive, then these fre-
quencies should be proportional to the cavity’s normal modewave numbers. A proportional, least-squares ﬁt of the
observed peaks’ frequencies to their corresponding normalmode wave numbers (calculated from the measured cavitydimensions, assuming that the cavity is rectangular) was per-formed by optimizing its slope, i.e., the average phase veloc-ity of sound in air over the measured frequency range. Theﬁt result was quite consistent with the hypothesis that air isnondispersive over this frequency range. The dashed verticallines in Fig. 2show predicted cavity resonant frequencies
calculated from the mode wave numbers and the best ﬁtslope.

The accuracy and large dynamic range of the experiment’s
data acquisition system enable it to provide a wealth ofdetails in the measured gain and phase responses of the cav-ity. It should come as no surprise that the cavity’s frequencyresponse peaks at nearly every normal mode, because, given
Fig. 1. Conﬁguration of the experimental apparatus. The interior of the rect-
angular acrylic box is approximately 152 mm /C2114 mm /C232 mm. The
metal plate serves as the cavity’s bottom boundary, and the small hole at the
plate’s center marks the position of the sound pressure response transducer
(a microphone). Its ampliﬁed signal is displayed on the computer monitor as
the experimenter moves the box around on the base plate, mapping out the
mode’s nodal line structure. The selected normal mode corresponds the cav-
ity’s third resonance, near 1 :9 kHz.

its construction, the quality factor Qof the cavity’s resonan-
ces should be on the order of 100. What might be surprising,
on the other hand, is the rich structure evident in the response
at intermediate frequencies. Interestingly, between severalpairs of resonant frequencies, the response drops sharply byas much as two orders of magnitude, a seemingly resonant-
like behavior for which the transducer positions correspond
to nodes rather than antinodes. Between other peaks, how-ever, the response gently falls and rises. This variation in
behavior piques the interest of many of our more sophisti-
cated students as well as our TAs, and we devote the remain-der of this text to model the driven response of the cavity asa function of frequency.
II. STEADY-STATE RESPONSE OF A 1D CAVITY
As a warm-up exercise, ﬁrst consider a familiar, one-
dimensional example: A resonant cavity consisting of a sec-tion of electromagnetic transmission line of length Lwith
reﬂective terminations at positions x¼0 and x¼L. Assume
that the line is linear, homogeneous, and nondispersive, butit has a ﬁnite quality factor Q. The cavity is driven by a
constant-amplitude, sinusoidal source coincident with the
termination at x¼0.
A. Exact solution
This 1D system is simple enough to solve exactly. Once
the system reaches steady state, the transmission line sup-
ports two traveling waves moving in opposite directions with
a common wave number k. Let V
þðxÞbe the complex-valued
voltage amplitude phasor of the wave traveling toward larger
xvalues, and V/C0ðxÞthat of the wave traveling in the opposite
direction.2With both waves present, the total voltage phasor
V(x) at some position xon the line will then equal
VþðxÞþV/C0ðxÞ. Assume the line terminations to be ideal,
free boundaries for a wave’s voltage (i.e., the boundaries
have inﬁnite impedances), so that at a termination, the
reﬂected wave’s phasor will equal that of the incident wave.At the right-hand boundary x¼L, it must then be the case
thatV/C0ðLÞ¼VþðLÞ. At the x¼0 termination, the outgoing
wave Vþð0Þmust also include the driving source power.
Denote the complex-valued source amplitude phasor as VS,
so that Vþð0Þ¼V/C0ð0ÞþVS. This model provides a wave
representation of the state of the system,3presenting us with
aninhomogeneous boundary value problem because of the
presence of VS.
The waves VþandV/C0propagate on the transmission line
in their respective directions. If the line were not lossy,
then the complex phasors representing these travelingwaves would have constant magnitudes as their phases
change with position: V
þðxþdÞ¼VþðxÞexpðikdÞand
V/C0ðxþdÞ¼V/C0ðxÞexpð/C0ikdÞ. Loss introduces a decrease
in amplitude along the direction of propagation that will gen-
erally be frequency dependent and, thus, also dependent on
the wave number k. We specify this loss using the quality fac-
torQ(k), where the wave’s squared amplitude (proportional to
its intensity) decreases as it propagates, e-folding with the
attenuation length kðkÞ¼QðkÞ=k. Including this attenuation
with distance, the two waves’ propagation operators ,o r
propagators ,PþandP/C0, become
VþðxþdÞ¼P þðdÞVþðxÞand V/C0ðxþdÞ

We use the propagators PþandP/C0to tidy up our deriva-
tions. Note a couple of their properties: P/C0ðdÞ¼P þð/C0dÞ
¼1=PþðdÞandPþðd1þd2Þ¼P þðd1ÞPþðd2Þ. The loss
factor is parameterized by Q(k) rather than kðkÞ. For many
systems, it turns out that Q(k) is a more slowly varying func-
tion of kthan is kðkÞ, except near a resonant absorption fea-
ture. The forms in Eq. (1)forVþðxÞandV/C0ðxÞprovide the
traveling wave components we use to derive the solution tothe boundary value problem. This solution will yield V(x),

actual data (no smoothing applied). The logarithmic vertical scale has grid
lines separated by factors of 10. The measured response is generally higher
for frequencies of 1.4–2 :1 kHz, because the conversion efﬁciencies of the
two transducers are highest in that range. The dashed vertical lines show the
expected set of resonant frequencies determined by the slope of a linear ﬁt
of the observed response peaks vs the cavity’s expected normal mode wave
numbers calculated from its measured dimensions.

ing through its numerator and denominator. The dependence
ofHonxandLis explicit in these expressions; its depen-
dence on kandQis through the propagator deﬁnitions in Eq.

vert to an equivalent trigonometric expression

B. Method of images model
Now we derive a method of images (MOIs) approach that
leads to a result equivalent to Eq. (6)for the 1D cavity’s
response function. Consider again the ﬁrst equality in that
expression
Hðk;xÞ¼PþðxÞþP þð2L/C0xÞ
1/C0P þð2LÞ:
Now expand the division by ð1/C0P þð2LÞÞ, creating an
equivalent series expression. Recalling that ½Pþð2LÞ/C138m
¼P þð2mLÞ, the expression becomes
Hðk;xÞ¼ P þðxÞþP þð2L/C0xÞ ½/C138

Equation (8)is an inﬁnite series representation of the exact
solution, Eq. (6). It is also the series that would result by add-
ing the signals from an inﬁnite array of identical sources
arranged along an inﬁnite transmission line, the sources
spaced at intervals of 2 L, and the sum of their individual
voltage phasor contributions measured at a point located a
distance x/C20Lfrom the nearest source. This inﬁnite series
forHconverges absolutely for ﬁnite Qandk>0. The ratioof the magnitudes of successive series terms is exp ð/C0kL=QÞ,
which will approach 1 if kL/C28Q. In this case, the required
number of series terms for an accurate model calculationmay be large, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
Keeping the series solution in mind, reconsider the origi-
nal 1D cavity conﬁguration: the terminations at 0 and L, the
source coincident with the termination at 0, and the measure-ment point at position x,0/C20x/C20L. Now think of the mea-
sured signal VðxÞ¼V
þðxÞþV/C0ðxÞconstructed as follows:
the signal from the source reaches xwith relative amplitude
PþðxÞ. This signal continues onward and reﬂects from the
termination at Lto return through xwith relative amplitude
P/C0ðx/C0LÞPþðLÞ¼P þð/C0xÞPþð2LÞ, adding this value to
the measurement. The signal then reﬂects again at 0 (now
with relative amplitude Pþð2LÞ), subsequently passing yet
again by xwithPþðxÞPþð2LÞ, and so on. The total signal
measured at xis the sum of these contributions, leading again
to the series solution in Eq. (8). Thus, the members of the
inﬁnite array of sources described in the preceding paragraph
represent the source along with an inﬁnite sequence of itsmirror images, reﬂected by the terminations. Equation (9)
rearranges the series representation of H(k,x) as a sum of
signals from the real source and this sequence of reﬂections.
This idea will be the basis of the method of images algorithm
presented in Sec. III.
III. MODELING THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL
CAVITY
The method used in Sec. IIto calculate an exact solution
to the steady-state response of a 1D resonator is very difﬁcult
to extend to the multidimensional geometry of the acousticcavity shown in Fig. 1. Useful alternative approaches typi-
cally generate an inﬁnite series, which is then truncated toprovide adequate accuracy in an approximate method. One
approach, especially when dealing with a high- Qsystem,
might be to perform some form of normal mode expansionof the inhomogeneous part of the boundary value problem,generating a set of coupling coefﬁcients to the homogeneous
system’s eigenfunctions. Typical examples might include the
coupling of free-space signals into an antenna or optical

nation Vðx¼LÞ(white circle), and image sources (gray circles) spaced at
intervals of 2 L. The bottom graphic shows the model frequency response
results for Q¼50. The black curve is for 100 terms of the Eq. (8)series
(equivalent to 200 image sources) and the gray curve is for 25 terms (50
image sources). The plot shows the two lowest resonances, where conver-
gence is slowest. The 100-term calculation has a maximum relative error of0.5% (at kL=p¼0:745).

system and estimating the changes to resonator’s normal
modes induced by a small perturbing effect on its state or
geometry. Another common practice, especially in commer-
cial software used to model very complicated structures, is todiscretize the system boundaries and volume and employone of a variety of techniques such as ﬁnite element, ﬁnitedifference, and the method of moments approaches.

Presented here is a quite different and simple approach
that is easy to understand, even by early undergraduates: we
extend the MOI model from Sec. IIto the acoustic cavity’s
multidimensional geometry and use it to numerically approx-imate the cavity’s detailed frequency response for any choice
of positions for the source and detector within it.5The model
can be adapted to accommodate mixed boundary conditions,boundaries that are not perfectly reﬂective, and transducersthat are not isotropic. The method is, unfortunately, limited
to only a small set of cavity geometries. Fortunately, a rect-
angular geometry happens to be a member of this set. TheAppendix provides a brief derivation of the boundary value
problem for the complex-valued sound wave pressure phasor
ﬁeld pðrÞinduced in our acoustic cavity and calculates the
cavity’s normal modes. It also shows that the physicaldimensions of the cavity (Fig. 1) effectively reduce the
required model geometry to only two dimensions, butextending the analysis to three dimensions is straightforward.
This exercise is an example of ﬁnding a Green’s function
solution to the problem.

A. Image source lattice construction
The reﬂection of an isotropic source wave from a ﬂat cav-
ity boundary can be modeled as an identical wave emitted by
an image source as shown in Fig. 4. The advantage of this
model is immediately apparent: The image’s location isunaffected by the detector location or any other modelparameter such as korQ. One, therefore, need only calculate
the distance to the detector from the image in order to deter-
mine the reﬂected wave’s contribution to the response phasorat the detector’s location. It is relatively straightforward toinclude not only the attenuations introduced by the propagat-ing medium but also to add factors to the image phasor that
incorporate any additional amplitude and phase effects intro-
duced by the reﬂection at the boundary.
7
The rectangular cavity’s multiple boundaries and conse-
quent multiple wave reﬂections complicate the situation.Each of the four planar boundaries, of course, requires the
inclusion of its own mirror image of the source. Waves fromthese images, however, will reﬂect from the other interior
surfaces of the cavity, and those subsequent reﬂections must
be accounted for. Thus, each image requires the inclusion of
more images to account for these reﬂected waves, and so on.The result is an inﬁnite lattice of image sources whose pha-
sor contributions become the terms in our series solution for
the cavity’s response.
Constructing the lattice of image sources is conceptually
simple: reﬂect the geometry of the cavity (including thesource) across each of its boundaries and then reﬂect each of
these images across its own boundaries, etc., until the entire
plane (or 3D space) is tiled with cavity images. The sourceswithin these images then constitute the inﬁnite set of imagesources to be used in the series solution. Figure 5illustrates a
possible result of this process. In this example, the actual sig-
nal source is located at an interior point of the rectangularcavity. Note how the source images form identical clusters,
regularly spaced at intervals of twice the horizontal and ver-
tical cavity dimensions, a generalization of the 1D imagepattern shown in Fig. 3.
As with the 1D example, each image source corresponds
to a unique, reﬂected path from the real source to detector
within the cavity. This correspondence is illustrated by two
example paths in Fig. 5. Note how the lengths and angles of
the reﬂected path segments correspond to segments of thedirect path from the image to detector as that path passes
through intervening cavity images. The countably inﬁnite
number of reﬂected paths from the source to detector makeup a set isomorphic with the set of image source positions,and the lengths of two corresponding paths match. These are
the essential properties that allow the MOI series expansion
to succeed.

B. Propagators and the calculation algorithm
Now consider the driven acoustic cavity, whose state, as
shown in the Appendix , may be described by a scalar pres-
sure ﬁeld p. We continue to assume that the driving source
radiates isotropically into the cavity interior, and the wave
medium is homogeneous, linear, and isotropic. Given thesecharacteristics, we may conclude that the pressure ﬁeld

and its mirror image (gray) radiate identical waves. The signal phasor at the
detector (white circle) is the coherent sum of these two signals. The arcs
show corresponding surfaces of equal phase for the two emissions.Fig. 5. A lattice of cavity images. The original, rectangular cavity and its
enclosed source (black boundary and disk) have mirror images tiling the
plane. The pattern repeats at intervals of 2 Lxhorizontally and 2 Lyvertically.
Also shown are examples of how a ray to the detector from each image
source corresponds to a unique reﬂected signal path within the cavity fromthe real source.

associated with the emitted wave from any source in the
image lattice can be characterized by a complex-valued pres-
sure phasor whose value at any location depends only on its
distance rfrom the source: p¼pðrÞ. Because the isotropic
natures of source and medium ensure that the wave’s localwave vector kis parallel to the location’s radius vector r
from the source, the phase of p(r) is determined by a simple,
scalar calculation: exp ðik/C1rÞ¼expðikrÞ.
The amplitude of an emitted wave’s phasor depends on
two factors. First is a geometric factor which requires that, inthe absence of absorption by the medium or the cavity
boundaries, the net total power escaping from an imaginary
surface containing the source must be independent of the sur-face’s size and shape. For the effectively 2D cavity geome-try, this factor must, therefore, be r
/C01=2. Second comes the
loss of power in the emitted wave. Air at ordinary lab tem-
peratures and pressures offers very little attenuation toacoustic waves at audio frequencies. Attenuation in the appa-ratus shown in Fig. 1is dominated by acoustic radiation
escaping from the cavity and by frictional losses, both
mainly caused by sound-induced vibrations of the acrylicbox and base plate forming the cavity. Nevertheless, weassume that this attenuation may be adequately described by
a quality factor Q(k) attributed to the medium (air), just as
for the 1D example presented earlier. The amplitude attenua-tion factor is then exp ½/C0kr=ð2QÞ/C138, cf. Eq. (2). This is, of
course, a greatly simpliﬁed model of the actual loss pro-
cesses. The ﬁnal expression for a source’s pressure ﬁeld pha-
sor becomes

/C01=2expðikrÞexp/C0kr=ð2QÞ ½/C138 ; (10)
where ris the distance from the source and Qwill be a func-
tion of the wave number k.9The contribution of the nth
image source, located at rn, to the total response phasor

rn¼jrn/C0rdjin Eq. (10). The image source contributions

C. Convergence and accuracy of the model calculations
Consider the convergence of the inﬁnite series of image
contributions to the ﬁeld value pðrdÞgiven in Eq. (11). Let
Lxbe the long dimension of the cavity, and let R/C29Lxbe
some very large distance. As R!1 , the number of image
sources Nfor which jR/C0rnj<Lxgrows proportionally to R:

. Therefore, as R!1 , Eq. (12) approaches a

lute convergence fails.10As was the case for the 1Dexample, the series convergence is dependent on the loss fac-
tor exp ½/C0krn=ð2QÞ/C138, and an approximate expression for the

Again taking Lxto be the cavity’s long dimension, con-
sider a sequence of circles centered on the detector position
rdwith radii Rm¼ð2m/C01ÞLxfor positive integers m.
These circles then deﬁne a set of annuli with outer and inner
radii of Rm6Lx, which tile the plane. The set of lattice sour-
ces within each annulus generates a contribution to the
response phasor pðrdÞgiven in Eq. (11). The magnitude of
this contribution may be estimated using R¼ð2m/C01ÞLxin
Eq. (13), an estimate which will be quite accurate for
m/C291. Now assume that we truncate the inﬁnite series for
pðrdÞ, including only those sources within the annuli deﬁned
by 1/C20m/C20m0for some m0/C291. We wish to estimate the
accuracy of this approximation of the inﬁnite series by esti-
mating the relative magnitude of the sum of the contributions
of the excluded sources.
For the longest wavelength mode, k¼p=Lx;f o rag i v e n Q,
this value of kwill yield a slower convergence than for higher-
order modes. Using this value, consider the annulus deﬁned by

It must be emphasized that, given the several approxima-
tions used to develop Eq. (16), this expression for the
fractional error in the MOI method provides only an order-
of-magnitude estimate. Nevertheless, it is a useful tool forsetting the values of computational parameters used in anMOI algorithm. These results are for k¼p=L
x, the lowest
frequency resonant mode of the cavity, for which the seriesconvergence is slowest.
Figure 6provides a graphical analysis of the relative
error estimate Eq. (16) in terms of the series truncation
index m
0and cavity Q. This analysis applies to the lowest
resonant mode of the cavity. For a higher frequency reso-nance, divide the model cavity Qby the ratio of the desired
frequency to that of its the lowest mode before consulting
Fig. 6. The plots clearly demonstrate that the MOI approach
can result in a very inefﬁcient model of a high- Qcavity, but
it places much more reasonable computational demandswhen modeling cavities with Qs of less than a couple of
hundred.
IV. MODEL IMPLEMENTATION, RESULTS, AND
DISCUSSION
Section IIIprovided the details of an inﬁnite series solu-
tion for the steady-state frequency response of a rectangularacoustic cavity such as that shown in Fig. 1. The series solu-
tion was developed using a method of images approach thatis particularly well suited to systems of moderate quality fac-torQ. We now use the results of the last section to assess the
computational demands required to accurately model the fre-
quency response of the cavity shown in Fig. 1, whose mea-
sured response was presented in Fig. 2. The widths of the
resonance peaks in that ﬁgure indicate that the cavity’s Qis
approximately 80–150. Knowing that the errors plotted in
Fig. 6are order-of-magnitude estimates, and because we
wish our model to accurately capture the details of theresponse between the resonance peaks, we will make conser-vative use of that ﬁgure’s estimates: For Q¼150 and an
error target of 0.1%, Fig. 6suggests that an appropriate trun-
cation limit would be m
0/C25300. With Ly=Lx¼3=4, the inte-
rior of a circle with radius 2 m0Lx¼600Lxwill include
approximately 1.5 /C2106image sources. The calculation of
pðrdÞusing Eq. (11) requires a distance calculation followedby an exponential and two trigonometric function calls for
each of these sources. This computational effort yields a cal-
culation of the response at a single location in the cavity for
a single wave number, k. Clearly, careful choice of program-
ming environment and algorithm organization will be impor-
tant. AVRMATHEMATICA notebook with a reasonably efﬁcient
algorithm is available online.11
Our implementation of the MOI model was conﬁgured to
approximate the conditions of the measured frequencyresponse dataset of Fig. 2. It used the measured cavity
dimensions and the speed of sound determined from that
data.1To simplify image source indexing for the model cal-
culations, a square area with side lengths of 2 /C2600Lxwas
chosen rather than a circular area of radius 600 Lx. This
increased the number of images to over 1.9 /C2106. To ease
this potential computational burden, the modeled source
position was selected to be a corner of the cavity, collapsing
each cluster of four image sources (Fig. 5) to a single source
and reducing the number of sources to just over 481 000. A
further simpliﬁcation was to choose rdas the diagonally
opposite corner. This placed the images symmetricallyaround the response location, reducing the number of unique
p(r) calculations from 1.9 /C2106to only approximately
121000 per frequency (or k).
Comparisons of the measured data to a calculation using
this MOI model are shown in Figs. 7and 8. In order to
approximate the behavior of the measured data peak widths
vs frequency, the Q(f) function used for the model increased
linearly from Qð1:1kHzÞ¼80 to Qð4:5kHzÞ¼220. This
observed Q(f) behavior may be due to a reduced ability of
the sound to excite vibrations of the cavity’s acrylic box athigher frequencies, reducing the level of vibration-induced
sound emissions. The model took 158 s of the CPU time to
calculate responses at the 2403 frequencies plotted in Fig. 7,
equivalent to approximately 1.8 /C2106p(r) calculations per
second (or about 15 frequencies per second).
The relatively simple, straightforward MOI model algo-
rithm was, nevertheless, able to capture the rich structure of
the acoustic cavity response with detail that is quite similarto that of the measured data, even given its assumption of a
2D model, the chosen source and detector positions, and
Fig. 7. Comparison of the model to measured data. The model source posi-
tionrswas in a corner of the cavity, and the detector position rdwas chosen
to be the diagonally opposite corner. Approximately 121 000 complex-
valued response calculations were performed for each of 2403 frequencies.
The result was normalized to match the measured data near 3 kHz.Fig. 6. Estimated relative errors vs m0andQ. Shown are several plots of the
Eq.(16) fractional error estimate as a function of the index m0at which the
inﬁnite series for pðrdÞis truncated. Each line is labeled with the cavity Q
value used to generate it. The logarithms are base 10.

very simple loss model. On the other hand, its ﬁdelity to the
measured data leaves much to be desired. The primary ﬂawis its omission of the frequency responses of the transducersused to generate and detect the sound. The two transducerswere identical, quite old hearing aid speakers, a vintage of
the late 1960s. The reciprocal nature of these purely electro-
mechanical devices allows one to serve as a detector micro-phone while its twin serves as the source speaker. Theirfrequency response is limited for a variety of reasons, theprimary one being that they were designed to optimize ahearing-impaired user’s ability to understand the spokenword. As mentioned previously, they have an enhancedresponse over a small range of frequencies centered at1.7 kHz. Their small size and design cause their response atlower frequencies to fall rapidly, whereas their high fre-quency response falls more gradually to provide some ambi-ent noise ﬁltering.A simple ﬁlter model was created to approximate the
observed transducer frequency response effects on the mea-sured data. This model was applied to the MOI result, andthe ﬁlter parameters were adjusted to optimize the matchbetween the simulation and the measurements. The improvedmodel result is presented in Fig. 9. The remaining discrepan-
cies in its ﬁdelity to the measured data are probably duemainly to its simplistic loss model: Eq. (10) with a linear
model for Q(f).
In conclusion, the method of images approach can clearly
be quite successful at calculating the steady-state frequencyresponses of resonant cavities with simple geometries andmoderate quality factors. Although not nearly so capable oras fast as the sophisticated algorithms used by commercialsoftware, it has its own advantages. In particular, a programto efﬁciently implement an MOI algorithm consists of only acouple of dozen lines of code. As such, the algorithm iswell-suited for instruction, especially for undergraduates at
the junior or even sophomore level.

APPENDIX: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1. Wave equation for sound propagation
Assume that the sound wave medium (air in this case) is
an isotropic, homogeneous, ideal ﬂuid (continuous, linear,zero viscosity, and lossless) with equilibrium pressure p
0
and density q0, which at sea level are approximately 1 :01
/C2105pascal and 1 :23 g=l, respectively. Given these assump-
tions, a sound wave induces a stress tensor ﬁeld on themedium that reduces to the combination of a scalar pressurechange pðr;tÞand its gradient vector rpðr;tÞ. Furthermore,
assume that sound waves will disturb the equilibrium valuesby very small amounts, i.e., pðr;tÞ/C28 p
0.12
A tiny parcel of air within the cavity at equilibrium posi-
tionrresponds to the sound in two ways: (1) qðr;tÞ, its
change in density away from q0, varies adiabatically with the
local pressure change pðr;tÞ; and (2) its center of mass is
accelerated by the local pressure gradient rpðr;tÞ. The ﬁrst
effect deﬁnes a velocity, which turns out to be the speed ofsound, c

ing dry air’s C, and air becomes slightly dispersive.13

Clearly, kis the wave number, thus showing that cs, deﬁned
in Eq. (A1) , is the sound wave’s phase velocity v/.
2. Boundary conditions and normal modes
If the cavity walls are rigid, then their shapes and positions
are unaffected by the sound pressure ﬁeld within the cavity,and a tiny air parcel abutting a wall is unable to move in adirection perpendicular to it. Therefore, at a rigid boundarywith surface normal nðrÞ, it must be the case that
nðrÞ/C1@
2Xðr;tÞ=@t2¼0, implying that
nðrÞ/C1rpðrÞ¼0: (A6)
The rigid cavity walls are, therefore, free boundaries for the
sound pressure ﬁeld, and Eqs. (A5) and (A6) deﬁne the
Neumann boundary value problem for the sound pressure
phasor ﬁeld.14
Equations (A5) and(A6) separate in a Cartesian coordi-
nate system, and, because the cavity is rectangular, this is anobvious choice. Aligning the origin and the axes with a cav-ity corner and its adjoining three edges almost makes thesolution obvious by inspection. Assign L
x,Ly, and Lzas the
three cavity edge lengths, and assume a formal solution of
pðrÞ¼pxðxÞpyðyÞpzðzÞ. The separated differential equations
become

(A10)
The pressure ﬁeld phasor pðrÞ¼pl;m;nðx;y;zÞin Eq. (A10)
has been assigned a phase that makes it a real number. The
three cosine factors have identical phases (real). In terms oftraveling waves, each cosine term can be written as a sum ofoppositely directed traveling waves, e.g., cos ðk
lxÞ
¼ð1=2Þðeiklxþe/C0iklxÞ. Multiplying these expressions and
gathering terms will show that pl;m;nðx;y;zÞcan be written as
a sum of as many as eight equal-amplitude plane waves, allwith wave vectors whose squared magnitudes equal k
2
l;m;n,
Eq.(A9) , and whose vector sum vanishes.
The original, homogeneous boundary value problem for
these free oscillations, Eqs. (A5) and(A6) , is, of course, an
eigensystem problem. The k2
l;m;nare the eigenvalues and the
pl;m;nðx;y;zÞtheir corresponding eigenfunctions. Because the
problem’s differential equations, both for the cavity interiorand for its boundaries, do not include damping or loss terms,the eigenvalues are all real. The solutions constitute the setof ideal cavity normal modes, a complete set of orthogonalbasis states for sound waves in an ideal, rectangular cavity.
The longest side of the cavity was designed to have length
L
x¼6:00 in :or 15.24 cm. The other two side lengths were
designed to be Ly¼4:50 in :andLz¼1:25 in :. The measured
lengths are 15.225, 11.442, and 3.185 cm. The measured Lx
andLyvalues are each within 0.1% of their design values,
and their ratio is 0.2% away from the designed 4 :3 value.
The Lzvalue is about 0.3% greater than its design length.
These numbers set the relevant wave number and, therefore,frequency ranges of the experiment. The lowest frequencymode will have wave number k
1;0;0¼p=Lxwith a wave-
length equal to 2 Lx. Taking the speed of sound to be
344.7 m/s,1the lowest mode frequency is expected to be
1.132 kHz. (The measured frequency was 1.1323 kHz.)
The lowest mode frequency with a z-component variation
corresponds to k0;0;1, which is Lx=Lztimes that of the lowest
mode. The location of the driving source, however, hasz¼L
z=2 (see Fig. 1). However, this lowest z-mode has a
nodal surface at Lz=2, as shown in Eq. (A10) . This implies
that the source position makes it impossible for the source toexcite this mode. The lowest excitable mode for this conﬁgu-ration must be k
0;0;2with frequency 2 Lx=Lztimes the lowest
mode frequency of 1.132 or 10.8 kHz.
This lowest frequency involving a mode with a zcompo-
nent to its wave vector, 10.8 kHz, exceeds the high frequencyresponse limit of the transducers. Thus, the wave vectors rel-evant to the experiment will all have vertical index n¼0,
effectively reducing the cavity geometry to only two dimen-sions for the behavior of the pressure ﬁeld pðr;tÞgenerated
by the driving source and its images, and even with thedetector transducer located in the bottom surface of the cav-ity (z¼0), its signal is representative of the cavity pressure
ﬁeld at any z, except, perhaps, when located very near the
driving source transducer. Consequently, we will refer toonly the xandycomponents of the cavity wave vectors with
their associated mode indices landm.
3. Behavior at degenerate mode frequencies
The rectangular cavity’s normal mode eigenfunctions
p
l;mðx;yÞhave a particularly simple structure (note that the z
component factor has been removed from Eq. (A10) because
it/C171 and is, thus, irrelevant at the frequencies we consider).
If either the xorycosine factor’s argument in Eq. (A10) is
an odd multiple of p=2, then pl;mðx;yÞ¼0. This criterion
deﬁnes the function’s nodal lines, and in this case, the nodallines are straight and aligned with the cavity boundaries. Themode index values provide counts of the nodal lines: lis the
number of nodal lines parallel to the ydirection, mthe num-
ber parallel to the xdirection. For example, Fig. 1shows the
295 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 4, April 2023 Rice, Riedel, and Curtis 295 04 October 2023 22:51:19
experimenter investigating the nodal line structure for the
third normal mode, p1;1, with a single vertical and a single
horizontal nodal line which intersect at the center of the
cavity.
If the ratio of the rectangular cavity boundary lengths is
rational, then there will be pairs of distinct normal modeswith the same wave number: k
l;m¼kl0;m0. Such a pair is then
degenerate , and linear combinations of them are also eigen-
functions with the same eigenvalue k2. These linear combi-
nations can have nodal line structures which are very
different from those of the original pl;mandpl0;m0. Our cavity
has a design Ly=Lx¼3=4, and the actual cavity differs by
only 0.2% from this value. Thus, the cavity was designed to
have k4;0¼k0;3, making this pair degenerate. The common
resonant frequency of the pair is 4 times that of the k1;0
mode, or 4.528 kHz.
The nodal line structures of these two 4.528 kHz modes
are shown in Fig. 10. With the source transducer placed in a
corner of the cavity and emitting this degenerate mode fre-
quency, both modes should be excited with equal phases and
nearly equal amplitudes. This means that the cavity willrespond with a linear combination of the two modes. Withthe transducer in the lower left corner of the cavity, for
example, the cavity should respond with the combination
p
4;0þp0;3. The nodal structure of this state, along with its
orthogonal counterpart p4;0/C0p0;3, are shown in Fig. 11.
Note the interesting nodal line structures of the sum and
difference combinations shown in Fig. 11: Each nodal line
meets a boundary at an angle of 45/C14, either at a corner or
paired with another nodal line along a wall. Each of these
intersections is a saddle point of the resultant pðrÞ, satisfying
the boundary condition Eq. (A6) because rpðrÞ¼0 at these
points. Particularly relevant to the measured cavity fre-quency response is the observation that diagonally opposite
corners of the cavity represent antinode–node pairs. The
source will occupy the antinode position, and a diagonallyopposite position of the detector will be on a nodal line,causing the frequency response to show a sharp decrease at
the degenerate mode frequency. This behavior could not
occur at a nondegenerate resonance, where all corners areantinodes of the individual p
l;meigenfunctions, Eq. (A10) .
Of course, any real cavity is not a perfect rectangle with a
side length ratio of exactly 4:3. Thus, this degeneracy due toan ideally shaped, lossless cavity will be broken by any
actual resonant cavity. A real cavity also would not have
zero loss; however, so its resonances have nonzero qualityfactors Q, and this makes all the difference. If the errors in
the shape of the cavity break such a degeneracy by a frac-
tional frequency shift smaller than the resonances’ nominal
1=Q, then two nearly degenerate modes may be mixedstrongly enough to behave in a way that is well-
approximated by this ideal description. Such is the casewith the cavity of Fig. 1, who response at 4.53 kHz, shown
in Fig. 8, exhibits behavior that is consistent with the anti-
node–node response of the ideal p
4;0þp0;3model, as indi-
cated by the sharp dip conﬁrming the near cancellation of
the two modes’ responses over a very narrow range of fre-quencies—a behavior present both in the actual data and inthe MOI model.
In fact, for the particular design ratio choice of 4:3, there
is a further complication involving the p
4;0þp0;3degener-
acy. The p3;2mode would have a kand frequency which dif-
fer from the degenerate pair by only 0.3% at this designratio. The actual cavity dimensions would assign mode fre-quencies of
ðf
0;3;f4;0;f3;2Þ¼ð 4:520;4:529;4:541ÞkHz: (A11)
The differences of the successive frequencies are only
0.20% and 0.26%, so with a Q/C25150, these three frequen-
cies form what is effectively a degenerate triplet, complicat-ing the observed frequency response and nodal line structurenear 4.53 kHz (cf. Fig. 8).

5In general, the method of images (MOI) enjoys a long history in the
computer-aided engineering analysis of room and structural acoustics.
Pioneered in a now-classic paper by Allen and Berkley (Ref. 15), it used
image sources to estimate the time-domain, reverberation response of a
room to a short sound impulse. The resulting reverberation time envelope
characterizes the suitability of a space as, for example, a lecture hall or
recording studio, a diagnostic introduced in 1895 by W. C. Sabine (Ref.16). The method does not, however, employ coherent superposition of
waves from the source and its reﬂections, and it is, therefore, unsuitable
for frequency response calculations of a cavity whose dimensions are of
the order of a wavelength, as in our case. The use of MOI-based calcula-
tions of a space’s acoustic reverberation response has become a standard
of the industry. The Wayverb website, Ref. 17, includes a summary of cur-
rent techniques employed by several popular acoustic engineering tools:<https://reuk.github.io/wayverb/context.html#existing-software >. All of
these tools, however, are inappropriate for the task at hand.

7We consider only specular reﬂections for our model, so that angles of inci-dence and reﬂection are equal. The assumed ideal, rigid boundaries have
reﬂection coefﬁcients equal to unity, independent of the angle of inci-
dence. These assumptions are quite accurate for the thick, rigid walls of
the small resonant cavity under consideration. For large cavities (such as
ofﬁces, classrooms, or auditoriums), these assumptions are inadequate,because diffuse reﬂections and wall losses (attenuation) are nontrivial and
can be strongly dependent on the angle of incidence.
8The requirement that multiple mirror images of the cavity generated asdescribed completely tile the plane and have disjoint interior regions
greatly restricts the geometries of candidate cavities for this method.
Rectangles and equilateral triangles are among the very few available.
More complicated algorithms can be used to generate the set of imagesources for a more general range of polygonal cavity shapes, but such con-
siderations are beyond the scope of this paper. For examples see the quite
sophisticated approach presented by Cuenca et al. , in their 2009 paper,
Ref. 18. It employs coherent MOI superposion to analyze the frequency
responses of elastic vibrations in thin, convex, solid plates.
9Of course, the RHS of Eq. (10) does not evaluate to a pressure amplitude.
It should be scaled by a factor representing the pressure phasor amplitudeat some standard distance dfrom the source, e.g., pðdÞd1=2. As will be
seen, this factor is unimportant for our analysis, so it may be taken to be
/C171.

12At the “standard” threshold of human hearing, 0 dB SPL (sound pressure
level), a sound wave’s RMS pressure amplitude is approximately 2/C210
/C010standard atmospheres, or about 0.15 ltorr. At 121 dB SPL, over a
million times the threshold amplitude, measured vibration amplitude of
the human eardrum in the area where it is coupled to the inner ear is

16Harvard professor Wallace Clement Sabine (1868–1919) was arguably the“father” of architectural acoutics and its use of sound reverberation time
as a primary indicator of the suitability of a space’s acoustics for concertmusic or as a lecture hall. Modern computational methods for architectural
acoustic design are clearly directly descended from his successful 1895
effort to improve the acoustics of a lecture hall on the Harvard campus.
