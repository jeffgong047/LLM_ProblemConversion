(Received 11 July 2022; accepted 17 October 2022)
We have developed a complete collection of freely available instructional materials to assist
faculty in creating a student-centered quantum mechanics (QM) class that engages students while
supporting them in developing both sense-making and calculational skills. Our materials are
grounded in research on students’ understanding of quantum mechanics and are intended to beadaptable to a variety of instructional settings and faculty styles or preferences. They were
designed for a spins-ﬁrst instructional paradigm and include a set of learning goals, concept
(“clicker”) questions, pre-lecture surveys, and homework and exam questions, along with examplelecture notes from three instructors at three different institutions. In this work, we describe what
active learning can look like in the upper-division as well as describe each of the instructional tools
and provide a few representative examples. We also discuss how these materials are used at eachof our institutions, illustrating how they may be adapted for use at different institutions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum mechanics (QM) stands at the core of much of
modern physics and constitutes an essential foundation for
both the skill set and identity of many physics faculty and stu-dents. A middle-division undergraduate course on the funda-
mentals of quantum mechanics can be a highly sought-after
teaching assignment. At the same time, quantum mechanicshas a reputation amongst many students, supported in part bypopular media, of being an arcane, abstract, unintuitive, and
difﬁcult topic. It is not hard to ﬁnd quotations from famous
physicists that support this reputation: “…Those who are notshocked when they ﬁrst come across quantum theory cannot
possibly have understood it” (N. Bohr) or “I think I can safely
say that nobody understands quantum mechanics” (R.Feynman). As a result, students may enter a quantum classwith a mix of excitement and trepidation.
Given the importance of the topic for students’ develop-
ment, the teaching and learning of undergraduate quantum
has been the subject of a growing amount of physics educa-tion research. (Note: We have compiled a set of additional
references 1for the interested reader in the supplementary
material, including many links to helpful quantum coursematerials.) The bulk of PER research has focused on studentdifﬁculties with individual topics, identifying challenges and
common ideas (including those that may be incorrect and
counterproductive, or correct and useful
2,3), and has pro-
vided curricular materials or other pedagogical tools.4–9
Particular attention has been paid to the transition from clas-sical to quantum ideas, representations,10and mathematical
tools.11,12There are also studies of sociocultural aspects
related to the attitudes and concerns of students13and a vari-
ety of approaches to teaching quantum mechanics.
Our group conducts research in student learning of quantum
mechanics in large and small classes across a diverse set ofinstitutions. We have developed a set of learning goals for
quantum mechanics instruction in collaboration with manyfaculty; we have probed student learning and difﬁculties in
QM in different instructional paradigms; and we have con-
ducted research on student understanding of a variety of topicsrelated to those learning goals.
14,15Part of our intent was to
develop a set of accessible and ﬂexible materials that are easy
for faculty to use and modify in a diverse range of institutions.
The primary goal of this paper is to introduce an assort-
ment of freely available, readily adaptable teaching materialsbased on research ﬁndings. We also provide guidance to helpfaculty determine how to introduce such teaching materialsand practices into their classes. Note that we are not present-
ing a particular course or curriculum, nor do we prescribe
teaching methods. In our experience, the teaching of quan-tum mechanics is personal and highly dependent on theneeds, interest and background of the instructor and students.
Instead of prescribing what and/or how faculty should teach,
our aim is to share a broad and easily modiﬁed set of materi-als to support faculty who want to make research-based mod-iﬁcations to their teaching.
These resources
16were developed based on research into
student learning using an iterative design process. While our
materials have been ﬁeld-tested in our classrooms, many
have not yet been extensively tested for student learninggains. The adaptable and modular design provides ﬂexibilityfor instructors to make minor modiﬁcations or substantial
changes to their teaching. While this allows for different
implementations based on the needs of individual institutionsand instructors, it makes validation of student learning gainsin all environments virtually impossible. However, all ourmaterials promote student engagement with the content, and
we have seen the potential for them to be powerful learning
tools.

II. INTERACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN THE UPPER
DIVISION
One of the primary and best-researched outcomes from
physics education research is that students at all levels bene-ﬁt from interactive engagement .17This refers to approaches
to teaching and learning that are “designed at least in part to
promote conceptual understanding through engagement of
students in heads-on (always) and hands-on (usually) activi-ties which yield immediate feedback through discussion withpeers and/or instructors.”
18There is no single pedagogy
associated with this idea, and the tools and approaches to
implement it can vary widely.
In the upper-division, we borrow some interactive-
engagement techniques popularized in introductory phys-ics.19However, it is important to consider the differences
between upper-division and introductory students. By their
third year, physics majors have further matured with respect
to mathematical tools, problem solving skills, and back-ground knowledge. They are in smaller classes, and are, as awhole, more motivated and more advanced as learners. Assuch, we rely on a mix of lecture and interactive engagement
strategies with frequent opportunities for students to test
themselves and to articulate and reﬁne their thinking.Frequent low-stakes formative assessments (e.g., concept or“clicker” questions) can be helpful, along with the articula-
tion of learning goals, feedback and assessment mechanisms,
and opportunities for small-group discussions. Student atti-tudes and buy-in are important: It can be helpful to explicitlydiscuss your reasons for using these pedagogical tools and
the expected classroom norms around them.
In Sec. V, we describe our transformed course materials.
They are built on physics education research literature and
target a selection of known student difﬁculties. A few con-crete examples of these difﬁculties that we have focused oninclude: technical ﬂuency in expansion in a basis and change
of basis,
15,20calculation and interpretation of expectation
values, issues with time evolution,5calculation and interpre-
tation of measurement in QM,14and the (often) challenging
transition for students from discrete to continuous bases. The
materials we have developed can be mixed and matched to
ﬁt the style and circumstances of each individual course.Indeed, as described in Sec. VI, the authors implement these
materials in different ways in each of our courses. Our lec-tures are not radically different than what might be consid-
ered a traditional lecture. However, the inclusion of
interactive elements, including clickers, spontaneous Q&Awhile lecturing, use of simulations, and occasional small-group discussions result in a course centered on the students
and their learning.
III. SPINS-FIRST QUANTUM MECHANICS
All three of the authors’ quantum courses are taught from
a spins-ﬁrst perspective using the textbook by McIntyre.
21
This is the instructional paradigm we consider in our
research and when designing instructional materials. A
spins-ﬁrst paradigm is in contrast to a position-ﬁrst or wavefunctions ﬁrst approach, in which the time-independentSchr€odinger equation is introduced as a differential equation
in the context of position-space wave functions. In the spins-
ﬁrst paradigm, the time-independent Schr €odinger equation is
introduced later as the energy eigenequation in the context ofoperators and spin-1/2 states.Both perspectives cover mostly the same content but in a
different order and with varying degrees of emphasis. Inposition-ﬁrst QM, students begin by solving the Schr €odinger
equation for a variety of one-dimensional potentials before
moving on to three dimensions. This treatment generallyfocuses on the mathematics of second-order differential equa-tions, both ordinary and partial, with time dependence and
dynamics generally coming second, and Dirac notation and
spin later still. Questions of interpretation and issues of mea-surement are often left as secondary topics, if considered at all.Student challenges in this domain
22are commonly associated
with the abstract interpretation of a wave function and a lack
of a conceptual framework to help make sense of unfamiliarterminology and methods. Such an approach also typicallydoes not become experimentally grounded until later in the
course, when more realistic physical situations are considered.
In contrast, in the spins-ﬁrst paradigm, the system in ques-
tion is a mathematically simple spin-1/2 object and theSchr€odinger equation can be solved as a 2 /C22 matrix equa-
tion. Instruction foregrounds the postulates of QM, illustrat-
ing them in the spin-1/2 context before introducing wave
functions in position and momentum space and solving one-and three-dimensional potentials (including hydrogen).
This approach grounds the postulates of quantum mechan-
ics in experiment, emphasizing the nature of science by
focusing on meaning and physical sensemaking, not just for-
malism and symbol manipulation. The language of operators,Dirac notation,
23and relevant (but still reasonably elemen-
tary) principles of linear algebra are introduced right away.
The calculations are considerably easier for most students
than those involving partial differential equations and contin-uous variables, as they involve only basic algebra and themanipulation of 2 /C22 matrices. The segue from classical to
quantum ideas is highlighted early on, providing connections
to familiar topics (such as magnetic moments). Opportunities
for sense-making are present from the start (e.g., when con-sidering chained Stern-Gerlach experiments, where consider-able physical intuition and consistency of outcomes are easy
to provide). A variety of Stern-Gerlach simulations can be
found online (for example, Refs. 24and25) that allow stu-
dents to “experiment” and further ground their newly devel-oping quantum intuitions. Some challenges to the spins-ﬁrst
approach include the fact that spin is a new, abstract concept,
and the transition from discrete, two-state systems to contin-uous wave functions can be difﬁcult for students. The materi-als presented below explicitly address these challenges.
Regardless of the instructional approach and content
ordering used, there is likely some helpful content within our
materials, as most canonical topics are introduced regardlessof the starting point. Most of these materials help studentsdevelop intuitions and expert habits of mind in the context of
quantum mechanics. While we explicitly discuss with stu-
dents that there are aspects of quantum that might be referredto as weird (i.e., not expected based on classical models andour everyday experiences), it is not that weird! Quantum
mechanics is built on a rigorous postulate-driven mathemati-
cal framework, and students can readily develop strong con-ceptual understanding of the principles and methods wecommonly use to make sense of results in quantum systems.
IV. DEVELOPMENT METHODS
The process of developing our materials involved articulat-
ing a set of learning goals, researching student understanding
41 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 1, January 2023 Pollock, Passante, and Sadaghiani 41 04 October 2023 22:48:46
as related to these goals, and developing instructional materi-
als. Once these materials were ﬁeld-tested in our classrooms,we collected more data from students, documenting theireffectiveness and revising them as needed. In this section, wewill discuss our research and development process in moredetail.
A. Consensus learning goals
The ﬁrst step to build ﬂexible, research-based instructional
materials was to develop consensus learning goals. To that
end, we identiﬁed faculty who frequently teach or design
quantum mechanics courses nationwide and invited them toattend a working meeting. In Spring 2017, over 20 facultyexperts met with the aim of articulating a set of learninggoals suitable for a range of quantum courses in a variety ofdifferent types of institutions and student populations. At themeeting, participants discussed different curricularapproaches, student populations, high priority needs, existingphysics education research literature, and the desires of fac-ulty in different classroom environments. Then the partici-pants began articulating learning goals at a variety of levelsand granularity spanning different textbooks and instruc-tional paradigms.
We later compiled an informal list of consensus learning
goals, framed as skills, concepts, and habits of mind that wewant students to be able to do or have by the end of thecourse.
16For instance, one such goal was that our students
should be able to “…distinguish between expectation values,allowed values, and most probable value.” An example of abroader goal, admittedly vaguer and harder to operationalizeor assess, but highly valued by most faculty, was that studentsshould be better able to “…connect mathematical results tophysics.” These learning goals do not span everything cov-ered in our courses—we chose to focus on topical areas thatreceived the most attention from the majority of the facultyparticipants. In our classes, we share these goals with studentsand use them to help guide instruction and assessment.
B. Iterative cycle of research and development
The development of our materials is not a linear process.
Based on the same cycle of curriculum development her-alded by the Physics Education Group at the University ofWashington,
6we use an iterative process of research into
student thinking, development of instructional materials,testing their effectiveness, and then using those results toreﬁne, and sometimes redesign, our materials.
20
Our process generally starts with an idea that comes up in
our experience in the classroom. Students will ask a questionduring class or ofﬁce hours, or a number of students will pro-
vide an intriguing question on a homework or exam, or we
will prepare to teach a topic and just not feel conﬁdent in thepedagogical tools we are currently using. These initial ideasare then discussed during research meetings, and if multipleauthors agree, we follow up by collecting data on studentthinking by asking targeted questions on homework assign-ments, ungraded surveys (pre-ﬂights), or exams. For morein-depth investigations into student thinking, we then inter-view students. Based on the ﬁndings, we then begin to designmaterials for use in the classroom. These materials will oftenbe tested with small numbers of students in focused inter-views before they are further reﬁned and ﬁeld-tested in theclassroom. Similar data collection techniques are generallyused once again to be able to compare student thinking withand without the new materials. Generally, several years of
reﬁnement occur before we reach a state of equilibrium withour materials. Often, we share draft versions of our materialswith colleagues and collect their feedback to further improve
their development. Some of our materials are well-tested,
and their effectiveness is published.
10,20
Our philosophy towards student learning in quantum
mechanics is that students are important characters in theirlearning journey. They come into our courses with ideas andcontinue to reﬁne these ideas while learning new concepts inour courses. Occasionally, these ideas are either incorrect orare applied incorrectly. In these situations, our materials mayact to correct them. Other times, students struggle to ﬁt all
the ideas together, often evidenced by students not applying
the same concepts or methods to questions consistently. Inthese situations, our materials instead work to provide scaf-folding so that students can construct the relevant knowledgestructures for themselves. Other materials are built on theidea that students need practice with concepts and applyingthem in varied contexts. No two instructional materials aredesigned using the exact same principles, but all are based
on the belief that students must do much of the legwork in
their learning and we, as the instructors and curriculumdesigners, act as architects who provide a structure and envi-ronment that makes learning possible.
V. OVERVIEW OF MATERIALS
In this section, we describe each type of instructional
resources we have developed and give an example (or two)of each. All materials can be found at our PhysPort web-page.
16Each example provided is from the ﬁrst third of an
introductory quantum mechanics course where the topics ofoperators, measurements, and expectation values are dis-cussed in detail for spin-1/2 systems. At this early stage of aspins-ﬁrst QM course, we ﬁnd many students are naturally
still unfamiliar or uncomfortable with Dirac notation, inter-
pretation and solving of eigenequations, and the basic quan-tum rules involving probability amplitudes. The exampleschosen here were designed to deepen student thinking andultimately improve their understanding of these ideas.Materials designed for use later in the semester are similar instyle but tackle progressively more advanced topics. Thematerials available for download on our webpage also
include additional elements, including lecture notes from the
authors’ courses and instructor guides and tips, to assist fac-ulty in incorporating these materials in their courses.
A. Pre-flight questions
Pre-ﬂight questions
26are a small set of questions given to
students (typically online) before they attend lecture.Generally, they are not graded for correctness, but studentsreceive a small amount of participation credit for completing
them. Pre-ﬂight questions can serve a number of purposes,
including: asking students to recall relevant content from aprevious course; assessing understanding of recent content;having them describe what they learned from a readingassignment; or learning about student concerns at the begin-ning or middle of the semester.
For example, very early in the semester it is important
for students to remember the complex plane and Euler’s
formula, which they have nominally learned in a previous
course. The pre-ﬂight might ask them some complexnumber questions to help them prepare for the next lecture.
42 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 1, January 2023 Pollock, Passante, and Sadaghiani 42 04 October 2023 22:48:46
For reading questions, we have asked what they have learned
from the reading, what they are confused about, and what
questions the reading brought to mind. A common type of
pre-ﬂight question reinforces and/or assesses content already
covered in lecture, as can be seen in the example in Fig. 1.
The advantage to ask these questions on the pre-ﬂight
instead of on a homework assignment is that it allows stu-
dents to more immediately test their understanding. (Since
they are not graded for correctness, some answers may be
given immediately for feedback.) The instructor can look at
the submitted answers to quickly get a sense for students’
comprehension of the topics and make instructional deci-
sions based on this information. Additionally, the pre-ﬂights
act as a low-stakes opportunity for students to assess their
own understanding and take corrective actions, such as ask-ing questions in lecture or attending ofﬁce hours.
A note of caution for implementing pre-ﬂights is that stu-
dents can view these as highly useful or ﬁnd them to be an
annoying course element, depending on the implementation.
In our classes, we make sure to occasionally reference the
pre-ﬂight questions in class to underscore their importance.
We go over some solutions in class, suggest that students
who struggled on the pre-ﬂight might want to come to ofﬁce
hours to discuss the solutions, or provide additional readings
or practice problems to help get them up to speed. When we
show students that we value these tools as instructors, we
have found that student comments on end-of-semester evalu-
ations have been generally positive about the pre-ﬂight
assignments.
B. Concept questions
Concept questions (also known as “clicker questions”) are
multiple choice questions that are administered throughout
lecture in which students are asked to respond either using a
“clicker” device or without technology using voting cards,
small whiteboards, holding up a different number of ﬁngers
for the different answer options, or simply raising their hand.
Concept questions are a simple way to add a highly interac-tive element into lectures. Every faculty member who intro-
duces concept questions into their classes inevitably does itin their own way, and there exist many references to support
their implementation (see the supplementary material forsuggestions
1). If one wants to make a class more interactive,
we have found that frequent low stakes, small group, concep-tually focused discussions of this type rank as one of the low-est threshold entries to interactive engagement pedagogyavailable.
We typically ask a handful of concept questions through-
out our class periods, encouraging students to discuss theanswers in pairs or small groups. More information aboutour speciﬁc implementations can be found in Sec. VI. Our
concept questions are intended to help students make mean-ing of the math, practice techniques, consider additionalexamples, and/or lead into the next topic. They are referredto as “formative assessment”—scaffolding student under-standing, reducing cognitive load by externalizing theirthinking, and providing low-stakes, frequent feedback to usand to our students about how they are doing and what weshould focus on next in class.
We strive to develop questions with a wide range of difﬁ-
culties—a concept question that is initially around 50% cor-rect can be highly effective at generating productiveconversations, whereas a question that almost everyone getswrong can alert the class to a challenging idea or commonmisconception. It may be important in such situations toreassure students this was the intent! Alternatively, a ques-tion that almost all students get correct can be useful forconﬁdence-boosting and letting the instructor know that it’ssafe to move on to the next topic.
In lecture, some examples of “concept tests” at an early
stage of the term might include more formal notational ques-tions as seen in Fig. 2. In a small class where students can
answer individually, the question might be initially framedas open-ended for discussion. In our student population, weﬁnd typically 2/3 of students get this correct, after ratherheated peer discussion. Student reasoning shared in the ensu-ing whole-class discussion typically involves representingthese objects as matrices, and noting that one cannot multi-ply a 2 /C21 column by a 2 /C22 matrix on its right.
Another in-class question we have used is shown in Fig. 3.
By this point in our term, student discussion points focus onsquaring the magnitude and how to deal with phase. Scores onthis question after discussion are generally high (in our clas-ses,>90%), providing some conﬁdence and skill-practice for
most students. Followup discussion can include asking whathappens if one repeats this measurement immediately after, orinstead follows it with a measurement in the x-direction.
As with the rest of our materials, our bank of editable con-
cept questions can be found in Ref. 16. We have found that it
is helpful to have an idea of how students will respond to aquestion, and therefore, we have provided rough estimatesfor our student populations (where available) along with ouranswers, our goals for the question, and typical pitfalls orinteresting teaching moments from our class experiences.
C. Tutorials
Our materials include a set of tutorial worksheets, approxi-
mately one for every week of instruction, that cover manytopics throughout a semester of QM. They are meant to pro-vide students with a deeper conceptual understanding ofmaterial, to address common incorrect ideas, and/or to scaf-fold student development as expert problem solvers bybreaking problems up into smaller pieces or by showing
Fig. 1. Example of two pre-ﬂight questions that would be given after this
content was covered in lecture, but typically before they have had a chance
to complete a homework assignment. Students are not graded for correctness
but do get feedback on their answers.
43 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 1, January 2023 Pollock, Passante, and Sadaghiani 43 04 October 2023 22:48:46
multiple ways to attack a problem. Tutorials were also
designed to help students develop metacognitive strategiesand communication skills. The tutorials are not collected or
graded—they are designed somewhat in the tradition of the
Tutorials in Introductory Physics6,27and are intended to be
worked on by students in small groups with a high instruc-
tor-to-student ratio. Written solutions are not provided, but
we will often discuss solutions in class and in ofﬁce hours.
Our tutorials have been inﬂuenced most notably by our
interactions with the University of Washington Physics
Education Group27and the Oregon State University Physics
Department Paradigms program8,28and instructional materi-
als, and many others.4,6,7Each of these inﬂuences have a
very different pedagogical style and you will see elements ofeach in our materials. Tutorials are one of the more challeng-
ing of our materials to implement in practice as they can be
logistically difﬁcult, especially in large classes, and require
the instructor to “hand over” considerable lecture time to stu-
dents. We have provided detailed instructor guides to help
faculty. As you will see in Sec. VI, each of the authors
administered the tutorials in different ways in their classes,
largely due to institutional differences. For faculty with
space or time limitations (which is almost all of us), our
group has begun work on creating online versions of the
tutorials that can be assigned as out-of-class homework.
The example questions seen in Fig. 4come from a tutorial
entitled “Quantum Mouse,” which introduces a whimsical
quantum mouse with measurable properties such as “eye
size.” The quantum mouse was created as a ﬁctional exten-
sion of the spin-1/2 context. We have found that students
often over-generalize from the spin-1/2 context, where non-
commuting observables ^S
zand ^Sxfrequently result in 50/50
probability splits. In the mouse example, students must go
back to the postulates of quantum mechanics and rely on the
formalism to determine the correct answers. This quantum
mouse example is mathematically analogous to common
problems with “tilted” spin-1/2 states, which is somethingwe focus on in the homework and future lectures.
For instance, eye-size is an observable (measure the diam-
eter of the pupil) with corresponding Hermitian operator ^S
that satisﬁes the eigenequations
^Sj/C3i ¼ 1m mj/C3i; (1)
^Sj/C12i ¼ 2m mj/C12i; (2)
where the symbols * and /C12refer to small and wide eyes,
respectively. In the tutorial we note
“Being either small-eyed ( j/C3i) or wide-eyed ( j/C12i)
is totally normal. In fact, let us assume it is
orthonormal (and complete).”
Follow-up open-ended questions include asking students
to identify the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and operators in
Eqs. (1)and (2), and what “orthonormal” means in thiscontext. We then introduce a second observable: the quan-
tum mood ^M, with eigenstates happy jJiand sad jLi(with
unitless þ1 and –1 eigenvalues, respectively). After conﬁrm-
ing what measurements of mood can yield, we propose arelationship between the two bases and ask calculational andinterpretational questions involving probabilities of various
sequential measurements, seen in Fig. 4.
In general, the quantum mouse tutorial is fun for students.
It brings some levity and concreteness to the sometimes for-
mal and abstract learning of Dirac notation. It supports anddevelops a conceptual understanding of the technical vocab-ulary and procedures associated with eigenequations.Additionally, as you will see in our example exam questionin Sec. VE, the quantum mouse makes a reappearance with
new operators that allow us to assess students’ proﬁciency
using an operator they have not seen before.
The mouse tutorial focuses on application of ideas learned
in class to a new context. Other tutorials are focused insteadon, for example, use of multiple representations, qualitativemethods for solving problems, practice with important calcu-lational skills, addressing common incorrect ideas, or prepa-ration for future learning. The techniques used in eachtutorial are tied to the content and learning needs for that top-ical area of the course.
D. Homework questions
Our homework sets are designed to meet a variety of
course goals including supporting conceptual understanding
and problem-solving skills. In particular, many of our home-
work sets seek to improve representational ﬂuency by havingstudents consider questions with a mix of conceptual, mathe-matical, and notational components. Many of our homeworkproblems are based on end of chapter textbook problems buthave been modiﬁed to address additional learning goalsdescribed in Sec. IV A . Many times this can be accomplished
by merely adding sense-making components. Typical modiﬁ-
cations ask students to: sketch, plot, estimate, ﬁnd a limit,
describe your mathematical solution in words, interpret,deﬁne units, check your answer, explain your reasoning, oruse two methods to solve and compare. Some of our questionsconnect abstract problems to real-world situations or physicalcontexts, others ask students to draw on common physicists’tools such as approximations, expansions, and estimations.
In Fig. 5, we show a question that might appear on the
fourth or ﬁfth homework of the semester. The question setup
comes from the textbook (Problem 3.7 in Ref. 21). We added
multiple subparts to encourage students to visualize thesetup, think explicitly about limiting cases, connect themathematical formalism to their classical understanding of
Fig. 2. Example of a concept question designed to test student understanding
of the notation being used for operators and vectors.

ment of whether or not students understand how to calculate probabilitiesfor a state written in the basis of the operator being measured.

precession, and answer qualitative as well as quantitative
questions. This example shows the way that a mix of abstract
and concrete questions is often grouped together.
E. Exam questions
Exam questions are meant to assess student learning is a
more formal and structured way. When designing our examquestions, we strive to create questions that directly address
our learning goals and that provide students the opportunity
to show us what they are able to do. Our ﬁrst exam typicallyincludes a chained (sequential) Stern–Gerlach apparatus.
These types of questions allow us to assess students’ ability
to convert between bases as appropriate, collapse the state
upon measurement, and interpret expansion coefﬁcients as
Fig. 4. Reproduced excerpt from the Quantum Mouse tutorial. These questions form the second page of the (ﬁve-page) tutorial, after students are ﬁrst i ntro-
duced to the quantum mouse and the eye-size and mood operators. On the actual tutorial worksheet, students are provided with blank space after each que stion
where they can write their responses.
Fig. 5. Example of a homework problem (slightly paraphrased here). The
setup is a textbook problem with additional elements to match course learn-
ing goals beyond just calculation.
Fig. 6. Example of an exam question that increases in difﬁculty for studentsfrom parts (a) through (c). Part (a) asks a question that is familiar to students
but in an unfamiliar context. Part (b) requires more calculation, while part
(c) is a question students likely have not seen before and they must use the
deﬁnition of expectation value in order to solve. A complete set of sample
exam questions are included in the downloadable materials.
45 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 1, January 2023 Pollock, Passante, and Sadaghiani 45 04 October 2023 22:48:46
probability amplitudes. It also requires that students distin-
guish “measured values” (eigenvalues) from resulting states.
A representative exam question is an extension of the
quantum mouse tutorial example above. As can be seen in
Fig. 6, we introduce a two-state quantum cat with similar
properties to the quantum mouse. The use of the novel con-
text prevents students from relying on memorized facts about
basis change for spin-1/2 particles and provides them with
the opportunity to compute probabilities, distinguish eigen-
values from eigenstates, and perform change-of-basis opera-
tions. Part (c) of this exam question is more challenging
because it requires that students use the deﬁnition of an
expectation value to work “backwards” to determine the
probability of one of the outcomes.
Our exam questions are almost always multi-part ques-
tions that increase in difﬁculty with each part. This allows all
students to answer portions of the question correctly. Almost
always it is possible to fairly grade the later parts of the ques-tion even if students answer a previous part incorrectly.
While it is not possible to assess everything on a ﬁnal exam,
we strive to assess as many of the learning goals as possible.
We try to include a variety of question types—for example,
conceptual questions, more traditional algebraic questions,
and questions that involve graphs or other representations.
Some of the authors make use of two-stage exams29where
students ﬁrst complete the assessment individually before
redoing it in small groups. This provides immediate feedback
from their peers and turns the assessment into a collaborative
learning opportunity.
F. End of term conceptual assessment: QMCA
Conceptual assessments have become common in physics
education at the university level. They provide standard, val-
idated measures of conceptual learning, and can be useful to
evaluate and compare pedagogy and curricula. There is a
long history of their effective use at the introductory level18
with increasing interest in assessment at the upper-divisionas well.19,22,30We use the Quantum Mechanics Conceptual
Assessment (QMCA),9,31typically given at the end of a ﬁrst
semester of quantum mechanics. The QMCA is a multiple
choice instrument, built from earlier open-ended research-
based tests, that focuses on measurement, the 1D
Schrodinger equation, time evolution, and probability den-
sity. It includes a subset of parallel questions, which modify
the problems’ context from wave functions to spin-1/2 con-
texts. The QMCA is typically given either in class or online
as a ﬁnal “participation only” homework assignment (so sol-
utions are not posted). The instrument has been given at
many universities. Class averages typically range from 40%
to 60%. At a single institution, we generally ﬁnd that scores
are consistent from term to term in a given context (sameclass, same instructor) unless some signiﬁcant change in ped-
agogy is made, making this a helpful tool for faculty seeking
to systematically improve instruction. Our students’ feed-
back shows they value taking the test, as a chance to review
concepts from earlier in the term, and practice/prepare for
the upcoming ﬁnal.
VI. IMPLEMENTATION IN A DIVERSE SET
OF CLASSROOMS
In Sec. V, we have presented the types of materials that
we have developed for use in a ﬁrst semester quantummechanics course. These materials can be used in many dif-
ferent combinations to create student-centered, interactivecourses. In fact, the three authors each teach quantummechanics using these same materials, but in different ways.Some parameters that affect our decisions include class sizes,number of class meetings per week, whether or not we havea recitation section, and personal stylistic preferences.Additionally, each institution has a unique student popula-tion with different demographics, prerequisites, and prepara-tion, which we need to take into account.
One salient difference in our courses is the class size: our
courses range from 10 to 100 students. In a class with fewerthan 30 students, it’s possible to have personal interactionswith each student during small group work. The small groupenvironment is very different in a large lecture hall, whereconcept questions are a more efﬁcient way to engage each
student. Even our use of concept questions varies between
institutions that use a clicker technology and institutionswhere that is not the norm and voting happens using coloredcards.
The other large difference in our courses is how tutorials
are used. Among our three institutions, we have three differ-ent structures for tutorials: a separate, required, recitationsection; an optional recitation section; and no recitation sec-tion. In courses with the recitation section, a tutorial is usedeach week. How that tutorial interfaces with the content varydepending on whether or not the recitation section isrequired. Without a recitation section, tutorials are used inlecture and their use is reduced with only 7–8 tutorials beingused throughout the semester (as opposed to 12–15 in theother classes).
We have also needed to carefully consider our institutions
and the student populations they serve. One institution is aresearch-intensive, selective, large public, Ph.D.-grantinguniversity. The other two are primarily undergraduate, large,public, Hispanic Serving Institutions. Our student populationvaries in terms of background preparation and previouscourses taken. In considering the speciﬁc needs of our stu-dents, we may choose, for example, to include more or lesscontent that reinforces mathematical concepts learned in pre-vious courses. To include more background material, wemight, for example, add a pre-ﬂight targeting an idea in orderto better prepare students for lecture. Where we feel lessbackground/review is needed, we might, for example, omitor quickly recap the ﬁrst page of a tutorial that reminds stu-dents of these concepts.
Additional differences between our courses include the
use of PowerPoint slides or hand written notes on a tablet orchalkboard during class, and the number of pre-ﬂights used
each week. However, despite these differences, our classes
all have a similar feel to them, where students and their
learning are front and center. We are responsive to studentprogress throughout the semester and routinely adapt ourplans based on students’ needs.
We hope that these instructional materials and the discus-
sions of our implementations of them will inspire faculty toincorporate some (or many) new active learning elementsinto their courses. Our materials are organized so that it’seasy to ﬁnd speciﬁc resources, whether an instructor wantsto select a single type of materials (for example, conceptquestions or tutorials), or look for tools to teach a speciﬁctopic (for example, time evolution). They were designed tobe adapted to each individual environment, and we encour-age faculty to do just that.
