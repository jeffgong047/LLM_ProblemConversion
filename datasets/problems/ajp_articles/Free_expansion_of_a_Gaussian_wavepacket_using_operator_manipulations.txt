The free expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket is a problem commonly discussed in undergraduate
quantum classes by directly solving the time-dependent Schr €odinger equation as a differential
equation. In this work, we provide an alternative way to calculate the free expansion byrecognizing that the Gaussian wavepacket can be thought of as the ground state of a harmonic
oscillator with its frequency adjusted to give the initial width of the Gaussian, and the time
evolution, given by the free-particle Hamiltonian, being the same as the application of a time-dependent squeezing operator to the harmonic oscillator ground state. Operator manipulations
alone (including the Hadamard lemma and the exponential disentangling identity) then allow us to
directly solve the problem. As quantum instruction evolves to include more quantum informationscience applications, reworking this well-known problem using a squeezing formalism will help
students develop intuition for how squeezed states are used in quantum sensing.

I. INTRODUCTION
A common example of time evolution taught in quantum
mechanics classes—in fact, in many cases, the ﬁrst examplethat is considered—is the free expansion of a Gaussianwavepacket starting from a state with variance rand zero
average momentum, which is in the following wavepacket att¼0

4e/C0x2=4r2: (1)
It is then solved by transforming from position to momentum
space, time evolving in momentum space, and then trans-forming back to position space. These Fourier transformationintegrals are elementary to do, because they are in aGaussian form and Gaussians integrate to Gaussians.
However, the analysis is fairly technical and does not pro-
vide great physical intuition as to what is happening (asidefrom the notion that because we have a spread in momentum,this means that components of the wavepacket move in posi-tion space at different rates and hence the position-spacewavepacket spreads in time).
In this work, we present a different methodology to solve
this problem based on the modern concept of squeezing.Squeezing is a phenomenon whereby a quantum state main-
tains a minimum uncertainty product, but the uncertainties in
position and momentum oscillate in time, with each individ-ual uncertainty becoming very small at some moment oftime and the other uncertainty becoming very small at a latertime. Squeezing is often discussed within the context of asimple harmonic oscillator. Here, the squeezing operatorlooks similar to the exponentiation of the Hamiltonian itself,but with different coefﬁcients in front of the individual
terms. The application to the free-expansion of a Gaussian
comes from the facts that the ground state of a harmonicoscillator is also a Gaussian, and the free time-evolutionoperator is a squeezing operator (for the harmonic oscillatorsystem). Hence, the time evolution of a Gaussian can be
solved by simply applying a squeezing operator to the har-
monic oscillator ground state!
Squeezed states can be difﬁcult to understand. One way to
physically picture them is via a quantum quench. If a systemis in a harmonic oscillator energy eigenstate with an initialfrequency x
i, and then suddenly the frequency changes to
xf, then we would expect the initially steady state to evolve
over time. This subsequent time evolution is one way tothink of the behavior of a squeezed state. Unlike a coherentstate, which preserves its shape as it evolves in time, the
squeezed state changes its shape as it evolves, periodically
changing from a squeezed state, with smaller variance inposition space, to an expanded state, with a larger variancein position space. The period of the shape oscillations is onehalf the period of the new oscillator. If, the quench goes all
the way to x
f¼0, then we will no longer have periodic
motion. Instead, the Gaussian will simply expand forever asa function of time. This is precisely the scenario for the freeexpansion of a Gaussian that we consider here.
We have surveyed 25 different undergraduate textbooks to
see whether they cover the free-expansion of a Gaussian
wavepacket and where this material appears relative to dis-cussions of the operator-based solution of the simple har-monic oscillator. We also looked at whether these textbooksdiscuss coherent states and squeezed states. The results are
summarized in Table I. Clearly, none of these texts are ideal
for using the material presented here—supplemental materialwill be required for all of them.
For undergraduate classes that employ these textbooks,
the methodology we discuss ﬁts in best with a course orga-
nized so that the abstract operator method is used to solve
the harmonic oscillator problem before a discussion of the
spreading Gaussian wavepacket. However, because all ofthese textbooks have inadequate resources for these topics,
extra instruction on squeezed states of the harmonic oscilla-
tor is required. Since quantum mechanics classes are likelyto change the material they cover to be more aligned with

quantum information science, we anticipate many more clas-
ses will provide coverage of coherent and squeezed statesand be well positioned to discuss the material we develophere in the near future. Indeed, we ﬁnd from our textbooksurvey that more recent books are more likely to covercoherent and squeezed states, supporting this trend.
The pedagogical literature has also discussed the free
expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket extensively, but we arenot aware of any physics education research work on thissqueezed states approach. Our discussion of previous peda-
gogical work will not be exhaustive here. Much of the previ-
ous work is interested in the question of whether and howthe wavepacket expands,
1,2how its shape evolves over
time,3–5and whether a power-series expansion to the time-
evolution operator converges.2Some papers discuss alterna-
tive methodologies to compute the evolving wavepacket.6,7
We are aware of three works that discuss this problem in
relationship to squeezed states of the simple harmonic oscil-lator.8–10Unlike this previous work, our work emphasizes
the operator approach to squeezed states.
The ground-state wavefunction of a simple harmonic
oscillator, with mass mand frequency xis given by
wgsðxÞ¼h xj0i¼mx
p/C22h/C18/C19 1
4
e/C0mxx2=2/C22h: (2)
Here, j0iis the ground state of the simple harmonic oscilla-
tor, and jxiis the position eigenstate at the location x. The
variance r2of the initial Gaussian is set by choosing
x¼/C22h=2mr2. Next, we can use a displacement operator to
displace the Gaussian in both position space and momentumspace. The displacement by x0and p0, respectively, is
given by
^Dðx0;y0Þ¼e/C0i
/C22hðx0^p/C0p0^xÞ; (3)
where ^xand ^pare the operators of position and momentum,
which satisfy the canonical commutation relation ½^x;^p/C138¼i/C22h.
The displaced Gaussian state can then be represented by
jwgs;x0;p0i¼ ^Dðx0;p0Þj0i; (4)
our choice for writing the wavepacket in this fashion ﬁxes its
initial global phase.
The free-particle evolves according to the free
Hamiltonian, given by ^Hfree¼^p2=2m, so the time evolution
of the initial Gaussian state becomes
jwgsðtÞ;x0;p0i¼e/C0i
/C22h^Hfreet^Dðx0;p0Þj0i; (5)
and the spreading Gaussian wavefunction evolves according
to time via
wgsðx;t;x0;p0Þ¼h xje/C0i
/C22h^Hfreet^Dðx0;p0Þj0i: (6)
It turns out that this is in the form of a squeezed and dis-
placed simple harmonic oscillator state, which can be seen
most easily when we express the position and momentumoperators in terms of the ladder operators of the simple har-monic oscillator.
The raising and lowering operators for a simple harmonic
oscillator are given byTable I. Summary of different topics, as presented in 25 undergraduate quantum mechanics textbooks. The X indicates that the topic is covered in the co rre-
sponding textbook.

with nbeing a complex number and gbeing a real number.
When converted to position and momentum operators, this is
the most general unitary operator that can be constructed from
quadratics in position and momentum; namely, it is of the
form exp ðia^x2þibð^x^pþ^p^xÞþic^p2Þ, with the real numbers

Hence, the most general spreading Gaussian is a displaced-

case, in which n¼ig. We ﬁnd we need to work with a simpli-

Here, the operator for time evolution is ^S/C0xt
4/C0/C1, with
k¼xt=4, because it involves the exponential of the square
of the momentum operator; we will ﬁnd we also need to
work with the exponential of a constant times the square of
the position operator, which corresponds to ^Sþðk0Þfor a suit-
ably chosen k0given below.
II. FORMALISM AND DETAILS OF THE
DERIVATION
If students know about the operator-based solution of the
simple harmonic oscillator, coherent states and squeezedstates, then it is natural to also discuss the spreading of a
Gaussian wavepacket in the context of this simpliﬁed
squeezing operator and the displacement operator. Wedescribe the details for how this works next. What we ﬁnd to
be particularly interesting about this approach is that we use
ladder operators from the simple harmonic oscillator in the
analysis, even though the quantum state evolves with respect
to a free-particle Hamiltonian, and there is no frequencyscale in the free-particle Hamiltonian. The simple harmonic
oscillator (and thereby the frequency we will use) enters
only because the initial wavepacket is a Gaussianwavepacket with an initial variance r
2. This tells us the fre-
quency of the simple harmonic oscillator for which this
Gaussian is the ground-state wavefunction and allows us to
examine the spreading of the wavepacket in this fashion. Theformal developments in this work are similar to, but different
from, earlier work on how to determine the displaced-
squeezed state wavefunction using operator methods11in
that here we must work with g6¼0, whereas there, g¼0.
We start with a coherent state jaiwith initial position
x0¼0 and some arbitrary initial momentum p0. Then, using
the standard notation for coherent states, we have that
a¼ip01ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2/C22hmxp for this special case. We use the free-particle
Hamiltonian, with mandxﬁxed in our calculations, and we
have that the initial variance of the probability distribution is
given by r2
0¼D2
x¼/C22h=2mx, since it is a coherent state.
To obtain the time-dependent wavefunction, we take the
overlap of a position bra with the time-evolved initial coher-ent state

The coherent state is simply a momentum translation opera-
tor applied to the harmonic oscillator ground state. We willalso ﬁnd it convenient to later introduce the position state at
the origin j0
xi, which satisﬁes ^xj0xi¼0. Then, using the
translation operator for position yields the position eigenstate
atxviajxi¼e/C0i
/C22hx^pj0xi, so that ^xjxi¼xjxi. In addition,
because the position translation operator has the semigroup
property, given by e/C0i
/C22hx^pe/C0i
/C22hx0^p¼e/C0i
/C22hðxþx0Þ^p, we ﬁnd that
jxþx0i¼e/C0i
/C22hx0^pjxi¼e/C0i
/C22hx^pjx0iboth hold. We will also use
this identity below.
Our manipulations will employ two other operator identi-
ties: (i) the Hadamard lemma,

2!^A;^A;^B/C2/C3/C2/C3

nnested commutators
of^Awith ^B(15)
and (ii) the exponential disentangling identity, which is dis-
cussed in the Appendix .
Now, we begin our work to simplify Eq. (13). We use a
multiply by 1 to create a Hadamard lemma expression,
which, after evaluating the Hadamard lemma, effectively
moves the expip0
/C22h^x/C16/C17
term from the right of the time evolu-
tion operator to its left

out of the matrix element. Evaluating the Hadamard lemma
requires some standard operator manipulations. First, we expand
the central exponential in a power series, and note that the expo-
nential factors can be moved into the exponent (this operation is
called the braiding relation), because the “internal” exponential
factors appear in pairs and multiply to 1

Note that the Hadamard for the exponent truncates after just
the ﬁrst commutator, because it is a number, which subse-
quently commutes with all operators.
Next, we expand the squared exponent in Eq. (16), pull
out the constant terms, let the terms with a linear exponent in
^pact on the bra to translate the position state, and then
replace the momentum operator with its expression in terms
of ladder operators (of the simple harmonic oscillator) in the
quadratic exponent to give us

We need to motivate our next step. The exponent of the oper-
ator is proportional to the difference of the ladder operators,
and we do not know how such an operator acts on the posi-tion bra to the left. However, if we could ﬁnd a way to
change the difference of ladder operators into a sum in the
exponent, then the operator in the exponent would be propor-
tional to ^x
2, which can be readily applied onto the position
eigenbra to its left. This would then leave us with theground-state wavefunction evaluated at x/C0tp0
m. In order to
accomplish the sign change, we ﬁrst use the exponential dis-
entangling identity acting on the simple harmonic oscillator
ground state and apply it to the operator with a quadratic
exponent as given in Eq. (A12) . We use the case with a dif-
ference of the ladder operators and k¼xt=4. We ﬁnd Eq.

This is, of course, the standard result for the spreading
Gaussian wavefunction in position space. Using operator
methods to determine it is a straightforward exercise that
helps build facility in working with operators. It is also inter-
esting to think of this in terms of squeezing and a “hidden”simple harmonic oscillator.
The momentum-space derivation is even simpler. We start

The evaluation of the remaining expectation value is easy
once we realize that the exponential operator translates the
momentum via jpi¼eip
/C22h^xj0pi, with ^pj0pi¼0 deﬁning the
momentum state at the origin j0pi. So, we ﬁnd the exponen-
tial operator translates the momentum bra to give us

III. APPLICATIONS OF THESE IDENTITIES
AND NEW EXERCISES FOR STUDENT LEARNING
One of the goals in modernizing physics instruction is to
bring modern experimental results into the classroom. Recent
work on atoms trapped in harmonic potentials has been able
to (i) create the ground state, the ﬁrst excited state, and the
second excited state and (ii) has used time-of-ﬂight spectros-
copy to measure the momentum distribution of the atom
when it is in these different Fock states.13The formalism we
used to describe the free-expansion of the simple harmonic
oscillator can be immediately adapted to analysing this exper-
iment, which makes for a context-rich problem for students
studying the expansion of wavepackets. We describe how this
can be used in instruction next.
These experiments employ time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy, which
is an important experimental technique that does not often get
discussed in quantum instruction. The only quantum textbook
we are aware of that discusses this technique in any detail is
Ballentine’s book.14In fact, even though many textbooks say
that one can measure the momentum of a quantum particle, vir-
tually none explain just how one does this. It is subtle, because
we usually measure position to infer momentum; hence, intro-
ducing a discussion of time-of-ﬂight provides a great opportu-
nity to properly explain how Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
applies to a real experiment on measuring momentum.
In fact, while many textbooks do describe how one can
measure position, they are often silent about how to measure
momentum. For example, Grifﬁths states “You might won-
der how it is enforced in the laboratory—why can’t you
determine (say) both the position and the momentum of a
particle? You can certainly measure the position of the parti-cle, but the act of measurement collapses the wave function
to a narrow spike, which necessarily carries a broad range of
wavelengths (hence momenta) in its Fourier decomposition.”
In this discussion, Grifﬁths is intimating that a simultaneous
measurement of position and momentum is impossible. It is
certainly true that subsequent measurements of position can-
not be used to determine the original momentum, but that
does not forbid position and momentum to be measured atthe same time, as we see below. Zweibach explicitly states
“given a particle, you cannot simultaneously know both itsposition and its momentum.” However, a time-of-ﬂightmeasurement is one way to determine momentum and itdoes so by measuring position. Is this in conﬂict with theCopenhagen interpretation? Of course not, because themomentum is inferred from the position measurement andthe assumption that the wavepacket is traveling as a free par-ticle. One simply needs to perform the analysis properly. Letus explain carefully how time-of-ﬂight works.
In a time-of-ﬂight experiment, one prepares a reasonably
localized state. (In Ref. 13, the state is localized on the order
of 0 :3–0:5lm.) Then at a speciﬁc time, the harmonic oscilla-
tor trapping potential is shut off (a quench to x
f¼0, just
like we analyzed above). We start a clock at this time and letthe atom expand in its wavepacket for some time before
measuring its position. (In Ref. 13, the time of ﬂight is about
10ls.) At the moment of the measurement, we know the
position to the accuracy of the position detector—but, wealso know its momentum, which is inferred from the factthat it traveled as a free particle from its localized origin towhere it was detected in the time of ﬂight. So, at the momentof the measurement, we know the position and momentumof the quantum particle for this one experimental shot!
Does this violate uncertainty? Of course not. The uncer-
tainty principle applies to the spread in the results if we repeatthe measurement many times (which will actually determinethe momentum distribution). The momentum distribution isthat of the original trapped atom, plus any spread in the distri-bution that occurred due to the time of ﬂight. However,because the momentum distribution does not spread in time,we do really measure the momentum distribution of the atomin its trap. What about the original position uncertainty?Unfortunately, we cannot determine that, because this mea-surement is not sensitive to the initial position. However, theuncertainty in knowing just what the initial position is (due tothe initial wavepacket spread) does lead to an intrinsic uncer-tainty in the momentum measurement in a time-of-ﬂight exper-iment, but one can make that uncertainty as small as desiredby simply increasing the time for the time of ﬂight (whichreduces the relative error for the momentum measurement).
Hence, the time-of-ﬂight measurement does not fall into
the standard measurement paradigm taught in most quantumtextbooks, and it avoids the uncertainty principle restrictionson individual experimental shots due to the way it is set-up.The time of ﬂight is employed to magnify the position valuesso that we can distinguish these different positions (due tothe magniﬁcation effect) and then infer the different
momenta in the initial momentum distribution.
What gets confused about quantum mechanics postulates
is that every quantum state has complementary uncertaintiesthat must obey the uncertainty principle. In other words, noquantum state can be created that has deﬁnite position andmomentum. Similarly, no von Neumann style projectivemeasurement can measure both position and momentumwithout obeying uncertainty as well. However, the vonNeumann paradigm is not sufﬁcient to be used to describe allof the parts of the time-of-ﬂight measurement—it onlydescribes the position measurement part. This is a subtlepoint, but an important one to convey to students.
So, while one can certainly say one cannot create a quan-
tum state with deﬁnite position and momentum, one shouldnever say that one cannot measure position and momentum at
the same time. One can. Discussing how this works provides

a great opportunity to carefully explain the subtleties of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the strategies used to
measure momentum. These are two topics often given “short
shrift” in the traditional quantum mechanics courses.
Back to the experiment in Ref. 13. In those measurements,
they examine not just the momentum distribution of theground state, but of the two lowest excited states as well. We
can easily generalize the techniques we developed above to
determine the momentum distributions for these differentFock states too, and this is an excellent exercise for studentspost instruction. Since the momentum distribution of a har-
monic oscillator is identical in shape to the position distribu-
tion, this also can be thought of as a magniﬁed visualizationof the original position distribution as well. The calculation
is quite simple to do, and this is because all harmonic oscilla-
tor Fock states maintain their shape (in momentum space)during time of ﬂight.
5So, if I start in the nth Fock state,
given byð^a†Þnﬃﬃﬃ
n!pj0i, then the momentum distribution after a
time of ﬂight of duration tis simply given by

which can be immediately solved to be

2/C22hm:(32)
Here, we have introduced the physicist’s form of the
Hermite polynomial. Details for how to do this using opera-tors have been discussed by Rushka and Freericks.12
One might say that because we directly measure the posi-
tion in the time-of-ﬂight, we should really calculate the posi-
tion distribution at time t. One can do this as well for the
Fock states, but it takes a few more steps. Again, we assumethe initial momentum is zero because we are in an energyeigenstate. Then, the only difference in the derivation is that
at the point when we use the exponential disentangling iden-
tity, the exponentials of ^a
2and of ^a†^acannot immediately
act on the ground state because the ð^a†Þnterm is in the way.
However, this causes no problem, as one can move the expo-
nentials past that operator by using a “multiply-by-one”followed by the Hadamard lemma. We have to do thistwice—once when we use the disentangling identity on the
square of the momentum operator and once when we bring
the required factors needed to convert the exponential to thesquare of the position operator. This requires a fair amountof algebra, which then yields

This has the same shape as the ﬁrst excited state, but with
x2!x2=ð1þx2t2Þ(and the required change in the normali-
zation factor), as we expect it to.5The calculation of higher-
order excited states follows in a similar fashion but is tedious
to work out the details, because the Hermite polynomial must
have each power of xscaled with a different factor, leading to
cumbersome equations to work out. So we stop here.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this work, we showed an alternative way to determine
the expansion of a Gaussian wavepacket in free space as afunction of time by mapping the problem onto the applica-
tion of a squeezing operator on a simple-harmonic-oscillator
ground state with the same variance as the initial wavepacket
att¼0. The squeezing operator used here is particularly
simple, which allows us to use an exponential disentangling
identity in the derivation that is easy to derive. Given the
increasing interest in quantum information science, espe-
cially in quantum sensing, we feel this approach will provide
an interesting new perspective on an old problem.
We worked with operators throughout, because we believe
working with operators makes the material accessible to
more students since it does not require calculus. (Calculus is
only needed to determine normalization constants, and those
can be told to the student if needed.)
All of the pedagogy used with the free-expansion of a
Gaussian wavepacket can also be used if it is taught this
way. This pedagogy is well-known and appears in many text-
books, so we do not rehash it here. Instead, we described
how this approach can be employed to introduce a modern
time-of-ﬂight experiment that measures the momentum dis-
tribution of a quantum particle in a harmonic trap and in the
ground state or a low-lying excited state. This provides an
interesting new application of the freely expanding
Gaussian, which should become a standard in quantum
mechanics courses of the future.

with kbeing a complex number. Disentangling identities are
proven by mapping the operators in the exponent onto Lie
algebra generators.15Here, the Lie algebra is that of the sym-
plectic group. We employ a faithful matrix representation of
that Lie algebra to derive an identity of the exponential oper-ator in terms of the product of three different exponential
operators—each involving one of the Lie algebra generators.
Then, because the representation is faithful, the identity
holds when expressed in terms of the Lie generators as well.
We start by working with the following operators, which
serve as generators of the symplectic Lie algebra

as can be directly worked out from the fact that ½^a;^a†/C138¼1.
This algebra looks quite similar to the more familiar SU(2)
algebra, except for the change in sign on the last commuta-
tor. Then, we have
