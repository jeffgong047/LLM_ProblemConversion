We report here an inadvertently misplaced parenthesis in our original published paper.1In the second line of Eq. (5), the
extra closing parenthesis after cosh ðk2w1Þshould instead be after sinh ðk2w1Þ. The correct equation reads as
T¼4h
eik1ðw1þw2Þð2coshðk3w2Þ/C0ik1/C03sinhðk3w2ÞÞ /C2 ð 2coshðk2w1Þ/C0ik1/C02sinhðk2w1ÞÞ
þeik1ðgþb/C0w1Þk1þ3k1þ2sinhðk2w1Þsinhðk3w2Þi/C01
: (1)
The results in the ﬁgures of our original published paper were obtained from numerical simulations, and hence, our results
are not affected.
The authors thank Professor Sudipta Sarkar and Dr. Kabir Chakravarti for alerting us to this typographical error.
