(Received 19 May 2022; accepted 26 May 2023)
In electromagnetism courses, students often solve Poisson’s equation for a point charge in the
presence of an inﬁnitely large perfectly conducting planar surface, usually by the method of
images. However, no surface is perfectly ﬂat; so at some level, corrugations must be introduced
to model the real world. Clinton et al. [ P h y s .R e v .B 31, 7540 (1985)] solved the problem,
including corrugations, using a perturbative calculation of the corresponding Green’s function.
We provide a detailed pedagogical review of this calculation and extend it in order to solve for
the electrostatic potential of a corrugated neutral conducting cylinder in the presence of auniform electric ﬁeld. These calculations can be used as pedagogical examples of this
perturbative approach in electromagnetism courses.

I. INTRODUCTION
At some scale, even smooth surfaces have corrugations
that will affect their interactions. As an example, consider acharge in the vicinity of a surface.1,2The image potential,
which arises from the induced charge distribution, is impor-tant for the formation of image potential states, which arequantum states of electrons localized at the surface of mate-rials with negative electron afﬁnity.
2The behavior of these
electrons can reveal important physical and chemical surfaceproperties.3,4Prior to 1980, the majority of the investigations
of image potential effects assumed that the interfaces
between two media were planar,2but the image potential is
modiﬁed when the surface has deformations.1,4
Perturbative expansions are often employed in electro-
magnetism courses in the context of multipolar expan-sions.5–7In 1985, using a perturbative approach to solve
Poisson’s equation, Clinton et al. calculated the image poten-
tial for a point charge in vacuum in the presence of a per-fectly conducting corrugated surface.8Recently, this
perturbative approach was also used to obtain the electron–electron interaction in a 2D system in the presence of a cor-rugated dielectric medium
9and to investigate the van der
Waals interaction between an anisotropic polarizable particleand a nonplanar surface.10–12
In the present paper, we pedagogically review the calcula-
tions of Clinton et al. , aiming to popularize their results. We
pay special attention to the case of a sinusoidal surface,showing how the potential, electric ﬁeld, and induced surfacecharge density are affected by the corrugated surface. Wealso present an original contribution, extending this perturba-tive approach to solve Laplace’s equation for the electro-static potential of a corrugated neutral conducting cylinder ina uniform electric ﬁeld. (Without corrugation, this is anothervery common exercise in electromagnetism courses.) Thisproblem is considerably simpler than that discussed inRef. 8, making it a useful example to employ when teaching
students about corrugated surfaces in electromagnetismcourses.This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we brieﬂy
review the problem of a point charge in the presence of aninﬁnite perfectly conducting planar surface. In Sec. III,w e
review Clinton, Esrick, and Sacks’ perturbative solution of
Poisson’s equation in the presence of a nonplanar conductingsurface. In Sec. IV, we apply the previously obtained formu-
las to the case of a sinusoidal corrugated surface. In Sec. V,
we review the solution to Laplace’s equation for an ideal
conducting cylinder placed in a uniform electrostatic ﬁeld. InSec. VI, we add corrugation to the cylinder’s surface and
apply the perturbative approach to solve Laplace’s equation
for this case. In Sec. VII, we perform a consistency check on
the formulas obtained in Sec. VIby applying them to the
case of a cylinder with a slight enhancement in its radius. In
Sec. VIII, we apply our perturbative calculations to a sinu-
soidally corrugated cylinder and analyze how the potential,electric ﬁeld, and induced surface charge density are affectedby the corrugation. In Sec. IX, we present our ﬁnal remarks.
II. A POINT CHARGE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN
INFINITE PLANAR CONDUCTING SURFACE
We begin by reviewing the calculation of the potential U
due to a point charge Qlocated at r
0¼r0
jjþz0^z(with z0>0
andr0
jj¼x0^xþy0^y) in the presence of a grounded conduct-
ing plane located at z¼0 (see Fig. 1). The potential can be
written, in Gaussian units, as
Ur;r0ðÞ ¼QGr;r0ðÞ ; (1)
where Gðr;r0Þis Green’s function of the Laplacian operator
(see, for instance, Refs. 13–15 ). Thus, the problem consists
of solving (in the region z/C210) Poisson’s equation
r2Gr;r0ðÞ ¼/C04pdr/C0r0 ðÞ ; (2)
under the boundary conditions

The solution is usually obtained by the image method in
which the conducting plane is replaced by a charge – Q(the
image charge) located at ri¼r0
jj/C0z0^z(see Fig. 2). For this
new conﬁguration, the solution is simply given by the sum of
Green’s function of each charge

This solution, for z/C210, is also the solution for the original
problem given in Eqs. (2)–(4) .
III. REVIEW OF CLINTON, ESRICK, AND SACKS’
CALCULATIONS
In this section, we review the perturbative analytical cal-
culations found in Ref. 8. These authors computed, perturba-
tively, the potential Ufor a point charge Qlocated at r0,i n
the presence of a grounded conducting corrugated surfacegiven by z¼hðrjjÞ, where hðrjjÞis a function describing the
small corrugations in the surface ½maxjhðrjjÞj /C28 z0/C138(Fig. 3).
Effectively, the problem consists of ﬁnding [in the regionz/C21hðr
jjÞ] the solution of Eq. (2), under the condition of Eq.
(4), but with the boundary condition (3)modiﬁed to
Gr;r0ðÞjz¼hðrjjÞ¼0: (6)
To build a perturbative description, these authors intro-
duced an arbitrary auxiliary parameter e, with 0 /C20e/C201.
Thus, one parameterizes: hðrjjÞ! ehðrjjÞ, so that Eq. (6)is
replaced by
Gr;r0ðÞjz¼ehðrjjÞ¼0; (7)
and Green’s function is written as a perturbative expansion
in terms of the parameter e,8
Gðr;r0Þ¼Gð0Þðr;r0ÞþX1

where Gð0Þðr;r0Þis the unperturbed Green’s function [Eq.
(5), now considered for z/C21hðrkÞ], and GðnÞðr;r0Þare pertur-
bative corrections. When e¼0, one has the solution to the
case of a planar surface, whereas, when e¼1, we recover
the actual problem of a corrugated surface described byz¼hðr
kÞ.
Substituting Eq. (8)in Eq. (2), one obtains

Since eis arbitrary, the coefﬁcients multiplying each power

It is important to remark that only by knowing Gð0Þ, one can
obtain the boundary condition for Gð1Þ, and then for
Gð2Þ;Gð3Þ, and so on. Also note that for n/C211, these bound-
ary conditions are inhomogeneous. In other words, the origi-nal problem of solving the non-homogeneous Eq. (2), under
a homogeneous boundary condition on a complicated surfacez¼hðr
kÞ[Eq. (6)], is now replaced by the problem of solv-
ing the homogeneous Eq. (11), under non-homogeneous
boundary conditions on a simple plane at z¼0 [Eq. (16)].Following Ref. 8, in order to ﬁnd a solution, it is convenient
to introduce the Fourier transformation (and its inverse)

Under the boundary condition Eq. (22) and the condition
that ~Gð0Þgoes to zero for large distances [Eq. (4)], the solu-

By performing an inverse Fourier transformation on ~Gð0Þ,
one obtains the unperturbed Green’s function which exactlymatches (5).
Under the boundary condition Eq. (23) and the condition
that ~GðnÞgoes to zero for large distances, the solution of Eq.

Thus, one obtains the functions ~GðnÞrecursively in terms of
~Gð0Þ. The solution for GðnÞis obtained by performing the
inverse Fourier transformation,

Thus, substituting Gð0Þ[Eq. (5)] and GðnÞ[Eqs. (26) and
(27)] in Eq. (8)(with e¼1), one obtains Green’s function
for the problem of a point charge in the presence of agrounded conducting corrugated surface.
A consistency check can be made by considering the case
of a translated plane, hðr
kÞ¼a, with jaj<z0, since the exact
solution for this problem is known. For more details, we dis-
cuss this case in Sec. II of the supplementary material.16In
Sec. IV, we focus on the case of a sinusoidally corrugated
surface.
IV. POINT CHARGE IN THE PRESENCE
OF A SINUSOIDAL CONDUCTING SURFACE
As an application of the Clinton, Esrick, and Sacks calcu-
lations, consider a point charge Qin the presence of a sinu-
soidal corrugated surface, described by (see Fig. 4)
hðrkÞ¼a
21þcos/C23xðÞ ½/C138 : (28)
To calculate Gð1Þ, we ﬁrst substitute Eq. (28) in Eq. (24)
(with m¼1) and obtain

xÞ/C2

Substituting it in Eq. (26),f o r n¼1, one obtains

ðkxþ/C23Þ2þk2ypi
: (30)
As a ﬁrst application of the above approximate solution,
we calculate the electric ﬁeld Eby performing the inverse
Fourier transformation of Eq. (30), applying the gradient
operator analytically (on the integrand), and then numerically evaluating the resulting integrals. In Fig. 5,w e
show the electric ﬁeld lines for a point charge in the presence
of both a planar surface and a sinusoidally corrugated sur-
face. For the considered values for a,/C23, and z0, one can see
that the electric ﬁeld lines are practically perpendicular tothe surface, indicating an acceptable approximate solution.
We further investigate the effects of this corrugation by cal-
culating the induced surface charge density r; details can be
found in Sec. III of the supplementary material.16
V. CONDUCTING CYLINDER IN A UNIFORM
ELECTRIC FIELD
In this section, we review the textbook solution to the
problem of a cylinder in the presence of a uniform electro-
static ﬁeld, and in Sec. VI, we introduce corrugation to the
cylinder’s surface.

We start by considering an inﬁnite grounded conducting cyl-
inder, with radius a, in a uniform electrostatic ﬁeld E0¼E0^x,
as illustrated in Fig. 6. The electrostatic potential can be calcu-
lated by means of Laplace’s equation r2Uðr;r0Þ¼0. Since the
cylinder is inﬁnitely long, we have translational symmetry in thez-direction, so that Uðq;h;zÞ!Uðq;hÞ. In this case, Laplace’s
equation in cylindrical coordinates can be written as

: (32)
Since we consider the cylinder as a grounded perfect conduc-
tor, we have a boundary condition at q¼a,
Uq;hðÞ jq¼a¼0: (33)
At large q, the potential has to describe the ﬁeld E0¼E0^x
and, therefore, it can be written as
Uq;hðÞ jq/C29a!/C0 E0qcosh: (34)
Thus, from these boundary conditions, one obtains (for

outside the cylinder, while inside the cylinder the potential is

VI. CONDUCTING CORRUGATED CYLINDER
PLACED IN A UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD
We now generalize Sec. Vto the case of an inﬁnite grounded
conducting cylinder parameterized by qðhÞ¼aþhðhÞ,w h e r ejhðhÞjis a small corrugation, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The poten-
tial can be calculated from Eq. (31), under the condition that the
potential describes the ﬁeld E0¼E0^xfor large distances
[Eq.(34)].
Following the perturbative approach discussed in Sec. III,
we introduce an arbitrary auxiliary parameter e, with
0/C20e/C201, and replace hðhÞ! ehðhÞ, so that Eq. (33) is
replaced by
Uðq;hÞjq¼aþehðhÞ¼0; (36)
and the electrostatic potential is written as a perturbative
expansion in eas
Uq;hðÞ ¼Uð0Þq;hðÞ þX1

When e¼0, one has the non-corrugated cylinder ðq¼aÞ,
whereas, when e¼1, we recover the actual corrugated cyl-
inder ½q¼aþhðhÞ/C138. Substituting Eq. (37) in Eq. (31), one

We also have the following conditions:

UðnÞq;hðÞjq/C29a!0: (45)
These conditions come from the fact that sufﬁciently far
from the cylinder ( q/C29a) its inﬂuence is negigible, so that
one recovers the external ﬁeld E0. Since Uð0Þalready speci-
ﬁes that when q/C29athe potential is the one corresponding
to the external ﬁeld, UðnÞ[Eq. (45)] cannot contribute to the
potential in this limit.
The solution of Uð0Þis given in Eq. (35). Moreover, the
solution of Eq. (39) can be found by using the method of sep-
aration of variables

In this way, substituting Eqs. (35) and(51) in Eq. (37), with

In these terms, one can identify the ratio jhj=aas the pertur-
bative parameter so UðnÞ/ð jhj=aÞn. Thus, as the ratio jhj=a
decreases, the faster our perturbative solution converges. Inaddition, the ratio a=qcontrols the convergence of the series
inl, which means that as the ratio a=qdecreases, the faster
these series converge. Finally, it is important to remark thatthe solution found here is valid for any function hðhÞ.I n
Secs. VIIand VIII, we consider some applications of our
results with speciﬁc choices for hðhÞ.
VII. CYLINDER WITH A SLIGHT ENHANCEMENT
IN ITS RADIUS
We can check the consistency of our calculations by
choosing a constant corrugation proﬁle, hðhÞ¼d, which
should yield the solution for a cylinder of radius aþd. From
Eq.(51), we obtain, for this case, that

VIII. SINUSOIDAL CORRUGATED CYLINDER
As another application, let us consider a sinusoidal corru-
gated cylinder, whose proﬁle is

case of a cylinder with a slight enhancement in its radius.
In this case, we calculate an approximate solution for U
up to ﬁrst-order in h, which is given by
Uðq;hÞ/C25Uð0Þðq;hÞþUð1Þðq;hÞ; (59)
withUð0Þgiven in Eq. (35). To calculate Uð1Þ, we use Eq.

For/C23¼0, we recover Eq. (54), as expected. In Fig. 8,w e
plot the potential for the case of a non-corrugated cylinderand compare it with the case of a corrugated one. The magni-tude of the potential for a corrugated cylinder oscillates closeto that of a non-corrugated one. As q=aincreases, we can see
that the corrugation effects become less signiﬁcant.
Figure 9shows the electric ﬁeld lines in both the corru-
gated and non-corrugated cases. When d=a¼0:1, the

electric ﬁeld lines are practically perpendicular to the surface
indicating that, we already have an acceptable approximatesolution at ﬁrst order. In Sec. V of the supplementary mate-
rial,16we also show the behavior of the induced surface
charge density for this system.
IX. FINAL REMARKS
Using a perturbative approach, we introduced corrugated
surfaces into basic electrostatic problems. We started, inSec. II, by examining Poisson’s equation for a point charge
in the presence of an inﬁnite, perfectly conducting planarsurface, whose solution is usually obtained by the method of
images. We introduced corrugations into this model by peda-
gogically reviewing the calculations of Clinton, Esrick, andSacks.
8As an application of these calculations, we investi-
gated the case of a sinusoidal corrugated surface and showedhow corrugations affect the electric ﬁeld lines and the
induced surface charge density. In Sec. VI, we introduced
corrugation into a neutral inﬁnite grounded conducting cyl-inder placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld. We investigatedsinusoidal corrugations and how they affect the electric ﬁeldlines and (in the supplementary material
16) the induced sur-
face charge density. Introducing corrugations into such clas-
sic problems is a pedagogically straightforward way toexpose students to perturbative methods in their electromag-netism courses.
