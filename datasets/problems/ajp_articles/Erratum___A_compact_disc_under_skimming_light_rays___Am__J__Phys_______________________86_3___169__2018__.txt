In trying to explain the colored line on a CD or DVD
under the skimming light rays of a white lamp,1we made
errors that affect the equations but not the overall conclu-sions. The mistakes stem from Eq. (1) of Ref. 1. As seen in
Fig. 1, in which two parallel light rays coming from the
source Sreﬂect from point PandP
0on the CD (or DVD), the
total length of the path from StoOis
r¼2dþr0þma ðÞ cosa: (1)
In Ref. 1, we had divided by cos arather than multiplying,
but this error did not affect our calculations because our lateranalysis used the approximation a¼0. We had also mis-
labeled das the length of the segment HCrather than H
0C,
which also did not affect our analysis. Finally, we were missingthe factor of 2 in determining the total path length. Using thiscorrect expression, the light intensity observed at ObecomesI¼I

k/C20/C21
sin22pacosa
k/C18/C19 ; (2)
where Nis the (large) number of possible paths that recom-
bine at O.
This expression differs from the corresponding one given
in Eq. (8) of Ref. [ 1], because the arguments of the sine func-
tions include the factor of 2 and have the cos aterms in the
numerators rather than denominators. The maxima of thefunction Iin Eq. (2)occur at wavelengths k
M¼2acosa=M,
where Mis an integer. For a CD, setting a¼1600 nm and
taking a/C250, we obtain the following three wavelengths in
the visible spectrum:
k5¼2a=5¼640 nm ðredÞ
k6¼2a=5¼533 nm ðgreen Þ
k7¼2a=5¼457 nm ðblueÞ: (3)
The two odd-numbered wavelengths, k5andk7, were not
found in the previous analysis due to the missing factor of 2.However, even with this correction, we can still understandthe observed green color of the light, since the intensity ofthe light source and the sensitivity of the eye are both muchgreater for the central wavelength.
For a DVD, setting a¼740 nm and taking a/C250, we
obtain the following wavelengths:
k
2¼a¼740 nm ðnear IR Þ
k3¼2a=3¼493 nm ðblueÞ
k4¼a=2¼370 nm ðnear UV Þ: (4)
In Ref. 1, we were not able to give a good explanation for
the observed blue color of the light, since we predicted only
the even-numbered wavelengths in the infrared and UV.However, now we can explain this observation.
The later equations in Ref. 1require similar corrections to
the arguments of the sines. These corrections do not affectthe qualitative results that were presented. Preliminary
