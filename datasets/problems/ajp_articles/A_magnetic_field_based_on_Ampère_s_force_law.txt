Ampe `re’s force law for steady currents was not historically associated with a magnetic ﬁeld, but it
could have been. A magnetic ﬁeld, inspired by work of Helmholtz in 1870, can be deﬁned suchthat the double-differential form of Ampe `re’s force law is a function of a double-differential of this
ﬁeld. We call this ﬁeld the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld, B, and show that its divergence is zero
everywhere, as is that of the usual, but different, magnetic ﬁeld Bof Maxwellian electrodynamics.
The curl of the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld is nonzero everywhere in static examples, in contrast to that
of the usual magnetic ﬁeld B. We illustrate the ﬁeld Bfor three examples, which exhibit patterns of
ﬁeld lines quite different from those of the usual magnetic ﬁeld. As the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld is
based on Ampe `re’s force law for steady currents, it does not extrapolate well to the Lorentz force
on a moving charge in a magnetic ﬁeld. That is, the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld B, like Ampe `re’s force
law, is more of a curiosity than a viable alternative to the usual magnetic ﬁeld B. If the
Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld had been invented in the mid-1800s, it would have been a distraction more
than a step toward a generally valid electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.

After a historical introduction in Sec. I, we discuss the
Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld in Sec. II.
I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
A. Ampe `re
1. Ampe `re’s force law
In 1820–1822, Ampe `re examined the force between two
circuits, 1 and 2, carrying steady currents I1andI2. He did
not use vector notation, but his result on pp. 21–24 of Ref. 1
is equivalent to

where d2FAðx1;x1Þis the force on current element I1dl1at
x1due to current element I2dl2atx2, and r¼x1/C0x2.5We
use SI units in this paper; l0is the permeability of the
vacuum.6
The integrand d2FAðx1;x2Þof Eq. (1)has the appeal that
it changes sign if elements 1 and 2 are interchanged; hence,Ampe `re’s force law for current elements obeys Newton’s
third law.12
Ampe `re’s force law1was generally accepted as the proper
representation of (static) magnetic forces until around1890,13when “electron theory” emerged from studies of
electrical discharges in low-pressure gases, and Lorentz’sgeneralization, Sec. 17 of Ref. 17, of the Biot–Savart force
law replaced Ampe `re’s force law.
2. Ampe `re’s circuital law
In 1826, Ampe `re gave lectures that included discussion of
the force on a magnetic pole due to an electric current, notingthat the line integral of the tangential force around a closedloop is proportional to the electric current that passes through
the loop, independent of the shape of the loop.
18,19This was a
statement of what is now called “Ampe `re’s (circuital) law.”20
While Ampe `re did not consider the now-usual magnetic ﬁeld
B, we note that the force on a magnetic pole pisF¼pB,s o
his conclusion thatÞ
F/C1dl/I,w h e r e Iis the electric current
through the loop of integration, implies also thatÞB/C1dl/I.
Maxwell was the ﬁrst to state Ampe `re’s circuital law in
terms of a magnetic ﬁeld, via a verbal description on p. 56 ofRef. 23, where he deduced from Stokes’s theorem that
$/C2H¼J. Maxwell’s use of Hrather than Bwas in the
context of the relation B¼lHfor linear media, his Eq. (B),
p. 53, where our lis Maxwell’s k

B. Biot and Savart
In 1825 Ampe `re noted26that for closed circuits, Eqs. (1)
and(2)can be rewritten as

result, other than noting that d
2FB/C0Sðx1;x2Þdoes not obey
Newton’s third law, omitting that it was inspired by the mag-netic force law of his rivals Biot and Savart.
28As a conse-
quence, Eq. (4)is generally attributed to Grassmann,15as in
Ref. 34for example.
In retrospect, we see that Eq. (4)lends itself to the inter-
pretation that the force between closed circuits with steady
currents can be written in terms of a magnetic ﬁeld BB/C0Sas

withr¼x1/C0x2. Equations (5)and(6)are a factorization of
the Biot–Savart force law (4), and both equations are called
the Biot–Savart law, for example, in Sec. 7–6, p. 125 of Ref.
35. The earliest description of Eq. (5)as the Biot–Savart law
may be in Sec. 2 of Ref. 36. However, many authors call
only Eq. (6)the Biot–Savart law (while it is called Laplace’s
law in France); an early example is on p. 220 of Ref. 37.
Equation (5)is often called the Lorentz force law, although
it was ﬁrst stated by Maxwell, somewhat obscurely, as the
third term in Eqs. (12)–(14), p. 172 of Ref. 38, and more
clearly in Eq. (11), Art. 603 of Ref. 7.
The magnetic ﬁeld Bof Maxwellian electrodynamics is the
time-dependent generalization of the Biot–Savart form (6).
C. Faraday
Ampe `re had no concept of a magnetic ﬁeld, which origi-
nated with Faraday, inspired in part by patterns of iron ﬁlings
on a sheet near a magnet.39Of particular interest here is Fig.
3from Art. 3295 of Ref. 42, in which Faraday showed the
pattern of iron ﬁlings in a plane containing the axis of a small
dipole magnet, as shown in Fig. 1below.
This pattern corresponds to the lines of force of a magnetic
dipole mon a hypothetical magnetic pole p as deduced by
Poisson, Eq. (9), p. 507 of Ref. 43(1824),
F¼/C0p$m/C1^r
r2¼p3ðm/C1^rÞ^r/C0m
r3; (7)
where ris the vector from the center of the dipole mto
the pole p. This was regarded by Poisson as an action-at-a-
distance force, and he did not consider the possibility of a
magnetic force ﬁeld such as B¼F=pthat existed in vacuum
at points unoccupied by magnetic poles.
Our present view is that iron ﬁlings are not magnetic
poles, but magnetic dipoles, which align themselves along
the magnetic ﬁeld B.D. Lord Kelvin
The ﬁrst to adopt Faraday’s concept of a magnetic ﬁeld
was Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), who discussed the mag-netic ﬁeld of a magnetic dipole min Sec. II of Ref. 44(1846,
age 22). However, he did not follow the path of Poisson towrite B¼/C0$ðm/C1^r=r
2, but simply stated that
B¼$/C2A;where A¼m/C2r
r3; (8)
in his Eq. (II), where B¼ðX;Y;ZÞ, and in his Eq. (3) where
A¼ða;b;cÞ. This is the ﬁrst appearance of a vector poten-
tial in print.45Like Poisson, Thomson provided no ﬁgure but
gave a brief verbal description that suggests he was awareof the form (7)given by Poisson, which agrees with our
Eq.(8), assuming that F¼pB.
E. Neumann
Meanwhile, in 1845, Neumann followed the examples of
Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson in relating forces of gravity
and electrostatics to (scalar) potentials, and sought a poten-tial for Ampe `re’s force law (2)between two (closed, steady)
current loops.
For this, he noted that Ampe `re’s force law can be rewritten
as Eq. (10) below, which permits us to write F
on1¼/C0$U
where, Uis the scalar potential (energy),

This equation is given on p. 8 (also p. 67) of Ref. 27.
Neumann’s argument was that for an element at x1;
dl1¼dr, and dr¼dr/C1^r¼dl1/C1^r. Then, for any function
f(r),df¼ðdf=drÞdr¼ðdf=drÞdl1/C1^r. In particular, for
f¼/C01=r;df¼dl1/C1^r=r2, so the ﬁrst term of the ﬁrst form
of Eq. (4)is a perfect differential with respect to l1. Hence,
when integrating around a closed loop 1, the ﬁrst term doesnot contribute, and it is sufﬁcient to write

such that Neumann is often credited for inventing the vector
potential A, although he appears not to have written our Eq.

F. Weber
In 1846, Weber published a force law for moving charges,
p. 327 of Ref. 49, p. 149 of Ref. 50, which he extrapolated
from Ampe `re’s force law (1)and(2),

where charge q1is atx1, charge q2is atx2, and r¼x1/C0x2.
However, Weber considered that his force law, like
Ampe `re’s, involved instantaneous action at a distance, and
he did not make a connection between electromagnetism and
light, regarding 1 =c2¼/C150l0as related to electro- and mag-
netostatics. Also, like Ampe `re, Weber had no concept of a
magnetic ﬁeld.
G. Maxwell
Maxwell’s discussions of Ampe `re’s force law, Ampe `re’s
circuital law, and the Biot–Savart force law were mentioned
at the end of Secs. I A 1 (see also Ref. 13) Secs. IA2 , and
II Babove, respectively.
1. Vector potential
Maxwell may have been the next person after Thomson to
publish a discussion of a vector potential, when, in 1856, p.
63 of Ref. 23, he related the magnetic energy Umof electric
currents with density Jto a vector potential Asuch that
Um¼ðJ/C1A
2dVol : (14)
In Ref. 23, Maxwell considered that magnetic charges might
exist, with density qm, such that the magnetic ﬁeld Bobeyed
$/C1B¼l0qmand$/C2A6¼B. However, he did relate the
electric ﬁeld induced by time-dependent currents to the vec-
tor potential as Einduced ¼/C0 @A=@t, on p. 64 of Ref. 23.
2. Lorentz force
Maxwell wrote the “Lorentz” force law, F¼qðEþv/C2
BÞfor charge qwith velocity vin electromagnetic ﬁelds EandB, as Eq. (77), p. 342 of Ref. 51(1861), eq. (D), p. 485
of Ref. 52(1865), Eq. (B), Art. 598, and Eq. (1), Art. 599 of
Ref.7(1873). However, these were li ttleunderstood at the time.
H. Kirchhoff
Kirchhoff,53using Weber’s electrodynamics, deduced a
wave equation for the current and charge on current elements(conductors) of small resistance, ﬁnding the wavespeed to bec¼1=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ/C15
0l0p, where the constants /C150andl0can be deter-
mined from electro- and magnetostatic experiments54and
the value of cwas close to the speed of light as then known.
However, as Weber’s electrodynamics was based on action-
at-a distance, and was not a ﬁeld theory in the sense of
Faraday, Kirchhoff (like Weber) did not infer that light mustbe an electromagnetic phenomenon.
Kirchhoff’s analysis on p. 530 of Ref. 53involved a vector
potential,
A

with r¼x/C0x0, which he attributed to Weber, who later
transcribed Kirchhoff’s paper into Sec. I.1. of Ref. 56, with
AWappearing on p. 578.
I. Helmholtz
In 1870, Helmholtz made a review of electrodynamics,
and in Eq. (1), p. 76 of Ref. 57(see also Ref. 58), he stated
that a general form for the magnetic interaction energy (his
P, but our U) of two current elements, which are part of
closed circuits of steady currents, could be written as a com-bination of the forms he attributed to Neumann

where k¼1 for Neumann’s form and k¼– 1 for Weber’s

the form called ANhere, although this is the form Gauss
claimed (1867) to have deduced in 1835.45Both ANandAW
lead to the same magnetic ﬁeld, B¼$/C2AN¼$/C2AW,
which is an early example of gauge invariance.68
II. THE AMP /C18ERE–WEBER FIELD
We now consider the ﬁeld,

Amp /C19ere–Weber ﬁeld, although it is the invention of the pre-
sent authors.

in agreement with Ampe `re’s form, Eq. (2).
Thus, Ampe `re’s force law (2)can be related to ﬁeld Bif
we allow the force form, Eq. (20). to depend on the spatial
derivatives of Bas well as Bitself. Such a derivative cou-
pling is not favored in the simplest implementation of a ﬁeld
theory, but it cannot be excluded altogether.

although the total force on a closed circuit due to another

Ampe `re–Weber magnetic ﬁeld does not provide a good
understanding of the forces between moving charges.

As noted by Helmholtz, Theorem VI, p. 61 of Ref. 70

Lines of the B/m/C2^r=r3are circles centered on the axis
m, as sketched in Fig. 4, and do not at all resemble the pat-
tern of iron ﬁlings found by Faraday for a small dipole mag-net (Fig. 1). Hence, while the ﬁeld Bis mathematically
consistent with Ampe `re’s force law (2)between two circuits
with steady currents, it seems unappealing physically, andwould not have been accepted by Faraday.
2. Infinite solenoid
In this section, we consider an inﬁnite solenoid of radius a
along the z-axis, with steady, azimuthal surface current Iper
unit length in z, as sketched in Fig. 5.

falls off inversely with the distance from it.
This result contrasts with Faraday’s vision that the lines of
magnetic ﬁeld Bcircle about long, straight, current-carrying
wires (Art. 233 of Ref. 74; see also Sec. A.17.4 of Ref. 4).
F. Force on a magnetic pole
An important insight of Ampe `re was that all magnetism is
due to electric currents, rather than due to magnetic poles, as
had been assumed by all previous workers. In particular (asmentioned in Ref. 28), Biot and Savart studied the interac-
tion of a magnetic needle with an electric current, supposing
that a magnetic pole presided on the tip of the needle, such
that the force law they proposed can be written (in vector
form) as
F¼pB

For the case of steady current I^zin a long straight wire, the
Biot–Savart magnetic ﬁeld is BB/C0S¼l0I^z/C2^r=2prat the
magnetic pole pat (transverse) distance rfrom the wire.
If we consider that an alternative magnetic ﬁeld must also
describe the force on a magnetic pole according to
F¼pBalt, then it is clear that the form Bof Eq. (19) does
not satisfy this. In particular, for the case of a magnetic ﬁeld
(45) due to the current in a long, straight wire (as in the
experiment of Biot and Savart29)B¼l0I^z=8r, Eq. (45),i s
parallel to the wire, which would imply a force on the pole
parallel to the wire, rather than in the direction I/C2ras
observed experimentally.
III. SUMMARY
We have shown that it is possible to relate Ampe `re’s
differential-force law (2)to a vector ﬁeld, which we call the
Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld, B, Eq. (19), which is very different
from the usual magnetic ﬁeld Bof Maxwellian electrody-
namics. However, the Ampe `re–Weber ﬁeld has many con-
ceptual defects and does not lead to a full theory of
electrodynamics. Rather, it is mainly a mathematicalFig. 5. Geometry for an observer on the x-axis outside an inﬁnite solenoid of

curiosity. It is perhaps just as well that the Ampe `re–Weber
ﬁeld was not invented in the 1800s.

12Maxwell called Ampe `re the “Newton of electricity” in Art. 528 of Ref. 7.
13In Arts. 525–527 of his Treatise,7Maxwell showed that Ampe `re’s force law
(1) gave the same result for four different expressions for d2FA, all functions
ofIdl;I0dl0,a n d r,14concluding that Ampe `re’s form, Eq. (42) of Art. 526
and our Eq. (2), “is undoubtedly the best.” Maxwell’s Eq. (43) of Art. 526,
which he attributed to Grassmann,15corresponds to our Eq. (4). Apparently,
Maxwell did not realize that his vector-diffential equations for the magnetic
ﬁeld lead most directly to the Biot–Savart–Grassmann form.

39Faraday ﬁrst mentioned magnetic lines of force in Art. 114 of Ref. 40(1831):
By magnetic curves, I mean the lines of magnetic forces, however modiﬁed by
the juxtaposition of poles, which would be depicted by iron ﬁlings; or those to
which a very small magnetic needle would form a tangent. In 1845, Art. 2247
of Ref. 41, the term magnetic ﬁeld appears for the ﬁrst time in print: The ends
of these bars form the opposite poles of contrary name; the magnetic ﬁeld
between them can be made of greater or smaller extent, and the intensity of thelines of magnetic force be proportionately varied.In 1852, Faraday published a
set of speculative comments
42in the Philos. Mag. (rather than Philos. Trans. R.
Soc., A, the usual venue for his Experimental Researches ), arguing more
strongly for the physical reality of the lines of force.In Art. 3258 of Ref. 42,h e
considered the effect of a magnet in vacuum, concluding (perhaps for the ﬁrst
time) that the lines of force have existence independent of a material medium:
A magnet placed in the middle of the best vacuum we can
produce…acts as well upon a needle as if it were surrounded by
air, water or glass; and therefore these lines exist in such a
vacuum as well as where there is matter .

45In 1867, Gauss posthumously published an analysis that he dated to 1835
(p. 609 of Ref. 46) in which he stated that a time-dependent electric cur-
rent leads to an electric ﬁeld, which is the time derivative of what we now
call the vector potential. English translation from Ref. 47
The Law of Induction
Found out Jan. 23, 1835
at 7 a.m. before getting up.
The electricity producing power, which is caused in a point P by a cur-
rent-element c, at a distance from P, ¼r, is during the time dt the differ-
ence in the values of c=r corresponding to the moments t and dt, divided
by dt. where cis considered both with respect to size and direction. This
can be expressed brieﬂy and clearly by
/C0dðc=rÞ
dt: (54)
Gauss’s unpublished insight that electromagnetic induction is related to
the negative time derivative of a scalar quantity was probably communi-
cated in the late 1830s to his German colleagues, to whom Weber was theclosest.
On p. 612 of Ref. 46(presumably also from 1835), Gauss noted a relation
(here transcribed into vector notation) between the vector A¼Þ
dl=rand
the magnetic scalar potential Xof a circuit with unit electrical current
(which he related to the solid angle subtended by the circuit on p. 611),
/C0$X¼$/C2A. While we would identify /C0$Xwith the magnetic ﬁeld H,
Gauss called it the “electricity-generating force.” In any case, this is theearliest (claimed) appearance of the curl operator (although published later
than MacCullagh’s use of it, p. 22 of Ref. 48(1839).

66See also Sec. II B of Refs. 34and14. The energy that Helmholtz associ-
ated with Weber was never actually advocated by the latter, who had a dif-
ferent vision of magnetic energy, as reviewed in Sec. A. 23 of Ref. 4.
67Thus, we cannot write for an isolated current element that

68Helmholtz’ discussion was tacitly restricted to electro- and magnetostatics,
such that his eq. (3a), p. 80 of,57$/C1A¼kd V =dt, where Vis the instanta-
neous electric scalar potential, led him to identify k¼0 with Maxwell’s
theory,52which emphasized $/C1A¼0, although we would now consider
k¼1 to be compatible with Maxwell’s theory for static electromagnetism.
Maxwell was more interested in electrodynamics than electro/magneto-
statics, such that his only mention of the “Neumann” magnetostatic scalar
potential, our Eq. (9), was in his Eq. (9), Art. 422 of Ref. 7.
69A reviewer noted that B, Eq. (19), is a vector ﬁeld, while the usual form
forB, Eq. (6), is a pseudovector ﬁeld.
