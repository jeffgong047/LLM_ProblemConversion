Lorentz transformations between inertial observers, along with Einstein’s theory of special
relativity, remedied discrepancies between Newtonian physics and Maxwell’s electromagnetism
caused by the use of the same time in all inertial frames. In view of the fundamental importance ofthe relativity between inertial observers, there have been several papers deriving generalized
Lorentz transformations without using light. Proving that general transformations are linear in
space and time can be done in several ways, most commonly relying on a four-dimensionalMinkowski spacetime, but other approaches are possible. A method is presented here that
establishes the linearity of the transformation by considering velocity transformations in the light
of Einstein’s ﬁrst relativity postulate of 1905. Once linearity is obtained, the remainder is fairlystraightforward and parallels results and methods found in the literature.

I. INTRODUCTION
In pre-relativistic physics, inertial reference frames move
in a homogeneous, isotropic Euclidean space, allowing free
choice of origin and orientation. Time is the same for all
inertial observers. The associated coordinate transformationis the well-known Galilean transformation, given below.
This worked ﬁne for mechanics, but after electromagne-
tism became well established, it turned out that its basicequations were not invariant under Galilean transformationsbetween inertial observers, where Newton’s ﬁrst law holds.
Once this problem was realized, it became necessary to
establish a transformation in which electromagnetism wasinvariant at the cost of abandoning the concept of absolutetime. This led, after several reﬁnements, to what is nowcalled the Lorentz transformation within the context of
which it is natural to consider a four-dimensional spacetime.
A 1905 paper
1by Einstein established the special theory
of relativity, postulating that (i) the laws of physics areinvariant in all inertial frames of reference and (ii) the speedof light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers. Theconcepts of the aether and absolute time were swept away.
Galilean transformations were shown to be correct in the
limit of relative speeds that are small compared to the uni-versal limit. From the vast literature, we only refer to someof the standard books incorporating this matter,
2–4and,
below, to selected publications.
After the general acceptance of the special relativity the-
ory, there arose efforts to establish a generalized Lorentz
transformation not linked to the invariant speed of light butbased on the relativity between inertial observers in homoge-neous and isotropic three-dimensional Euclidean space withtime differing for each observer; see, for example, Refs. 5–9.
These efforts are important because, as pointed out by L /C19evy-
Leblond,
7among others, the emphasis on the relation to elec-
tromagnetism, in particular, to the invariant speed of light,tends to obscure the fact that all of physics should obey abasic tenet of the special theory of relativity regarding iner-
tial observers. The question is: How and where to start a der-
ivation of the generalized Lorentz transformation if theinvariant speed of light is not explicitly required? How dowe incorporate the transformation of time from one inertialobserver to the next? Of course, we all know the Lorentz
transformation, but how to get there?
A ﬁrst line of approach is to start from the properties of
homogeneity and isotropy in Euclidean space and in time,
from which it is often concluded that the transformations
between the reference frames of two inertial observers inuniform rectilinear translation are linear in the coordinates
and in the observer-dependent time. This is only true with
certain nuances:
4transformations should be afﬁne functions
and form upon composition an afﬁne group.10
With linearity, application of the ﬁrst relativity principle sufﬁ-
ces to derive the generalized Lorentz form.11–14The original
concept of a four-dimensional (Minkowski) spacetime15is based
on the special relativity postulates, inclusive of the constantspeed of light. Hence, it is not ap r i o r i obvious that it holds true
for a generalized Lorentz transformation not involving light.
Other authors prove the linearity of the generalized Lorentz
transformation based on alternative arguments, involving dis-tance and time intervals rather than coordinates,
5–7,16–18com-
position of velocities,19conservation of uniform rectilinear
motions,20,21or an interesting Gedankenexperiment to estab-
lish an upper limit velocity.8In a recent paper,9Mathews dis-
cussed and compared several of these methods and included an
extended, annotated bibliography. Some of these proofs thatthe generalized Lorentz transformation is linear require quite
lengthy and involved analyses.
The exposition that follows in Sec. IIis based on physical
and mathematical arguments, not using symmetry or similarproperties, but involves time through velocities, studiously
ignoring results of the four-dimensional spacetime method.
The proof proceeds by comparing the velocities of a pointparticle Pobserved in two inertial reference frames. This is
done for three special cases: Pis at rest in one frame, then in
the other, and ﬁnally moves in both under the ﬁrst law ofNewton. This method has the advantage that it generates sim-
ple analytical relations in one reference frame, in a way that
is—to my knowledge—novel. Their combination yields thelinearity of the generalized Lorentz transformation.
Once linearity is established, the remainder of the deriva-
tion of the generalized Lorentz transformation becomes fairly
straightforward and uses arguments found in the literature,involving, e.g., moving rods and/or clocks,

the composition of velocities among three inertial
observers.4,5,7–10 ,12–14 ,16,18,19,21
Section IIIbrieﬂy summarizes the conclusions.
II. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
A. Preliminary considerations
Before we get to the mathematical details, we need to dis-
cuss the reference frames of a pair of inertial observers. Inprinciple, one can freely choose origin and orientations of
the axes of right-handed frames because of the assumed
homogeneity and isotropy of three-dimensional space. Givena uniform translation velocity vof one observer relative to
the other, it is simplest to choose the xandx
0coordinate axes
parallel to v, such that x¼x0andt¼t0forv¼0. In a plane
perpendicular to v, we can take any right-handed pair of
mutually orthogonal axes for yandz, and y0andz0. We also
assume that y¼y0andz¼z0when v¼0, as illustrated in
Fig. 1 .
Furthermore, without loss of generality, we can take the
spatial origins to coincide when the times in the two frames
are both zero, i.e., x¼x0¼0 when t¼t0¼0. The unprimed
quantities are for one observer and the primed for the other.
In our exposition, as in many others, the perpendicular
directions yandzcan be omitted because they are irrelevant
to the relations between fx;x0;t;t0g. Explicit proofs for the
property that y¼y0andz¼z0remain also when v6¼0 are
available,5,19all stressing that the choice of the { y,z} and
fy0;z0gaxes is arbitrary and that parallel motions are not
affected by purely geometric shifts in the directions perpen-
dicular to that of v.
Turning ﬁrst to Newtonian mechanics, the change of coor-
dinates between two inertial reference frames is given by the
Galilean transformation
x0¼x/C0vt; (1)
and time is an absolute concept. The interpretation of this
equation is that a point particle Pis observed at the position
xat time tby an inertial observer O, and at x0at the same
time tby another inertial observer O0, and valong the xand
x0axes is the (constant) velocity of O0measured by O.
The Galilean transformation involves an absolute time but
obeys, nevertheless, a posteriori , the special relativity princi-
ple, stating that all inertial observers are equivalent as to theform of the laws of physics with the exception of Maxwell’s
theory of classical electromagnetism. In other words, the
inverse transformation from O
0toOis of the same func-
tional formx¼x0/C0v0t: (2)
This requires the interchange of x$x0and v$v0, but the
inverse transformation can also be obtained by simply solv-ing Eq. (1)forx, yielding
x¼x
0þvt: (3)
It also implies, within the context of the Galilean transforma-
tion, that v0¼/C0 v, telling us that when O0moves in the posi-
tivexandx0directions relative to Owith speed jvj;Omoves
in the negative xandx0directions relative to O0with speed
jv0j¼j vj.
The Galilean transformation indicates that Newtonian
physics obeys the special relativity theory, provided t¼t0.
However, this Newtonian concept of absolute time must be
abandoned in order to obtain the generalized Lorentz trans-
formation using relativity arguments.
Thus, to derive a generalized Lorentz transformation, we
start from a general form
x0¼Fðx;t;vÞ;t0¼Gðx;t;vÞ (4)
and require that its inverse is
x¼Fðx0;t0;v0Þ;t¼Gðx0;t0;v0Þ: (5)
It is important to remark here that the functional form of the
generalized Lorentz transformation (4), and its inverse Eq.
(5), must be the same,5because if that were not the case, a
kind of classiﬁcation could be established that invalidatesthe relativity and equivalence between inertial observers.
Mathematically speaking, functions linear in xand in t(or in
x
0and in t0) obviously would ﬁt this requirement5,9,20,21but
is it the only possibility, in this formalism?
The interpretation of Eq. (4)at this stage is that Osees P
atxat time t, andO0atx0att0. Also, valong xis the velocity
ofO0measured by O, and v0along x0that of Oseen by O0.
The derivations of the generalized Lorentz transformation
transcend electromagnetic theory and apply to all ofclassical physics within the limitations underlying those deri-
vations.4We will establish from ﬁrst principles, in a
novel way, that transformation (4)is linear in its arguments x
andt.
Once linearity is proved, the remainder of the derivation is
straightforward and leads to the generalized Lorentz trans-
formation with a constant maximal speed V. This includes,
in the mathematical limit V!1 , the Galilean transforma-
tion as a special example.
B. Linearity of the generalized Lorentz transformation
A ﬁrst step is to assume the reciprocity of the translation
velocities vand v0so that v0¼/C0 v, as in Galilean relativity.
Indeed, as O0moves away from O, with a certain constant
velocity, Ois seen by O0to recede in the opposite direction
with the same velocity in absolute value. This is used byEinstein1and von Ignatowski,5and often presented in the lit-
erature as following from the special relativity theory. A
more exhaustive discussion of the velocity reciprocity prop-
erty is given in a very recent paper by Moylan,22arguing
rightly that this property does not always hold true for all sit-
uations and for all kinematics. However, for the Galilean and
Lorentz transformations velocity reciprocity is true.22

Start by considering a point particle Pwith position xat
time tand velocity p, as observed by O, and position x0, time
t0, and velocity p0, as observed by O0. By differentiating Eq.
(4)and deﬁning p¼dx=dtandp0¼dx0=dt0, one obtains that
p0¼dx0
dt0¼@F
@xdxþ@F
@tdt
@G
@xdxþ@G
@tdt¼p@F
@xþ@F
@t
p@G
@xþ@G
@t: (6)
For notational simplicity, the arguments x,t, and vofFand
Ghave been suppressed. We will discuss Eq. (6)for three
special cases.
In inertial frames, a point particle can, in the absence of a
force, only be at rest or move on a uniform rectilinear trajec-tory according to the ﬁrst law of Newton. If there is no forcein one reference frame, there is no force in the other frame,
since there is no source for it.
Forp¼0,Pis at rest relative to O, so no force is working
on it and consequently in O
0p0is constant. Homogeneity of
space allows the origin of Oto be chosen arbitrary. So, one
could ﬁrst take it at P, which should not affect the velocity
ofOrelative to O0, hence p¼0 leads to p0¼v0¼/C0 v. Thus,
Eq.(6)yields
@F
@tþv@G
@t¼0: (7)
The converse case p0¼0 means that Pis at rest relative to
O0with p¼vand, thus,
v@F
@xþ@F
@t¼0: (8)
This implies that Fis a function of the combined argument
x/C0vtas well as of v. Comparing Eqs. (7)and(8)indicates
that
@G
@t¼@F
@x: (9)
While Eqs. (7)–(9) were derived using particular assump-
tions concerning pandp0, they must hold for all situations,
asFandGare functions of fx;x0;t;t0;vgand are independent
ofpandp0.
For the next step, let Pmove with constant velocity p
along the xaxis, seen by O, with the logical consequence
thatPmoves with constant velocity p0too, along the x0axis,
seen by O0. Substitution of Eqs. (8)and (9)into Eq. (6)
yields
p0¼p/C0v
pCðvÞþ1; (10)
after dividing out the common factor @F=@xand introducing
CðvÞ¼@G
@x/C30@F
@x: (11)
Indeed, because in Eq. (10),p,p0, and vare constant veloci-
ties, the ratio ð@G=@xÞ=ð@F=@xÞcannot depend on xandt,a t
most on v.
As an aside, Galilean relativity implies t0¼t, so from Eq.
(4)we see that @G=@xis zero, and thus, C(v)¼0. To obtainthe generalized Lorentz transformation, one will need to
assume that CðvÞ6¼0.
Taking the derivative of Eq. (7)with respect to xand of
Eq.(11) with respect to tyields
@2F
@t@xþv@2G
@t@x¼0;CðvÞ@2F
@t@x/C0@2G
@t@x¼0: (12)
This is a set of two homogeneous linear equations in the
mixed derivatives of FandGwith a nonzero determinant of
the coefﬁcients, [1 þvCðvÞ]. This set can only have the triv-
ial solution
@2F
@t@x¼0;@2G
@t@x¼0: (13)
When the mixed derivative of a function of two variables
vanishes, the function is additively separable. This proves
thatFandGare additively separable in xandtand, thus, can
be written in the form
Fðx;t;vÞ¼Faðx;vÞþFbðt;vÞ;
Gðx;t;vÞ¼Gaðx;vÞþGbðt;vÞ: (14)
In Eq. (8), this yields that
vdFa
dxþdFb
dt¼0: (15)
This can only hold if the derivatives dFa=dxand dFb=dt,
depending on either xort, are constant, indicating that Fa
and Fbare linear in their respective arguments xand t.
Hence, Fis a linear function of xandtthrough the combina-
tionx/C0vt, and we obtain that
x0¼Fðx;t;vÞ¼AðvÞðx/C0vtÞ; (16)
having invoked the requirement that x¼t¼0 yields x0¼0.
Forv¼0, the two frames coincide, requiring that Að0Þ¼1.
Similarly, using Eqs. (9)and(11), the structure of Gis
t0¼Gðx;t;vÞ¼AðvÞCðvÞxþt ½/C138 : (17)
When both frames coincide for v¼0,t0¼t, and thus,
Cð0Þ¼0. Introducing B(v) through CðvÞ¼ vBðvÞ, Eq. (17)
becomes
t0¼Gðx;t;vÞ¼AðvÞvBðvÞxþt ½/C138 : (18)
ForBðvÞ6¼0, Eq. (18) indicates that xandtare intrinsically
linked.
C. Further to the generalized Lorentz transformation
Now we start by inverting Eqs. (16) and(18), which can
be done in two different ways. One is by interchanging the
primed and unprimed variables and, invoking the velocityreciprocity, replacing vby – v, so that
x¼Að/C0vÞðx
0þvt0Þ;t¼Að/C0vÞ/C0vBð/C0vÞx0þt0/C2/C3
(19)
results. The other method is simply solving Eqs. (16) and
(18) forxandt, yielding
427 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 6, June 2022 Frank Verheest 427 04 October 2023 23:10:31
x¼x0þvt0
AðvÞ1þBðvÞv2/C2/C3 ;t¼/C0vBðvÞx0þt0
AðvÞ1þBðvÞv2/C2/C3 : (20)
Equating in Eqs. (19) and(20), the coefﬁcients of x0lead to
Að/C0vÞ¼1
AðvÞ1þBðvÞv2/C2/C3 ;
Að/C0vÞBð/C0vÞ¼BðvÞ
AðvÞ1þBðvÞv2/C2/C3 : (21)
Satisfying both these equations requires
Bð/C0vÞ¼BðvÞ; (22)
andB(v) is an even function of v. Equating the coefﬁcients
oft0does not give additional results.
To prove that A(v), too, is even in v, we consider the
“classic” problem of moving rods. Use Eq. (16) for a rod
with length Dx0at rest relative to O0, which moves relative to
O, so that this observer has to make a snapshot of the end-
points at the same time, Dt¼0. This gives
ðDx0Þat rest in O0¼AðvÞðDxÞmoving in O: (23)
Considering instead a rod at rest relative to Oyields
ðDxÞat rest in O¼Að/C0vÞðDx0Þmoving in O0: (24)
If the rods are identical for observers seeing them at rest in
their respective frames, the special relativity principlerequires that in the frames where they are observed to bemoving, the observed lengths must be equal,
5yielding
Að/C0vÞ¼AðvÞ: (25)
Note that this has been proved after linearity was estab-
lished, not the other way around, where length changes havebeen used to prove that the generalized Lorentz transforma-tion is linear in space and in time.
5,6,12,18,21This discussion
points to the Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction, the shorteningof an object along the direction of its motion relative to anobserver. Dimensions in other directions are not contracted.
One can give a similar computation for ticking clocks and
the dilatation of time intervals between moving observers,leading again to Eq. (25).
From Eqs. (21),(22), and (25), there follows also that
A
2ðvÞ¼1
1þBðvÞv2; (26)
and the form of B(v) determines the expression for A(v). We
note that A(v) is dimensionless, and B(v) has the dimensions
of an inverse squared velocity.
To complete the description, three observers are consid-
ered, two by two. Use { x,t} for O;fx0;t0gforO0and
fx00;t00gforO00. Furthermore, take vas the velocity of O0
seen by O,was the velocity of O00seen by O0anduas the
velocity of O00seen by O. Thus, the transformations from O
toO0give Eqs. (16) and(18), from O0toO00,
x00¼AðwÞðx0/C0wt0Þ;t00¼AðwÞwBðwÞx0þt0/C2/C3
;(27)
and ﬁnally, from OtoO00,x00¼AðuÞðx/C0utÞ;t00¼AðuÞuBðuÞxþt ½/C138 : (28)
Substitution of Eqs. (16) and(18) into Eq. (27) yields
x00¼AðvÞAðwÞ1/C0BðvÞvw ½/C138 x/C0ðvþwÞt/C8/C9
;
t00¼AðvÞAðwÞBðvÞvþBðwÞw ½/C138 xþ1/C0BðwÞvw ½/C138 t/C8/C9
:
(29)
Gathering information from Eqs. (28) and(29), the coefﬁ-
cients of xinx00and of tint00indicate that
AðuÞ¼AðvÞAðwÞ1/C0BðvÞvw ½/C138
¼AðvÞAðwÞ1/C0BðwÞvw ½/C138 : (30)
Similarly, the coefﬁcients of tinx00yield
AðuÞu¼AðvÞAðwÞðvþwÞ: (31)
The result (30) proves that BðvÞ¼BðwÞ, for arbitrary vand
w, and thus, Bis a true constant, independent of v. Dividing
Eq.(31) by Eq. (30) gives
u¼vþw
1/C0Bvw: (32)
The above reasoning is based on the group property of the
generalized Lorentz transformations, but because of the line-
arity of these transformations, it is a mere question of
calculation.
It is clear that positive and ﬁnite velocities vandwimply
thatuhas to be positive and ﬁnite, too. If Bwere positive,
that could not always be the case, so that Bhas to be either
zero or negative.
ForB¼0, we obtain from Eq. (26) that AðvÞ2¼1, and
hence, A¼1, as Að0Þ¼1 was chosen from the outset. All
this yields the Galilean transformation (1)with the standard
addition of different translation velocities as
u¼vþw: (33)
On the other hand, when Bis negative, introduce a con-
stant velocity Vsuch that B¼/C01=V2, given the dimensions
ofB. Now Eq. (26) yields
AðvÞ¼1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1/C0v2
V2r : (34)
Before going to possible interpretations of V, note from Eq.
(32) that
u¼vþw
1þvw
V2: (35)
Consequently, the “addition” of v¼Vto another velocity
0<w/C20Vstill would yield u¼V, nothing larger than V.I n
other words, Vis a maximal speed. We thus obtain the gener-
alized Lorentz transformation
x0¼x/C0vtﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

The Galilean transformation (1), for B¼0, can formally be
obtained from Eq. (36) in the limit V!þ 1 .
It has been proved9,12thatVcan be measured and shown
to be c, the speed of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum,
without any use of electromagnetic radiation in the measure-
ment process. With V¼c, Eq. (36) becomes the Lorentz
transformation.
III. CONCLUSIONS
In view of the fundamental importance of the relativity
between inertial observers, there have been several papersderiving generalized Lorentz transformations without using the
light to show that abandoning the idea of absolute space and
absolute time is relevant to classical mechanics, too. All deri-
vations eventually lead to the concept of a four-dimensional
spacetime, as formally worked out by Minkowski.15
Despite an abundance of ways to prove that the general-
ized Lorentz transformation is linear in xand t, I am not
aware that the proof established here has been presented
before. As others, it starts from the relativity part of
Einstein’s postulates of 1905 but involves velocities and
their relative changes in three simple cases. Once linearity is
obtained, the remainder is fairly straightforward and parallels
results and methods found in the literature.
