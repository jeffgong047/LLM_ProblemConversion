A very simple and straightforward approach to solutions of the one-dimensional wave equation in a
ﬁnite space domain with inhomogeneous boundary conditions is presented. Based on the physicalpicture of traveling waves and wave reﬂection, the solution of the problem can be written down
without much effort if the equation and the initial conditions are both homogeneous. This approach
is applicable to Dirichlet boundary conditions, Neumann ones and mixed ones (one end withDirichlet boundary condition and the other with Neumann). The solutions are given by ﬁnite sums
rather than inﬁnite series. When the boundary conditions are given by elementary functions such as
trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc., the ﬁnite sums can be worked out explicitlyand the solution turns out to be unexpectedly simple.

I. INTRODUCTION
Solving the wave equation or the diffusion equation (in
one or more dimensions) with appropriate boundary and ini-
tial conditions is one of the basic problems in mathematicalphysics.
1–15If the space domain has a regular geometric
shape (a sphere, say), and the boundary conditions are homo-
geneous, it can be solved by the method of separation of var-
iables (if the equation is homogeneous) or by eigenfunction
expansion (if the equation is inhomogeneous). If the bound-
ary conditions are inhomogeneous, there exist essentially
two different approaches to the solution. The ﬁrst approach,
which is commonly presented in textbooks, makes a decom-
position of the dependent variable uðr;tÞ:uðr;tÞ¼u0ðr;tÞ
þvðr;tÞ, where u0ðr;tÞis some function satisfying the inho-
mogeneous boundary conditions, and then the new unknown
function vðr;tÞsatisﬁes homogeneous boundary conditions
and can be solved by the above-mentioned methods. In one
dimension, the construction of u0ðx;tÞis easy, while in
higher dimensions, it may be necessary to solve another
problem to ﬁnd u0ðr;tÞ.12The second approach is the method
of Green’s functions, which incorporates the inhomogeneous
boundary conditions into a solution that involves several
integrals. The Green’s function method for the Poisson or
Laplace equations is straightforward and discussed in
most textbooks of mathematical physics. The wave or diffu-
sion equation is somewhat more complicated, and the
Green’s function method is only dealt with in some
textbooks.7–11 ,13,14
In this paper, we revisit the one-dimensional wave equa-
tion in a ﬁnite space domain, which describes the transversal
vibration of a stretched string or the longitudinal vibration of
a ﬂexible rod. In this case, there exists yet another approach
for dealing with inhomogeneous boundary conditions. This
approach is very simple and easy, and the physical picture is
very clear, but to the best of our knowledge, it appeared
unnoticed before. Consider the most general problem with
an inhomogeneous equation, with inhomogeneous boundary
and initial conditions. By superposition, this can be decom-
posed into two problems, of which one has homogeneous
boundary conditions, and the other has inhomogeneous
boundary conditions but has both homogeneous equation andinitial conditions. Since the ﬁrst problem can be solved by
eigenfunction expansion, we concentrate our attention on the
second one. Based on the most general solutions of the wave
equation and the physical picture of traveling waves and
wave reﬂection, we can write down the solution to the sec-
ond problem without much effort. The solution is given by a
ﬁnite sum rather than an inﬁnite series. When the boundaryconditions are given by elementary functions such as trigo-
nometric functions, exponential functions, etc., the ﬁnite
sum can be worked out explicitly and the solution turns out
to be unexpectedly simple.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we solve the
above-mentioned problem for Dirichlet boundary conditions.
In Sec. III, we present the solution for Neumann boundary
conditions. Solutions with mixed boundary conditions (oneend with Dirichlet boundary condition and the other
Neumann) are given in Sec. IV. Solutions for speciﬁc exam-
ples are calculated in each case and compared with the con-
ventional solutions. Section Vis devoted to a brief summary.
II. DIRICHLET BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Consider the following problem of a one-dimensional
wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions at both
ends:

Here, cis the wave velocity (not necessarily the speed of
light). It is assumed that the ﬁrst derivatives l0ðtÞand/C230ðtÞ
are continuous for t/C210. Note that consistency between the
boundary conditions and initial conditions requires
lð0Þ¼l0ð0Þ¼0;/C23ð0Þ¼/C230ð0Þ¼0; (2)
though they are sometimes not satisﬁed in practical exam-
ples. A possible example of lðtÞis shown in Fig. 1. For

convenience, we extend the deﬁnition of lðtÞand/C23ðtÞto
/C01 <t<1, such that lðtÞ¼/C23ðtÞ¼0 for t<0 [then
lðtÞ¼/C23ðtÞ¼0 for t/C200 because of Eq. (2)].
We ﬁrst consider the case where lðtÞ6¼0 and /C23ðtÞ¼0.
For 0 <t/C20l=c, the solution can be written down immedi-
ately based on the most general solution of the wave equa-
tion and the physical picture of traveling waves,
uðx;tÞ¼lt/C0x
c/C18/C19
;0<t/C20l
c: (3)
It is easy to show that this satisﬁes the equation, the bound-
ary conditions, and the initial conditions. Note thatthe solution may be zero for xnear lsuch that t/C20x=c.
For the speciﬁc case where lðtÞtakes the form shown in
Fig.1, the above solution at t¼0:8l=cis illustrated in Fig. 2.
At ﬁrst sight, it seems that l
00ðtÞshould be continuous in
order to satisfy the wave equation. However, this is not nec-essary because the more fundamental form of the wave equa-
tion is actually15

@tdn¼c2@uðn;tÞ
@n/C12/C12/C12/C12n¼x
n¼x0; (4)
where 0 <x0<x<l. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient to require
thatl0ðtÞis continuous.
When l=c<t/C202l=c, however, the vibration at ( x,t)
should include two terms. In addition to the above term thatcomes from the boundary vibration at an earlier time
t/C0x=c, the boundary vibration at an yet earlier time
t/C0ð2l/C0xÞ=calso propagates to ( x,t), after a reﬂection at
the right end x¼l. Because of the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition there, the reﬂected wave gains a minus
sign. Thus, the solution is
uðx;tÞ¼lt/C0x
c/C18/C19
/C0lt/C02l/C0x
c/C18/C19
;l
c<t/C202l
c:(5)
Note that the second term may be zero for xnear 0 such that
t/C20ð2l/C0xÞ=c. For the speciﬁc case where lðtÞtakes the
form as shown in Fig. 1, the above solution at t¼1:8l=cis
illustrated in Fig. 3.
Similarly, if 2 l=c<t/C203l=c, we have a third term, which
arises from the boundary vibration at a still earlier timet/C0ð2lþxÞ=cand arrives at ( x,t) after two reﬂections at
both ends; therefore, the solution is
uðx;tÞ¼lt/C0x

c/C18/C19
þlt/C02lþx
c/C18/C19
;2l
c<t/C203l
c: (6)The last term may be zero for xnear lsuch that
t/C20ð2lþxÞ=c. By induction, we ﬁnally arrive at the follow-
ing solution for all t, where n2N:

In Eq. (7a), the k¼nterm in the ﬁrst sum may be zero for x
near lsuch that t/C20ð2nlþxÞ=c. In Eq. (7b), the k¼nþ1
term in the second sum may be zero for xnear 0 such that
t/C20½ ð2nþ2Þl/C0x/C138=c. The upper limit in the above summa-
tions can be formally extended to þ1 because the terms
with larger kvanish trivially. It is easy to verify that the
above solution, indeed, satisﬁes the wave equation, theboundary conditions, and the initial conditions. Moreover,on the account of Eq. (2), it can be shown that u,@u=@t, and
@u=@xare all continuous at t¼2nl=cand t¼ð2nþ1Þl=c,

dashed line (blue) in the ﬁgure represents the ﬁrst term in Eq. (5), the thin
solid line (orange) represents the second term, and the thick solid line (red)
is their sum and gives u(x,t).

in spite of the piecewise form. Compared with the conven-
tional solution, the advantage of the present solution is that
only ﬁnite sums, rather than inﬁnite series, are involved,
while the shortcoming is that it is in piecewise form instead
of a single expression valid for all t. However, if lðtÞis
some elementary function, say, a simple harmonic oscillation
lðtÞ¼Asinxt(for t/C210), the above ﬁnite summation can
be worked out and the solution turns out to be unexpectedly
simple. In such cases, the advantage becomes obvious.
There is yet another reasoning that leads to the above solu-
tion. It is easy to verify that uðx;tÞ¼lðt/C0x=cÞ(for all
t/C210) satisﬁes the equation, the initial conditions, and the
boundary condition at x¼0, but the boundary condition at
x¼lis not satisﬁed except for t/C20l=c. To satisfy the latter
condition, we add a similar term (that also satisﬁes the equa-
tion and the initial conditions) such that the resulting func-
tion is an odd function of x0¼x/C0l. Then, the solution is
modiﬁed as
uðx;tÞ¼lt/C0x
c/C18/C19
/C0ltþx
c/C02l
c/C18/C19
:
However, the second term does not generally satisfy the
boundary condition at x¼0, so we should add a third term
such that the sum of the second and third terms is an odd
function of x. Therefore, the solution is further modiﬁed as
uðx;tÞ¼lt/C0x
c/C18/C19
/C0ltþx
c/C02l
c/C18/C19
þlt/C0x
c/C02l
c/C18/C19
:
However, the third term does not generally satisfy the bound-
ary condition at x¼l; hence, the solution should be further
modiﬁed and so on. Finally, the solution is given by an inﬁ-
nite series. Because for any ﬁnite t, only several terms are
nontrivial, the result is actually the same as Eq. (7). This is
somewhat similar to the image method in electrostatics16for
the domain between two large parallel conductor plates but
is simpler because the ﬁrst term lðt/C0x=cÞsatisﬁes the
boundary condition at the left end, so that it does not require
an image term with respect to x¼0.
Next, we consider the case where lðtÞ¼0 and /C23ðtÞ6¼0.
The problem can be solved in a similar way or by simply
replacing xbyl/C0xandlðtÞby/C23ðtÞin the above solution.
The result is

Remarks similar to those below Eq. (7)are also applicable
here.The complete solution of the original problem in Eq. (1)is
given by the sum of Eqs. (7)and(8).
Let us solve a speciﬁc example, where
ltðÞ¼0;/C23 tðÞ¼Asinxt;t/C210;
0; t<0;/C26
(9)
where Aandxare given constants and xis not an integral
multiple of pc=l. This example is discussed in many text-
books. In the conventional approach, one makes a decompo-
sition uðx;tÞ¼u0ðx;tÞþvðx;tÞ, where u0ðx;tÞis some
function satisfying the above inhomogeneous boundaryconditions, so that the new unknown function v(x,t) has
homogeneous boundary conditions. The most convenient
choice of u
0ðx;tÞisu0ðx;tÞ¼Asinðxx=cÞsinxt=sinðxl=cÞ
because this also satisﬁes the wave equation, so that the
equation for v(x,t) is still homogeneous. The ﬁnal solution is

Using the approach presented in this manuscript, the solu-
tion is obtained by substituting /C23ðtÞ¼hðtÞAsinxtinto Eq.
(8), where hðtÞis the Heaviside step function. The ﬁnite sum-
mations can be easily worked out, and the result turns out to
be unexpectedly simple,

(11b)
In obtaining Eq. (11b) , we have used the relation hðtÞ¼1
/C0hð/C0tÞin the k¼nterm in the second sum of Eq. (8b),
which makes the result simpler. It should be remarked that
the ﬁrst term in Eq. (11a) does not represent a harmonic
oscillation because ndepends on the value of t, and neither
does the second term that involves the Heaviside step func-
tion. This remark also applies to Eq. (11b) .
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (11a) can be decomposed into two
terms by using 2 sin ðnxl=cÞcosxðt/C0nl=cÞ¼sinxt
/C0sinxðt/C02nl=cÞ. Then, it is obvious that the resulting ﬁrst
term equals the ﬁrst term in Eq. (10) [namely u0ðx;tÞchosen
above], which is a harmonic oscillation. The situation for Eq.
(11b) is similar. The remaining terms can be shown to be
periodic in twith period 2 l=c. It is not difﬁcult to verify that
the inﬁnite series in Eq. (10) is the eigenfunction expansion
of these remaining terms, for either Eqs. (11a) or(11b) .

Thus, the present solution is equivalent to the conventional
one, as it should be. However, it is in ﬁnite closed form and
appears much simpler.
III. NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Consider the following problem with Neumann boundary
conditions at both ends:
@2u
@t2/C0c2@2u
@x2¼0;ð0<x<l;t>0Þ; (12a)
@u
@x/C12/C12/C12/C12

ujt¼0¼0;@u
@t/C12/C12/C12/C12
t¼0¼0;ð0/C20x/C20lÞ: (12c)
We require lð0Þ¼/C23ð0Þ¼0, so that the boundary conditions
are consistent with the initial conditions. It is convenient to
deﬁne
/C22lðtÞ¼/C0 hðtÞcðt
0lðsÞds;/C22/C23ðtÞ¼hðtÞcðt
0/C23ðsÞds: (13)
We ﬁrst consider the case where lðtÞ6¼0 and /C23ðtÞ¼0.
For 0 <t/C20l=c, the solution is obviously uðx;tÞ¼ /C22lðt/C0x=cÞ,
which satisﬁes the wave equation and all conditions. The solu-tion for subsequent time intervals can be obtained by consider-
ations similar to those in Sec. II, except that in the present case,
there is no sign change for the reﬂected wave. The approacht a k e ni nS e c . II, which is similar to the image method, also
works here except that the requirement of odd functions there,
are replaced by even ones here. The solution turns out to be

Next, we consider the case where lðtÞ¼0 and /C23ðtÞ6¼0.
This can be solved in a similar way or by simply replacing x
byl/C0xand /C22lðtÞby/C22/C23ðtÞin the above solution. The result is

The complete solution of the problem in Eq. (12) is given
by the sum of Eqs. (14)and(15).One can easily work out an example where lðtÞand/C23ðtÞ
are similar to those in Eq. (9). However, we prefer to deal
with an example where
lðtÞ¼0;/C23ðtÞ¼a
cAe/C0at; (16)
where Aanda>0 are given constants. The factor a=cis
included for later convenience. For a ﬂexible rod, this means
that the left end is free while the right end is acted upon byan exponentially decaying force. By the conventional
method, the solution is found to be
uðx;tÞ¼Ae

We now solve the example by the presented approach.
First, the auxiliary function /C22/C23ðtÞdeﬁned in Eq. (13) is found
to be /C22/C23ðtÞ¼hðtÞAð1/C0e/C0atÞ. The solution is then obtained
by substituting this into Eq. (15). The ﬁnite summations can
be easily worked out and the result turns out to be

c<t/C20ð2nþ2Þl
c: (18b)
It can be veriﬁed that these results are equivalent to the con-
ventional solution in Eq. (17). However, they appear much
simpler.
Let us make some remarks on the linearly increasing term
Act=lin Eq. (17). We denote the center-of-mass displace-
ment of the rod by U(t). The force acted on the right end is
the only external force on the rod, given by FðtÞ¼YS/C23ðtÞ,
where Sis the area of the cross section and Yis the Young
modulus. The total mass of the rod is M¼qSl, where qis
the mass density. On the account of Eq. (16) andc¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Y=qp
,
the equation of motion M€UðtÞ¼FðtÞreduces to
€UðtÞ¼ð Aca=lÞe/C0at. Because of Eq. (12c) , the initial velocity
is obviously _Uð0Þ¼0, and then integration of the above
equation gives the velocity _UðtÞ¼ð Ac=lÞð1/C0e/C0atÞ. This
has the same sign for all t(always positive, say, if A>0) and
_UðtÞ/C24Ac=lfor large t. Since the force is exponentially
decaying, the rod will reach a ﬁnal constant velocity,
which is Ac/l. It is then obvious that U(t) would contain a
term Act/l. In fact, integrating once more using the initial dis-
placement Uð0Þ¼0 [also a consequence of Eq. (12c) ], we
have UðtÞ¼ð Ac=alÞð/C01þatþe/C0atÞ. Taking the average of
uðx;tÞover xleads to the same result, as expected.

IV. MIXED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
In this section, we consider the following problem with
mixed boundary conditions:
@2u
@t2/C0c2@2u
@x2¼0;ð0<x<l;t>0Þ; (19a)
ujx¼0¼lðtÞ;@u

ujt¼0¼0;@u
@t/C12/C12/C12/C12
t¼0¼0;0/C20x/C20l ðÞ : (19c)
We require lð0Þ¼l0ð0Þ¼0 and /C23ð0Þ¼0, so that the
boundary conditions are consistent with the initial condi-tions. If, instead, we have the Neumann boundary conditionon the left end and the Dirichlet boundary condition on theright end, the problem can be transformed into the aboveform by the transformation x
0¼l/C0xand need not be con-
sidered separately.
We ﬁrst deal with the case where lðtÞ6¼0 and /C23ðtÞ¼0.
In the following, we extend the deﬁnition of lðtÞas in
Sec. II, such that it stands for lðtÞhðtÞ. For 0 <t/C20l=c, the
solution is obviously uðx;tÞ¼lðt/C0x=cÞ, which satisﬁes the
wave equation and all conditions. The solution for sub-sequent time intervals can be obtained by considerationssimilar to those in Sec. II, except that in the present case,
there is a sign change after reﬂection at x¼0 but none at
x¼l. The reasoning of Sec. IIthat is similar to the image
method can also be appropriately modiﬁed and applied here.The solution turns out to be

Next, we consider the case where lðtÞ¼0 and /C23ðtÞ6¼0.
This can be solved in a similar way. We deﬁne /C22/C23ðtÞby the
expression in Eq. (13). The solution is found to be

c: (21b)The complete solution of the problem in Eq. (19) is given
by the sum of Eqs. (20)and(21).
One can easily work out an example where lðtÞand/C23ðtÞ
are similar to those in Eq. (9)or Eq. (16). However, we
would like to deal with an example where they have different
forms,
lðtÞ¼0;/C23ðtÞ¼b; (22)
where bis a given constant. For a ﬂexible rod, this means
that the left end is ﬁxed while the right end is acted upon by
a constant force F¼YSb, where Yand Shave been
described before. By the conventional method, the solution
is found to be
uðx;tÞ¼bxþ2bl

n¼1ð/C01Þn
ðn/C01=2Þ2cosð2n/C01Þpct

/C2sinð2n/C01Þpx
2l: (23)
In the following, we solve this example with the presented
approach. First, the auxiliary function is found to be
/C22/C23ðtÞ¼hðtÞbct. The solution is then obtained by substituting
this into Eq. (21). The ﬁnite summations can be easily
worked out, and the result turns out to be
ux;tðÞ ¼bx½1/C0/C0 1Þn/C0/C3
þð /C0 1Þnbxþct½

ð2nþ1Þl

It can be veriﬁed that the above solution is a periodic func-
tion of twith period 4 l=c. In fact, it can be shown that these
results are equivalent to Eq. (23), where the periodicity is
more obvious. However, these are in ﬁnite closed form and
seem much simpler.
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
In summary, we have revisited the one-dimensional wave
equation in a ﬁnite space domain and presented an approach
to the solution when there are inhomogeneous boundary con-
ditions. This approach is based on the physical picture of
traveling waves and wave reﬂection. The solution can be
written down without much effort when the equation and ini-
tial conditions are both homogeneous, so it is mathematicallysimple and easy, and physically clear. The solution is given
by ﬁnite sums instead of inﬁnite series. When the boundary
conditions are given by elementary functions such as trigo-
nometric functions, exponential functions, etc., the ﬁnite
sum can be easily worked out, and the solution turns out to
be unexpectedly simple.
Though the current approach can be modiﬁed to deal with
cases where Robin boundary conditions (a linear combina-
tion of the unknown function and its normal derivative is
given at the boundary) are involved, the result will be rather
complicated. In such cases, the conventional approach is

preferred. Another shortcoming of the present approach is
that it is not applicable to diffusion equations or wave equa-tions in higher space dimensions.
