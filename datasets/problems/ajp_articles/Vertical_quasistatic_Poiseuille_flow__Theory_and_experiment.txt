As a viscous ﬂuid drains from the bottom of a wide-mouthed reservoir through a narrow vertical
tube, the symmetric ﬂow within the tube, known as Poiseuille ﬂow, is quickly established. Since
the pressure provided by the ﬂuid in the reservoir changes slowly in time, the ﬂow is quasistatically
time dependent. Our theoretical model of this process relates the time dependence of the height ofthe ﬂuid in the reservoir to the dimensions of the tube and the kinetic viscosity of the ﬂuid. We
construct an apparatus from inexpensive and easily procured materials (plastic containers, steel
straws, glue, adhesive putty, and a supply of pure glycerin) in order to test our model and ﬁnd goodagreement between the theory and the experiment.

I. INTRODUCTION
Viscosity quantiﬁes the tendency of water and other ﬂuids
to minimize transverse velocity gradients in their ﬂow.Water, olive oil, honey, and molasses are viscous in increas-ing degree, and their increasing viscosity increases their ten-dency to ﬂow in bulk rather than chaotically or in multiple
streams. We can see the effects of viscosity in our dailylives, usually without noticing them.
The concept of viscosity was developed over the ﬁrst half
of the 19th century
1and culminated in George G. Stokes’s
formalization of the Navier–Stokes equation in 1845.2
Stokes even derived the radially parabolic velocity proﬁleinside a cylindrical tube, as shaped by viscosity, that is nowcalled Poiseuille ﬂow —but without a no-slip condition at the
tube wall. Stokes was unaware of the empirical investiga-tions of pipe ﬂow made only a few years earlier by JeanLeonard Marie Poiseuille (1797–1860).
Poiseuille performed a series of experiments in the late
1830s and early 1840s, in which water was pushed throughsmall-diameter, horizontally oriented, glass tubes. In thisway, Poiseuille discovered the effect of viscosity on pipe
ﬂow, even if he did not fully quantify this effect.
3At about
the same time, the German hydraulic engineer GotthilfHeinrich Ludwig Hagen (1797–1894) performed similar, ifless extensive, experiments. In this paper, we describe thephysics that underlies Poiseuille ﬂow and the version ofPoiseuille and Hagen’s experiments we created with easilyprocured materials.
Today we understand the physics of pipe ﬂow better than
did Poiseuille and Hagen. However, most importantly, wehave access to the ﬂuid glycerin whose viscosity, some300–3000 times greater than that of water (depending ontemperature), allows us to avoid using the extremely small-
diameter glass or brass tubes employed in mid-19th century.
Glycerin is an odorless, tasteless, transparent, nontoxic, andinexpensive ﬂuid that is used to make soap and moisturizer.
In our experiment, glycerin drains from a clear plastic
container with vertical walls through a vertically orientedsteel tube, marketed as a reusable straw, ﬁtted to a hole inthe reservoir bottom. We seal the interface between the straw
and the edge of the hole with glue in order to eliminate leaks.
We stabilize the relatively heavy steel straws with adhesive
putty in order to keep their orientation vertical. The simpleexperiment we propose, analyze, and implement is opti-mized, not necessarily for accuracy, but rather to illuminatephysical and ﬂuid dynamical concepts.
According to our calculations, the time required for the
ﬂuid to drain from the reservoir through the straw is directlyproportional to the kinematic viscosity /C23of the glycerin and
to the area Aof the ﬂuid surface in the reservoir, inversely
proportional to the fourth power of the straw radius R, and
related in a simple way to the straw length Land the initial
height Hof the ﬂuid above the entrance to the straw. Modern
capillary viscometers, of which ours could be considered a
type, usually have more complicated geometries,
4see Fig. 1
for our geometry.
II. NAVIER–STOKES EQUATION
If the tube through which the ﬂuid ﬂows is horizontally
oriented, as in Poiseuille and Hagen’s experiments, thedynamics in the tube are governed by the followingNavier–Stokes equation:

Here, u¼uðr;tÞis the time-dependent axially directed ﬂuid
velocity, ris the distance from the center of the tube, /C23is the
kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid, Lis the length of the tube,
which, in Poiseuille and Hagen’s geometry, is horizontallyoriented, qgh=Lis the uniform pressure gradient along the
tube, and qis the density of the incompressible ﬂuid.
The Navier–Stokes equation (1)relates the acceleration of
the mass of the ﬂuid in the tube to the forces applied to anelement of that ﬂuid. The term on the left-hand side of Eq.(1)originates from the inertial (or “ ma” term) of Newton’s
second law of motion; the ﬁrst term on the right-hand sidequantiﬁes the friction-like forces that adjacent streams of

ﬂuid exert on each other; and the second term on the right-
hand side accounts for the pressure on a ﬂuid element causedby the weight of the ﬂuid above the entrance to the tube.

This parabolic proﬁle is said to describe Poiseuille ﬂow .
However, Poiseuille did not discover or derive Eq. (5)but
rather discovered that when a constant pressure was appliedto one end of a cylindrical tube that is open to the atmo-sphere at the other end, the mass ﬂux Qthrough the tube is
related to the tube radius Rand length Lby
Q/
R4
L: (6)
As we shall see, this proportionality follows directly from
the radial proﬁle Eq. (5)and conservation of mass. WhilePoiseuille did not reference the concept of viscosity, he did
recognize that the speed of the ﬂow was a maximum in the
center of the cylindrical tube, where r¼0 and approached
“extreme slowness” at its edge where r¼R.
In our experiment, a vertically oriented steel straw drains
glycerin from a clear plastic container. In order to account
for the weight of the ﬂuid in the vertically oriented straw, an
extra term must be added to the right-hand side of Eq. (1).
Since the total weight of the ﬂuid in the straw is qgLpR2,a n
additional pressure gradient qgL=Lper unit density qmust
be added to the right-hand side of Eq. (1). Accordingly, Eq.

The steady-state radial proﬁle Eq. (8)and the mass ﬂux Qit

scale of the height hðtÞof the ﬂuid in the reservoir, that is,
h=_h, is long compared to the time required to form Poiseuille

The time dependence of hcan be found by remembering
that mass is conserved. Therefore, the mass ﬂux Qin the

IV. CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR QUASISTATIC
POISEUILLE FLOW
The time required to form Poiseuille ﬂow in a cylindrical
tube of radius Ris according to standard calculations
R2=/C23k2
1, where k1½/C252:41/C138is the ﬁrst zero of the Bessel func-
tionJoðxÞ(see Ref. 5, pp. 193–195). The time R2=/C23k2
1is, at
least dimensionally, easy to understand. After all, the SI
units of kinematic viscosity /C23are m2/s, and the tube radius R
is that distance across which the viscosity minimizes the
velocity gradient.
Therefore, in this geometry, quasistatic Poiseuille ﬂow
requires the strong inequality
R2
/C23k2
1/C28htðÞ

Given Eq. (13), this condition is equivalent to

The dimensionless quantity gR3=/C232in the ﬁrst set of paren-
theses is the dimensionless ratio of gravitational to viscousforces that ﬂuid dynamists call the Galileo number
Ga¼gR
3=/C232. The smaller the Galileo number Ga, the more
closely condition (17) obtains and the more viscosity, rather
than gravity, dominates the ﬂow (see the text later in this sec-
tion for an example of a gravity-dominated ﬂow).
The product of the average ﬂuid speed /C22uand the formation
time R2=/C23k2
1is the entrance length /C22uR2=/C23k2
1, the distance
over which ﬂow in the reservoir transitions to Poiseuille ﬂow
in the straw (see pp. 193–195 of Ref. 5for a calculation of
reference length). Our analysis requires that the entrancelength be small compared to L,H, and h. Given Eq. (10) and

Since pR2<A, the experimental parameters satisfying con-
dition (18)also satisfy condition (17).Another requirement for quasistatic Poiseuille ﬂow is that
the Reynolds number Re of the ﬂow in the cylindrical tube issmall enough to ensure that this ﬂow remains laminar. TheReynolds number Re in a cylindrical tube of radius Ris
given by Re ¼2R/C22u=/C23, and Reynolds numbers Re <2000
are required for laminar pipe ﬂow.
7We ﬁnd that this condi-
tion is equivalent to
Ga

Lþ1/C18/C19
<2000 : (19)
As we shall see, inequalities (17)–(19) are easily met by our
experimental parameters.
As an example of how gravity rather than viscosity could
dominate the ﬂow, we note that in the limit L!0 the aver-
age speed /C22uof Poiseuille ﬂow as given in Eq. (10) diverges
to inﬁnity. Several investigators have proposed theoreticalgeneralizations that avoid this seemingly paradoxical limit.8
Of course, this limit is unphysical and, indeed, irrelevant toour experiments since it leads to the breakdown of require-ments (17)–(19) .
Indeed, the physics behind this limit is equivalent to the
small entrance length condition (18).F o r ,a s Lbecomes smaller
than the entrance length /C22uR
2=/C23k2
1, the ﬂow from the reservoir
is no longer constrained by Poiseuille ﬂow but rather byTorricelli’s principle , according to which gravity, rather than
viscosity, dominates the ﬂow. When, in this limit, the ﬂuid exitsthrough a hole of radius Rat depth hbelow the ﬂuid surface, its
speed isﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ2ghp.
9Conservation of mass then requires that

Consequently, the time tBerrequired to drain the reservoir,

is independent of viscosity /C23. Therefore, insuring that the
entrance length /C22uR2=/C23k2
1is much smaller than Halso ensures
thattBer/C28tend. This condition, given in Eqs. (15) and(21),
is equivalent to the strong inequality
Ga/C1R
32H/C18/C191=21
lnH=Lþ1 ðÞ/C281; (22)
which is closely related to the small entrance length condi-
tion (18). Note that the Galileo number appears in each of
the four inequalities, Eqs. (17)–(19) , and (22).
Typical experimental parameters, as described in Sec. V,
areR¼0:0026 m, A¼0:0057 m2,L¼0:14 m, H¼0:09 m,
and/C23/C251000/C210/C06m2=s. In this case, Ga¼0:17. Note
that the ﬁrst three inequalities (17)–(19) also depend on the
value of h. Inequalities (17) and(18) most easily fail when
h¼H=3 while inequality (19)most easily fails when h¼H.
Inequality (22) depends only on Hand not on h. Given our
experimental data numerical values of the four inequalities,at the most critical stage of the evolution, are: 5 :7/C210

V. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURES AND RESULTS
All of our measurements were done in one of our residen-
ces with fairly common tools (a plastic ruler, a pair of $36
61 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January 2022 Lemons, Lipsombe, and Faehl 61 04 October 2023 23:00:14
calipers, and a cellphone stop watch) on an apparatus con-
structed out of easily procured materials (plastic containers,steel straws, adhesive putty, and pure glycerin). While ouroriginal intention was to use only inexpensive tools andmaterials, glycerin’s sensitivity to temperature drove us toborrow a $150 Onset Hobo Temperature Data Logger andtwo probes.
We made preliminary measurements on water draining
from a large plastic tub through a straw inserted through ahole in its bottom. However, water has a kinematic viscosity/C23/C2510
/C06m2=s. In this case, Ga/C252/C2105and the ﬂow is
dominated by gravity rather than by viscosity. Furthermore,the Reynolds number Re ¼7/C210
4indicates that such ﬂow
is turbulent. Indeed, in this case, the decay of hðtÞwas so
much slower than that predicted in Eq. (14) we did not fol-
low up with more precise experiments. Apparently, turbulent
ﬂow, under these conditions, is slower than laminar ﬂow.
Consequently, we sought a ﬂuid more viscous than water.
Pitch, an extraordinarily viscous ﬂuid, is an interesting, ifimpossible, case. Its viscosity at room temperature is about2/C210
11times that of water. For this reason, we would have
to wait decades for experimental results! For instance, thepitch in an experiment at the University of Queensland,ongoing since 1927, ﬂows through a funnel and forms dropsat a rate of once every 9 years.
10
We ﬁnally settled on pure glycerin with a viscosity of only
300–3000 times that of water depending upon its tempera-ture. Olive oil or other vegetable oils might have worked justas well, if having access to tabulated, temperature-dependentvalues of the viscosity of the ﬂuid was not important to us.
For reservoirs, we purchased and drilled holes in the bot-
tom of several clear plastic, cylindrical, kitchen containershaving vertical walls that, when level, create a ﬂuid surfacearea of A¼56.7 cm
2. The initial height (8 :00 or 9 :00 cm) of
the glycerin above the entrance to the straw is limited by theheight of the reservoirs. Reusable steel straws with innerradius R¼0.260 cm ensure that the time required for the
height of the glycerin to descend more than half its originalvalue H=2 is in the 15–30 min range. We used two different
steel straws, one with L¼14.0 cm and the other with
L¼26.7 cm. Given these geometrical values, the Galileo
number of room temperature glycerin is Ga/C250:17, the
Reynolds number is such that Re /C200:025, all ﬂows are lami-
nar, the ﬂow in the straw is Poiseuille, and all four condi-tions, Eqs. (17)–(19) , and (22), are easily met.
Our procedure was to measure the height hðtÞof the ﬂuid in
the reservoir as it decays with time tpast half-centimeter marks
on a paper rule taped to the side of the clear plastic reservoirand to compare these measurements with the evolution pre-
dicted in Eq. (14). Straw length Lis a parameter. Usually, two
of us performed the experiment. However, one person is sufﬁ-cient if that person uses the “lap” button on a smartphone timer.
Accuracy is crucial in two instances. According to Eq.
(14), the rate of exponential decay of hðtÞis proportional to
R
4. For this reason, the inner radius Rof the steel straw
should be accurately known. The calipers we used to mea-sure the diameter are uncertain to 60.02 mm, and this read-
ing error produces an uncertainty in hðtÞthat grows from
60:1% to63:1% as the height of the ﬂuid descends.
The temperature of the glycerin is also important—for the
glycerin’s viscosity depends sensitively and nonlinearly onits temperature.
11While the advertised uncertainty of our
temperature probes is 60.2/C14C, we found that the two probes
we used agreed with one another to well within 60.1/C14C. Anuncertainty of 60.2/C14C produces an uncertainty in hðtÞthat
evolves from 60:1% to63:6% as the height of the ﬂuid
descends.
Our efforts were, for a time, stalled by glycerin’s hydro-
philia, that is, its tendency to absorb water from the atmo-
sphere. Even a small amount of water dramatically decreases
the viscosity of a water/glycerin mixture, as we observed by
measuring the time evolution hðtÞof a deliberately composed
mixture of glycerin and water. Indeed, the kinematic viscos-
ity of a room-temperature mixture composed of 95% glyc-
erin and 5% water is a factor of two below that of 100%glycerin (see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) of Ref. 11). Glycerin can be
reused but only if its purity is preserved or if its mixture with
water is quantiﬁed. In an effort to obtain the best possible
data, we opened new bottles of inexpensive, pure glycerin.12
Figure 2displays our measurement of hðtÞversus t(ﬁlled
circles) with the predictions of Eq. (14) (continuous lines).
The straw lengths were L¼14.0 cm (lower ﬁlled circles and
curve) and 26.7 cm (higher ﬁlled circles and curve). In calcu-
lating each curve, the kinematic viscosity of glycerin was
determined from the median temperature logged by our tem-
perature probes as determined by the empirical relation
between kinematic viscosity and temperature.13The error
bars shown are centered on points on the curve that corre-
spond to times tat which the height hðtÞwas measured.
After all, these error bars represent the uncertainty in the the-
oretical curve caused by the uncertainty in determining
parameters that enter Eq. (14). In the two cases reported in
Fig.2, the temperature drifted by no more than 0.2/C14C in the
course of our data collection. The geometrical parameters,
H¼9c m , A¼56.7 cm2, and R¼2.60 mm, are common to
both cases.
VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have constructed an apparatus with easily procured
materials that sets up, under household conditions, thePoiseuille ﬂow of pure glycerin through a vertically oriented,
reusable steel straw. The design of our apparatus allows this
ﬂow to evolve quasistatically in time. We derived an
Fig. 2. Instantaneous height hðtÞof the glycerin in the reservoir in meters
versus time tin seconds. The ﬁlled circles are data, and the continuous
curves are those values predicted in Eq. (14). The error bars are centered on
the continuous “theory” curve, because they represent an uncertainty associ-
ated with parameters that enter Eq. (14). The lowest sets of data and continu-
ous curve are for L¼14 cm with T¼24.2/C14C and v¼773.8 /C2106m2/s,
while the highest sets of data and curve are for L¼26.7 cm with T¼22.9/C14C
andv¼875.9 /C2106m2/s. The purpose of different initial values of h, that is
ofH, is to separate the two curves on the graph.

expression (14) for the quasistatic decay of the easily mea-
sured instantaneous height hðtÞof the glycerin in the reser-
voir above the entrance to the steel straw as a function ofgeometrical factors and the kinematic viscosity of glycerinand found good agreement between the results of this deriva-tion and our measurements.
Because the kinematic viscosity of glycerin depends, sen-
sitively and nonlinearly, on its temperature, we found it nec-essary, contrary to our initial goal of using only inexpensivetools, to upgrade our thermometer to one that measured tem-peratures with an advertised accuracy of 60.2
/C14C. During a
series of experiments, we realized that glycerin readilyabsorbs water from the atmosphere. According to publishedstudies, only a little water mixed with glycerin dramaticallydecreases the mixture’s viscosity. For these reasons, anagreement between the experiment and the theory was best
when we used glycerin from recently opened bottles.
This apparatus and these techniques could also be used to
measure the kinematic viscosity of other readily availableﬂuids, for instance, different vegetable oils, as long as theinequalities (17) and (18), which ensure that the system
evolves quasistatically, and Eq. (19), which ensures that the
ﬂow within the steel straw is laminar, are observed. Theapparatus could also be used to measure the amount of waterin a water–glycerin mixture since the viscosity of these mix-tures is empirically known.
