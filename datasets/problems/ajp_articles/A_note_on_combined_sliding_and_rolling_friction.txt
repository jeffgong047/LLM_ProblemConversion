The coefﬁcient of sliding friction is usually regarded as a constant for any given surfaces although
it is sometimes known to vary with sliding speed. An experiment is described where the coefﬁcientof friction for a billiard ball decreases to a very small value as the sliding speed decreases to zero,
after which the ball starts rolling without sliding. A simple theoretical explanation is provided.

If a billiard ball is projected on a billiard table without
spin, then sliding friction will reduce its translational speedand increase its rotational speed until it commences to roll
without sliding. The process is usually regarded as one where
the coefﬁcient of friction remains constant (or at leastapproximately constant) while the ball is sliding and thensuddenly decreases to a much smaller value corresponding to
the coefﬁcient of rolling friction.
1–3In this Note, I present
measurements which show that this is not the case. Whilethe ball is sliding and while its angular velocity is increasing,
the horizontal speed of the contact point at the bottom of the
ball decreases. Just before the ball stops sliding, the speed ofthe contact point is very small, and so is the coefﬁcient offriction. The results show that there is a gradual decrease in
the coefﬁcient of friction rather than a sudden decrease when
sliding stops. As far as the author is aware, there are no othermeasurements showing how the coefﬁcient of friction and
the velocity of the contact point vary during the short time
interval just before the ball stops sliding. The transition fromsliding to rolling without slipping was examined in Ref. 1,
but the time steps involved were too large to examine the
ﬁnal stage of the transition as the sliding speed approachedzero. The authors used 67 ms time steps, whereas the timesteps in the present experiment are 3.3 ms.
The geometry of the problem is shown in Fig. 1. The ball
has mass m, radius R, travels to the right at center of mass
speed vand rotates clockwise at angular velocity x. The con-
tact point P at the bottom of the ball slides to the right at
speed v
P¼v/C0Rx, so the friction force, F, on the ball acts
to the left. The normal force acting on a billiard ball on feltacts in a direction perpendicular to both the ball surface andthe deformed felt surface and is distributed over the whole
contact region.
2The net effect can be resolved into compo-
nents FandNparallel and perpendicular to the undeformed
surface ahead of the ball, as indicated in Fig. 1. The normal
reaction force, N¼mg, acts at a distance Dahead of the
ball’s center. This offset distance is needed to account forrolling when v¼Rx, otherwise the torque due to Fwould
allow xto continually increase while vdecreases.

If the ball rolls without slipping, then vP¼0a n d lE¼ðD=RÞ=

Otherwise, lEdepends on dvP=dt.lEcannot exceed the coefﬁ-
cient of static friction and is equal to the coefﬁcient of sliding
friction, lk,w h e n dvP=dtis large and negative. However, as the
ball transitions from a sliding mode to a rolling wit hout slipping
mode, vPand dvP=dtboth decrease in magnitude, so lE
decreases smoothly from its maximum value of lkto a mini-
mum value of lR. In the transition region where vPdecreases to
zero, the friction force is due partly to rolling motion and partly
to sliding motion. As described below, if the felt deforms or if
the ball deforms elastically, then part of the ball in the contact
region can slide while the remaining part can simultaneouslyroll without sliding.
The experiment was undertaken by impacting a bi lliard
ball (radius 25.4 mm) with a cue on a horizontal surface

ball was projected with a small amount of backspin and at
low speed so that it would slide for a short distance beforeit started to roll without sliding. The motion of the ball
was ﬁlmed at 300 frames/s to measure its linear and
angular speed; two equator lines were drawn on the ball to
measure its rotation angle. Every sixth video frame was
digitized using Tracker motion analysis software. The digi-tized data were ﬁtted with polynomial functions, and those
functions were differentiated with respect to time to calcu-
late vandx. The ﬁts were excellent, with correlation coef-
ﬁcients greater than 0.999 98. The results are shown in
Fig. 2. In the time interval 0 <t<0:16 s, the coordinates
of the ball and its angular rotation were ﬁtted with cubic
functions, and in the time interval 0 :2<t<0:44 s, during
which the ball rolled without sliding, quadratic ﬁts were
used.

and dvP=dt¼dv=dt/C0Rdx=dt. Since xwas ﬁtted with a
cubic function during the sliding part of the motion, v
¼dx=dtis initially a quadratic function of time while lEand
dvP=dtare linear functions of time. lEdecreases from a max-
imum value 0.49 at t¼0 to the rolling friction value
lR¼0:015, while dvP=dtincreases rapidly from –15.8 m/s2
to zero when the ball starts rolling. The measured value of
lRindicates that Nis offset by a distance D¼0.53 mm on
the felt surface. At t¼0, the second term in Eq. (4), i.e.,
½/C0k=gð1þkÞ/C138dvP=dt, equals 0.46, close to the maximum
value of lE. Thereafter, lEdecreases rapidly, despite the fact
that the ball continues to slide for the next 0.2 s.
The above results are surprising and were checked care-
fully with other initial launch conditions and on a smooth
rather than the felt surface, with similar results to the felt sur-face. The results were also checked by ﬁtting quadratic func-
tions over small overlapping time intervals during the sliding
phase, indicating that the acceleration of the ball varied with
time in the same manner as that calculated with the cubic
ﬁts. That is, a cubic ﬁt to say, 20 data points (digitized everythird frame) gave essentially the same acceleration vs time
as four different quadratic ﬁts to 6 or 7 data points over suc-
cessive but smaller time intervals. In all cases, the expectedlinear decrease in vwith twas not observed, which would be
the case if l
E¼lkremained constant while the ball was
sliding.There was no evidence that lkvaried with sliding speed,
since many different initial ball speeds were examined. All
revealed the same initial value of lkbefore the transition to
rolling commenced. The experimental results are consistent
with the theoretical calculation showing that lEvaries with
time if dvP=dtvaries with time, as it does during the latter
stages of the transition process when vPapproaches zero.
The implication is that when vPis small, any given contact
point can slide to a stop while it remains in contact with thefelt surface, but when v
Pis large, the contact point slows
down but does not come to stop. That interpretation is con-sistent with calculations in Refs. 4and5where the authors
consider the pressure distribution over the contact region atthe bottom of an elastic cylinder that slides on an elastichorizontal surface. Within the contact region, part ofthe cylinder grips the surface and part slides. The total fric-tion force, therefore, has two separate components and
decreases with time until the cylinder grips the surface over
the whole contact region, after which the cylinder rollswithout slipping. In the present case, a billiard ball is alsoelastic but it is the felt that deforms the most. A relatedeffect arises when a ball bounces obliquely on a horizontalsurface. The bottom of the ball can slide to a stop and thengrip the surface before the ball bounces off the surface, inwhich case the friction force at the bottom of the ball is due

to an initial sliding phase followed by a static friction
phase.6The coefﬁcient of friction therefore decreases rap-
idly with time during the impact.
