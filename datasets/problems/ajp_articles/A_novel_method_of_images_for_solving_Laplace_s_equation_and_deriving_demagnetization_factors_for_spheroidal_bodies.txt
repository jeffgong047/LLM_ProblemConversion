I. INTRODUCTION
Consider an arbitrarily shaped body that possesses a magneti-
zation (magnetic dipole moment per unit volume), MðrÞ,e i t h e r
spontaneously by virtue of being a ferromagnet or by placementin an external magnetic ﬁeld, H
0. The magnetization of the
body acts as the source of an add itional magnetic ﬁeld H0ðrÞ.
This ﬁeld is often called a demagnetizing ﬁeld, since it usuallyopposes H
0andM, and it is generally nonuniform inside the
body even if MðrÞis uniform or nearly so. A knowledge of the
demagnetizing ﬁeld is essential if one wishes to make accurate
measurements of the magnetic properties of a material. Most
experimental techniques measure the magnetic moment M,
which is the integral of MðrÞover the volume, but ideally one
would like to ﬁnd the relationship between MðrÞand the local
ﬁeldHðrÞ¼H0ðrÞþH0ðrÞ. Finding H0ðrÞcan be challenging,
and its nonuniformity is a further unwelcome complication.Because the magnetic ﬁeld is such an important probe of theproperties of matter and a control variable in many technologi-cal applications, this problem appears frequently across manysubﬁelds of physics and engineering.
The only exception to the nonuniformity of H
0is found
when the body is of ellipsoidal shape and is uniformly mag-netized. In that case, H
0is itself uniform and can be written
in terms of a demagnetization tensor whose trace, further-more, is equal to unity.
1–4Speciﬁcally, in Gaussian units,
H0
i¼/C04pNijMj; (1)
TrN¼Nii¼1: (2)
Here, H0
iandMjare Cartesian components of H0and the mag-
netization, M; repeated indices are implicitly summed over; and
Nijis the aforementioned tensor. It is symmetric, i.e., Nij¼Nji,
and each of its principal values is non-negative.
The above fact is widely known, but while its statement is
very simple, its proof is surprisingly elaborate, and mosttextbooks, even at the graduate level, are content to just statethe fact. The complete solution for the ﬁeld both inside andoutside the body is generally found by solving Laplace’sequation for the magnetic scalar potential in ellipsoidal coor-dinates. Practically, nobody ever goes through this solutionin detail as a student or later in life with the result that even
many experienced researchers do not fully know why the
result is true. Even the degenerate case of a spheroid (anellipsoid of revolution) is quite complicated, and the answersare almost always taken on authority. The more limited prob-lem of ﬁnding just the interior ﬁeld and showing that it isuniform can be solved by starting with Poisson’s integralform for the potential due to the surface magnetic poles,
expanding the inverse separation jr/C0r
0j/C01in spherical har-
monics, and using the orthogonality of these harmonics toperform the requisite surface integral.5While still somewhat
intricate, this method is within the grasp of a graduate class.
The situation simpliﬁes greatly when the spheroid further
degenerates to a sphere, an inﬁnitely long right circular cyl-inder, or an inﬁnitely wide slab. In these three cases, one canobtain the answer by solving Laplace’s equation in sphericalpolar, cylindrical, or Cartesian coordinates, and this is com-monly done in many more textbooks.
6–8In fact, it is not nec-
essary to solve Laplace’s equation at all, and the answer canbe seen to be correct by inspection. Unfortunately, it is notpossible to proceed backward from these simple cases to thespheroid or ellipsoid by guesswork.
It is apparent that because of the underlying connection
with Laplace’s equation, the demagnetization problem hascounterparts in gravity, and it also shares many features withheat transport and elastic stresses in materials with ellipsoi-dal inclusions.
9We have chosen to frame our study in terms
ofdemagnetization since that is where it ﬁnds its most com-
mon application. It is mathematically isomorphic, however,
to the electrostatic problem of depolarization of a dielectric
body in a uniform external electric ﬁeld. The solution of thatproblem can in turn be reduced to that of a conductor in auniform external electric ﬁeld. It is in this last form that weshall present our mathematical analysis, since one can thenappeal to well-known and intuitively simple ideas aboutequipotential surfaces and ﬁelds inside conductors. The con-nection with the magnetic problem is simple and will bemade later.
The most symmetric problem is that of a conducting
spherical shell in a uniform applied electric ﬁeld. In thiscase, the additional ﬁeld produced by the charges induced onthe sphere is precisely that of a point dipole of certainstrength at the center of the sphere. This dipole plays thesame role as an image charge in the method of images—it isto be regarded as a ﬁctitious collection of charges that, alongwith the true charges, makes the surface of the conductor an
equipotential and, thus, produces the correct ﬁeld outside the
conductor, but gives an incorrect ﬁeld inside it. How thisimage dipole is found is beside the point. What matters isthat, however, one has found it, its correctness can be veri-ﬁed. The uniqueness theorem for the solutions to Laplace’sequation when the potential is speciﬁed on a surface (theDirichlet problem) guarantees that the potential will be givencorrectly outside all the conductors. In Purcell’s words,
10the
method provides a “solution in search of a problem.”Starting with an arbitrary collection of charges, one ﬁnds an

equipotential surface or a set of such surfaces. Purcell then ima-
gines copperplating one of these mathematical surfaces, takingall the charge inside the mathematical surface and depositing iton the copperplated one instead, and erasing all the ﬁeld linesinside it. The deposited charge is guaranteed to distribute itselfso as to make no change to the ﬁeld lines outside the surface.
In the same way, in this paper, we shall present image
charge distributions that give the solution for a conducting
prolate spheroid (an ellipsoid with semi axes a,b, and b,
with a>b) in a uniform applied electric ﬁeld, both when the
ﬁeld is along the long axis and when it is perpendicular to it.We have found these solutions by guesswork.
We present these solutions in Sec. II. As a preliminary, we
reprise the known fact that the equipotential surfaces of auniform charged wire of ﬁnite length are prolate spheroidswith foci at the ends of the wire.
11–13Hence, the ﬁeld outside
any prolate spheroidal conductor is the same as that of a con-focal wire with the same total charge, and this wire can be
viewed as an image charge. We then present our guesses and
show that they make the surface of the conductor an equipo-tential. By the uniqueness theorem, they must give the cor-rect ﬁeld outside the conductor, the distribution of charge onits surface, and the depolarization coefﬁcients. One neednever solve Laplace’s equation itself. The analysis is simpleenough for an undergraduate class. It requires only basicknowledge of the geometry of the ellipse and a few one-dimensional integrals that can be done by a trigonometric
substitution. Some detailed aspects of ellipse geometry and
the integrations are given in Appendixes A andB.
In Sec. III, we show the connection between the problem
of the conductor and demagnetization. We ﬁnd the demagne-tization factors explicitly for a prolate spheroid and by ana-lytic continuation in the spheroid dimensions for an oblatespheroid. We have not found image solutions in the oblatecase, and we explain the difﬁculties involved in Appendix C .
In Sec. IV, we give a little bit of the provenance of the results

tains some suggestions for exercises that can be assigned to
students. Finally, Appendix D contains a proof that

II. IMAGE SOLUTIONS FOR A PROLATE
SPHEROIDAL CONDUCTOR
In this section, we consider a conducting prolate spheroid
in three situations: (a) charged and in zero ﬁeld, (b)uncharged and in an electric ﬁeld along the long axis, and (c)uncharged and in an electric ﬁeld transverse to the long axis.Throughout this paper, any external ﬁeld is to be understoodas uniform and static.
A. Ellipse geometry
A prolate spheroid is an ellipsoid of revolution obtained
by rotating an ellipse about its major axis. If this axis is takenalong zthen in any cross-section containing it, it is conve-
nient to use coordinates q¼ðx
2þy2Þ1=2andz.
Let two points, F and F0, lie on the zaxis at z¼6f, and
letr1andr2be the distances from these points to a generic
point P, see Fig. 1. The locus
r1þr2¼2a (3)
deﬁnes an ellipse whose equation isz2
a2þq2
b2¼1: (4)
The points F and F0are the foci of the ellipse, and the lengths
aandbare its semi-major and semi-minor axes. They are
related to the interfocal distance 2 fvia
a2/C0b2¼f2: (5)
Asaandbare varied so that this equation is always obeyed,
one obtains a set of confocal ellipses. The range of the semi-
major axis is f/C20a<1. The quantity
/C15¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

a(6)
is the eccentricity of the ellipse. If a¼f, the ellipse degener-
ates into the line segment connecting the foci and /C15¼1, and
asa!1 , it approaches a circle of radius aand/C15¼0.
Given a general point with coordinates zandq, we have
r2
1¼q2þðz/C0fÞ2;
r2
2¼q2þðzþfÞ2: (7)
Hence, if we deﬁne two new variables

then

B. Charged conductor in zero external field
Let us consider a wire carrying a charge per unit length k
lying on the segment FF0. We shall show that the equipoten-
tial surfaces are confocal ellipses with foci F and F0. This is a
known fact,11–13but it will be useful to derive it for our-
selves. The potential at a general point (in three-dimensional
space) is given by
/¼kðf
/C0fdz0
ðz/C0z0Þ2þq2hi1=2
¼klnðz0/C0zÞ2þq2hi1=2
þz0/C0z
q2
43
5f
z0¼/C0f
¼klnr1þf/C0z
r2/C0f/C0z/C20/C21
: (13)
(The integral is easily done by the substitution
z0/C0z¼qtanh, see Fig. 2.) If we now rewrite r1,r2, and zin
terms of uandvby using Eqs. (9)and(10), the argument of
the logarithm becomes
r1þf/C0z
r2/C0f/C0z¼uþvþ1þuv
u/C0v/C01þuv¼ðuþ1Þð1þvÞ
ðu/C01Þð1þvÞ: (14)
Cancelling off the factor ð1þvÞ, we obtain
/¼klnuþ1
u/C01/C18/C19
: (15)
Since this is a function only of u, it is constant on surfaces
of constant u, i.e., the ellipsoids of revolution with foci F
and F0. In particular, if we have a conductor whose surface
coincides with one of these ellipsoids, carrying a total
charge Q,E q . (15) gives the potential outside this conduc-
tor. The argument is simple. The solution to Laplace’s
equation that is a constant on the surface of the conductor is
unique up to an additive constant. Equation (15) meets these
requirements, so it must be the correct solution. It remains
to ﬁx k. Since the total charge on the wire must be Qby
Gauss’s law
k¼Q=2f: (16)We can also see that for points far from the ellipsoid,
r/C29f;u’r=f/C291, the logarithm can be expanded in pow-
ers of 1 =u, yielding
/’2kf
r: (17)
This is the potential of an object with net charge 2 kf.
The potential inside the conductor, /imust also obey
Laplace’s equation and equal the exterior potential on the
surface u¼uab¼a=ða2/C0b2Þ1=2. The only possible solution
is a constant, i.e.,
/i¼klnuabþ1
uab/C01/C18/C19
: (18)
C. Conductor in external field: Longitudinal case
Let us now consider an (uncharged) prolate conducting
spheroid in an external ﬁeld along the long axis, E0^z.( A s
before, the semi axes are a,b, and bwith aalong the zaxis.)
The potential /is divided into two parts
/¼/0þ/0; (19)
where /0¼/C0E0zis the potential due to the applied ﬁeld and
/0is the remainder due to the induced charges on the con-
ductor. The total potential /must satisfy Laplace’s equation,
and we must have
/¼constant if u¼uab: (20)
We proceed by analogy with the conducting sphere. In that
case, the image charge that produces the correct potential out-
side the sphere is a point charge at the center if the conductor is
charged and there is no external ﬁeld, and a dipole at the center
if it is uncharged and in a uniform external ﬁeld. We now guess
that for the spheroid in an external ﬁeld, the image will again be
aw i r el y i n go nt h e zaxis from F to F0, but with a charge distri-
bution odd in zso as to produce a net dipole moment. We also
expect this dipole moment to be proportional to the magnitude
of the external ﬁeld, E0. Accordingly, we consider the simplest
guess, a linear charge density
kðzÞ¼cE0zð/C0f/C20z/C20fÞ; (21)
where cis a (dimensionless) constant. The potential /0from
this image charge is
/0¼cE0ðf
/C0fz0
ðz/C0z0Þ2þq2hi1=2dz0: (22)
Just as for Eq. (13), this integral is also evaluated by
substituting z0¼zþqtanh. The unobvious step is casting
the answer for /in terms of zandurather than zandq.
Leaving the details to Appendix B , the ﬁnal result is
/¼/C0E0zþcE0zFðuÞ; (23)
with

On the surface of the conductor, FðuÞ¼FðuabÞ¼constant.
If we choose cso as to cancel the ﬁrst term, /C0E0z, the sur-
face will become an equipotential with /¼0. The unique-
ness theorem for Laplace’s equation then guarantees that this
is the correct solution for the potential outside the conductor.Since u
ab¼1=/C15, we ﬁnd that the required value of cmust be
such that
c/C01¼ln1þ/C15
1/C0/C15/C02/C15: (25)
The potential inside the conductor must be a constant and
equal to 0 in order to satisfy Laplace’s equation. We have,
thus, found /ðrÞeverywhere.
For future use, let us ﬁnd the induced surface charge den-
sity and the dipole moment of the conductor. First, let E0be
the induced ﬁeld. Since the total ﬁeld vanishes inside the
conductor; in this region, we must we have
E0¼/C0E0^z: (26)
Second, let us consider the ﬁeld far from the conductor.
Putting u’r=fin Eq. (24) and expanding in powers of 1 =r
gives, the induced potential as
/0¼2cE0zf3
3r3: (27)
This is the potential of a point dipole of dipole moment14
P¼ 2cE0f3=3: (28)
Third, the surface charge density is given by
re¼/C01
4p^n/C1r//C12/C12/C12/C12
u¼uab; (29)
where ^nis the outward normal to the surface. Feeding in Eq.
(23) for/, we get
^n/C1r/¼^n/C1^zð/C0E0þcE0FðuÞÞþcE0zdF
du^n/C1ru:(30)
The ﬁrst term vanishes when u¼uab¼1=/C15. If we evaluate
dF/du, use Eq. (A5) for^n/C1ru, and simplify, we obtain
re¼c
2p/C153
ð1/C0/C152ÞE0^n/C1^z: (31)
D. Conductor in external field: Transverse case
If the ﬁeld is transverse to the long axis, along xsay, the
conductor will develop a dipole moment along xby symme-
try. This suggests that we seek an image charge in the form
of a line of dipoles on the segment FF0with a strength that
varies as an even function of zand is proportional to E0.
Some trial and error shows that the following dipole moment
density works:
pðzÞ¼bE0ð1/C0z2=f2Þ^xð/C0f/C20z/C20fÞ; (32)
where bis a constant. Since pðzÞis a dipole moment per unit
length, bhas dimensions of (length)2.
Once again, we write the potential as /¼/0þ/0with
/0¼/C0E0x. The induced potential is/0¼bE0x
f2ðf
/C0ff2/C0z02
ðz/C0z0Þ2þq2hi3=2dz0: (33)
This integral is also evaluated in Appendix B , and combined
with/0, the result for /is
/¼/C0E0xþbE0x
f2GðuÞ (34)
with
GðuÞ¼2u
u2/C01/C0lnuþ1
u/C01/C20/C21
: (35)
This result has the same structure as Eqs. (23) and(24) for
the longitudinal case. We choose bso that /¼0 on the sur-
face of the conductor, u¼uab. This surface is then an equi-
potential, and /is assured to be the correct potential
everywhere outside the conductor. Recalling that uab¼1=/C15,
the required value of bmust be such that
b/C01¼1
f22/C15
1/C0/C152/C0ln1þ/C15
1/C0/C15/C20/C21
: (36)
Inside the conductor, we again take /¼0.
As in the longitudinal ﬁeld case, let us ﬁnd the induced
surface charge and dipole moment. The argument is thesame. The induced electric ﬁeld is now given by
E
0¼/C0E0^x: (37)
For the far ﬁeld, we put u’r=f, expand Eq. (35) in powers
of 1=r, and obtain
/0¼4bE0xf
3r3; (38)
corresponding to a dipole moment15
P¼ 4bE0f=3: (39)
Finally, the surface change density is given by /C0^n/C1r/=4p
with u¼uab.W eh a v e

(40)
When u¼uab¼1=/C15, the ﬁrst term vanishes. Using Eqs. (35)
and(A6), the second simpliﬁes to yield

As mentioned in Sec. I, the material in this section is
within the grasp of advanced undergraduates. Suggestions
for possible exercises are given in Sec. V.
III. CONNECTION WITH DEMAGNETIZATION
A. Magnetic scalar potential
Let us begin by recalling the relationship between the
magnetization (magnetic dipole moment per unit volume)
523 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Garg, Ketterson, and Lim 523 04 October 2023 23:12:29
MðrÞof an arbitrarily magnetized body and the magnetic
ﬁeld H0ðrÞthat it produces.3,16,17Since MðrÞis static and
there are no free currents, this ﬁeld obeys the equations
r/C1H0¼/C04pr/C1M;r/C2H0¼0: (42)
Furthermore, the tangential component of H0must be contin-
uous at the surface, and its normal component must jump byan amount M/C1^nas we cross the surface from the inside to
the outside. The problem is then identical to one in electro-statics, and the solution can be sought in terms of a magneto-static potential, /
0, such that H0¼/C0 r /0. The potential /0is
that produced by volume and surface magnetic chargedensities

m¼/C0 r/C1 M;rm¼M/C1^n: (43)
Hence,
/0¼ð
Vqmðr0Þ
jr/C0r0jd3r0þð
Srmðr0Þ
jr/C0r0jd2r0: (44)
The integrals over VandSare over the volume and surface
of the body.
B. Prolate spheroidal magnet: M jj^z
We now consider a prolate spheroid uniformly magnetized
along z,18i.e.,MðrÞ¼M^z, independent of rinside V. In this
case, qm¼0 and
rm¼M^n/C1^z: (45)
Because there are no volume charges anywhere, /0satisﬁes
Laplace’s equation, is continuous on the surface S, and has a
discontinuity in its normal gradient given by 4 prm. If we can
guess a solution that satisﬁes these conditions, we areassured that it will be correct by the uniqueness theorem.
The key observation is that r
e/^n/C1^zin the electric prob-
lem, just as rm/^n/C1^zin the magnetic one. Thus, the two
are mathematically identical. To solve the magnetic problem,we merely replace the symbols E
0,re, andPbyH0,rm, and
M, where Mis the total magnetic moment. All three quanti-
ties are proportional to E0, which is now some purely arbi-
trary scale factor. Examining Eq. (31), we see that to get
rm¼M^n/C1^zwe must put
E0¼2p
c1/C0/C152
/C153M: (46)
Then,
M¼2cf3
3/C22p
c1/C0/C152
/C153M¼4p
31/C0/C152
/C153f3M: (47)
Butf¼a/C15andð1/C0/C152Þ1=2a¼b,s o
M¼ MV; (48)
where V¼4pab2=3 is the volume of the spheroid. We see
thatMis indeed the total magnetic moment of the body.
Finally, H0¼/C0E0^z. Using Eqs. (46) and(25) forE0andc,
we may write this as
H0¼/C04pNðzÞM^z; (49)with
NðzÞ¼1/C0/C152
2/C153ln1þ/C15
1/C0/C15/C02/C15/C20/C21
: (50)
Equation (49) states that the magnetic ﬁeld inside a uni-
formly magnetized prolate spheroid is itself uniform andantiparallel to the magnetization, which is our main result.
The quantity N
ðzÞis the demagnetization factor. It depends
only on the eccentricity of the spheroid. As /C15!0, i.e., as the
spheroid tends to a sphere, NðzÞ!1=3, which is the correct
answer by symmetry.
C. Prolate spheroidal magnet: M ?^z
Once again, reandrmare proportional to ^n/C1^x,s ow e
replace E0,re, andPbyH0,rm, andM. To get rm¼M^n/C1^x
from Eq. (41),w em u s tp u t

Then,
M¼4bf
3/C2pf2
b1/C0/C152
/C153M¼MV; (52)
just as in the longitudinal case. Once again, Mis indeed the
total magnetic moment. Finally, H0¼/C0E0^x. Using Eqs.
(51) and(36) forE0andb, we obtain
H0¼/C04pNðxÞM^x; (53)
with
NðxÞ¼1/C0/C152
4/C1532/C15
1/C0/C152/C0ln1þ/C15
1/C0/C15/C20/C21
: (54)
This is the demagnetization factor for Mjj^x.
By symmetry, NðyÞ¼NðxÞ. For Tr Nto equal 1, we should
have
2NðxÞþNðzÞ¼1; (55)
which is easily checked to be true.
D. Oblate spheroidal magnet
This case is more complex than that of the prolate spheroid,
and we have not found image solutions for it. We indicate thenature of the complexity in Appendix C . Nevertheless, one can
obtain the demagnetization factors by analytic continuation
from the prolate case provided care is taken to avoid notationalconfusion.
Let us denote the semi-axes along the x, y, andzaxes by
b,b, and afor a prolate spheroid ( b<a), and by b,b, and c
for the oblate spheroid ( b>c). When we pass from atoc,
we must continue /C15toig, where
g¼ð ðb
2=c2Þ/C01Þ1=2: (56)
ForNðzÞ, this yields
NðzÞ¼1þg2
g3ðg/C0arctan gÞ: (57)
524 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Garg, Ketterson, and Lim 524 04 October 2023 23:12:29
However, the variable gisnotthe eccentricity of the cross-
sectional ellipse. Denoting the latter by /C15as before, we have
/C15¼ð1/C0c2=b2Þ1=2, so that
g¼/C15
ð1/C0/C152Þ1=2: (58)
Then, arctan g¼arcsin /C15, and in terms of /C15,
NðzÞ¼1

IV. PROVENANCE AND ADVANCED READING
Because the Coulomb and gravitational forces are both
inverse-square laws, the problem examined here has gravita-
tional antecedents, and because the earth and other rotatingcelestial bodies are often ellipsoids, these antecedents go allthe way back to Newton and his contemporaries. A scientiﬁ-cally rich historical account is given by Chandrasekhar,
20
and a more limited account especially of Dirichlet’s work isgiven by Dittrich.21
Chandrasekhar says that the gravitational force inside a
uniformly dense ellipsoid with three unequal semi-axes a1,
a2, and a3was given by Gauss in 1813 and independently by
Olinde Rodrigues in 1815, in a form which we would today
write as
Fi¼/C04pGqNijxj; (60)
where Nijis none other than the demagnetization tensor of
the magnetic problem! Furthermore, Gauss and Rodrigues
gave the principal values of this tensor in the beautifullysymmetric form22
NðiÞ¼1
2a1a2a3ð1
0du
ða2
iþuÞQ
jða2
jþuÞ1=2: (61)
(In these formulas, Gis the gravitational constant, qis the
density of the ellipsoid, and Fiandxiare the components of
the force and radius vectors, respectively.) However, the factthat the force is a linear function of the x
i, and a less symmet-
ric form of the principal values of Nijwas stated earlier by
Laplace in 1784. As per Dittrich, in 1839 Dirichlet employed
what we today call the Dirichlet discontinuous factor to eval-
uate the standard Poisson integral
UðrÞ¼/C0ð
r02body1
jr/C0r0jd3r0; (62)
for the gravitational potential (in units where G¼q¼1)
both inside and outside the ellipsoid. Dirichlet’s answers arealso given in the same symmetric form as Eq. (61).
The above investigations do not directly relate, however,
to magnetic bodies. According to Korringa et al. ,9Roche,23
and also to Maxwell’s Treatise of 1873,24that connection,
effectively in the form of Eq. (44), was ﬁrst made by Poissonin 1824.25,26For a uniformly magnetized body, this amounts
to saying that the magnetic and gravitational potentials arerelated by
/0¼M/C1rU; (63)
and that H0is obtained by taking a further gradient:
H0¼/C0 r /0. The task is, thus, reduced to evaluating the inte-
gral (62) for an ellipsoid. Maxwell simply asserts the result,citing the textbook by Thompson and Tait.27An accessible
evaluation of the integral in modern language is given in
Ref. 21.
The route to the answer via the direct solution of
Laplace’s partial differential equation in ellipsoidal coordi-nates can also be found in Maxwell’s Treatise.28The argu-
ment entails what are now called Lam /C19e functions,29and
indeed Maxwell states that his “investigation is chieﬂy bor-rowed from a very interesting work” by Lam /C19e. This analysis
is translated into more modern language in Stratton.30A
complete but very terse account is given by Landau andLifshitz,1who obtain Eq. (61) for the NðiÞ, and also give lim-
iting forms for ellipsoids of revolution. Equations (50) and
(57) are identical to their Eqs. (4.32) and (4.34). Further dis-
cussion of demagnetization and tables of the coefﬁcientsmay be found in Refs. 16,19, and 31–34 .
V. EXERCISES FOR STUDENTS
As already mentioned, the systematic methods for ﬁnding
N
ijare, regrettably, too complex even for many graduate
classes. In contrast, once the method of images has been
motivated, the solutions presented here have many aspectsthat can make for interesting exercises for advanced under-graduates or beginning graduate students. The answers to allof them are in this paper.
First is the evaluation of the integrals in Sec. II. Second,
one can ask for the induced charge (for the charged conduc-tor in zero ﬁeld) or the induced dipole moment (for theuncharged conductor in nonzero ﬁelds) by examining theasymptotic form of the potential at large distances, r/C29f.I t
might be noted that in contrast to the uncharged sphere in an
external ﬁeld, the induced ﬁeld is not purely dipolar; inter-ested students could be asked to calculate higher moments ofthe ﬁeld both by direct integration of the image charge distri-butions and by examining the distant form of the ﬁeld, andthis could be an opportunity to exemplify or reinforce themultipole expansion. Third, one can ﬁnd the induced chargedensity on the surface of the ellipsoid. For the charged con-ductor in zero ﬁeld, one should ﬁnd the elegant result
r
e¼Q
4pab2x2þy2

a4/C18/C19/C01=2
; (64)
when written in Cartesian coordinates. For the other two
cases (uncharged conductor in a ﬁeld either along or perpen-dicular to ^z), this is a nontrivial exercise, but successful stu-
dents should ﬁnd the remarkable result that r
e¼V/C01
0P^n/C1^z
orre¼V/C01
0P^n/C1^x, where ^nis the outward normal to the sur-
face. Curious students will naturally enquire about the prob-lem when the ﬁeld is in a general direction. The answer is
given by superposition of the high symmetry cases and
can be an opportunity to discuss that the dipole moment istensorially related to the external ﬁeld. Finally, one canobserve that 2 N

525 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Garg, Ketterson, and Lim 525 04 October 2023 23:12:29
be expected to see the deep reason for this, namely, that it
reﬂects the inverse-square nature of the Coulomb force.
The connection between the conducting and dielectric and
magnetic ellipsoids in external ﬁelds may also strike instruc-
tors as an advanced topic. On the one hand, the connection isquite simple, but on the other it needs to be preceded by dis-
cussion of the dielectric constant, magnetic susceptibility,
and the general issue of constitutive relations for matter.

APPENDIX A: MORE ELLIPSE GEOMETRY
With x¼qcosuandy¼qsinu, the variables u,v, and u
are ellipsoidal coordinates that uniquely ﬁx the location ofany point in space. In this appendix, we give a self-contained
derivation of some relations for their gradients without
invoking the theory of orthogonal coordinate systems.
We begin by calculating ru/C1rv. From Eq. (8), we get

Now, r1is the distance from F to a general point. Its gradient
is, therefore, a unit vector in the direction of increasing r1.
Similarly, rr2is also unit vector. Hence, ðrr1Þ2¼ð r r2Þ2
¼1, and
ru/C1rv¼0: (A2)
Because the vectors ruandrvare normal to the surfaces of
constant uand constant v, this result shows that these surfa-
ces intersect at right angles. (One can show that the surfaces
of constant vare hyperbolas with foci at F and F0in the same
way that one shows that the surfaces of constant uare ellip-
ses.) Furthermore, ruis normal to the plane of constant u
whereas ruandrvlie in this plane. Hence,
ru/C1ru¼r v/C1ru¼0: (A3)
Next, let us denote the outward unit normal to any of the
ellipsoids by ^n. It is apparent that

APPENDIX C: OBLATE SPHEROIDAL CHARGED
CONDUCTOR IN ZERO EXTERNAL FIELD
We discuss in this appendix the nature of the problem in
ﬁnding demagnetization factors for an oblate spheroid by the
method of images.
To this end, we consider the simpler problem of a conduc-
tor carrying a total charge Qin zero external ﬁeld. From the
solution of Laplace’s equation in oblate ellipsoidal coordi-nates,35one can infer that the correct image charge distribu-
tion is that of a circular disk Dof radius fin the xyplane
with charge density

However, this is an indirect argument. To directly show that
the equipotential surfaces are oblate spheroids, one mustevaluate

This is not a simple integral and cannot be done via elemen-

(theJmare Bessel functions), integrate over u0and then use
formulas 6.554.2 and 6.752.1 in Ref. 37for the integrals

It is quite likely that an image charge distribution that pro-
duces the equipotentials of an uncharged oblate conductor inan external ﬁeld will take the form of a dipole sheet or amore complex distribution on the disk D. Even if such a dis-
tribution could be found, the required integrals will mostlikely be even more complex than the one shown above.
While the results might be interesting in their own right, thegoal of a simple route to demagnetization coefﬁcients wouldbe defeated.
APPENDIX D: PROOF THAT TrN51
We give in this appendix a proof for a more general tensor
known as the magnetometric demagnetization tensor that can
be deﬁned for a body of arbitrary shape, not just an ellip-soid.
16,38The body need not even be simply connected. Our
proof differs from previous ones in that it essentially elimi-nates the need to actually evaluate any integrals by employ-ing Fourier transform methods.
39
If the body is uniformly magnetized,18the magnetic ﬁeld
everywhere, both inside and outside the body, may be writ-ten as
H
0
iðrÞ¼4pMjð
Dijðr/C0r0Þsðr0Þd3r0; (D1)
where
DijðrÞ¼/C01
4pr2dij/C03rirj
r5/C01
3dijdðrÞ; (D2)
andsðrÞis a function which is 1 inside the body, and 0 out-
side.40With this function, the integral in Eq. (D1) is a convo-
lution extending over all space. Taking Fourier transforms,we get
H
0
iðkÞ¼4pMjDijðkÞsðkÞ (D3)
with
sðkÞ¼ð
Ve/C0ik/C1rd3r: (D4)
To obtain DijðkÞ, we note that DijðrÞ¼r irjð1=4prÞ. Since
the Fourier transform of 1 =4pris 1=k2;DijðkÞ¼/C0 kikj=k2,
or
DijðkÞ¼/C0 ^ki^kj; (D5)
where ^k¼k=k. Hence,
H0
iðkÞ¼/C0 4psðkÞ^ki^kjMj: (D6)
Let us now consider the volume average of H0over the
body. Denoting this average by /C22H0, we have
/C22H0

HiðrÞsðrÞd3r

527 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Garg, Ketterson, and Lim 527 04 October 2023 23:12:29
If the body is an ellipsoid, H0is uniform inside it, so
/C22H0¼H0,E q . (D7) reduces to the statement at the start of the
paper, and the magnetometric tensor reduces to the standard one.
The tensor Nijalso gives us the magnetostatic energy of
the body. We have
Ems¼1
8pð
H02ðrÞd3r; (D9)
where the integral is again over all space. By Parseval’s
theorem,
Ems¼1
8pðd3k
ð2pÞ3jH0ðkÞj2; (D10)
where the absolute value is in two senses: The magnitude of
a vector, and of a complex number. Feeding in Eq. (D6), and
recalling that repeated indices are being summed over so that
^ki^kn^kj^kn¼^ki^kj, we get
Ems¼2pVNijMiMj: (D11)
This result is sometimes known as the Brown–Morrish
theorem.38
That Tr N¼1 follows directly from Eq. (D8) and
Parseval’s theorem. Since ^ki^ki¼1,
TrN¼1

Vð

Equation (D8) also shows that Nijis dimensionless, symmet-
ric, positive deﬁnite, and determined entirely by the shape ofthe body.
Workers in magnetism often deﬁne other demagnetization
factors by averaging H
0in other ways.41These factors are
physically meaningful, but they do not have nice mathemati-cal properties: They do not give the energy and they are noteven elements of a tensor.

18How this state of uniform magnetization is brought about and whether it is
stable are completely irrelevant to our discussion. Still, if one insists on
asking this question, one can imagine a ferromagnet with very strongexchange interaction J.A s J!1 , the individual spins in the magnet
must be aligned with each other, and their overall orientation can be ﬁxed
by applying an inﬁnitesimal magnetic ﬁeld. This state of affairs is a good
approximation for real magnets whose size is smaller than the so-called
magnetostatic exchange length. See Ref. 16.
