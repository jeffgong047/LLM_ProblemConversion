Is contour integration essential? Alternatives for
beginning physics students
Onuttom Narayan
91(3), p. 170
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0084475We rely on contour integration in many physics deriva-
tions. But sometimes we want to teach these topics beforestudents have studied complex variables. What to do? Thispaper shows alternate techniques to evaluate many standard
integrals that are found in topics ranging from response func-
tions to Fourier transforms of Gaussian functions. Thesetechniques will be valuable to anyone seeking to expand therange of integrals they can present in lower-level courses.
A shorter path to some action variables
Juan F. Zanella B /C19eguelin
91(3), p. 177
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0118683In advanced dynamics, conjugate momenta are used to
compute action variables, derivatives of which yield infor-mation on the periodic motions of a system. A classic appli-cation is the problem of Kepler orbits. Unfortunately,computing the action variables often involves complicatedintegrals that are conventionally treated by contour integra-
tion. This paper shows how these integrals can be more eas-
ily solved by ﬁrst differentiating them with respect to aparameter of the problem, a technique developed by Leibnizand often exploited by Richard Feynman, hence becomingknown as Feynman’s trick. Appropriate for teachers of inter-mediate and advanced-level dynamics.
An exploration of circumbinary systems using

91(3), p. 182
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0088604This work provides an introduction to gravitational lensing
by planets bound to a binary stellar system. Instructors ofintroductory astrophysics courses can use this introduction toallow undergraduates to simulate possible observations. Theprospects for further exoplanet discovery are exciting.
Producing slow light in warm alkali vapor using
electromagnetically induced transparency
Kenneth DeRose, Kefeng Jiang, Jianqiao Li, Macbeth
Julius, Linzhao Zhuo, Scott Wenner, and Samir Bali91(3), p. 193
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0128967In the past decades, atomic physicists have gained a new
superpower: They are now routinely able to slow light down to
a few hundred meters per second, a million times slower thanthe speed of light in vacuum, c.T h e yd os ob ym a k i n gp o l a r -
ized light go through alkali vapor, already excited by a stronger“pump” laser. Alkali atoms can be approximated by a three-
level atom with two low energy states, j1iandj2i, and a higher
energy excited state, j3i. The intense pump beam excites the
transition from j2itoj3i, whereas the weaker polarized probe
beam is tuned to the j1itoj3itransition. It turns out that, when
the two beams excite the atoms, a “dark state,” a combination
ofj1iandj2
i, appears, which cannot absorb any photons. This
transparency to light also comes with a group velocity that ismuch smaller than c. The alkali medium is then transparent to
light butslows it down. How paradoxical! This paper gives a
detailed description of the experimental setup needed to create
such electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT), appropri-ate for an undergraduate project or an advanced optics lab. EITcan also be used to store quantum information, so that this lab
could be introduced as a practical example of quantum memory
in an advanced course on quantum computing.
A tabletop experiment for speed of light measurement
using a Red Pitaya STEMlab board
Che-Chung Chou, Shi-Yu Hsaio, Jun-Zhi Feng, Tyson
Lin, and Sheng-Hua Lu
91(3), p. 206
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0099720A tabletop optical setup, which includes an affordable Red
Pitaya STEMlab test and measurement board and a low-cost
laser diode module, is used to accurately determine the speedof light. The experiment is carried out by measuring the fre-quency response of the phase shift between intensity-modulatedlight beams reﬂected by two mirrors separated by 50 cm. By
using the STEMlab unit’s built-in Bode analyzer to automati-
cally scan the modulation frequency over the range from 10 to40 MHz, the frequency response of phase is measured andrecorded. These phase shift data are then used to calculate the
speed of light with an uncertainty of less than 0.5%. All of the
required components are commercially available and no elec-tronic construction work is necessary so the experiment can beimplemented by students in plug-and-play manner.
Singular Lagrangians and the Dirac–Bergmann
algorithm in classical mechanics

lower dimensional phase spaces enables applications of this
formalism to masses attached to rods and springs. Instructorscould introduce the constrained Hamiltonian dynamical for-
malism into upper-level undergraduate mechanics courses
using several systems that are offered as examples.
Particle-in-cell method for plasmas in the one-
dimensional electrostatic limit
Sara Gomez, Jaime Humberto Hoyos, and Juan Alejandro
Valdivia
91(3), p. 225
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0135515This paper provides an introduction to computer simula-
tion methods that is accessible to early undergraduate phys-ics majors and discusses the interesting and common
phenomenon of electron-electron two stream instability. It
illustrates how, even though most plasmas are not onedimensional, many of the key insights into their behavior canbe obtained from one-dimensional models.
Continuous fractional component Gibbs ensemble Monte
Carlo
Niklas Mayr, Michael Haring, and Thomas Wallek
91(3), p. 235
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0135841This paper discusses a clever modiﬁcation of the usual
algorithm for simulating vapor-liquid coexistence. The usualmethod requires a trial move of a particle from one phase tothe other. Because most random moves to the liquid phaserequire too much energy and are not accepted, the authorsdiscuss using fractional particles which require less energy.These particles gradually become complete particles as thesurroundings adapt to the change. This modiﬁcation is agood example of how physics motivates the choice of com-puter algorithms.
From Sackur-Tetrode entropy to the ideal gas adiabatic
equation in one step
P.-M. Binder and Ian R. Leigh
91(3), p. 247
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0139175For an ideal gas, adiabatic processes are characterized by
the relation between pressure and volume: PV
c¼constant ( c
is the adiabatic constant). Usually this equation is derivedusing thermodynamics principles. In this paper, an alternatederivation is proposed based on statistical mechanics, usingthe expression of entropy for an ideal gas, the so-calledSackur-Tetrode equation. It is breathtakingly simple, andillustrates how statistical mechanics is indeed consistent withthermodynamics. This derivation would make for a niceundergraduate statistical physics exercise.
