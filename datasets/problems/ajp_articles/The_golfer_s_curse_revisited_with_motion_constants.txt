We revisit the golfer’s curse, which is the possibility that a golf ball can emerge from the
cylindrical hole into which it has entered. Our analysis focuses on three constants of the motion.
One of these is the energy, because we assume that the ball rolls without slipping on the inner wallof the hole, losing only a small amount of energy to rolling resistance; the other two are related to
the angular momentum about the contact point of the ball with the inner wall of the hole. We
develop an analysis of the motion of the ball and report measurements of the moment of inertia of areal golf ball. Solving the equation of motion along the vertical direction, we address the question
of whether or not the ball could complete a vertical oscillation without reaching the bottom of the
hole. We also present measurements of the dynamical friction for a golf ball and discussdissipation in slip conditions. We conclude by proposing a challenge to golf players: to ﬁnd a way
to send a ball into a hole in order to make it emerge.

I. INTRODUCTION
The golfer’s curse is the counter-intuitive emergence of a golf
ball from the hole into which it has been directed. If this occurs, it
must be due to the existence of an upward force that acts against
weight. We analyze the problem in the case that the ball stays in
contact with the inner wall of the hole, a condition admittedly not
often met in reality.1Of course, the phenomenon discussed here
can only occur if the ball does not approach the hole close to its
center-line. Historically, the roots of this problem can be found
in the Mathematical Problems for the Cambridge Mathematical
Tripos Examination by Wolstenholme.2The problems num-
bered 2689 and 2690 in this reference concern the motion of asphere on the surface of a cylinder of inclination awith respect
to the vertical direction (for problem 2689, the cylinder is hori-
zontal). Figure 1is the text of problem 2690 with the equations
of motion to be proven by students. The general equations of
motion of a sphere over rough surfaces were given by Edward
Routh in his treatise on the dynamics of rigid bodies; see section
215 and further.3In particular, sections 225, 226, and 227 deal
with rolling motion on a rough cylinder. Routh showed that the
center of the sphere can exhibit an oscillating motion along the
cylinder axis: “… the sphere cannot be made to travel continu-
ally in one direction along the length of the cylinder exceptwhen the point of contact describes a generator.”
It seems that the question of this type of motion was not fur-
ther investigated until recently.4–6Gualtieri et al. performed a
theoretical and experimental analysis of the motion.7Later, we
reanalyzed the motion in order to show that Gualtieri’s interpre-
tation via the Coriolis torque was due to the arbitrary choice of
a non-Galilean reference frame.8The more natural choice of a
Galilean terrestrial reference frame Rallowed us to ﬁnd the
same result by considering only two real forces, the weight of
the ball and the reaction force exerted by the inner wall of the
hole. While this problem originates more from theoretical and
academic investigations rather than the need to understandoccasional real-life occurrences, they are possible under the
assumptions of no-slip constraint, continuous contact with the
inner surface of the hole, and negligible dissipation. Despite
the rarity of this phenomenon, the problem of the golfer’s curse(or surprise) is a nice application of classical mechanics and
associated experiments. Furthermore, this physical model can
be seen as a motivation for future experiments, where a ball-
and-hole arrangement mimics the theory presented here inorder to determine whether balls can systematically be made toemerge from the hole. In the present work, the reference frame
Rof the analysis is that of the Earth (or lab), but the emphasis
is on constants of the motion that arise from energy and theangular momentum of the ball about its mobile contact point
with the inner surface of the hole.
8In Fig. 2, we sketch the ball
(mass m¼45 g, radius rb¼21 mm), which rolls without slip-
ping on the vertical cylindrical inner wall of the hole (radius rc
¼54 mm and depth hc¼102 mm). We adopt the cylindrical
unit vectors ðeq;eu;andezÞ,t h ea x i s Ozbeing vertically
upward and opposite to the weight ﬁeld vector g¼/C0gez.
The outline of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we exam-
ine the condition of rolling without slipping. Section III
establishes the constants of the motion. The dynamics of the
center of mass of the ball are examined in Sec. IV, which
also includes experimental results on the moment of inertiaof real golf balls; the conditions to have the ball emerge
from the hole are then studied. Section Voffers some com-
ments regarding the role of dissipation and reports results ofexperiments on the factor of rolling friction of golf ballsagainst various materials. Section VIsummarizes our results
and offers some suggestions for future experiments.
II. ROLLING WITHOUT SLIPPING
The ball will roll without slipping on the inner cylindrical
surface of the hole if the velocity of the contact point Iof the
ball with respect to this surface is zero.
9Analogous motions
of balls in contact with hollow tubes have recently been ana-lyzed and experimentally tested.12Using the velocity ﬁeld of
a rigid body with a rotation velocity vector XðXq;Xu;XzÞ,
the no-slip condition can be written as

In addition to the laboratory frame R, we also deﬁne a
moving frame Rethat rotates with respect to Raround the
Ozaxis with rotation velocity Xe¼Xeez¼_uez. The speed

III. CONSTANTS OF THE MOTION
A. Energy
In addition to weight, the ball experiences a reaction force R
exerted by the wall of the hole. This force has a componentnormal to the wall, Rn¼Rneq, that does no work since we
assume that the motion is at all times perpendicular to the q
axis. The friction force has tangential componentsR
t¼Rt;ueuþRt;zez. This force is obviously needed to counter-
act the weight /C0mgezif the velocity along the vertical direction
is to become positive. This reaction force combines with theweight to result in the acceleration of the ball: ma
C¼mgþR.

If the ball rolls without slipping, and assuming also that the
ball and the inside of the hole are rigid enough to prevent therolling resistance, we can approximate that the friction forcedoes no work, so the sum of its kinetic energy E

tial energy Epdue to weight is approximately constant

As the number of unknowns is ﬁve ðu,z,Xq,Xu;XzÞ,w e
have to ﬁnd, in addition to Eqs. (3),(4), and (6), two other
equations. These are obtained via the projection along thevertical and the radial directions e

tive of the angular momentum.
B. Angular momentum
In order to eliminate the torque of the reaction force R,w e
consider the angular momentum of the ball about the pointof contact I. This point is mobile with a velocity with respect

mobile point Iis (see Ref. 9, p. 315)Fig. 1. Problem 2690 from Ref. 2. Notations a,b,/,x, and zcorrespond in our text to rb,rc/C0rb;u;Xq, and z/C0hc. The mass of the sphere in the problem
2690 is unity. Also, in our problem, the axis of the cylinder is vertical, so a¼0.

which is typical of a harmonic oscillator. The vertical com-
ponent Rt;zof the reaction force, thus, has the same behavior,
see Eq. (5).
In the time derivative of Eq. (19),_zappears; the complete
equation is _z½fð€z;_z;zÞ/C138 ¼ 0. We exclude the trivial solution
_z¼0 for all times; that is, we set aside z¼constant ¼zðt

some speciﬁc times during the motion.
We see that the term in Eq. (20) that is responsible for the
vertical oscillatory motion is the one that takes into account

For a concrete analysis, it is important to experimentally
determine the factor Kof the moment of inertia.
A. Determination of the factor K
To experimentally determine the factor Kinvolved in the
moment of inertia Iof the ball, we have used a torsional
oscillator (Fig. 3): a small hole is drilled in the golf ball and
a small hook is inserted. This is then hung from a nylonthread (length 40 cm, diameter 0 :45 mm Þ, and the ball is
twisted. The experiment consists in measuring the period ofoscillation of the ball. Denoting the torsion constant as j,
this period is T¼2pðI=jÞ
1=2(recall that I¼Kmr2
bÞ.
Because the value of jwas not available, we have used the
same torsional oscillator with a ping-pong ball as a referencebody; designating its moment of inertia as I
r(the subscript r
stands for “reference”), the period of oscillation is, in this
case, Tr¼2pðIr=jÞ1=2. This ball (mass mr¼2:92 g, diame-
terDr¼40:4m m Þcan be considered with a good approxi-
mation to a hollow sphere, so that Ir¼mrD2

eliminates jby comparing the two periods of oscillation. It
follows that:

We performed ten measures of each of TandTr. Taking the
average value of these measurements and taking into accountthe measurement accuracy of our chronometer (about0:01sÞ, we obtained T¼7:2460:01 and T
r¼2:3460:01s.From these, we deduce K¼0:38360:004. The inertial
momentum of the hook has been neglected since it is very
close to the rotation axis.
This result is close to the value 0.4 expected for a homoge-
neous sphere. Figure 4shows the cross section, the kind of
golf balls we used in our experiments; they have a core made
of a rubbery material encased within a thin dimpled shell.

The special case Xqð0Þ¼0 is not physical since it would

Now, once the center of mass is in the hole, the question
of whether it can oscillate per Eq. (26) or rather if the ball
touches the bottom of the hole can be addressed by consider-ing the condition zðtÞ>r

Figure 5shows a plot of the functions F1½Xz;Xqð0Þ/C138
[Eq. (32)] and F2½Xz;Xqð0Þ/C138[Eq. (35)], in which we separate
three domains: (1) “the center of mass of the ball does notenter the hole” ðF
1<0Þ, (2) “the center of mass of the ball
is in the hole, oscillates, and can exit the hole ðF1>0 and
F2>0Þ,” and (3) “the center of mass of the ball is in the
hole and the ball touches the bottom” ðF2<0Þ. We also
indicate the null-lines F1¼0 and F2¼0. Note that the latter
is lower than the former, and both null-lines tend to inﬁnityasX
zapproaches 0. We can see that the higher Xqð0Þ, the
smaller the threshold values of Xz;1andXz;2. In the ﬁgure,
we also show a secondary ordinate axis that establishes anapproximate link between X
qð0Þand the velocity vaof the
centre of mass of the ball as it approaches the hole. The linkmay be of the type va/C24rbXqð0Þif one assumes that the
rotation velocity of the ball coincides approximately withX
qð0Þ. The velocity va, which can be estimated via Xqð0Þ,i s
interesting from an experimental perspective since it is easierto measure than X
qð0Þ. Since the ball rolls and drops at the
edge of the hole, we can reasonably assume such a relation-
ship to be a good estimate of Xqð0Þ, which is also the angular
velocity of the ball rolling on the green just before it entersthe hole (Fig. 6). Of course, the higher X

this threshold, but lower than Xz;1/C2537 rad s/C01, the center of
mass of the ball oscillates vertically in the hole (Fig. 7(b)). If
Xz>Xz;1, the simulation gives zðtÞ>hc(the center of mass

of the ball, namely, the appearance of oscillations of its centerof mass as a function of X
zfor a given value of Xqð0Þ,w e
can plot the function zðt;XzÞby taking Xqð0Þ¼50 rad s/C01
(Fig. 8). We see that zbecomes negative, that is, the ball
hits the bottom of the hole, if Xzis less than /C2423 rad s/C01. For
example, if Xz/C2520 rad s/C01;z>rbfor t<0:25 s, as
observed also in Fig. 7. The ball touches the bottom of the
hole at later times if Xzincreases. This instant of touching
does not exist anymore for Xz/C2523 rad s/C01, and so the center
of mass of the ball oscillates in the hole. When zbecomes
greater or equal than the hole depth ðz>hcÞ, the ball can
potentially pop out of the hole. Also, in Fig. 8, the vertical
coordinate of the center of mass, z, is never negative (the cen-
ter of mass does not enter the hole) if Xz>37 rad s/C01.
The physical origin of Xzis in the initial conditions: when the
ball enters the hole, Xz6¼0ap r i o r i .I na na c t u a lg o l fg a m e ,t h e
values of Xzmay be small, and our analysis indicates that the
ball should not emerge from the hole. This may explain whyball emergence has not been observed (or, if so, only rarely) bygolfers themselves. Also, this reveals why experiments showingvertical oscillations (Refs. 7and12) are conducted with rela-
tively high rotation velocities of the ball. It is worth emphasizingthat for the problem at hand, the ball is always assumed to
remain in contact with the inner surface of the hole.
V. SOME WORDS ABOUT DISSIPATION
In the foregoing analysis, we have assumed that a rigid
ball was rolling without slipping on a rigid surface, so therewas no energy dissipation. If there is slipping, the tangentialreaction force R
twill not be zero, and the mechanical energyEmwill no longer be constant because of the power of the
reaction force at point I,Ps¼Rt/C1vs. The slip velocity is
vC/C0rb/C2X, i.e .,vs¼½ ðrc/C0rbÞXeþrbXz/C138euþ½_z/C0rbXu/C138ez.
In other words, the components of vsare the terms on the
left sides of Eqs. (3)and(4); the null right sides of these
equations express the no-slip condition. From Coulomb’s
law of friction, we know that jjRtjj ¼ljjRnjj¼lmðrc
/C0rbÞX2
e, where lis the factor of dynamic friction. Since
Psis negative, it follows that its minimum is
minðPsÞ¼/C0jj Rtjjjjvsjj¼/C0 lmðrc/C0rbÞX2
ejjvsjj. It is not easy
to determine Psbecause it depends on the behavior of vs
(and hence Xe,Xu,Xz, and _z) and on l; we assume it does
not depend on vs. However, we can estimate the minimum
value of Psand compare it to the power mg_z. An assessment
ofjjvsjjcan be obtained by taking the following typical
orders of magnitude: Xe/C24Xz/C24Xu/C2410rads/C01and
_z/C240:1ms/C01, which give jjvsjj/C240:55ms/C01. Now we need to
estimate lfor surfaces that closely resemble the properties
of the liner of the hole.
There are numerous papers on how to measure l(e.g.,
Refs. 16–20 ). In the present paper, we have chosen the methods
of Ref. 16. To this end, we have built the apparatus shown in
Fig.9, which consists of two inclined (elevation angle h) parallel
rails of length Lwith an adjustable distance d<rbbetween
them; a screw mechanism (top right on Fig. 9(a))a l l o w st h er a i l s
to be tilted. The edges of the rails are a distance

b/C0d2=4Þ1=2below the center of the ball (Fig. 9(d)).
Measurements were conducted as follows: (1) we choose d;( 2 )
we choose h; (3) we let the ball travel down the rails and deter-
mine its average velocity /C22vfrom measures of L(here 0 :8mÞand
of the duration sneeded to cover this distance; (4) we repeat the
experiment with a higher value of h. We considered values of h
from 2/C14to 40/C14. We can repeat the same procedure for other val-
ues of d.F i g u r e 10is a plot of /C22vvsh1=2¼ðLsinhÞ1=2,w i t h h

elevation angles h, i.e., h/H1135110/C14, the measure is the least
accurate. This may be explained by the fact that lshould
depend on the normal force of reaction, which is greater forsmaller values of h. We have assumed that lwas a constant,
i.e., that the empirical Coulomb’s law of dynamic friction is
a good representation of what occurs; however, lis not
exactly constant, especially “if the normal force or the speedof motion gets too big.”
21We have obtained similar plots for
other values of dand, consequently, slightly different values
ofl; we adopt the average of these values /C22las our operative
value. We also considered different materials for the rails,namely, aluminium, plexiglass, PVC, and wood; Table II
summarizes the results.
We assume that the surface of the hole in the golf game is
made with a material analogous to plastics, so we can rea-
sonably adopt, for our purpose, /C22l/C250:085, a value between
those for plexiglass and PVC. Of course, the surface of agolf ball is not perfectly spherical because of the dimples;
the nature of the contact can change as the ball moves. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that measurements of thedynamical friction of a golf ball have been reported.
Consequently, we ﬁnd min ðP
sÞ/C24/C0 0:007 W, which is an
order of magnitude lower than the power of weight,
mg_z/C240:04 W. Dissipation by the tangential reaction force
may, thus, be considered to be negligible.
Another source of dissipation independent of slipping is
possible, namely, that corresponding to the contact torque Cr
associated with the rolling. The norm of this torque can be
written as jjCrjj ¼lrjjRnjj, where lris the factor of rolling
friction (with units of length).22,23In general, the value of lr
is on the order of a few millimeters. This gives the resistive
power due to rolling as Pr¼Cr/C1Xr<0, where

tioned orders of magnitude for Xe,Xu,a n d Xz, one gets
minðPrÞ/C24/C0 0:002 W, which is smaller than the dissipation
due to slipping alone. This is not totally surprising since roll-
ing resistance is often small with respect to the slipping resis-
tance: it is easier to move a wheel than a sled! This last valueis about 0 :002=0:007¼0:28 of the value due to slipping
alone ð/C240:007 W Þ.
If one considers both slipping and rolling, the total dissi-
pative power is R

Hence, taking into account rolling in the dissipation may
change the factor of dynamic friction /C22lbyltot. With the
orders of magnitude considered above and taking /C22l¼0:085,
one obtains ltot/C241:30/C22l¼0:111, i.e., the additive contribu-
tion proportional to lrrepresents around 30%; the ratio
0:002=0:007 of above. This difference may explain, in part,
the slight mismatch between the ﬁt (red) and experimental
(green) lines in Fig. 10.
We remark that the total dissipative power, namely, the
minimum min ðPsÞþminðPrÞ/C24/C0 0:009 W, is not so small
compared to the power of weight, mg_z/C240:04 W. It follows
that a not totally negligible part of the exchange between
kinetic and potential (weight) energy is lost. Hence, dissipa-
tion may also prevent the ball to emerge from the hole by
limiting the amplitude of the center of mass vertical
oscillations.
VI. CONCLUSION
The motion of a golf ball that rolls without slipping on the
inner wall of the hole in which it has entered has been inves-
tigated from the perspective of constants of the motion. One
of these is the energy. Two others arise from the projection
of the angular momentum of the ball about the mobile con-
tact point with the inner wall of the hole along the vertical
axis on the one hand and along the radial axis on the otherhand. The consequence is that the rotational velocity of the
ball around the vertical axis and the rotation velocity of the
cylindrical basis are constants of the motion: X
z¼constant
andXe¼constant. With respect to the reaction force that
the hole wall exerts on the ball, its normal (radial) compo-
nent is also a constant. The orthoradial component is zero,
and the vertical component creates, like the vertical coordi-
nate zof the center of mass of the ball, an oscillatory behav-
ior. This approach of emphasizing conserved quantitiesseems to us simpler than previous studies and should be of
pedagogical interest.7,8Our approach leads directly to the
physical interpretation that the ball can pop out of the hole.
Fundamentally, this is due to the pivoting velocity of the ball
on the inner wall of the hole, speciﬁcally, its dependence on
the vertical coordinate z.
Furthermore, we have analyzed the nature of the motion,
taking into account the experimentally determined momentof inertia of a golf ball. This experiment in itself could be
appropriate as an undergraduate laboratory.For the ball to emerge from the hole, its rotation velocity
X
zmust be greater than a threshold, which depends upon the
initial value of pivoting rotation velocity Xq. This threshold
decreases if the initial rotational velocity Xqð0Þincreases.
The role of dissipation due to slipping has also been con-
sidered; this led us to measure, we believe for the ﬁrst time,the factor of dynamical friction of a golf ball.
The oscillatory motion of the ball in the z-direction and
the possibility that it can emerge from the hole are rare inpractice. A reason for this may be that, in reality, the ball
does not keep continuous contact with the hole, and rota-
tional velocities are relatively small. Dissipation may alsoplay a role. However, this emergence is, in principle, possi-ble. We hope that present investigation may motivate golfersto try sending the ball into a hole with high enough rotationalvelocities so that it maintains contact for long enough to popout of the hole.

1We could not ﬁnd any online videos showing such an effect in a real golfgame. The best we found is a video of a putt by Tiger Woods in the 2007
PGA Championship, where the ball entered the hole only slightly, made
contact with its internal surface, and then emerged after an almost 180
/C14
turn (see <https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/golf-devil-ball-golf/look-back-
tiger-woods-putt-2007-pga-championship-213256799.html >, at time 1:10).
Strictly speaking, this is not completely similar to the periodic vertical
motion analysed here and in the references but is similar in that the ballseemed to fall before initiating a sudden upward motion and exiting the
hole.

11In the present work, it is assumed that Xqð0ÞandXzare unrelated quanti-
ties. They might be related under two conditions: (1) if vawere identiﬁed
with the initial velocity vCð0Þ(viz., the initial velocity of Cof the ball just
after entering the hole), and (2) if _zð0Þwere taken to be 0. One, thus,
would arrive at the conclusion that Xqð0Þ¼Xz; Eqs. (32) and(35) then

va;2/C24rbXz;2/C250:58 m s/C01, in perfect agreement with Fig. 5. Because the
interaction between the hole and the ball is complex (see Ref. 10), the con-
ditions (1)and(2)are not obvious. It is, thus, reasonable and simpler from
a pedagogical point of view to consider Xqð0ÞandXzas independent.

13The ball is obviously neither homogeneous nor a perfect sphere; we would
expect Kto be different from 2/5 and 2/3. However, the experimental
study gave a value close to 0.4 (cf. 4.1).
14Consider a mobile point M(position rM, velocity vM¼drM=dtÞin the
time derivative of the angular momentum; Ois the origin of the lab frame,
viz., a ﬁxed point in this frame. Since LM¼LO/C0rM/C2P, where P¼mvC
is the total linear momentum, we have, when taking the time derivative of
LM,dLM=dt¼dLO=dt/C0vM/C2P/C0rM/C2dP=dt. Moreover, the torque
about Mof all the forces ðF¼dP=dtÞisCM¼CO/C0rM/C2F. Because
dLO=dt¼CO, we obtain for the angular momentum theorem about a
mobile point d LM=dtþvM/C2P¼CM. This explains the term mvI/C2vCin
Eq.(8).
15We did not manage to ﬁnd exactly the ﬁrst equation in this examination.
Speciﬁcally, we do not ﬁnd the constant term 17 gsina=b; the 17 is myste-
rious. Also, to be consistent with the two other equations, it seems thatðd/=dtÞ2may correspond to X2

Xe¼Xeð0Þ¼constant, as in the present work (Eqs. (3)and(11)).
