The Eﬁmov effect (in a broad sense) refers to the onset of a geometric sequence of many-body
bound states as a consequence of the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scaleinvariance. While originally discovered in three-body problems in three dimensions, the Eﬁmov
effect has now been known to appear in a wide spectrum of many-body problems in various
dimensions. Here, we introduce a simple, exactly solvable toy model of two identical bosons in one
dimension that exhibits the Eﬁmov effect. We consider the situation where the bosons reside on a
semi-inﬁnite line and interact with each other through a pairwise d-function potential with a
particular position-dependent coupling strength that makes the system scale invariant. We show that,
for sufﬁciently attractive interaction, the bosons are bound together, and a new energy scale emerges.
This energy scale breaks continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance and leads to theonset of a geometric sequence of two-body bound states. We also study the two-body scattering off
the boundary and derive the exact reﬂection amplitude that exhibits discrete scale invariance.

I. INTRODUCTION
In his seminal paper in 1970, Eﬁmov considered three iden-
tical bosons with short-range pairwise interactions.1He
pointed out that, when the two-body scattering lengthdiverges, an inﬁnite number of three-body bound statesappear with energy levels fE
ngn2Zforming a geometric
sequence. This phenomenon—generally known as the Eﬁmov
effect—has attracted much attention because the ratioE
nþ1=En/C251=ð22:7Þ2is independent of the details of the
interactions as well as of the nature of the particles: It is uni-versal. More than 35 years after its prediction, this effect wasﬁnally observed in cold atom experiments,
2–6which has trig-
gered an explosion of research on the Eﬁmov effect. For more
details, see the reviews in Refs. 7–11 (see also Refs. 12–14
for a more elementary exposition).
Aside from its universal eigenvalues ratio, the Eﬁmov
effect takes its place among the greatest theoretical discover-ies in modern physics, because it was the ﬁrst quantummany-body phenomenon to demonstrate discrete scale
invariance —an invariance under enlargement or reduction
in the system size by a single scale factor.
15It is now known
that the emergence of a geometric sequence in the boundstates’ discrete energies is associated with the breakdown ofcontinuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance
16
and can be found in a wide spectrum of quantum many-bodyproblems in various dimensions.17–23The notion of the
Eﬁmov effect has, therefore, now been broadened to include
those generalizations, so that its precise meaning varies inthe literature. In the present paper, we will use the term“Eﬁmov effect” to simply refer to the onset of a geometricsequence in the energies of many-body bound states as aconsequence of the breakdown of continuous scale invari-ance to discrete scale invariance.
To date, there exist several theoretical approaches to study
the Eﬁmov effect. The most common approach is to directly
analyze the many-body Schr €odinger equation, which nor-
mally involves the use of Jacobi coordinates, hypersphericalcoordinates, the adiabatic approximation, and the Faddeevequation.
7Another popular approach is to use secondquantization or quantum ﬁeld theory.8Though the problem
itself is conceptually simple, it is hard for students and non-specialists to master these techniques and to work out thephysics of the Eﬁmov effect. The essential part of this phe-nomenon, however, can be understood from undergraduate-level quantum mechanics without using any fancy techniques.
This paper is aimed at introducing a simple toy model for
a two-body system that exhibits the Eﬁmov effect. We con-
sider two identical bosons on the half-line R
þ¼fx:x/C210g
with a pairwise d-function interaction. The Hamiltonian of
such a system is given by

where mis the mass of each particle and xj2Rþ(j¼1, 2) is
the coordinate of the jth particle. Here, g(x) is a coupling
strength. In this paper, we will focus on the position-dependent coupling strength that satisﬁes the scaling lawgðe
txÞ¼e/C0tgðxÞ, where tis an arbitrary real number. Notice
that, up to an overall constant factor, this scaling law has a
unique solution gðxÞ/1=x. For the following discussion, it
is convenient to choose
gðxÞ¼/C22h2

x; (2)
where g0is a dimensionless real number that can either be pos-
itive or negative. Physically, Eq. (2)models the situation
where the interaction strength becomes stronger as the particles
come closer to the boundary x1¼x2¼0( s e eF i g . 1). This
two-body interaction is essentially equivalent to the so-calledscaling trap introduced in Ref. 19, where the Eﬁmov effect
was discussed in the context of two non-identical particles onthe whole line R. As we will see shortly, our two-identical-
particle problem on R
þenjoys simple solutions and is more
tractable than the corresponding two-non-identical-particle
problem on R.
The rest of this paper is devoted to the detailed analysis of
the eigenvalue problem of H. Before going into details,

however, it is worth summarizing the symmetry properties
of the model. Of particular importance are the following:
•Permutation invariance. Thanks to the relation
gðx1Þdðx1/C0x2Þ¼gðx2Þdðx2/C0x1Þ, the Hamiltonian (1)is
invariant under the permutation of coordinates, ðx1;x2Þ
7!ðx2;x1Þ. Note that this permutation invariance is neces-
sary for Eq. (1)to be a Hamiltonian of indistinguishable
particles, where, for bosons, the two-body wavefunction
should satisfy wðx1;x2Þ¼wðx2;x1Þ. We will see in Sec.
III A that this invariance greatly simpliﬁes the analysis.
•Scale invariance. Thanks to the relations gðetx1Þ
¼e/C0tgðx1Þand dðetx1/C0etx2Þ¼e/C0tdðx1/C0x2Þ, the
Hamiltonian (1)transforms as H7!e/C02tHunder the scale
transformation ðx1;x2Þ7!ðetx1;etx2Þ. This transformation
law has signiﬁcant implications for the spectrum of H. Let
wEðx1;x2Þbe a solution to the eigenvalue equation
HwEðx1;x2Þ¼EwEðx1;x2Þ. Then, it follows from
e/C02tHwEðetx1;etx2Þ¼EwEðetx1;etx2Þthat wEðetx1;etx2Þ
satisﬁes HwEðetx1;etx2Þ¼e2tEwEðetx1;etx2Þ; that is,
wEðetx1;etx2Þis proportional to the eigenfunction
we2tEðx1;x2Þcorresponding to the eigenvalue e2tE. The
proportionality coefﬁcient can be determined by requiring
that both wEandwe2tEbe normalized. The result is the fol-
lowing scaling law:
we2tEðx1;x2Þ¼etwEðetx1;etx2Þ: (3)
If this indeed holds for any t2R;e2tEcan take any arbi-
trary (positive) value so that the spectrum of His continu-
ous. As we will see in Sec. III B, however, if g0is smaller
than a critical value g/C3, Eq. (3)holds only for some dis-
crete t2t/C3Z¼f0;6t/C3;62t/C3;…g; that is, continuous
scale invariance is broken to discrete scale invariance,
deﬁned by a characteristic scale t/C3. As a consequence,
there appears a geometric sequence of (negative) energyeigenvalues, fE
0;E0e62t/C3;E0e64t/C3;…g, where E0ð<0Þis
a newly emergent energy scale. One of the goals of this
paper is to show this result using only undergraduate-levelcalculus.
It should be noted that there is no translation invariance in
our model: It is explicitly broken by the boundary at x¼0a s
well as by the position-dependent coupling strength (2). This
non-invariance means that the total momentum—the canoni-cal conjugate of the center-of-mass coordinate—is not a
well-deﬁned conserved quantity. In other words, the two-
body wavefunction cannot be of the separation-of-variableform wðx
1;x2Þ¼eiPX=/C22h/ðxÞ, where X¼ðx1þx2Þ=2 is thecenter-of-mass coordinate, Pis the total momentum,
x¼x1/C0x2is the relative coordinate, and /is the wavefunc-
tion of relative motion. In Sec. II, we will ﬁrst introduce an
alternative coordinate system that is more suitable for the
two-body problem on the half-line Rþ, before solving the
problem in Sec. III.
II. TWO-BODY PROBLEM WITHOUT

Let us ﬁrst introduce a new coordinate system in the
ðx1;x2Þ-space. In what follows, we will work with the polar

h¼6p=4 correspond to the two-body coincidence point
x1¼x2and to the boundaries x1¼0 and x2¼0, respec-
tively. Note also that the permutation ðx1;x2Þ7!ðx2;x1Þcor-
responds to the parity transformation ðr;hÞ7!ðr;/C0hÞ; see

The energy eigenvalues are determined by the inverse-
square potential, which has been widely studied over theyears in the context of quantum anomaly (symmetry break-ing by quantization) or renormalization
24–31and is known to
support a geometric sequence of bound states if k<0.32As
we will see shortly, if g0is smaller than a critical value g/C3,
the lowest eigenvalue k0in the eigenvalue equation (11a)
becomes negative. Hence, in such a k0-channel, continuous
scale invariance can be broken down to discrete scale invari-ance, and the two-body bound-state energies follow a geo-metric sequence. Let us next see this by solving thedifferential equations (11a) and(11b) explicitly.III. TWO-BODY EFIMOV EFFECT
WITH BOUNDARY
A. Solution to the angular equation
Let us ﬁrst solve the angular equation (11a) . To this end,
we need to specify the connection conditions at h¼0 and the
boundary conditions at h¼6p=4. We start with the connec-
tion conditions equivalent to the d-function potential.
As well known, the d-function potential system (11a) is
equivalent to the differential equation /C0H
00¼kHforh6¼0
with the following connection conditions at h¼0:33
/C0H0ð0þÞþH0ð0/C0Þþg0ðHð0þÞþHð0/C0ÞÞ ¼ 0;(12a)
Hð0þÞ¼Hð0/C0Þ; (12b)
where the prime (0) indicates the derivative with respect to h.
Let us next take into account the symmetry of the two-
body wavefunction. Since we are dealing with identical
bosons, the wavefunction must be symmetric under the
permutation wðx1;x2Þ¼wðx2;x1Þ.34In the polar coordinate
system, this is equivalent to HðhÞ¼Hð/C0hÞ, whose deriva-
tive gives H0ðhÞ¼/C0H0ð/C0hÞ. Hence, at the two-body coinci-
dence point h¼0, there must hold the following additional
conditions:
Hð0þÞ¼Hð0/C0ÞandH0ð0þÞ¼/C0H0ð0/C0Þ: (13)
Thus, for identical bosons, Eq. (12a) can be reduced to the
following Robin boundary conditions:35
7H0ð06Þþg0Hð06Þ¼0: (14)
Let us now specify the boundary conditions at h¼6p=4.
For simplicity, we will impose the following Dirichlet boundaryconditions:36

Now it is straightforward to solve the angular equation (11a) .
Thanks to the property HðhÞ¼Hð/C0hÞ, it is sufﬁcient to solve
the differential equation /C0H00¼kHin the 0 /C20h/C20p=4r e g i o n

Hence, in the k0-channel, continuous scale invariance must
be broken down to discrete scale invariance for g0<g/C3. Let
us next see this by solving the radial equation (11b) .
B. Boundary-localized two-body Efimov states
From here on, we will consider the situation where
g0<g/C3and focus on the case E<0 in the channel
k¼k0<0. In this case, there exists a square-integrable
solution to the differential equation (11b) whose asymptotic
behavior as r!1 isRjkðrÞ! Njke/C0jr, where Njkis a nor-
malization constant and j¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

jr!1 . Note that Eq. (19)together with Eq. (16)describes
a two-body wavefunction that localizes to h¼0 and r¼0;
that is, it describes the two-body bound state that is localized
to the boundary ( x1¼x2¼0).
It should be noted that at this stage jis an arbitrary posi-
tive real constant. To determine its possible values, we fol-low the argument in Ref. 32and require the orthonormality
of the radial wavefunctions. Let R
jkandRj0kbe two distinct
solutions to Eq. (11b) . Then we have

where the overline ( /C22) stands for the complex conjugate and
the prime here indicates the derivative with respect to r.B ymultiplying Rj0kto Eq. (20a) andRjkto Eq. (20b) and then
subtracting one from the other, we get

where the second equality follows from Rjk;Rj0k!0 in the
limit r!1 , and the last equality follows from the short-
distance behavior of the modiﬁed Bessel function (see Eq.(A4) inAppendix A ).
Now, Eq. (22) enables us to determine the normalization
constant as well as the energy eigenvalues. First, the normal-ization constant is determined by requiring that R

Second, the energy eigenvalues are determined by requiring
that Rjkand Rj0kbe orthogonal for j6¼j0; that is,Ð1
0drRj0kðrÞRjkðrÞ¼0 for j6¼j0, which is attained if and
only if sin ð/C23logðj=j0ÞÞ ¼ 0. Thus, /C23logðj=j0Þmust be an

These are the binding energies of the boundary-localized

lows from the asymptotic behavior RjnkðrÞ! Njnke/C0jnras

¼ep=ð2/C23ÞRjnkðep=/C23rÞ, which, through Eq. (10), guarantees the
scaling law (3)discussed in the introduction with the scaling
factor et¼ep=/C23.
C. Two-body scattering off the boundary
Let us ﬁnally consider the case E>0 in the channel
k¼k0<0. In this case, we are interested in the solution
to the radial equation (11b) whose asymptotic behavior
asr!1 is the linear combination of plane waves
RkkðrÞ! e/C0ikrþSkðkÞeikr, where SkðkÞis a linear combina-
tion coefﬁcient and k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

(28)
Note that Eq. (28) together with Eq. (16) describes the
superposition of an incoming wave to r¼0 and an outgo-
ing wave from r¼0, both of which localize to h¼0; that
is, it describes the two-body bound state scattered off theboundary, where S
kðkÞplays the role of the reﬂection
amplitude (see the right panel of Fig. 4). Note also that the
scattering solution (28) is no longer localized to the bound-
aryr¼0.
It should be noted that at this stage SkðkÞis an arbitrary
constant. In order to determine SkðkÞ, we require that the
scattering solution (28) be orthogonal to all the bound-state
solutions (19). (Note that the energy eigenfunctions should
be orthogonal if their eigenvalues are different.) In exactly
the same way as for Eq. (22), one obtains the following
relation:ð/C0j2

Hence, in order to guarantee the orthogonality relationÐ1

IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced a toy scale-invariant
model of two identical bosons on the half-line Rþ,w h e r e
interparticle interaction is described by the pairwise d-function
potential with the particular position-dependent coupling
strength given in Eq. (2). We have seen that, if the two-body
interaction is sufﬁciently attractive, continuous scale invari-ance is broken down to discrete scale invariance. In the
bound-state problem where the bosons are bound together
and localized to the boundary, this discrete scale invariance

with different binding energies (left) and the scattering of a two-body bound
state off the boundary (right). The boundary plays the role of the (inﬁnitely
heavy) third particle (see Appendix B for details).

manifests itself in the onset of the geometric sequence of bind-
ing energies. In the scattering problem where the two-body
bound state is scattered by the boundary, on the other hand, thisdiscrete scale invariance manifests itself in the log-periodic
behavior of the reﬂection amplitude. Hence, by breaking transla-
tion invariance of this one-dimensional problem, we can con-
struct a two-body model that exhibits the Eﬁmov effect. In
contrast to the ordinary Eﬁmov effect in three-body problems in
three dimensions, our model can be solved exactly by just using
undergraduate-level calculus.
Finally, it should be mentioned the stability issue of the
model and its cure. As is evident from Eq. (27), there is no
lower bound in the energy spectrum fE
ngforg0<g/C3.
This absence of ground state is inevitable if the system is
invariant under the full discrete scale invariance that forms
the group Z. (As discussed in the introduction, the full dis-
crete scale invariance leads to the geometric sequence
fE0;E0e62t/C3;E0e64t/C3;…g, which cannot be bounded from
below if E0<0.) In order to make the spectrum lower-
bounded, we, therefore, have to break this invariance under
Z. The easiest way to do this is to replace the short-distance
singularity of the inverse-square potential by, e.g., a square-
well potential. Such regularization procedures have been
widely studied over the years in the context of renormaliza-
tion of the inverse-square potential. For more details, we
refer to Refs. 24–31 .

APPENDIX A: MODIFIED BESSEL FUNCTIONS
OF IMAGINARY ORDER
In this section, we summarize the short- and long-distance
behaviors of the modiﬁed Bessel functions. For details, we
refer to Ref. 42.
First of all, the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second
kind with imaginary order is deﬁned as follows:
Ki/C23ðzÞ¼ip
2Ii/C23ðzÞ/C0I/C0i/C23ðzÞ
sinhð/C23pÞ;/C232Rn0fg; (A1)
where Ii/C23is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind
given by the following series:
Ii/C23ðzÞ¼ei/C23logðz=2ÞX1
n¼01
n!Cð1þnþi/C23Þz

Here,Cis the gamma function. It follows immediately from
the deﬁnition (A1) that K/C0i/C23ðzÞ¼Ki/C23ðzÞ. It also follows
from Eqs. (A1) and(A2) thatKi/C23ðzÞ¼Ki/C23ðzÞforz>0.
The short-distance behavior of Ki/C23is governed by the
n¼0 term in Eq. (A2). By using the polar form of the
gamma function,

where arg Cð1þi/C23Þstands for the argument of Cð1þi/C23Þ,
we see that Ki/C23ðzÞbehaves as follows:Ki/C23ðzÞ!/C0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃp

APPENDIX B: BOUNDARY AS THE INFINITELY
HEAVY THIRD PARTICLE
In this section, we show that the two-body problem on the
half-line Rþdiscussed in the main text is equivalent to a
three-body problem on the whole line Rwith an inﬁnitely
heavy third particle. We note that this section is not neces-
sary for understanding the main text.
To begin with, let us ﬁrst deﬁne some notation. Let
z1;z22Rbe the coordinates of two identical bosons of mass
mandz32Rbe the coordinate of a third particle of mass
M. The Hamiltonian of these particles is assumed to be of
the following form:
H3-body¼/C0/C22h2

þgðz1/C0z3Þdðz1/C0z2ÞþUðz1/C0z3Þ
þUðz2/C0z3Þ; (B1)
where gðxÞ¼ /C22h2g0=ðmjxjÞis the position-dependent coupling
strength that makes the two-body interaction between theidentical bosons scale invariant. Note that the two bosons
interact only when they are in the same position, and the
interaction strength depends on their position relative to themassive third particle. Uis a pairwise interaction between
one of the identical bosons and the third particle whose
explicit form is irrelevant for the moment. Note that Eq.
(B1) is invariant under the translation ðz
1;z2;z3Þ7!ðz1þ
a;z2þa;z3þaÞfor any a2R. Hence, the total momentum
is conserved, and the center-of-mass motion is that of a free
particle. Below, we will show that, by taking the limit
M!1 , the relative Hamiltonian that describes the relative
motion of this three-body system can be reduced to the two-
body Hamiltonian on the half-line discussed in the main text.
Let us ﬁrst separate the center-of-mass Hamiltonian from
Eq.(B1) and identify the relative Hamiltonian. To this end,
it is convenient to introduce the Jacobi coordinates
ðy1;y2;y3Þas follows:
y1¼z1/C0z2; (B2a)
y2¼z1þz2
2/C0z3; (B2b)
y3¼mz1þmz2þMz3
2mþM: (B2c)
Physically, y1is the relative coordinate for the identical bosons,
y2is the relative coordinate for the center-of-mass of the identi-
cal bosons and the heavy particle, and y3is the center-of-mass
coordinate for the three particles. A main advantage in this coor-
dinate system is the following equality:

is much heavier than the identical bosons, m=M/C281. In the

This Hamiltonian describes the relative motion of the three-
body system in the center-of-mass frame and in the M!1
limit. Notice that y3!z3asM!1 so that the inﬁnitelyheavy third particle remains at the origin in the center-of-
mass frame. In this limit, the three-body system is described
by the two-body Hamiltonian (B8).
Finally, let us consider the conﬁnement of the identical
bosons on the half-line Rþby specifying U. One way to
achieve this is to choose U(x)¼0 for x>0 and UðxÞ¼1
forx<0. An alternative way is to use the strong-coupling
limit of the following d-function potential:
UðxÞ¼/C22h2
mcdðxÞ; (B9)
where cis a coupling constant. As discussed in Sec. III A,
Uðx1Þis equivalent to the following connection conditions
for the two-body wavefunction wðx1;x2Þ:
/C0@w
@x1ð0þ;x2Þþ@w
@x1ð0/C0;x2Þ
þcwð0þ;x2Þþwð0/C0;x2Þ ðÞ ¼ 0; (B10a)
wð0þ;x2Þ¼wð0/C0;x2Þ; (B10b)
where x26¼0. In the strong-coupling limit c!1 , Eq.
(B10a) reduces to wð0þ;x2Þþwð0/C0;x2Þ¼0, which,
together with Eq. (B10b) , leads to the Dirichlet boundary
condition wð0þ;x2Þ¼wð0/C0;x2Þ¼0 that corresponds to
Hðp=4Þ¼0 in Eq. (15). Similarly, for Uðx2Þ, one can obtain
wðx1;0þÞ¼wðx1;0/C0Þ¼0(x16¼0) that corresponds to
Hð/C0p=4Þ¼0. Notice that, under the Dirichlet boundary
conditions, the two regions x>0 and x<0 are physically
disconnected because the probability current density van-
ishes at x¼0, and hence, there is no probability current ﬂow
across the origin. Alternatively, one can say that particlescannot penetrate through the origin because the transmission
amplitude for the d-function potential vanishes in the strong-
coupling limit. Hence, if the identical bosons are initially onthe positive half-line R
þ, they remain on this region forever.
This is the two-body problem on the half-line discussed in
the main text. Note that the effective two-body Hamiltonian
(B8) is no longer invariant under the translation

34For fermions, we have wðx1;x2Þ¼/C0 wðx2;x1Þ, which is equivalent to

reduced to the Dirichlet boundary conditions Hð06Þ¼0, in which case k
cannot be negative (if we impose Hð6p=4Þ¼0). Hence, for fermions, the
Eﬁmov effect cannot be realized with the Hamiltonian (1). In order to real-ize the Eﬁmov effect for fermions with a pairwise contact interaction, one
has to use the Hamiltonian H¼/C0 ð /C22h

40Once given the relation Skðenp=/C23kÞ¼SkðkÞfor any n2Z, we can say that
the reﬂection amplitude is of the form SkðkÞ¼fkðlogkÞ, where fkis a
periodic function with the period p=/C23. In general, in scattering problems,
discrete scale invariance manifests itself in a periodic oscillation of the
S-matrix as a function of log k. For more details, see Ref. 22.
41Without any loss of generality, the angular wavefunction Hkcan be cho-
sen to be real for any k2fk0;k1;…g.
