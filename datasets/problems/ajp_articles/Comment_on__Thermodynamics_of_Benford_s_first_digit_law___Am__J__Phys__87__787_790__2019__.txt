Benford’s ﬁrst digit law states that the ﬁrst digit of any set of
random numbers is most likely to be 1. Speciﬁcally, the proba-
bility of the ﬁrst digit being dis logð1þð1=dÞÞwith
d¼1;2;…;9. In a recent paper, Don Lemons introduced an
ingenious way to relate Benford’s law to thermodynamics.1He
likened a large number Nto a thermal system that can be parti-
tioned into Ismaller subsystems, each having a number ini,
such that N¼PI
i¼1ini.I feis a quantum of energy, Nerepre-
sents the total energy of the system. For a ﬁxed N,t h es y s t e mi s
closed, and the partition of Ncorresponds to the distribution of
energy among the subsystems. Different partitions, therefore,amount to ﬂuctuating energies for each subsystem. This can be
viewed as the consequence of the free exchange of energy
among subsystems through thermal contact. The number of all
possible partitions of Ncorresponds to the number of all accessi-
ble microstates, X
I;N, which deﬁnes the entropy S¼kBlnXI;N
of this closed system. Lemons then derived the entropy Susing
the so-called “high-dimensionality argument,”2namely, for
I/C291:S¼kBlne2NðÞ =I2/C0/C1I. The “Benford distribution” was
ﬁnally obtained as
ihnii¼N=I (1)
as a direct consequence of equilibrium among subsystems.
Here,hniirepresents the equilibrium number of subsystem i.
It should be pointed out that the average bracket is needed
here because, in the thermodynamic limit, the subsystemswill most likely take their average values, by virtue of the
central limit theorem.
When I use this example in my thermodynamics class, the
students ﬁnd it both inspiring and confusing. The introduc-tion of the analogy with a thermal system deepens their
understanding of what a closed system is and helps me con-
vey two fundamental thermodynamic concepts: temperature
and entropy. However, the derivation of the entropy Sproves
to be a big challenge for undergraduates. Therefore, follow-ing the ideas of Lemons, I will show that the Benford distri-
bution could be derived using a simple physical model
without invoking the high-dimensionality argument.
We may regard each subsystem ias a single radiation
mode. iethen corresponds to the unit energy or photon
energy of radiation mode i, andhn

which recovers the Benford distribution. This also expresses
the equipartition principle of classical statistical mechanics,where each radiation mode has equal thermal energy k

hniii¼N=I. Since kBT/C29e, we notice that N/C29I. This is
reasonable because the key property of the Benford distribu-tion is scale invariance.4Since eis our arbitrary unit of
energy, it could be taken as small as we want, so that N
would then go to inﬁnity. Meanwhile, in the thermodynamic
limit, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of
photon number in each mode becomes peaked around hnii.
Since the average photon number of each mode is deter-mined by the Benford distribution, the uncertainty in the sys-tem or the system’s entropy can be calculated by summingcontributions from each mode. Mode ihas a photon
distribution,

where Stirling’s approximation I!/C25ðI=eÞIis used in the last
step. In Ref. 1, this entropy is obtained by counting all the
possible microstates, which correspond to the microcanoni-cal ensemble method for a closed system. Here, by introduc-
ing the concept of temperature, we use the grand canonical
ensemble for an open system, which is much simpler. In thethermodynamic limit, these two ensembles are equivalent.
Finally, we would like to comment on our choice of the
radiation mode, or Bose–Einstein statistics (with chemicalpotential l¼0), to derive the Benford law. This may seem

like a natural but arbitrary choice, but it is actually the only
valid one. Indeed, the Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac popu-lation of an energy level eare given by
f

with “þ” for the Fermi–Dirac and “–” for the Bose–Einstein
distributions. If eðe/C0lÞ=kBT/C291, the 61 term can be
neglected, and f6ðeÞreduces to the Boltzmann distribution,
fðeÞ¼e/C0ðe/C0lÞ=kBT/C281, which means negligible level occu-
pation. As long as the occupation with two or more particlesis highly improbable, a harmonic oscillator reduces to a twolevel system (occupied or empty), which can, in turn, bedescribed by the Fermi–Dirac distribution. However, in our
case, each harmonic oscillator mode has high occupationnumber, hn
ii/C29 1. Therefore, we cannot use the Fermi–Dirac
or the Boltzmann statistics to get the Benford law.
