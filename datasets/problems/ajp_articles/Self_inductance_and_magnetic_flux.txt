I. INTRODUCTION
Self-inductance is typically calculated in reference to the
total current Iof some circuital conﬁguration and to the mag-
netic ﬂux Uthrough a relevant surface that the current
bounds
L¼U
I: (1)
Generally, the current may be ﬁlamentary (i.e., it follows a
singular contour) or distributed over a surface or in a vol-ume. The magnetic ﬂux through an area d~r,
dU¼~B~rðÞ/C1d~r; (2)
involves the magnetic ﬁeld that is created by the current distri-
bution. The simplest, in principle , application of Eq. (1)is that
of a single circular current loop (see Appendix A ). In cases in
which the current is not ﬁlamentary, but rather is distributedacross a surface or within a volume, the surface of integration
associated with the application of Eq. (1)becomes unclear, espe-
cially to students ﬁrst introduced to magnetostatics. The simplestexample of this case is the solenoid, but it is nearly alwaystreated as a ﬁlamentary current bounding an effective area sothat Eq. (1)is readily applicable (see Sec. III). In David
Grifﬁths’s textbook, Introduction to Electrodynamics ,h es t a t e s
that in cases in which current is not conﬁned to a single path, “itcan be very tricky to get the inductance” from Eq. (1).
1General
physics textbooks never address this matter (for example, Refs.
2–4), nor do other undergraduate textbooks (for example, Refs.
5–7). Even advanced physics textbooks on electrodynamics are
silent on the matter (for example, Ref. 8). It is curious that a
more versatile version of Eq. (1)exists but is never presented in
any of the references cited.
In the pedagogical literature on inductance, one ﬁnds
references to “ﬂux linkage” or “ﬂux weighting” but no elabo-
ration on these (see, for example, Refs. 9and10, and Ref.
11). The idea is assumed to be common knowledge and
appears to be familiar to the electrical engineering commu-
nity. We shall see that the more versatile version of Eq. (1),
derived in Sec. II, will show that Uis indeed a weighted ﬂux.
This version of the equation deserves to be explained, whichthis paper attempts to do, thereby ﬁlling what appears to be asmall void in the physics literature. This version should clar-
ify the approach to anyself-inductance problem encountered
by students exposed to calculus-level electromagnetism andintent on using the ﬂux method.Let us begin by pointing out that parts, or segments, of a
complete circuit, such as the wire we will consider in Sec. II,
have well-deﬁned partial inductances despite there not being
an explicit current loop. Given any current loop, let ~Abe the
magnetic vector potential so that
~B¼r/C2 ~A: (3)
The ﬂux in Eq. (1)can, therefore, be expressed as
U¼þ
~A/C1d~‘; (4)
and one can then deﬁne the partial inductance of any seg-
ment, for example, the straight (ﬁlamentary) segment
depicted in Fig. 1,t ob e
L
partial¼1
Ið
~A0/C1d~‘; (5)
where the integral is taken along the length of the segment
and~A0is the vector potential of only that segment. Note that
the sum of the partial inductances is notthe loop inductance
as there are partial mutual inductances (between that seg-
ment and other parts of the current loop) that contribute to
this. If we wish to return to Eq. (1)and calculate the partial
inductance via a ﬂux through a loop, we can create an inte-
gration path that includes the segment, as long as the lineintegral over the additional path is zero. For example, given
an (albeit unphysical) isolated linear conductor carrying a
current I, the partial inductance can be calculated by integrat-
ing~A0/C1d~‘around the clockwise rectangular path depicted in
the ﬁgure. This closed path is taken to extend to inﬁnity on
the right so that A0!0 on the right leg of the path. Also, the
vector potential is perpendicular to the horizontal (dashed)
segments in the ﬁgure so ~A0/C1d~‘¼0 on the top and bottom
legs. Application of Eq. (1)to this area will, therefore, yield
Lpartial for the linear conductor. A more detailed exposition
of partial inductance can be found in Ref. 12.
When calculating a ﬂux in cases of distributed currents,
such as the linear conductor considered in Sec. II, there will
be a part of the ﬂux area that overlaps the conductor and apart that does not. The inductance calculation can then be
split into the contribution from the overlap, referred to as the
internal inductance, and that from the non-overlap region,called the external inductance.
In Sec. II, we will derive the versatile version of Eq. (1)
and apply it to calculate the self-inductances of a straight

wire, of a solenoid (Sec. III), of a ribbon (Sec. IV), and of an
annular current (Sec. V).
II. GENERAL EQUATION FOR SELF-INDUCTANCE
To derive the more general form of Eq. (1), we start with
the magnetic ﬁeld energy

where dsis the volume element, aris shorthand for “all
space,” and Iis the total current of the circuital conﬁgura-
tion that creates the magnetic ﬁeld ~B. Equation (6)could be
solved to ﬁnd the self-inductance of the circuit. The basisfor the following derivation can be found, for example, inRef. 1. If one considers a spherical surface with a radius
r!1 enclosing the current distribution, the following sur-
face integral ( d~ris the surface element) vanishes in this
limit, since A!1=r;B!1=r
2, and the surface area
increases as r2,

where @Vis the (closed) boundary of the volume. By
Gauss’s theorem,
ðð/C14~A/C2~BðÞ /C1d~r¼ððð
r/C1 ~A/C2~BðÞ ds: (8)
As long as the integration is over all space, Eq. (6)can be
written as

Mathematically, using Ampere’s law
~B2/C0r/C1 ~A/C2~BðÞ ¼~A/C1r /C2 ~BðÞ ¼l0~A/C1~J: (10)
Consequently,

The volume current density can be expressed as ﬁlamen-
tary differential sub-currents,
~J~rðÞds¼^nJd a ?d‘¼dId~‘; (12)where ^nis the unit vector in the direction of current ﬂow and
da?is the area perpendicular to ^nof the volume element ds

where Eq. (14) follows from Eq. (13) by Stokes’s theorem.
Note that @Ris the (closed) boundary contour for dI; the cur-
rent element dIﬂows around this contour @R, which bounds
the ﬂux surface R(Fig. 2). So if we deﬁne

Eq.(1)is, in fact, the weighted integral

For cases in which the current is conﬁned to a single ﬁla-
mentary path, Eq. (18) reduces to its standard form,
Eq.(1).
To illustrate a naive use of Eq. (1)that results in an incor-
rect result, let us consider the case of a straight cylindricalconductor of radius Rand length ‘. We assume that the cur-
rent is uniformly distributed over the circular cross section.From Ampere’s law, the magnetic ﬁeld inside the cylinder at
a distance rfrom the central axis is

where ^/is the azimuthal unit vector in cylindrical coordi-
nates. The student presented with the problem of ﬁnding theinternal magnetic ﬁeld’s contribution to the inductancewould likely identify the rectangular area, ABCD (shown in
Fig. 3(a) with a representative gray differential strip dr), as
the relevant total area over which the magnetic ﬂux should
be calculated, which is correct. Indeed, Grifﬁths points outthat the return current can be assumed to follow along thesurface (i.e., from BtoCin the ﬁgure) just beyond a thin

insulating sheath.13However, a straightforward (albeit
naive) calculation using Eq. (1)yields Lint¼l0‘=4p, which
is wrong by a factor of two.
This problem is solved correctly in Ref. 11. Rosa calcu-
lates separately the contributions to the self-inductance dueto the internal ﬁeld of the wire and to the external ﬁeldusing magnetic ﬂuxes. To determine the internal contribu-tion (which is speciﬁcally the part we are considering here),
he calculates a weighted ﬂux (without explanation), which
yields the correct answer. He conﬁrms the result by com-paring it with that coming from Eq. (6). Grifﬁths explicitly
espouses this energy method when a current is not conﬁnedto a single path. However, the volume integral in Eq. (6)
may be intractable in many cases, such as in the case of acircular current loop, so that it is useful to have a version ofEq.(1)that removes any confusion when calculating ﬂuxes
in the presence of surface or volume current distributions.We point out that implicit in Grifﬁths (by using Eq. (11))i s
also the option to work with the more primal vector poten-tial~Arather than the energy or the ﬂux.
Let us now reconsider the self-inductance of the wire due
to the internal ﬁeld using Eq. (18). Figure 3(b) shows a repre-
sentative ﬁlamentary current element dIðr;/Þ,

As a singular (linear) current, the relevant area of integration
is the loop, A0BCD0(i.e.,a rectangle within the conductor
with the current as one side). This follows from the discus-sion on partial internal inductance in the Introduction. Theﬂux through this area isU

Although the calculation of the self-inductance contribution
due to the external ﬁeld does not present any problems usingEq.(1)since its determination involves, in effect, a ﬁlamen-
tary current, we include it for completeness in Appendix B .
III. SELF-INDUCTANCE OF A SOLENOID
We now consider the simple case of the solenoid ( Fig. 4 ).
The solenoid is the most common example of the use of Eq.(1)in calculating self-inductance. Students generally have
no difﬁculty in determining that the cross section Aof the
solenoid is the surface through which the ﬂux has to be cal-culated. However, they are often confused by how this sur-
face changes with the ﬁnite length ‘or the number of
windings N. In fact, the total area per axial length ‘is that of
Ndisks, or that of a spiral surface of Nlevels so that the total
surface to be considered for the ﬂux calculation is A
tot¼NA.
If the solenoid were inﬁnite, the magnetic ﬁeld is then con-stant ( B¼l
0NI=‘), the ﬂux is simply U¼BAtot, and the
self-inductance per unit length NBA=I‘¼l0ðN=‘Þ2A.
The calculation is also easily handled with Eq. (18) by
denoting the effective surface current density K¼NI=‘.
Taking the axial coordinate to be z,dI¼Kdz. The ﬂux contour
is a circle whose disk surface area is Aand the associated ﬂux
UR¼BA. The self-inductance for a solenoid of length ‘is

where the ﬁnal equality assumes that the magnetic ﬁeld is
the same as for the inﬁnite solenoid.
IV. SELF-INDUCTANCE OF A RIBBON
We now illustrate a case in which the ﬂux method is better
suited than the energy method to determine an inductance.
Consider a long ribbon of length ‘and width w/C28‘with
uniform surface current density K¼I=w. We seek the inter-
nal inductance, i.e., that part of the partial inductance due
solely to the magnetic ﬁeld within the conductor (as in thecase of the linear conductor in Sec. II). This inductance com-
ponent involves no volume, so the energy method would not
be obviously viable. One proceeds with the ﬂux method bydetermining the magnetic ﬁeld along s, the direction perpen-
dicular to the ribbon length, with s¼0 at one edge (the left
side of the ribbon in Fig. 5). Since the differential current
elements dI¼Kdsare singular straight currents with well-
known magnetic ﬁeld, an application of the superposition
principle yieldsFig. 3. (a) A long straight conductor of radius R, length ‘, and through which
ﬂows a current I. (b) The same conductor with representative current ele-
ment dIidentiﬁed.

where eregularizes the inﬁnity at the edges. There is obvi-
ously a symmetry about the central line of the ribbon. Eachcurrent element is part of an inﬁnite rectangular contourwhose area is hatched in the ﬁgure for a give dI(in gray).
The contour extends beyond the ribbon (i.e., s>w; recall
again the discussion on partial and internal/external induc-
tance in the Introduction), but we are only considering the
internal inductance now. The contour can be extended eitherto the right (as we are doing) or equivalently to the left. Nextwe calculate the ﬂux for this area

V. THE ANNULUS
As a non-trivial application of Eq. (18), we outline the cal-
culation of the self-inductance of a 2D annulus (or washer).Since an annulus is a ﬂattened hollow cylinder, the ideaemployed in the solenoid case also applies. Although in theannulus case, the magnetic ﬁeld resulting from the currentdistribution will be far more complicated than the constantone of the inﬁnite solenoid. In Fig. 7, a uniform surface cur-
rent,K, ﬂows in a circular pattern forming an annulus of cur-
rent with inner radius, a, and outer radius, b. If one takes the
annulus to be a ﬂat spiral coil, as in an RFID tag antenna, for
example, one can express the surface current density asK¼NI=ðb/C0aÞ. Naively trying to apply Eq. (1), a student
may be confused as to which ﬂux Ushould be used. The
alternative is Eq. (6), but this would require knowledge of
the magnetic ﬁeld in all space and would involve a volumeintegral that is certainly daunting, if not altogether unfeasi-ble. As in the ribbon case of Sec. IV, the ﬂux method is like-
wise preferable, as it requires only the knowledge of themagnetic ﬁeld in the plane of the annulus (as is the case forthe circular current; see Appendix A ). Moreover, Eq. (18)
removes the ambiguity in approaching this case using theﬂux method.
In Fig. 7, a representative circular current element within
the annulus is identiﬁed, of radius rand current dI¼Kdr.
The self-inductance then follows from Eq. (18) asFig. 5. (a) A surface current forming a long ribbon of width w. (b) A head-
on view.

aURrðÞKdrðÞ ; (35)
where URðrÞis the magnetic ﬂux through a disk of radius, r,
due to the annular current (see the end of Appendix A for
more details). The determination of this ﬂux and its integra-tion in Eq. (35) is now the crux of the matter and beyond the
scope of this paper. The work on the circular current loop of
Appendix A can serve as a basis for this calculation since it
lays out how to calculate the ﬂux contributions from the (sin-
gular) sub-currents of the annulus. Although it avoids the
complications of the ﬁeld energy method, the calculation,using the ﬂux method at least, is anything but trivial.
Reference 9presents an alternate method for calculating
self-inductance based on the relationship between power andcurrent rather than ﬂux and current, and perhaps represents a
more efﬁcient method in this case.
VI. CONCLUSION
Although self-inductance can be calculated via various
methods, including using the magnetic ﬁeld energy or the
magnetic vector potential, students in introductory magneto-statics are often asked to derive it via magnetic ﬂuxes. From
this perspective, we believe it is well worth presenting Eq.
(18), although it is absent from the more common textbooks
on electromagnetism. By recasting Eq. (1)in the more
explicit, or versatile, form of Eq. (18), instructors will pro-
vide students with a more valuable tool in general and aninvaluable tool in problems without a ﬁlamentary current.

APPENDIX A: THE CIRCULAR CURRENT
For completeness, in this appendix, we calculate the self-
inductance of a circular current of radius R(Fig. 8), where
there is no conceptual problem in using Eq. (1). The mag-
netic ﬂux of the circular current loop through its bounded
area is ﬁrst calculated. To do so, the magnetic ﬁeld at a pointlocated at ~r, due to the circular current, is calculated using
the Biot–Savart law. Without loss of generality, ~r¼r^x, then~r

APPENDIX B: THE LINEAR CONDUCTOR’S
EXTERNAL FIELD SELF-INDUCTANCE
We complete the case of the wire, or linear conductor, by
calculating the (partial) self-inductance contribution due to
the external ﬁeld. We assume the conductor to have a length
‘and a radius R/C28‘. To calculate the ﬂux, we start by calcu-
lating the magnetic ﬁeld at point Pexternal to the conductor
due to a uniform current Iﬂowing along the wire. The posi-
tionPis deﬁned by parameters sandzor by z0,rand the
angle h. These quantities are deﬁned in Fig. 9. Since Pliesoutside of the conductor, the magnetic ﬁeld created by the
wire is identical to the one created by a line current running
down the center of the cylinder. Using the Biot–Savart law,
the contribution from each Id~z0(where both the zandz0axes
run positive upwards in Fig. 9) is azimuthal (i.e., directed
into the page at Pin the ﬁgure) so

As discussed in the Introduction, the area to consider for the
external partial inductance in the case of a linear conductor
is a rectangular one, in this case, of height ‘, and extending
horizontally from the surface of the conductor to inﬁnity. A
representative element of this area is shown in gray in Fig. 9.
The differential ﬂux is then integrated over this area to give
