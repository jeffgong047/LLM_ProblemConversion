the buttered side down has been considered by philosophers andphysicists, and it was even the subject of the 1996 Ig Nobel
Prize in Physics. This Back-of-the Envelope paper presents a
solution and shows how dimensionless equations can yieldinsight into the conditions that result in the unfortunate outcome.
Space pirates: A pursuit curve problem involving
retarded time
Thales Azevedo and Anderson Pelluso
90(10), p. 730
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0069298Our students normally encounter the concept of retarded
time in the treatment of the production of electromagnetic
radiation. As the authors discuss, the phenomenon arises also
in the context of a chase, where it can be dealt with byemploying straightforward integration coupled with interpo-
lation using elementary Mathematica. This approach can
function as a simpler introduction to the topic.
Exploring entropy by counting microstates of the p-state
paramagnet
Steuard Jensen
90(10), p. 736
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0061383Students already have intuitive experience with most intro-
ductory physics concepts like energy, pressure, inertia, or
weight. Entropy is a notoriously difﬁcult concept to teachbecause, while students can quickly grasp the arrow of time,
this intuitive concept lacks an obvious connection to entropy’s
quantitative deﬁnition. Moore and Schroeder proposed thatintroductory students learn about temperature, entropy, and the
second law by explicitly counting states at ﬁxed energy and cal-
culating thermodynamic quantities. This paper greatly expandsthe number of models available for such exercises that upper-
level students can use to develop more in-depth understanding.
Astronomy with Chaucer: Using an astrolabe
to determine planetary orbits
Michael Robinson

https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0097302
Antique instruments can have tremendous pedagogical
value. One such device is the astrolabe, which goes back tothe time of Hipparchus in about 200 BC. By making sightings
of the elevation angles of the Sun, stars, and visible planets,
this handheld device can help you determine the time, compassdirections, the season, your latitude and longitude, and, in con-junction with Kepler’s laws, the orbits of planets. This paperprovides links to plans for astrolabes that can be prepared with
a 3D printer and offers suggestions for class observations and
data-analysis assignments. Appropriate for students in astron-omy classes at a variety of levels.
Stereographic projection to and from the Bloch sphere:
Visualizing solutions of the Bloch equations and the
Bloch-Riccati equation
David J. Siminovitch
90(10), p. 755
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0088987Stereographic projection is an elegant analysis technique
that receives little attention in undergraduate physics. The
author shows that, when it is applied to nuclear magnetic res-
onance (NMR), it can signiﬁcantly aid in the visualizationof solutions. And I hope readers will take note of the factthat the astrolabe described in the previous paper also usesstereographic projection!
Green’s functions in quantum mechanics courses
William J. Herrera, Herbert Vinck-Posada, and Shirley
G/C19omez P /C19aez
90(10), p. 763
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0065733Green’s functions are a mainstay of advanced quantum
mechanics, ﬁeld theory, and condensed matter computations,
but they are frequently omitted from the undergraduate cur-
riculum. This manuscript presents applications of Green’sfunctions to basic quantum mechanics problems, cleanlydemonstrating their deep relationship with energy eigenval-ues and the density of states as well as their application in
perturbation theory. Instructors of quantum mechanics may
ﬁnd their next challenge problem or student project topicwithin.
Efimov effect for two particles on a semi-infinite line
Satoshi Ohya
90(10), p. 770
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0086802The Eﬁmov effect is a counter-intuitive effect that appears
in many-body quantum systems: when the interactionbetween two particles is too small to allow pairs to form,many-body bound states appear in which the energies followa geometric sequence. In other words, a third particle has to
come into play for the pair to remain together. It turns out
that this is a consequence of the breakdown of continuousscale invariance to discrete scale invariance: A system that

was initially invariant with respect to any given change in
size suddenly becomes invariant only for ﬁxed values ofchanges in size when the two-particle interaction weakens.The Eﬁmov effect, far from being a theoretical speculation,has been observed in ultra-cold atomic systems and in liquidhelium. This paper proposes a toy model to introduce thisphenomenon to students with minimum formalism, andcould be used as an interesting exercise for an advancedquantum mechanics course.
Waving arms around to teach quantum mechanics
Kelby T. Hahn and Elizabeth Gire
90(10), p. 778
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0073946Building a representation of quantum states is notoriously
difﬁcult for students starting quantum mechanics. This articlecan help you with this. It explains how students can imperson-ate quantum spin eigenstates with their arm, gaining a deeperphysical understanding of relative phases, decomposition in aneigenstate basis, and the time-evolution of quantum states.This paper is guaranteed to bring more fun to your introductoryquantum mechanics class and can also be adapted for teachingcomplex numbers.
Maxwell’s color box: Retracing the path of color
matching experiments
Valentina Roberti, Boris Kalinic, Tiziana Cesca, Luca
Bacci, and Giulio Peruzzi
90(10), p. 787
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0087786We all think of James Clerk Maxwell as a consummate
theoretical physicist. True, but lesser-known is that he was
also an accomplished experimentalist. In the 1850s and1860s, Maxwell developed a spectroscopic device that he
dubbed a “color box,” which permitted an observer to com-pare a mixture of three adjustable spectral colors to whitelight. By establishing three primary colors (red, green, andblue), Maxwell built up expressions for how two primariesplus a chosen third color had to be mixed in intensity toreproduce white. This led to the development of a color tri-angle diagram, which laid the foundations for chromaticityand color-vision studies. This paper describes Maxwell’sinstrument and the construction of a replica made with mod-ern equipment. Experiments give results in excellent agree-ment with those published by Maxwell. Constructing andusing such a device could be a semester project for advancedoptics students. A video abstract accompanies the online ver-sion of this paper.
A z-axis tunneling microscope for undergraduate labs
Randy Lindgren, Wesley Kozan, Noah Fuerst, Douglas
Knapp, and Joshua P. Veazey
90(10), p. 795
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0094028A simpliﬁed alternative to the scanning tunneling micro-
scope is presented. This affordable experimental setup, whichlimits tip motion to the vertical axis alone, facilitates quantita-tive measurements of electron quantum tunneling and theelectronic density of states of various materials. Using thisapparatus, acquisition and analysis of tunneling current versustip height data are demonstrated on gold and graphite sam-ples. In addition, tunneling current versus bias voltage dataare shown to display the qualitative differences in the elec-tronic density of states for these two materials. The workdescribed here offers an accessible project to study quantumtunneling and basic electronic band structure for the under-
graduate instructional laboratory.
