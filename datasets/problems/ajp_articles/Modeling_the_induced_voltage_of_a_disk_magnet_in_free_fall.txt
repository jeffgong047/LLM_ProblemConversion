We drop a circular disk magnet through a thin coil of wire, record the induced voltage, and
compare the results to an analytic model based on the dipole approximation and Faraday’s law,
which predicts that the difference between the voltage peak magnitudes corresponding to the entryand exit of the magnet should be in proportion to z
/C01=2
0, where z0is the initial height of the magnet
above the center of the coil. Agreement between the model and experimental data is excellent. This
easily reproduced experiment provides an opportunity for students at a range of levels toquantitatively explore the effects of magnetic induction.

I. INTRODUCTION
Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction is fundamental
to any introductory physics sequence. While it is straightfor-
ward to demonstrate qualitatively, providing students with a
quantitative experiment is more challenging. A common
approach is to drop a magnet through a conducting loop and
measure consequences of that relative motion. These experi-
ments tend to fall into two basic categories: (i) inducing
resistive magnetic forces via eddy currents1–5and (ii) induc-
ing a voltage signal that is visualized in real time using com-
puter acquisition software.6–10In this paper, we follow the
second group and describe an experiment where students
drop a circular disk magnet through an induction coil and
relate the resulting peak voltage values to the drop height of
the magnet. Such an approach presents a good mix of intui-
tion gained from introductory mechanics and electromag-
netic phenomena. The recent paper of Gadre et al. describes
an experiment similar to that which we describe here, but
our analysis is more thorough and explicitly compares exper-
imental results to theoretical predictions.10While some of
the details provided here are outside the scope of an intro-
ductory level course, they would be accessible to upper-level
students and are critical to the discussion contained herein.
II. FREE-FALLING MAGNET
In this section, we provide an analytic model for the
induced voltage signal produced by a disk magnet falling
freely through an open coil of radius Rcand negligible thick-
ness. As shown in Fig. 1, the starting height of the magnet z0
is deﬁned as the distance from the mid-point of the coil to
the mid-point of the magnet, which is assumed to fall freely
through the center of the coil along the z-axis. We ignore air
drag as well as any resistive magnetic forces that act on the
magnet from the coil.
A. Modeling the disk magnet
We assume that a circular disk magnet can be modeled as
an ideal N-turn circular loop of current I, with dimensions
equal to that of the magnet, save for the thickness, which
we assume to be negligible. As the magnet falls along the
z-axis through the induction coil, only the z-component of
the magnetic ﬁeld will contribute to the ﬂux, thus to the
induced voltage. Therefore, we only need to concernourselves with the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld,
which can be found using the Biot–Savart law and the stan-dard dipole approximation,11

B. Modeling the voltage signal
For a magnet that is moving, z/C17zðtÞ, and so Eq. (2)
becomes a function of time where the ﬂux increases as themagnet approaches the coil, reaches a maximum when it isat the center of the coil, and then decreases as it exits thecoil. The resulting voltage signal in the coil is found fromFaraday’s law of induction and the chain rule to be

where vis the speed of the moving magnet. When the speed
is constant, Eq. (3)is an anti-symmetric function: the two
voltage peaks occur at zp;1¼þRc=2 and zp;2¼/C0Rc=2(z¼0
at the center of the coil), and the peaks are equal in value butopposite in polarity. This was extensively veriﬁed inKingman et al.
7
For an accelerating magnet, Eq. (3)is no longer exactly
anti-symmetric. Since the speed of the magnet is higher as itexits the coil than when it enters, we should expect the laterpeak voltage jV
p;2jto be larger than the earlier one jVp;1j.
Furthermore, the voltage peaks do not occur exactly at

zp;i¼6Rc=2; however, the shifts away from these points
are small enough to ignore (see the Appendix ).
Since measuring the instantaneous speed of an accelerat-
ing (free falling) magnet is difﬁcult, we instead seek a rela-
tionship between the initial height of the magnet z0and the
measured peak voltages Vp;iof the signal. For a magnet in
free fall, its speed at any position zis related to the drop
height z0through kinematics: v¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

this into Eq. (3)and assuming the peak voltages Vp;ioccur at

If we further assume that the peak positions occur approxi-
mately at zp;1¼þRc=2 and zp;2¼/C0Rc=2 and let the drop
height be much larger than these positions (i.e., z0/C29Rc=2),
we can expand the square root and ﬁnd

of the two peaks asymptotically approaches zero withincreasing drop height,

applying the binomial expansion, a more qualitative argu-
ment for the z/C01=2

students by noting that the difference in the peak voltage val-ues is proportional to the difference in the correspondingspeed values, i.e., DV
p/Dv. Here, Dv¼gDt, where Dtis
the time between the peaks. If the drop height is sufﬁciently
large, then Dtwill be much smaller than the total drop time,
and so the magnet’s change in speed will be minimal duringthisDtinterval. Approximating the speed as an average
value during this time yields Dv¼gDy=v

vertical distance traveled during Dtand vave/C25ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ2gz0p, which
is the magnet’s speed at the center of the coil. Thus, we
arrive at DV/z/C01=2

experimentally.
III. EXPERIMENT
A disk magnet of radius R¼0.953 cm and thickness
t¼0.318 cm was taped to a plastic ruler to facilitate consis-
tent dropping through a Nc¼500-turn coil of copper wire
wrapped around a piece of ABS plastic piping. The coil, ofaverage radius R
c¼4:83 cm and thickness h¼2.42 cm, was
set on two blocks of wood and elevated by two jack stands;foam padding was set beneath the coil to protect the magnet
as it fell, and a meter stick was stationed inside the coil to
measure the drop height; see Fig. 2. While it might not be
obvious that the dipole approximation should apply here,given the relative dimensions of the magnet and the coil, wewill see below that it does yield a very good ﬁt with theexperimental data.
To determine the k-value of the disk magnet, a FW Bell
model 4048 Gauss/Tesla meter ( 62% tolerance) was used to
measure the magnetic ﬁeld B
zalong the main axis from 4.0 to
10.5 cm in 0.5 cm intervals. We plotted Bzvs.ðR2þz2Þ/C03=2
and found k¼0.004 25 T /C1m from the slope of the linear
ﬁt.12This corresponds to a magnetic dipole moment of
m¼0.965 A /C1m2.
A. Data acquisition
The voltage measurements were made with a Pasco 750
Computer Interface in conjunction with the Pasco Capstonesoftware. As the magnet fell through the main axis of thecoil, the software displayed the induced voltage signal as afunction of time; a 2000 Hz sampling rate was used for every
trial. The starting height of the magnet was varied from 1.0
to 5.0 cm in 1.0 cm intervals, and then 5.0 to 45 cm in 2.5 cmintervals. All values are measured from the center of the coilz¼0. For each starting height, the magnet was dropped ﬁve
times and the two peak voltages were recorded for everytrial; all results are, thus, presented as an average (data point)
and an uncertainty (error bars).
B. Results
In Fig. 3, we plot the experimental peak voltage values
against the drop height, along with the theoretical predictionsgiven by Eqs. (5)and(6). The uncertainties are given by the
sample standard deviation of the mean of the measurements,while the theoretical curves were obtained directly from Eqs.
(5)and(6), along with the experimental parameters deﬁned
earlier. We ﬁnd very good agreement between the experi-mental data and the theoretical models for drop heights
Fig. 1. Magnet-coil geometry. The magnet and coil share a common z-axis;
z¼0 corresponds to the center of the induction coil, and z¼z0is the starting
height of the magnet.

greater than Rc=2–2.4 cm, which was an assumed condition
in the derivation of Eqs. (5)and(6). We mark the position
z0¼Rc=2 explicitly in Figs. 3and4and note that the model
begins to break down for drop heights less than this value.
The upper limit of the dataset was mainly a practical one:
consistently dropping the magnet through the center of the
induction coil became too difﬁcult for drop heights largerthan/C2445 cm. While drag effects could also begin to manifest
at larger drop heights, we show later that these effects are
minimal for the magnet used in this experiment.
As mentioned earlier, the z/C01=2
0-dependence is key to accu-
rately modeling the peak voltage magnitudes. We demon-strate this explicitly in Fig. 4by plotting the difference
between the peak voltages against the drop height. The
uncertainties are found via propagation of the error values
given in Fig. 3. We again ﬁnd the theoretical curve by apply-
ing the relevant experimental parameters directly to Eq. (7)and ﬁnd very good agreement for all drop heights larger than
2.4 cm.
Finally, if we deﬁne Eq. (3)explicitly as a function of
time by letting zðtÞ¼z

the following expression which can be numerically

In Fig. 5, we match the complete theoretical line shape as
predicted by Eq. (8)to the induced voltage signal for a repre-
sentative sample run ( z0¼30 cm); the agreement between
the experimental signal and the theoretical model is

magnet is taped to a plastic ruler to allow its dipole moment to stay aligned with the coil’s symmetry axis as it falls.

net; both plots are presented as experimental data (black data points/error
bars) along with the corresponding analytic model (solid red line). The theo-
retical curves are calculated by directly applying the experimental parame-
ters to Eq. (5)(lower curve) and Eq. (6)(upper curve). The model is valid
for drop heights larger than half the radius of the induction coil Rc=2, indi-
cated by a blue dashed line. We note the agreement between the predicted
curves and the empirical data for z0>Rc=2.Fig. 4. Difference in the two voltage peaks plotted against the drop height.
The data points and error bars correspond to the experimental results, while
the solid red line corresponds to Eq. (7), with all relevant experimental
parameters applied. The model is valid for drop heights larger than half the
radius of the induction coil Rc=2, marked by a dashed blue line. The pre-
dicted z/C01=2
0-dependence is conﬁrmed, given the agreement between theory
and data for z0>Rc=2.

essentially perfect. This further validates the analytical
approach taken in Sec. II.
C. Error and limitations
For the experiment described here, the largest source of
experimental error comes from dropping the magnet by handthrough the center of the induction coil from the same heightfor any ﬁve repeated trials. Anecdotally, it was observed thatif the magnet drifted away from the symmetry axis as it fell,the voltage peaks were affected by this motion. The dataindicate that this was more of an issue at larger drop heights,where the average peak voltage values tend to skew largerthan the theoretical line shapes, in particular for the laterpeak. While numerical modeling seems to suggest that a fall-ing magnet with non-zero horizontal motion can result in alarger ﬂux change (and thus larger voltage peaks), we cannot
conclusively verify this yet. Overall, however, these effects
seem to be random, and they are small: differences betweenthe data points and the predicted curves are on the order ofmillivolts, which begins to approach the tolerance of theinstrumentation.
For larger drop heights, it is also reasonable to suspect
that air drag would begin to affect the magnet’s speed, thusaffect the voltage measurements. We modeled a quadraticdrag force on the square 2.30 /C22.30 cm
2cross section of
masking tape holding the magnet to the ruler (total mass of0.02 kg) and found that air drag accounted for a reduction ofonly 0.6% of the speed at the largest drop height used in thisexperiment.
Similarly, resistive drag effects due to the induced currents
in the coil were also minimal. Since air resistance is not asigniﬁcant factor, the magnet’s kinetic energy at the centerof the coil should be equal to its potential energy at releasemgz
0, which is 88 mJ for the largest drop height used in this
experiment. The energy lost due to inducing a current in thecoil is found by integrating the electric power over time,
U¼ð
PðtÞdt¼ð

rdt; (9)where V(t) is deﬁned in Eq. (8)andris the resistance of the
coil, measured to be 21.7 X. This calculation yields an
energy loss of 0.123 mJ for the largest drop height, roughly0.1% of the initial energy. Repeating for the smallest dropheight yielded an initial energy value of 1.96 mJ and anenergy loss of 0.0188 mJ, or about 1%.
The theoretical model hinges on two main assumptions.
One is that the drop height of the magnet is much larger thanhalf the coil radius. This allows us to deﬁne the locations ofthe voltage extrema at z
p;i¼6Rc=2 as well as to employ
the binomial expansion on the speed term in the peak voltagedeﬁnitions. This assumption also coincides with the range ofvalidity for the dipole approximation.
The second assumption is that both the magnet and the
induction coil are treated as “thin rings” of negligible thick-ness. For a cylindrical object, this approximation is gaugedby the ratio of the cylinder’s length Lto its diameter D;a s
long as this ratio is “small enough,” the approximation isvalid. Determining exactly where this approximation breaksdown depends on the details of the individual experiment,but for the objects used here, the magnet had an L:Dratio
of about 1 :6, while the induction coil had a ratio of about
1:4. Based on the results of our experiment, we conclude
that these ratios are, indeed, small enough for the models tobe considered valid. Separate numerical modeling (notshown) indicates that the thin-ring model for the inductioncoil begins to noticeably separate from the solenoid modelaround L¼D=2;which would correspond to the edges of
the coil being located at the assumed peak voltage positions
z
p;i¼6Rc=2. While this should not necessarily be consid-
ered the point at which the model breaks down, it could serveas a rough upper limit when designing the experiment.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have developed an analytic model of the
induced voltage signal produced by a disk magnet fallingfreely through a thin induction coil. The initial motivationfor this work was to develop a quantitative experiment to testFaraday’s law; however, we were pleasantly surprised at therobust opportunities for the engagement of students at vari-ous course levels that this investigation provides. All of themeasurements are easily obtained in an introductory setting,requiring materials and equipment either generally availableor easy to obtain.
While a similar but slightly more rigorous derivation of
the peak voltage values can be done in the time coordinate,
the argument presented here in the z-coordinate allows stu-
dents to make an intuitive connection between introductorykinematics and the observed voltage signals. Students can beled through a series of questions and/or asked to make theirown speculations about what they expect to see based ontheir knowledge of free fall. At the introductory level, stu-dents could then simply measure the drop height of the mag-netz
0and the two resulting voltage peak values jVp;1j
andjVp;2jand then test their predictions. It would also be
straightforward at that point to verify the z/C01=2
0-dependence
ofjVp;2j/C0jVp;1j(as in Fig. 4). Depending on the expectation
of the level of rigor for the experiment, students could alsomeasure the experimental parameters required to plot thetheoretical curve for direct comparison to the dataset.
In an upper-level course, students could be expected to
replicate some or all of the derivations contained in thispaper,
12have a stronger understanding of the model, and beFig. 5. Representative trial run ( z0¼30 cm) of experimental voltage data
(black points) and theoretical line shape (red solid line) as functions of time.
The dataset has been horizontally shifted to align with the time scale deﬁnedby the theoretical calculation ( t¼0 at release), such that it crosses the V¼0
axis at the same time t/C250:21 s as the theoretical curve. We note the excel-
lent agreement between the data and the model.

able to explore the consequences of varying different param-
eters on the resulting voltage signal. For example, magnetsof different radii or dipole moments could be used, alongwith different induction coils of varying radii or number ofturns. For comparison to the experimental voltage signals,theoretical line shapes are easily produced using any graph-ing software or numerical coding platforms. While the appli-cation of the dipole approximation makes the full modelaccessible to upper-level students, it is also conceivable thatit could be eschewed in favor of a complete elliptic integralapproach that could be investigated as part of an advancedproject; this could be done while experimenting with aninduction coil that is similar in size to the magnet.
Finally, the work included here could be extended to exam-
ine a disk magnet moving through a solenoid induction coilrather than a thin-ring coil, or a bar magnet moving through
various coil geometries. It could also be interesting to evaluate
the resulting voltage signals of a disk magnet moving with var-ied accelerations as controlled via an Atwood’s machine.
