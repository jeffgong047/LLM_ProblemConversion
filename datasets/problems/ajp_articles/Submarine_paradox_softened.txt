In Supplee’s submarine paradox, a naive argument based on Lorentz contraction leads to a
contradiction that a fast submarine should sink in the water’s reference frame but ﬂoat in thesubmarine’s reference frame. Due to the submarine’s rigidity constraints, it is not easy to resolve
the paradox in a manifestly covariant form. To simplify the problem, we consider a version of the
paradox in which one ﬂuid moves through another ﬂuid. An analysis of ideal relativistic ﬂuids in a
weak gravitational ﬁeld shows that the moving ﬂuid has a larger pressure and, hence, sinks, in
agreement with known results for the rigid submarine.

I. INTRODUCTION
Consider a submarine at rest with respect to water, having
the same density as water so that it neither sinks nor ﬂoats.What happens if the submarine attains a relativistic velocity v
in the horizontal direction? In the water’s rest frame, the sub-marine should become Lorentz contracted, so it shouldbecome denser than water and therefore sink. Yet analo-gously, in the reference frame where the submarine is at rest,it is the water that should become Lorentz contracted anddenser, so the submarine should ﬂoat. However, it is a contra-diction; whether the submarine will sink or ﬂoat cannot
depend on the observer. This puzzle, known as the submarine
paradox, was ﬁrst studied by Supplee
1and then further ana-
lyzed from various points of view in Refs. 2–4.T h e ya l l
agreed that the submarine will, in fact, sink. Physically, this isbecause buoyancy depends on Earth’s gravity, so the relevantvelocity to consider is the velocity of the submarine relative
to Earth (which is independent of the observer’s velocity).
One difﬁculty which is encountered when analyzing the
submarine paradox is the fact that the usual Lorentz contrac-tion formula L
0¼L=cis not a transformation law for a ten-
sor. In this formula, Lis the proper length, namely, the
length of object as seen by observer comoving with the
object, L0is the length seen by observer moving with veloc-
ityvrelative to the comoving observer, and
c¼1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1/C0v2p (1)
is the usual special-relativistic factor, in units where c¼1. On
the other hand, since the problem involves gravity, its propertreatment requires the use of general relativity naturally for-mulated in terms of tensors. An argument based on theLorentz contraction formula lacks manifest general covari-ance and looks rather awkward from the general-relativisticpoint of view. To our knowledge, the only manifestly covari-ant treatment of the submarine paradox is the one by Matsas.
2
However, the treatment by Matsas is quite involved, mainlybecause one needs to implement a constraint that the submar-ine is a rigid object. (In fact, even within a special-relativisticcontext, the rigidity constraint may be complicated when onestudies an object with a non-constant velocity.
5)
The motivation for this work is to ﬁnd a resolution of the
submarine paradox which, like Ref. 2, is relativistically
covariant, but at the same time involves simpler formalismthan.2Our main idea is to drop the rigidity constraint. Indeed,
if the shape of an object is changed such that its density andvolume remain the same in its own rest frame, the effect ofbuoyancy should be the same. Hence, the rigidity constraint(the constraint that the object’s shape and volume shouldremain constant in its own reference frame) seems inessential.Thus, instead of studying a rigid submarine, we study a ﬂuid,ﬁrst idealized as incompressible with a ﬁxed constant densityq, and later, more realistically, as a slightly compressible ﬂuid
like water. This signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the problem because a
manifestly covariant treatment is much simpler for ﬂuids thanfor rigid objects. We study a drop of one ﬂuid (called “ink”)of proper density q, moving horizontally through another ﬂuid
(called the “lake”) of the same proper density q. Here, the
names ink and lake are taken for the sake of intuitive visuali-zation. (To avoid diffusion of one ﬂuid into another, in a real-istic experiment one might want to deal with ﬂuids at atemperature close to absolute zero, so water-based ﬂuidswould not be the best choice. Alternatively, perhaps it is pos-sible to have two different immiscible ﬂuids with almostequal densities.) As with the submarine, the question iswhether the moving drop will sink or ﬂoat. By an elementaryyet manifestly covariant analysis, we ﬁnd that it will sink.
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we start
from the energy-momentum tensor for an ideal ﬂuid in a
weak quasi-Newtonian gravitational ﬁeld and derive a for-
mula that determines the enhancement of the ﬂuid’s pressuredue its horizontal velocity v. In Sec. III, we repeat the same
calculation in a comoving frame with respect to which theﬂuid does notmove, and explain why the pressure still gets
enhanced due to v, showing that the pressure enhancement is
observer independent. In Sec. IV, we apply those results to a
moving incompressible drop to show that the pressureenhancement of the drop implies that the drop sinks. In Sec.V, we discuss the effect of compressibility of a more realistic
ﬂuid and show that it does not signiﬁcantly affect the results.In Sec. VI, we analyze how the pressure enhancement is
modiﬁed in the full weak ﬁeld limit, beyond the quasi-Newtonian approximation. Finally, a qualitative discussionof our results is given in Sec. VII.

where qis density of the ﬂuid, pis pressure of the ﬂuid, ulis
the four-velocity of the ﬂuid, and gl/C23is the spacetime metric
tensor with signature ð/C0 þ þþÞ . We work in units c¼1, so
pandqhave the same units. Here, pandqtransform as sca-
lars under general coordinate transformations; they are the
pressure and energy density as seen by observer comoving
with the ﬂuid. The four-velocity vector is deﬁned as

which implies

To avoid misunderstanding of the notion of relativistic
pressure, some additional conceptual clariﬁcations may be
useful. In non-relativistic physics, “pressure” is usually
deﬁned as the force per unit area when the force three-vector
and area three-vector are parallel. However, in relativity,such a quantity depends on the frame of reference and,
hence, is not a scalar. In relativistic physics, the pressure of a
ﬂuid is, hence, redeﬁned as above in the local frame of refer-
ence in which the ﬂuid is at rest , which is why the relativistic
pressure pis a scalar. Similarly, the density qof the ﬂuid is
redeﬁned as mass per volume in the local frame of reference
in which the ﬂuid is at rest . (This is similar to the fact that
mass mof a relativistic particle is deﬁned as energy in the
frame of reference in which the particle is at rest, which is
why mis a scalar.) Indeed, the scalar nature of pandqis
clear from the tensor nature of (2).
If no external force (except gravity) acts on the ﬂuid, then
its energy-momentum tensor obeys a covariant conservation

We are interested in the case where the metric gl/C23
describes a weak gravitational ﬁeld near the Earth’s surface.
The full weak ﬁeld limit will be explored in Sec. VI, but
here, for simplicity, we shall work in the weak quasi-
Newtonian limit
g00¼/C0 ð 1þ2/Þ;
g0i¼0;gij¼dij; (8)
where i;j¼1;2;3 are the spatial indices,
/ðxlÞ¼/0þgaccx3(9)is the Newtonian gravitational potential, x3¼zis the vertical
coordinate, gacc¼9:81 m =s2is the gravitational acceleration
on Earth, and /0is an arbitrary constant, which determines
the altitude at which the potential is taken to be zero. In theabove-mentioned quasi-Newtonian limit, only g
00is nontriv-
ial, while in the full weak-ﬁeld limit (explored in Sec. VI)gij
are also nontrivial.7What we call the quasi-Newtonian limit
is usually called the Newtonian limit in the literature, but weadd the “quasi” preﬁx to emphasize an important difference
between non-relativistic Newtonian gravity and gravity
described in (8). The metric (8)transforms as a tensor under
general coordinate transformations, while in non-relativisticNewtonian gravity /transforms as a scalar. In fact, the met-
ric(8)is given in a frame of reference in which Earth is at
rest. We shall see in Sec. IIIthat in another frame of refer-
ence the metric tensor takes a different form, while in non-relativistic Newtonian gravity that would not be the case.
There are several reasons for working with the quasi-
Newtonian limit instead of the full weak ﬁeld limit. First,
this better isolates the kinematic essence of our resolution of
the submarine paradox, which involves certain physicalquantities transforming as scalars, vectors, or tensors.Second, other papers on the submarine paradox also work in
this limit, either explicitly
4or implicitly.1,3Third, the effect
of gravity in the submarine paradox can be simulated by auniformly accelerating frame of reference in ﬂat spacetime2
and only g00is nontrivial in the local coordinate system of an
accelerated observer.8
Now suppose that the ﬂuid moves with a horizontal

(For a similar, more general construction see also Ref. 9.) In
contrast, (10) can be interpreted as the velocity of a material
point at z, as seen by a static observer at the ﬁxed altitude z/C3

We emphasize that (13) and(14) are obtained in the weak
quasi-Newtonian limit (8). Either vorvloccan be used to
parameterize the four-velocity ul; choosing one or the other
is a matter of convenience. For our purposes, vis more con-
venient for the following reason. If a rigid body extended inthe vertical z-direction moves horizontally, then intuitively
one expects that the upper end of the body has the same
“velocity” as its lower end, i.e., the velocity does not depend
onz. The velocity that is constant in that sense is vnotv
loc.
Having speciﬁed the four-velocity and the metric, Eq. (6)
can be thought of as an equation that determines p(x). Since
the metric (8)and(9)and the velocity (12) and(13) depend
only on x3¼z, while qis either a constant (for an incom-
pressible ﬂuid) or satisﬁes an equation of state q¼qðpÞ,i t
follows that pdepends only on x3¼z. Hence, the middle
term in (6), proportional to an expression of the form
@/C23½/C1 /C1 /C1u/C23/C138, vanishes; terms with /C236¼3 do not contribute due
to the derivative @/C23, while the term with /C23¼3 does not con-
tribute because u3¼0. A similar analysis of other terms
reveals that (6)reduces to

Hence, (15) simpliﬁes to

Next, (8)and(9)give
@3g00
2¼/C0gacc; (18)
while (12) and(13) give
ðu0Þ2¼~c2; (19)
so(17) ﬁnally becomes
@3p¼/C0 ð pþqÞgacc~c2: (20)
The meaning of (20) is most easily understood by consid-
ering the nonrelativistic limit q/C29p;~c/C251, in which case
(20) becomes
@zp/C25/C0qgacc: (21)
If the ﬂuid is incompressible so that qis constant, this
gives pðzÞ/C25p0/C0qgaccz, which is the familiar nonrelativis-
tic linear dependence of pressure on depth. This reveals
that(20) is just a relativistic generalization of the nonrela-
tivistic formula (21). For our purposes, the most important
feature of (20) is the fact that the pressure gradient gets
enhanced by the relativistic factor ~c2that increases with
velocity v.III. PRESSURE ANALYZED FROM THE COMOVING
FRAME
The result (20) has been obtained by doing all calculations
in Earth’s frame, in which the ﬂuid moves with horizontal
velocity v. Now we want to ﬁnd the pressure pby doing anal-
ogous calculations in the frame comoving with the ﬂuid.Naively one might argue that in the comoving frame, theﬂuid does not move, so there can be no ~c
2in that frame. Yet
that cannot be right. The pressure pis a scalar, so its value
cannot change due to a change of coordinates. To see wherethe~c
2comes from in the comoving frame, in this section, we
perform an explicit calculation.
To deﬁne a comoving frame, consider a Lorentz
transformation
x00¼cðx0/C0vx1Þ;x01¼cðx1/C0vx0Þ;
x02¼x2;x03¼x3: (22)
The inverse transformation is of course
x0¼cðx00þvx01Þ;x1¼cðx02þvx00Þ;
x2¼x02;x3¼x03: (23)
The four-velocity in the primed coordinates is then
u0l¼@x0l
@xaua¼~c
cð1;0;0;0Þ; (24)
where (22) and(12) have been used. We see that all spatial
components of u0lvanish, which shows that x0lare indeed
comoving coordinates. Similarly, the metric in primed coor-dinates is
g
0
l/C23¼@xa
@x0l@xb
@x0/C23gab; (25)
so(23) and(8)give
g0
00¼/C0jg00j/C0v2
1/C0v2¼/C0c2
~c2;
g0
11¼1/C0jg00jv2
1/C0v2;g0
22¼g0
33¼1;
g0
01¼ð1/C0jg00jÞv
1/C0v2; (26)
with other components vanishing. We see that g0
006¼g00;
g0
116¼g11, and g0
016¼g01, i.e., the Lorentz transformation is
not an isometry of the metric in the presence of the static
gravitational ﬁeld described by jg00j6¼1. (It is possible to
redeﬁne the time coordinate to make g00¼/C01 everywhere,
but then some of the metric components become time depen-dent so the gravitational ﬁeld does not longer look static.) Inparticular, even though we are in a comoving frame, the met-ric depends on v. It is only in the absence of gravity, when
jg
00j¼1, that the dependence on vin(26) disappears and
the Lorentz transformation becomes an isometry, namely, atransformation for which g

l/C23¼gl/C23.
Now we can see what happens with the pressure in
the comoving frame. By analysis completely analogous tothe one that gave (17), in the comoving coordinates, we
obtain

Hence, @0
3g000ðu00Þ2¼@3g00ðu0Þ2,s o (27) is really the same
equation as (17). Taking for granted that the boundary condi-
tion, such as pðz0Þ¼0, cannot depend on the observer, it fol-
lows that the pressure panalyzed from the comoving frame
is the same as pressure panalyzed from the frame in which
ﬂuid moves, which indeed must be the case because pis a
scalar.
A reader with only special-relativistic intuition may still
be confused why the pressure of ﬂuid gets enhanced due to v
even in the comoving frame in which the ﬂuid does notmove. In special relativity, the Minkowski metric tensor
does not change under Lorentz transformations, so intui-
tively one may wrongly expect that g
0
00¼g00. Indeed, if
there was no c2factor in (29) to cancel the 1 =c2factor in
(28), there would be no pressure enhancement due to vin the
comoving frame. This demonstrates that special-relativistic
intuition based on an invariant metric tensor is not sufﬁcient
to properly understand the submarine paradox. Instead, onemust develop general relativistic intuition and note that the
metric tensor is also a quantity that depends on the reference
frame.
IV. SOFT SUBMARINE
Now consider a drop of ink of density qmoving through a
lake of the same density q. (Here, for simplicity, we assume
that the ﬂuid is incompressible so that qis constant; the
effect of compressibility is discussed in Sec. V.) Roughly
speaking, (20) implies that the ink pressure p
inkis larger than
the lake pressure plakeby a factor ~c2ðz;vÞ=~c2ðz;0Þ. To make
this statement more precise, we need to explicitly integrate
the differential equation (20). While it can be integrated
exactly, it is more illuminating to integrate it in the approxi-
mation q/C29p, in which case (20) gives
pðz;vÞ/C0pðz0;vÞ¼qgaccðz0
zdz~c2ðz;vÞ; (30)
where z0is the top surface, while ~cðz;vÞis deﬁned in (13)
and(8)and(9). From this expression, we can see that q/C29p
is a good approximation if gaccÐz0
zdz~c2/C281. We assume
that vis not ultra-relativistic, so ~c/C241 and the condition sim-
pliﬁes to gaccDz/C281. Restoring the units with the speed of
light c6¼1, this is really gaccDz/C28c2. Since c/C253/C1108m=s
andgacc/C2510 m =s2, we see that the condition gaccDz/C28c2is
indeed well satisﬁed for any reasonable ﬂuid depth Dz.
Hence, the pressure difference between the bottom and topof the moving ink isDp
ink¼qgaccðz0
zdz~c2ðz;vÞ; (31)
while the pressure difference for the non-moving lake is
Dplake¼qgaccðz0
zdz~c2ðz;0Þ: (32)
Since ~c2ðz;vÞincreases with jvj, it follows that
Dpink>Dplake.
Now consider a surface at the boundary between the two
ﬂuids. At any point on the surface, the ﬂuid with energy-
momentum Tl/C23acts with the local inﬁnitesimal force10
dFi¼Tijdaj; (33)
where dajis the outward oriented inﬁnitesimal area element.
We are interested in a horizontal surface, for which the only
non-vanishing component of dajisda3,s o (33) reduces to
dF3¼T33da3. Since u3¼0,(2)gives T33¼p, so we have
dF3¼pd a 3; (34)
showing that the local vertical force per unit area depends
only on p. However, on any surface, we have in fact two
forces, one coming from ﬂuid on one side of the surface and
another coming from ﬂuid on the other side of the surface.Hence, the total force acting on the boundary surface is
dF
3¼dF3
inkþdF3
lake¼pinkdaink
3þplakedalake
3: (35)
Yet, dalake
3¼/C0daink
3, so the total force on the boundary sur-
face is given by the difference of the two pressures
dF3¼ðpink/C0plakeÞdaink
3: (36)
Since pink>plake, it follows that the force has the same
direction as daink
3, i.e., in the outward direction from the ink
drop. Hence, the force on the bottom boundary of the drop
acts downward, while the force on the top boundary of the
drop acts upward. However, the force on the bottom is stron-ger than the force on the top because the pressures are larger
on the bottom, as seen in (30)–(32) . More explicitly, after
(32) we have shown that Dp
ink>Dplake, i.e.,
pink;bottom/C0pink;top>plake;bottom/C0plake;top; (37)
which can be rewritten as
ðpink/C0plakeÞbottom >ðpink/C0plakeÞtop; (38)
which shows that the downward pressure on the bottom is
larger than the upward pressure on the top. Hence, the net
force on the drop has the same direction as the force on thebottom boundary, i.e., the overall force on the drop is down-
ward. For a visualization of all these forces, see also Fig. 1.
This implies that the drop sinks .
Some readers may not be completely convinced by the
analysis of forces above because it may differ from the way
the forces are analyzed in more elementary texts on non-
relativistic mechanics. Why isn’t the mass of the dropinvolved in the analysis? Why is the gravitational force on
the drop not considered explicitly? To address those issues
in the simplest possible manner, let us consider a non-
844 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022 Hrvoje Nikolic ´ 844 04 October 2023 23:20:50
relativistic cubical drop of constant density q, surrounded by
vacuum (not by the lake). The cube has the height Dzand the
horizontal base with the area A. The pressure difference is
Dp¼qgaccDz, so the force difference DF¼ADp¼mgacc
points in the downward direction, where m¼qADzis the
mass of the drop. Thus, we see that the formula for pressure
difference contains a dependence on mass implicitly, through
the dependence on q. Moreover, we see that the force
difference DFis the same thing as the gravitational force
Fgrav¼mgaccon the drop in the downward direction.
Let us also note that (33) is not manifestly covariant
because it contains only spatial indices. A manifestly covari-
ant version of (33) is presented heuristically in Ref. 10. For
completeness, in Appendix , we present the covariant version
of(33) in a mathematically precise form. This relativistic
covariance implies that all observers agree that the drop
sinks.
V. THE ROLE OF COMPRESSIBILITY
So far we discussed rigid submarines and incompressible
ﬂuids, but those are idealizations. In fact, a strictly rigid
body and a strictly incompressible ﬂuid imply that any local
disturbance propagates with inﬁnite speed, which is inconsis-
tent with relativity. Hence a proper relativistic treatment of a
ﬂuid needs to take compressibility into account. In this sec-
tion, we study the effect of compressibility in a slightly com-
pressible ﬂuid like water and show that it does not
signiﬁcantly affect the results, provided that the size of the
ﬂuid drop is small enough.In an adiabatic process, the compressibility of a ﬂuid is
related to the speed of sound csthrough the formula11
@p
@q¼c2
s: (39)
In the approximation of a constant cs, this implies the equa-
tion of state
qðpÞ¼c/C02
spþq0; (40)
where q0is a constant not depending on p. However, Eq.
(20) is valid for any equation of state qðpÞ, even when the
approximation q/C29pis not valid, so we see that compress-
ibility does not affect the conclusion that pgets enhanced by
the factor ~c2ðz;vÞdue to the ﬂuid motion, owing to which
the moving drop sinks.
The compressibility, however, can affect how much the
pressure is enhanced. The insertion of (40) into(20) gives
@zp¼/C0 ð pþc/C02
spþq0Þgacc~c2: (41)
It can be integrated exactly, most easily by writing it as
dp
ð1þc/C02
sÞpþq0¼/C0dz g acc~c2ðz;vÞ; (42)
and integrating the left-hand side over pand the right-hand
side over z. We now assume that the speed of sound is much
smaller than the speed of light, i.e., cs/C281. We also assume
that the ﬂuid is only slightly compressed, which, due to (40),
implies c/C02
sp/C28q0. Thus, we have a hierarchy
p/C28c/C02
sp/C28q0; (43)
which shows that (41) can be approximated with
@zp¼/C0q0gacc~c2: (44)
Hence, we conclude that we can again use the approximation
(30) with q!q0.
The above-mentioned conclusion rests on the assumption
c/C02
sp/C28q0. Now let us see under what condition is this
assumption satisﬁed. Since this assumption implies theapproximation Dp¼q

VI. THE FULL WEAK FIELD LIMIT
So far, we analyzed everything in the quasi-Newtonian
limit (8)in which only g00is nontrivial. Now we want to
improve our analysis by considering the full weak ﬁeld limit
in which both g00andgijare nontrivial. In the full weak ﬁeld
limit, the metric (8)is modiﬁed to12Fig. 1. The forces acting on the top boundary and bottom boundary of the
spherical ink drop surrounded by the lake. The tips of arrows indicate the
application points of the forces. Since there is a force acting on each point of
the boundary, the indicated forces on two points (the top point and the bot-
tom point) are in fact inﬁnitesimal, while the lengths of arrows indicate therelative magnitudes of the inﬁnitesimal forces. Such a visualization of forces
at the top and bottom of the spherical drop is sufﬁcient to conclude that the
net force on the entire drop points downwards.

A straightforward computation shows that (15) and (16)

Thus, we see that all non-vanishing terms in (49) are propor-
tional to g33, so the dependence on g33is eliminated by mul-
tiplying (49) by 1=g33. We also see that (18) generalizes to

2¼/C0gacc; (51)
so(49) simpliﬁes to

Using also (47), this ﬁnally can be written as
@3p¼/C0 ð pþqÞgacc~C2; (53)
where
~C2¼~c2ð1þv2Þ: (54)
Equation (53) is a modiﬁcation of (20).I n(54), both factors
~c2andð1þv2Þincrease with v,s o~C2in(53) increases with
v, similarly to ~c2in(20). This shows that (53) leads to simi-
lar qualitative behavior as (20), i.e., that the full weak ﬁeld
limit predicts an increase in pressure with velocity, similar tothe quasi-Newtonian limit.
VII. DISCUSSION
Our results can be qualitatively summarized as follows.
When the ﬂuid moves with horizontal velocity v, its pressure
pgets enhanced by the v-dependent factor ~c
2deﬁned in (13).
However, pis a scalar, so its value does not depend on the
choice of coordinates. Hence, the pressure is enhanced bythe same factor even in the comoving frame, in which the
ﬂuid does not have velocity v. It may seem paradoxical
because the ﬂuid’s velocity vanishes in the comoving frameleading one to believe that the enhancement factor cannot be
the same. The apparent paradox is resolved by noting that
the effect depends on the velocity relative to Earth , not onvelocity relative to the observer. All observers agree that the
ﬂuid moves with respect to the gravitational ﬁeld produced
by Earth. This is why the v-dependent enhancement does not
depend on the velocity of the observer. This v-dependent
enhancement of the pressure implies that the moving drop
has a larger pressure than the surrounding non-moving lake
due to which the drop sinks. This is the essence of the resolu-tion of our softened version of the submarine paradox.
Our results are in a qualitative agreement with similar
results
1–4for a rigid submarine. In particular, in a special-
relativistic treatment in Ref. 1, the downward pressure of the
moving submarine is enhanced by the special-relativistic factor
c2deﬁned in (1), with one ccoming from Lorentz contraction
and the other ccoming from v-dependent “relativistic mass,”
the consequence of which is that the submarine sinks. Similar
results for a rigid submarine are obtained also in other works.2–4
Since the effect depends on the velocity vrelative to
Earth, we can also understand immediately what happens ifinstead of a lake we have a fast river moving with horizontal
velocity vwith respect to Earth, while the ink drop does not
move with respect to Earth. In this case we have p
river>pink,
so the ink drop ﬂoats. Likewise, one can also consider a sym-metric situation in which the river has velocity v=2 with
respect to Earth and the drop has velocity /C0v=2 with respect
to Earth, in which case the drop neither sinks nor ﬂoats.
Note also that our results are not in contradiction with the
non-relativistic Bernoulli’s effect which states that a moving
ﬂuid has a lower pressure. In our analysis, we tacitly assume
that ﬂuid is put into a state of larger velocity by acting on itwith an external force, which gives additional energy to the
ﬂuid, while the Bernoulli’s effect assumes that there is no
such external force.
Our results offer a new perspective on the submarine para-
dox. In our approach, the rigid submarine is replaced by a
drop of ideal ﬂuid, which simpliﬁes the analysis to a certain
extent, while the nature of the paradox and ﬁnal results arequalitatively similar. We believe that such a perspective con-
tributes to overall understanding of the whole issue.

APPENDIX: THE COVARIANT VERSION OF EQ. (33)
Here, we study the manifestly covariant version of (33).
We use the same physical ideas as Ref. 10but present them
in a form mathematically more precise than in Ref. 10. This
appendix uses a higher level of mathematical sophistication
than the rest of the paper, which makes it suitable toadvanced readers.
Consider a timelike three-dimensional hypersurface
embedded in the four-dimensional spacetime. The embed-
ding is deﬁned by four functions x
lðy0;y1;y2Þ, where
846 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022 Hrvoje Nikolic ´ 846 04 October 2023 23:20:50
y0;y1;y2are coordinates on the hypersurface. The induced
metric on the hypersurface is
qab¼@xl
@ya@xl
@ybgl/C23; (A1)
where a;b2f0;1;2g. The volume element on the hypersur-
face is d3yﬃﬃﬃqp, where d3y¼dy0dy1dy2andqis the absolute
value of the determinant of qab. From the four-dimensional
point of view, this three-dimensional volume element is rep-resented by the four-vector
DR
/C23¼d3yﬃﬃﬃqpn/C23; (A2)
where n/C23is the unit spacelike vector normal to the timelike
hypersurface.
Now consider a two-dimensional surface with coordinates
y1,y2at a ﬁxed time y0. Let dPlbe the amount of four-
momentum that, during a ﬁnite time, crosses an inﬁnitesimalpart of the surface with area proportional to dy
1dy2. Then
during the inﬁnitesimal time dy0, the amount of four-
momentum that crosses this part of surface is dðdPlÞ/C17DPl.
In terms of the quantities deﬁned as above, the covariant ver-sion of (33) is
DP
l¼Tl/C23DR /C23: (A3)
To see more explicitly how is (A3) related to (33),w e
choose coordinates yaon the hypersurface such that q01
¼q02¼0. With this choice, the determinant qfactorizes as
q¼jq00jqð2Þ, where qð2Þis the determinant of the induced
metric tensor on the two-dimensional surface. Thus, we canwrite (A2) as
DR
/C23¼dtlocda/C23; (A4)
where
dtloc¼dy0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
jq00jp
;da/C23¼d2yﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
qð2Þq
n/C23; (A5)
andd2y¼dy1dy2. Hence, (A3) can be written as
DPl
dtloc¼Tl/C23da/C23: (A6)
The left-hand side can be written as
DPl
dtloc¼dðdPlÞ
dtloc¼ddPl
dtloc/C18/C19
; (A7)
so(A6) becomes
ddPl
dtloc/C18/C19
¼Tl/C23da/C23: (A8)
Equation (A8) is quite similar to (33), but to get (33) we
would like to eliminate the contribution from /C23¼0. It could
be done by an appropriate choice of four-dimensional space-time coordinates, but we want to keep the four-dimensionalspacetime coordinates arbitrary. Therefore, we choose a dif-ferent method based on tetrad formalism.
13The tetrad el
/C22aðxÞis an object with two kinds of indices, the index lin the
curved spacetime and the index /C22ain the ﬂat tangential space
atx. It obeys el
/C22ae/C23
/C22bgl/C23¼g/C22a/C22b, where g/C22a/C22bis the ﬂat Minkowski
metric. From any object with spacetime indices, one can con-struct an equivalent object with Minkowski indices, e.g.,A
/C22a¼el
/C22aAlandA/C22a¼e/C22a
lAl, where e/C22a
l¼g/C22a/C22bgl/C23e/C23
/C22b. With this
formalism, we can write (A8) as
ddP/C22l
dtloc/C18/C19
¼T/C22l/C22/C23da/C22/C23: (A9)
The advantage of (A9) over (A8) is that now we can choose
the tetrad such that the spacelike vector n/C22/C23hasn/C220¼0, so
(A9) reduces to
ddP/C22l
dtloc/C18/C19
¼T/C22l/C22jda/C22j; (A10)
with /C22j2f1;2;3g. Choosing the tetrad in a speciﬁc way
while keeping coordinates arbitrary, rather than the otherway around, makes the formalism manifestly general covari-ant. Finally, choosing /C22l¼/C22iand deﬁning the inﬁnitesimal
force as
dF
/C22i¼ddP/C22i
dtloc !
; (A11)
(A10) implies
dF/C22i¼T/C22i/C22jda/C22j; (A12)
which is nothing but (33) written in a more precise form.

7The full weak ﬁeld limit depends on the Einstein equation which speci-

simplest modiﬁcation of ﬂat Minkowski metric that yields Newtonian
gravity for small velocities; it does not depend on the Einstein equation,
but only on the general kinematic idea that gravity is described by
spacetime metric.
