Representing components combined in series or parallel as a single equivalent component is a powerful
tool for simplifying systems, both in mechanics and in electrical circuits. When combining inductors,the effect of mutual inductance decreases or increases the total inductance of the system, depending on
the coupling factor between the inductors and on how they are connected. The analysis of mutually
coupled inductors can be complex and is often avoided, obscuring the underlying physics. Here, we
discuss the dependence of the equivalent inductance on the coupling factor for two parallel-connected
inductors with linear magnetic core and negligible resistance. By analyzing the current distribution ineach coil, we show that the so-called aiding and opposing arrangements are more complicated than is
frequently assumed. We recommend avoiding these terms and calling them instead aligned and anti-
aligned arrangements.

I. INTRODUCTION
Modeling series and parallel combinations of compo-
nents are a powerful tool to simplify their analysis. Simple
rules allow us to model combinations of springs, capaci-
tors, and resistors as a single effective component.However, the rules are not so simple for combining induc-tors. If a pair of inductors in series or parallel also has a
non-zero mutual inductance, then the equivalent induc-
tance may be increased or decreased, because the magneticﬂuxes they produce can be add itive or subtractive. The
mutual inductance of two coupled linear inductors with
self-inductances L
1andL2can be written in the form (see
theAppendix )
M¼kﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃL1L2p; (1)
where the coupling factor kis zero for independent inductors
and tends to unity for the ideal case of perfect coupling. Theequivalent inductance depends on how the inductors are con-nected: series or parallel, and aligned or anti-aligned.
For two aligned inductors connected in series (i.e., with
additive or aiding ﬂuxes, Fig. 1(a)), the equivalent induc-
tance is (see the Appendix )

whereas, if the inductors are anti-aligned (i.e., with subtrac-
tive or opposing ﬂuxes, Fig. 1(b)), it is (see the Appendix )

nected in parallel (Fig. 2(a)), the equivalent inductance is

Series- and parallel-connected inductors have various uses
in electrical applications. For example, on-chip multilayer
spiral inductors connected in series are used in microelec-
tronics.1Large inductances per unit area are, thus, achieved
for integrated circuits. Another example is to connect induc-
tors in parallel to increase the quality factor of the compo-
nent, deﬁned as the ratio of its equivalent inductance to its
equivalent resistance. This inductor structure has recently
been proposed to improve the efﬁciency of wireless powertransfer systems.2,3
In the literature, however, the complexity of the inductor
combination analysis is often avoided. Some authors
directly omit the calculation of equivalent inductances,despite having considered the calculation of equivalent
capacitances and resistances in their works.4–6Others
restrict the study to the combination of uncoupled
inductors.7,8The equivalent inductances of series- or
parallel-connected inductors are, thus, reduced to expres-sions analogous to those of equivalent resistances. Other
authors do deal with the combination of mutually coupled
inductors, but only for the aligned and anti-aligned series
connections, which correspond to aiding and opposing
ﬂuxes, respectively.9,10Finally, numerous authors who also
analyze the parallel connection assume that, in analogy to
the series connection, the arrangements with aligned and
anti-aligned inductors correspond to aiding and opposing
ﬂuxes, respectively.11–16
In this paper, we will analyze the dependence of the equiv-
alent inductance on the coupling factor for two parallel-connected inductors of negligible resistance. By illustrating
the distribution of currents through each branch, we will
show that the conﬁgurations with aligned and anti-aligned
inductors do not always produce additive or subtractive mag-
netic ﬂuxes, respectively, as is frequently assumed.

II. COUPLING FACTOR
We begin by analyzing, for the different conﬁgurations,
the dependence on the coupling factor of the equivalentinductance of two linear inductors, both with negligibleresistance. To this end, we replace the mutual inductance inEqs. (2)–(5) by Eq. (1)

where the upper signs correspond to aligned arrangements
and the lower signs to anti-aligned arrangements.
The series connection of two aligned or anti-aligned
inductors produce aiding or opposing magnetic ﬂuxes,respectively. Thus, L
eqincreases or decreases monotonically
in each case with increasing k(Fig. 3).
For the parallel connection of two anti-aligned inductors
of negligible resistance, Leqalso varies monotonically with
k; it decreases continuously with increasing k(Fig. 4(b)).
However, with the aligned arrangement, Leqincreases mono-
tonically with increasing konly if L1¼L2(Fig. 4(a)). If
L1>L2,Leqincreases with increasing kup to k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

approaching to the ideal full coupling scenario. In the fol-
lowing, we will determine the critical turning point of the
function Leq parallel

inductors and (b) anti-aligned inductors. Using the right-hand grip rule in
the pictorial diagrams above, we notice that a positive current iﬂowing
through coil 1 produces a clockwise magnetic ﬂux in the magnetic core. A
positive current iﬂowing through coil 2 in the aligned arrangement also
produces a clockwise ﬂux in the magnetic core. That is why this arrange-
ment produces aiding ﬂuxes. Instead, a positive current iﬂowing through
coil 2 in the anti-aligned arrangement produces a counterclockwise ﬂux in
the magnetic core. That is why this arrangement produces opposing ﬂuxes.
In the schematic diagrams below, we indicate with a dot the terminals ofthe inductors through which simultaneously incoming or outgoing currents
produce additive magnetic ﬂuxes. Simultaneously incoming or outgoing
currents through one dotted and one un-dotted terminal produce subtractive
ﬂuxes.

ing through coil 2 in the aligned arrangement also produces a clockwise ﬂux in the magnetic core. However, a positive i0does not guarantee positive i1andi2
in parallel-connected aligned inductors. That is why this arrangement does not necessarily produce aiding ﬂuxes. Instead, in the anti-aligned arra ngement i1

III. CURRENT DISTRIBUTION
We will now analyze the relationship between the currents
in each of the parallel-connected aligned inductors (of negli-gible resistance) when L
1>L2.
The electromotive force induced in each of the inductors
is the sum of the self-induced and the mutually induced elec-
tromotive forces. By equating the net electromotive forceinduced in each parallel-connected inductor of negligible
resistance, we obtain

The coefﬁcient L1/C0MðÞ is positive (Eq. (14)), while
the coefﬁcient L2/C0MðÞ will be positive, zero, or negative
ifkis less than, equal to, or greater thanﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
, respec-
tively (Eq. (12)). Thus, the sign of the time rate of change of
the current in both inductors will be the same if
k<ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

, but will be the opposite if k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

andi2vary in the same direction, both the self-induced and
the mutually induced electromotive forces have the same
polarity and Leqincreases with increasing k.I fi1andi2vary
in opposite directions, both the self-induced and the mutually
induced electromotive forces have opposite polarities and
Leqdecreases with increasing k, cancelling out for the
ideal scenario of fully coupled inductors (Fig. 4(a)). If
k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
, the current through the inductor of higher self-
inductance ( i1) does not vary, and therefore, e11¼e21¼0.
That is why Leqis equal to L2and to M(Eq. (10) and
Eq.(12), respectively).
By noting that the electromotive force induced in each
inductor ( e1and e2) must be equal to the electromotive force
induced in the equivalent inductor ( e), we obtain, for the
inductor of lower self-inductance
e2¼e;
L2di2

where i0¼i1þi2is the total current that ﬂows through the
equivalent inductor. By solving Eq. (17) fordi1=dtand
replacing the expression in Eq. (18), together with the
expression for Leq(Eq. (4)), we obtain the relationship
between the total current and the current through the inductor

Analogously, for the inductor of higher self-inductance
L1þL2/C02M ðÞdi1

Next, we will show that the coefﬁcient L1þL2/C02M ðÞ ;
present in the two latter equations, is positive. Recalling
Eq.(1)and that 0 /C20k<1, we get
L1þL2/C02M¼L1þL2/C02kﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ

Moreover, as already seen above, the coefﬁcient L1/C0MðÞ
is also positive, so i2(the current through the inductor of
lower self-inductance) and i0always vary in the same direc-
tion (Eq. (19)).
We have also seen that the coefﬁcient L2/C0MðÞ will be
positive, zero, or negative if kis less than, equal to, or
greater thanﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

, respectively. Therefore, it will be i1

which will vary in the same or opposite direction as i0for

IV. DC TRANSIENT ANALYSIS
We ﬁrst simulated the DC transient response of two
parallel-connected aligned inductors using Micro-Cap 12
software from Spectrum Software.17Micro-Cap is an inte-
grated schematic editor and mixed analog/digital simulatorwith an intuitive interface based on SPICE modeling(acronym for Simulation Program for Integrated Circuits
Emphasis, originally developed at the Electronics Research
Laboratory of the University of California).
18We designed
the circuit shown in Fig. 5with L1¼1HandL2¼0:64L1,
mutually coupled with a factor k, and a DC source of
V0¼4V. To model the internal resistance of the inductors, a
resistor Rwas connected in series with each inductor. To
control the time constant of the equivalent inductor(s
eqﬃLeq=R0), we connected a resistor of R0¼40Xto the
power supply.
After closing the switch S(i.e., connecting the circuit to
the power supply) and once the steady state is reached, as
both inductors are modeled with the same internal resistance,
it is expected that I1¼I2¼I0=2. However, simulations
show that, if we consider the ideal scenario of inductors

368 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 5, May 2022 J. M. Silveyra and J. M. Conde Garrido 368 04 October 2023 23:08:47
without resistance (i.e., R!0X), the steady state currents
depend on the self-inductances and on the coupling factor.This solution may also be reached analytically by integratingEq.(17)over time. This unphysical situation occurs because
we have assumed inductors without any resistance: The timeconstant of each inductor tends to inﬁnity when its resistancetends to zero, so the currents never converge to the expectedsteady state values. Figure 6shows the currents ﬂowing
through each branch of the circuit with uncoupled inductors(k¼0) in the transient regime, for different values of resis-
tances: R¼0, 0:1, 1 and 10 X. We found that the resistances
of 1Xare high enough for the circuit to reach the steady
state (i.e., i
1/C25i2/C25i0=2) in a reasonably short time ( /C245 s),
but low enough to be considered negligible compared to R0
(i.e., I0ﬃV0=R0).
Then, after selecting the pair of internal resistances
R¼1X, we analyzed the DC transient response of the cir-
cuit for the following coupling factors: k¼0 (uncoupled
inductors), k¼0:7(k<ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
),k¼0:8(k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
),
k¼0:9(k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
), and k¼0:99 ( k/C29ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
) (see
Fig. 7). The total current, i0ðtÞ, varies slightly with k,
because kvaries Leq—non-monotonically—(Fig. 4(a)) and
so does seq(Fig. 7(a)). The current through the inductor with
lower self-inductance, i2ðtÞ, suffers from an initial over-
shooting, which is greater for higher values of kand, when
k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
, may reach values even greater than I0(the
steady state total current) (Fig. 7(c)). This in-rushing current
phenomenon may be understood through Eq. (19), fromwhich we may observe that i2will vary faster than i0for near
perfect couplings ( k/C251), varying even faster for more simi-
lar self-inductances, i.e., closer to unity L2=L1ratios

and therefore i1tðÞis negative during the beginning of the
transient regime. This indicates that the ﬂowing direction ofi
1ðtÞis opposite to that assumed in the schematic of Fig. 5.
We, thus, demonstrate that, during the beginning of the DCtransient regime, the magnetic ﬂuxes produced by currentsthrough parallel-connected aligned inductors of negligibleresistance are not necessarily aiding, as is frequentlyassumed.
11–16Finally, it should be noted that the i1ðtÞpeak
current may also reach values higher than I0for near-perfect
couplings, although not as high as the i2ðtÞpeak current, and
in the reversed direction to i0and i2. In this case, the

phenomenon may be understood through Eq. (17), from
which we may observe that i2ðtÞwill vary faster than and in
opposite direction to i1ðtÞfor near perfect couplings ( k/C251),
varying even faster for more different self-inductances, i.e.,

V. AC STEADY STATE ANALYSIS
We then simulated the AC steady state of parallel-
connected aligned inductors, again using Micro-Cap 12. We
designed the circuit shown in Fig. 8with the same inductors
of the previous analysis, L1¼1HandL2¼0:64L1, mutu-
ally coupled with a factor k. A generator fed the circuit with
v0tðÞ¼4sinð100ptÞV. A high resistance of R0¼40kXwas
connected in series to the generator. This allows the circuit
to quickly reach the alternating steady state, the equivalent
impedance seen by the generator (input impedance) being
ZeqﬃR0, and, thus, the total current is i0ðtÞﬃv0tðÞ=R0.
In this analysis, it was possible to model the system using
R!0Xwithout obtaining unphysical results.
Figure 9(a) shows the negligible dependence of the total
current on the coupling factor in the AC regime due to the
use of a large R0, as already discussed ( i0ðtÞﬃv0tðÞ=R0). As
occurred in the DC regime, the current through the inductor
of lower self-inductance varies in the same direction as the
total current for any kand, therefore, both currents i2ðtÞand
i0ðtÞare in phase in the AC steady state regime (Fig. 9(c)).
The amplitude of i2ðtÞincreases as the coupling factorincreases, being i2ðtÞ¼i0ðtÞwhen k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
. When
k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
, the peak value of i2ðtÞexceeds that of i0ðtÞ.
Conversely, the current that ﬂows through the inductor of
higher self-inductance is in phase with the total current only
when k<ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
(Fig. 9(b)). When k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
,i1ðtÞis
null, while, when k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L2=L1p
,i1ðtÞvaries in the opposite
direction to i0ðtÞandi2ðtÞ, i.e., they are in counterphase. We,
thus, demonstrate that, also in the AC steady state, the mag-
netic ﬂuxes produced by the currents through parallel-
connected aligned inductors, of negligible resistance, are not
necessarily aiding, as is often assumed in the literature.11–16
Finally, also in the AC regime, the i1tðÞpeak current may
reach higher values than i0tðÞfor near-perfect couplings.
VI. CONCLUSION
We analyzed the equivalent inductance of two mutually
coupled inductors of negligible resistance more fully than in
the usual textbook treatments with the aim of helping
broaden the reader’s insight into Faraday’s law applied to
circuits. Our approach includes elementary calculus and
numerical simulations with a powerful, yet intuitive and
freely distributed software based on SPICE modeling. The
qualitative aspects of our study can be discussed in introduc-
tory calculus-based courses on electricity and magnetism for
undergraduate students of engineering and physics, while a
deeper analysis may be possible in courses for electrical
engineers. The circuits can be constructed in the laboratory
to compare the model predictions with experimental data.
The only precaution necessary is that the inductors operate
in the linear range assumed in the present work.
Since the illustrated examples demonstrate that for
k>ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

, parallel-connected aligned inductors do not
necessarily produce aiding ﬂuxes, we recommend to avoid
calling the two possible parallel-connection conﬁgurations
aiding or opposing arrangements. These terms, used by some
authors in analogy to the behavior of series-connected
aligned inductors, lead to confusion, hampering progress in
education and research on electrical applications. Instead, we
propose making reference to the geometry by calling them,
for example, aligned or anti-aligned arrangements.

APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF BASIC EQUATIONS
In this Appendix , we derive Eqs. (1)–(5) . To this end, we
begin by recalling brieﬂy some basic notions. Inductance is
the property of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in
the current ﬂowing through it. Inductors are made by wind-ing a conductor in the form of a coil and may have a soft
magnetic core.
19The concept of inductance arises most natu-
rally from Faraday’s law, which states that a changing mag-netic ﬂux through a loop induces an electromotive force(emf) ein the loop equal to the negative time derivative of
the ﬂux. Self-inductance Land mutual inductance Mare
deﬁned as the ratio of the induced emf to the rate of changeof current producing it on the conductor itself and on nearbyconductors, respectively.
Consider two coupled inductors, 1 and 2, which means
that some of the magnetic ﬂux produced by the current
ﬂowing in either of the inductors passes through bothinductors. The self-inductances and mutual inductancesare

where Umnis the magnetic ﬂux linked with each of the Nm
turns of inductor mand produced by the current inthrough
inductor n. Both mutual inductances are equal for linear
inductors (see Ref. 20for an elementary derivation from a
stored energy argument)
M12¼M21/C17M: (A2)
Under linear conditions, we can also deﬁne a coupling factor
kas the ratio of the mutual ﬂux linkage ( Umn;m6¼n) to the
total ﬂux Unnproduced by the current in; that is,
k¼U12
U11¼U21
U22: (A3)
This ratio is zero for independent inductors and tends to
unity for the ideal case of perfect coupling, i.e., without ﬂux
leakage. Taking the product of both mutual inductances and
using Eq. (A3) to rewrite each of the mutual ﬂux linkages,
we obtain
M12M21¼N1dU12

¼N1dkU11ðÞ
di2N2dkU22ðÞ

which, considering Eq. (A2), yields Eq. (1)
M¼kﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃL1L2p: (A5)Let us now ﬁnd the equivalent inductance of the two cou-
pled inductors connected in series (Fig. 1). The total induced
emf is the sum of the emf induced in each inductor

where the plus sign corresponds to aligned inductors and the
minus sign corresponds to anti-aligned inductors. The totalemf is e¼L
eqdi=dt, so the term between brackets in Eq.
(A6) is the equivalent inductance deﬁned in Eqs. (2)and(3)
for each arrangement
Leq¼L1þL262M: (A7)
When two coupled inductors of negligible resistance
are connected in parallel with the aligned arrangement(Fig. 2(a)), the emf induced in each inductor is
e

and should be equal to the emf induced in the equivalent
inductor, which is
e¼Leqdi0
dt¼Leqdi1

Then from e¼e1, we have

Dividing Eq. (A11) by Eq. (A12) and solving for Leqgives
Eq.(4)

With the anti-aligned arrangement, the emf induced in
each parallel-connected inductor is
