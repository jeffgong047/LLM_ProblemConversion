The use of Green’s functions is valuable when solving problems in electrodynamics, solid-state
physics, and many-body physics. However, its role in quantum mechanics is often limited to the
context of scattering by a central force. This work shows how Green’s functions can be used in
other examples in quantum mechanics courses. In particular, we introduce time-independentGreen’s functions and the Dyson equation to solve problems with an external potential. We
calculate the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients of scattering by a Dirac delta barrier and the
energy levels and local density of states of the inﬁnite square well potential.

I. INTRODUCTION
Green’s function method is used to solve problems at the
undergraduate or graduate level. Green’s functions are fre-quently used when solving inhomogeneous differential equa-tions such as Poisson’s equation, the inhomogeneous waveequation, and the inhomogeneous heat equation.
1–7In many-
body physics and solid-state physics, Green’s functions are
introduced to solve more complex problems that require
second quantization.8–16In quantum mechanics courses,
Green’s functions are used in the context of scattering by acentral potential, which requires the understanding of timedependence,
17–21so that Green’s functions are often intro-
duced only in graduate-level courses or speciﬁc problems.22–24
In this work, we show how students in intermediate or
advanced quantum mechanics courses can learn the basicconcepts of Green’s functions and use them to solve prob-lems. First, we present the formalism of Green’s functionsin the context of the Sturm–Liouville problem and linearoperators
25–28and show how we can use it for the time-
independent Schr €odinger equation. Later, we calculate
Green’s function for a free particle and derive the Dysonequation when the system is perturbed with an externalpotential energy function. In particular, we consider a Diracdelta potential, where we can use Green’s function to calcu-late both reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients exactly.
Likewise, we illustrate how to ﬁnd Green’s function of an
inﬁnite square potential well, and from it, the spectrum ofenergy and the local density of states (LDOS). Finally, inAppendix C, we suggest two challenging problems.
II. GREEN’S FUNCTION CONCEPT
AND ITS CONSTRUCTION IN THE
STURM–LIOUVILLE PROBLEM
Here, we provide a short introduction to Green’s functions
as a method to solve inhomogeneous differential equationsin the context of the Sturm–Liouville equation. To summa-rize the Sturm–Liouville theory, second-order linear differ-ential equations can be expressed as
ðk/C0^L
xÞ/ðxÞ¼fðxÞ; (1)
with^Lx/ðxÞ¼d
dxpðxÞd/ðxÞ
dx/C20/C21
þqðxÞ/ðxÞ: (2)
This differential equation, in conjunction with regular
boundary conditions deﬁned for the interval x2ða;bÞ;a1/ðaÞ
þa2/0ðaÞ¼0a n d b1/ðbÞþb2/0ðbÞ¼0, determines a prob-
lem with a unique solution. The operator ^Lxhas eigenfunctions
unðxÞwith eigenvalues knthat satisfy the Sturm–Liouville
equation
^LxunðxÞ¼knwðxÞunðxÞ: (3)
Forw(x)¼1, we wish to ﬁnd the inverse operator ðk/C0^LÞ/C01,
such that /¼ðk/C0^LÞ/C01f. The inverse operator can be repre-
sented as an integral operator with kernel Gðx;x0Þ,
k/C0^Lx/C0/C1/C01ð/C1 /C1 /C1Þ ¼ð
Gðx;x0Þð/C1 /C1 /C1Þ dx0; (4)
such that the integral solution of Eq. (1)can be written as
/ðxÞ¼ð
Gðx;x0Þfðx0Þdx0: (5)
Gðx;x0Þis known as the Green’s function. Now, let us derive
the differential equation that Gðx;x0Þsatisﬁes by applying
the operator k/C0^Lxto Eq. (5)in this manner,
k/C0^Lx/C0/C1
/ðxÞ¼ð
k/C0^Lx/C0/C1
Gðx;x0Þfðx0Þdx0(6)
¼fðxÞ: (7)
Therefore, Gðx;x0Þmust satisfy
k/C0^Lx/C0/C1
Gðx;x0Þ¼dðx/C0x0Þ: (8)
Thus, Green’s function in the coordinate representation satisﬁes
an inhomogeneous differential equation with fðxÞ¼dðx/C0x0Þ.
From the solution of Eq. (8), we can solve Eq. (5).

By integrating Eq. (1), we can see that Green’s function
must be continuous at x¼x0, but the ﬁrst derivative is dis-
continuous at this point,
lim
/C15!0fGðx;xþ/C15Þ/C0Gðx;x/C0/C15Þg ¼ 0; (9)

dx/C12/C12/C12/C12
x0¼x/C0/C15()
¼1
pðxÞ:(10)
One technique to ﬁnd Green’s function is the direct
method, which is based on the solution of the associatedGreen equation for x6¼x
0. In this case, as Gðx;x0Þfulﬁlls the
homogeneous equation for x6¼x0, we can write
Gðx;x0Þ¼Au<ðxÞu>ðx0Þ;x<x0
A0u<ðx0Þu>ðxÞ;x>x0:(
(11)
The product u<ðxÞu>ðx0Þassures us that Gðx;x0Þsatisﬁes
Eq.(1)for both the operator ^Lxas for ^Lx0. The functions
u<ðxÞandu>ðxÞare solutions of the Sturm–Liouville equa-
tion that satisfy the left or right boundary conditions, respec-
tively. (For example, u<ðxLÞ¼0;u>ðxRÞ¼0,xL<xR,a s
in Fig. 1(a).) This method is often called “asymptotic sol-
utions” in the context of the Schr €odinger equation. Using
Eqs. (9)and(10), we obtain the normalization factors
A¼A0¼/C01
pW; (12)
where Wis the Wronskian,
W¼u<ðxÞdu>ðxÞ
dx/C0u>ðxÞdu<ðxÞ
dx: (13)
Despite appearances, AandA0are independent of x, since
dðpWÞ=dx¼0.
III. GREEN’S FUNCTIONS APPLIED
TO SCHR €ODINGER EQUATIONS
Now, we consider the time-independent Schr €odinger equa-
tion, where k¼Eand^L¼H0ðrÞ,
H0rðÞw0ðrÞ¼Ew0ðrÞ; (14)with
H0rðÞ¼/C0/C22h2
2mr2þV0ðrÞ: (15)
Here, the subscript 0 refers to the potential V0. Even though
the Schr €odinger equation is homogeneous ( f(x)¼0), its
Green’s function encodes information about the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions of the equation and is still useful for solv-ing various problems other than ﬁnding inhomogeneous sol-
utions. We can deﬁne the associated Green’s function as
E/C0H
0rðÞ ðÞ gðr;r0Þ¼dðr/C0r0Þ; (16)
with the solution
gðr;r0Þ¼ E/C0H0rðÞ ðÞ/C01dðr/C0r0Þ: (17)
The function gðr;r0Þdepends on E, which is not explicitly
notated. As shown in Appendix A ,g(E) has poles whenever
Eis equal to an energy eigenvalue of the system. We usually
add or subtract a small imaginary part to the value of E,
E!E6ig, so that ghas no poles on the real- Eaxis. When
we add ig, Green’s function is called retarded ( r), and for
/C0igadvanced ( a); see note in Ref. 29. In the following, we
will specify whether Green’s function is advanced or
retarded only when necessary.
As an example, we consider the free particle case. The
asymptotic solutions are
u<ðxÞ¼e/C0ikx;
u>ðxÞ¼eikx;
with k¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2mE=/C22h2q
; see Fig. 1(b). The wave function u<ðxÞ
describes a particle that propagates to the left and u>ðxÞone
that propagates to the right. With these solutions, we can cal-
culate the Wronskian
W¼ike/C0ikxeikxþike/C0ikxeikx¼2ik;
and from Eqs. (9)and(10), with p¼/C0/C22h2=2m, we obtain
gðx;x0Þ¼/C0 im
/C22h2keikjx/C0x0j: (18)
This Green’s function will be used in Sec. IVto solve
problems perturbed by an additional potential.
IV. PERTURBED SYSTEMS AND DYSON
EQUATIONS
Green’s function gðr;r0Þbecomes useful when we add a
perturbing potential VðrÞto the Hamiltonian H0ðrÞ,
H0rðÞþVrðÞ ðÞ wðrÞ¼EwðrÞ; (19)
which can also be expressed as
E/C0H0rðÞ ðÞ wðrÞ¼VrðÞwðrÞ: (20)
We can see this equation as an “inhomogeneous”
Schr€odinger equation, where the external source is given byFig. 1. (Color online) Schematic representation of the asymptotic functions.
The arrows illustrate the group velocity of each wave traveling in different
directions. (a) A semi-inﬁnite system with an edge at xLorxR, where the
function in each case is a linear combination of incoming (blue dashed
arrows) and outgoing (red solid arrows) plane waves. (b) An inﬁnite system
where xR=L!61and the functions are outgoing plane waves.

fðrÞ¼VðrÞwðrÞ. We start from the fact that we know
gðr;r0Þ, and then we can write the solution for wðrÞas
wðrÞ¼w0rðÞþð
dr0gr;r0ðÞ Vr0ðÞwðr0Þ; (21)
where w0is the solution of Eq. (14). This is an integral equa-
tion to ﬁnd wðrÞfrom gðr;r0Þ. However, it is possible to
express wðrÞmore directly from Green’s function of the per-
turbed system by deﬁning Gðr;r0Þas
E/C0H ðÞ Gðr;r0Þ¼dðr/C0r0Þ; (22)
with H¼H0ðrÞþVðrÞ. Using Eq. (16) to write dðr/C0r0Þ;
Gðr;r0Þcan be written as
Gðr;r0Þ¼ E/C0HrðÞ ðÞ/C01dðr/C0r0Þ
¼E/C0HrðÞ ðÞ/C01E/C0H0rðÞ ðÞ gðr;r0Þ
¼E/C0HrðÞ ðÞ/C01E/C0HrðÞþVrðÞ ðÞ gðr;r0Þ
¼gðr;r0Þþ E/C0HrðÞ ðÞ/C01VrðÞgðr;r0Þ: (23)
From the inverse operator notation (4)forðE/C0HðrÞÞ/C01;
Gðr;r0Þis
Gðr;r0Þ¼gðr;r0Þþð
dr1Gðr;r1ÞVr1ðÞgðr1;r0Þ:(24)
This result is called the Dyson equation, and it allows us to
express Green’s function of the perturbed system in terms ofGreen’s function of the unperturbed system. Similarly, we can
ﬁndwðrÞfrom Gðr;r
0Þby treating H0as a perturbation of H
Ew0ðrÞ/C0H0ðrÞw0ðrÞ¼0;
E/C0HðrÞ ðÞ w0ðrÞ¼/C0 VðrÞw0ðrÞ:(25)
From this perspective, the external source is given by
fðrÞ¼/C0 VðrÞw0ðrÞ, and using Eq. (22), we can express
w0ðrÞ¼wðrÞ/C0ð
Gðr;r0ÞVðrÞw0ðrÞdr0; (26)
where wðrÞis the solution of Eq. (25) forVðrÞ¼0. Finally,
we ﬁnd
wðrÞ¼w0ðrÞþð
Gðr;r0ÞVðr0Þw0ðr0Þdr0; (27)
which allows us to ﬁnd the quantum state of the perturbed
system from the unperturbed wave function and the per-turbed Green’s function G, itself found from the unperturbed
Green’s function gsolving Dyson’s equation (24).
V. DELTA BARRIER POTENTIAL AND EXACT
SOLUTION
As a ﬁrst example, we consider the Schr €odinger equation
for a particle in one dimension with a potential of the form
VxðÞ¼U
0dxðÞ; (28)
which can model a thin potential barrier that couples two
regions of a material, such as two metals separated by anoxide layer. We can think of the delta function as the limit ofa barrier of width a
0and height V0, as it grows narrower and
taller while holding the strength U0¼a0V0constant (see
Fig.2). In terms of the coordinates xandx0, the Dyson equa-
tion is written as
Gðx;x0Þ¼gðx;x0Þþð
gðx;x1ÞVx 1ðÞGðx1;x0Þdx1: (29)
Substituting the potential VðxÞ, we get
Gðx;x0Þ¼gðx;x0ÞþU0gðx;0ÞGð0;x0Þ: (30)
From this equation, we can ﬁnd Gð0;x0Þ,
Gð0;x0Þ¼gð0;x0ÞþU0gð0;0ÞGð0;x0Þ;
Gð0;x0Þ¼ 1/C0U0gð0;0Þ ½/C138/C01gð0;x0Þ;(31)
and replacing in Eq. (30), we get
Gðx;x0Þ¼gðx;x0ÞþU0gðx;0Þ1/C0U0gð0;0Þ ½/C138/C01gð0;x0Þ:
(32)
The unperturbed function gðx;x0Þcorresponds to an inﬁnite
one-dimensional system, Eq (18). Replacing gðx;x0Þin Eq. (32),
we obtain
Gðx;x0Þ¼Aeikjx/C0x0jþU0Aeikjxjþjx0j ðÞ1/C0U0A ½/C138/C01/C16/C17
:(33)
Deﬁning Zas the strength of the barrier,
Z¼m
/C22h2kU0; (34)
we get
Gðx;x0Þ¼Aeikjx/C0x0j/C0iZ
1þiZeikjxjþjx0j ðÞ/C18/C19
: (35)
The ﬁrst term comes from Green’s function of the homoge-
neous system, and the second from the particle’s interactionwith the potential, which breaks the homogeneity ofthe system. Now to ﬁnd the perturbed wave function, we useEq.(27), with which
wðxÞ¼w

Gðx;x0ÞU0dðx0Þw0ðx0Þdx0
¼w0xðÞþGðx;0ÞU0w0ð0Þ: (36)
If we assume an incident wave from the left, the unperturbed
wave function is
Fig. 2. (Color online) Potential barrier of width a0and height V0. When
a0!0 and V0!1 while a0V0¼U0, the potential can be modelled as
VðxÞ¼U0dðxÞ. The solid red line illustrates the incoming wave, and the
black dotted and green dashed lines are the reﬂected (r) and transmitted (t)
waves, respectively.

w0xðÞ¼aeikx; (37)
with abeing the amplitude of the wave. From Eq. (35),w e
can express
Gðx;0Þ¼Aeikjxj 1
1þiZ/C18/C19
: (38)
Using Eqs. (36)–(38) , we obtain
wðxÞ¼aeikx/C0eikjxjiZ
1þiZ/C18/C19
: (39)
We can write explicitly to the left and right of the barrier the
wave function as
wðxÞ¼aeikx/C0e/C0ikxiZ
1þiZ/C18/C19
;x<0
aeikx1
1þiZ; x>0:8
>>><
>>>:(40)
From here, we can see that the amplitudes of reﬂection ( r),
and transmission ( t) are
r¼/C0iZ
1þiZ;t¼1
1þiZ; (41)
in such a way that the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁ-
cients30are
R¼jrj2¼Z2
1þZ2;T¼jtj2¼1
1þZ2: (42)
These coefﬁcients satisfy R2þT2¼1 and are illustrated in
Fig.3.Let us go back to Green’s function and analyze the case of
an inﬁnite barrier, for which we let U0!1 and, therefore,
Z!1 ,
Gðx;x0Þ¼Aeikjx/C0x0j/C0eikjxjþjx0j ðÞ ðÞ : (43)
This Green’s function corresponds to that of a semi-inﬁnite
medium to left or right at x¼0;and will be used in Sec. VI.
Since the potential is modelled as a Dirac delta function,
we were able to solve Eq. (24) or Eq. (29) to ﬁnd Green’s
function exactly. For the general case, the Dyson equation isan integral equation that can be solved iteratively, leading to
the following expansion, which we write symbolically as
G¼gþgVG
¼gþgV g þgVgþ/C1/C1/C1 ðÞ
¼gþgVgþgVgVg þ/C1/C1/C1 : (44)
For a one dimensional case, this expansion yields
Gðx;x
0Þ¼gðx;x0Þþð
dx1gðx;x1ÞVðx1Þgðx1;x0Þ
þðð
dx1dx2gðx;x1ÞVðx1Þgðx1;x2Þ
/C2Vðx2Þgðx2;x0Þþ/C1/C1/C1 : (45)
A technique to solve this type of equation is, for example,
to take the Fourier transform of Green’s functions and thepotential V,10,31which gives an algebraic system of equa-
tions that must be solved. Alternatively, when Vcan be con-
sidered as a small perturbation, the iterative technique
generates a perturbation series solution.
VI. QUANTUM POTENTIAL WELL VIA GREEN’S
FUNCTION ANALYSIS
To ﬁnd Green’s function of an inﬁnite potential well, as
seen in Fig. 4, we start from Green’s function of the semi-
inﬁnite medium with x>0 and place an additional potential
atx¼L,
VxðÞ¼U1dðx/C0LÞ; (46)
with U1¼a1V1,a1being the width of the additional barrier,
andV1its height. The unperturbed Green’s function gðx;x0Þ
is given in Eq. (43) with x;x0>0,
gðx;x0Þ¼Aeikjx/C0x0j/C0eik xþx0ðÞ/C0/C1
: (47)
Proceeding similarly to the case of a barrier, we have
Fig. 3. (Color online) Reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients as a function
of the energy for different values of U0. The units of U0areeV ˚A, and the
values correspond to insulating barriers for a typical metal-oxide-metal

Gðx;x0Þ¼gðx;x0ÞþU1gðx;LÞ1/C0U1gðL;LÞ ½/C138/C01gðL;x0Þ;
(48)
and taking the limit of U1!1 , we obtain Green’s function
for an inﬁnite square potential well as
Gðx;x0Þ¼gðx;x0Þ/C0gðx;LÞgðL;LÞ ½/C138/C01gðL;x0Þ: (49)

ﬁnd that the energy spectrum is given by

therefore,

which coincide with the well-known energy eigenvalues of

we have used g/C253/C210/C02times the energy of the ﬁrst

which has a maximum when Ecoincides with an eigenvalue

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a pedagogical presentation of the concept and
the techniques for calculating Green’s function was made inthe usual linear second-order partial differential equations sce-nario. Then, we showed how to apply this formalism to the
Schr€odinger equation in quantum mechanics. Also, we have
derived the Dyson equation to solve an “inhomogeneous”Schr€odinger equation when an external potential perturbs the
system. As a ﬁrst example for applying the Dyson equationwith unbounded states, we solve a potential modelled by aDirac delta function, where we ﬁnd Green’s function and thewave function, deriving the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁ-
cients. To study bound states, we solve the inﬁnite square
potential well and ﬁnd Green’s function, the energy spectrum,and local density of states. We showed the method of theasymptotic solutions to calculate Green’s function in onedimension and applied this to ﬁnd Green’s function of the freeparticle. The methods to ﬁnd Green’s functions and examplesshow how to introduce this concept in quantum mechanicscourses.

APPENDIX A: DENSITY OF STATES
For a system, such as a metal, in which the electronic
energy levels form a quasi-continuum, a function of greatimportance is the density of states N(E), where NðEÞdEis
deﬁned as the number of states with energies between Eand
EþdE. We are going to show that the density of states can
be expressed in terms of a Green’s function, then we are
going to ﬁnd an expression of Green’s function in terms ofthe eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian H, which we assume
orthonormal and complete

states from the well. Plot the transmission coefﬁcient for dif-ferent values of Zand observe how the width of each reso-
nance depends on Z.

30In general, the transmission coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the ratio between the
transmitted probability current density and the density of incident current.
When the system is three-dimensional, one must consider only the current
densities normal to the interfaces.
