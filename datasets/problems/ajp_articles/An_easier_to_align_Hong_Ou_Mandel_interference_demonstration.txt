The Hong–Ou–Mandel interference experiment is a fundamental demonstration of nonclassical
interference and a basis for many investigations of quantum information. This experiment involvesthe interference of two photons reaching a symmetric beamsplitter. When the photons are made
indistinguishable in all possible ways, an interference of quantum amplitudes results in both
photons always leaving the same beamsplitter output port. Thus, a scan of distinguishableparameters, such as the arrival time difference of the photons reaching the beamsplitter, produces a
dip in the coincidences measured at the outputs of the beamsplitter. The main challenge for its
implementation as an undergraduate laboratory is the alignment of the photon paths at thebeamsplitter. We overcome this difﬁculty by using a pre-aligned commercial ﬁber-coupled
beamsplitter. In addition, we use waveplates to vary the distinguishability of the photons by their
state of polarization. We present a theoretical description at the introductory quantum mechanicslevel of the two types of experiments, plus a discussion of the apparatus alignment and list of parts
needed.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1987, Hong, Ou, and Mandel reported on one of the
most consequential experiments in quantum optics.1It is an
experiment that demonstrates the ensuing quantum interfer-ence of two properly prepared photons after each arrives sepa-rately at an adjacent input port of a symmetric beamsplitter.When all of the properties of the two photons are identical, a
striking phenomenon appears: the two photons always exit
together at the same output port of the beamsplitter and neverexit at separate output ports. This effect is a purely nonclassi-cal phenomenon. The proper way to understand it is from aquantum-mechanical perspective, where the amplitudes for
the various possibilities interfere. This result mimics a form of
interaction between photons, but one that is solely due toquantum effects, similar to the exchange interaction of elec-trons in atoms. This quantum interaction has been used for anumber of purposes,
2such as entanglement,3,4entanglement
swapping,5teleportation,6implementation of CNOT gates,7
and ultimately, quantum computing with photons.8
The essence of the Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference
phenomenon is shown in Fig. 1. When two photons arrive
separately at adjacent input ports of a beamsplitter, there arefour possible outcomes. Either the two photons exit togetherout of the same output port in one of two possible ways, as
shown in Figs. 1(a)and1(b), or they exit out of separate ports
in one of two possible ways, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and1(d).Following Ref. 9, consider the event when both photons exit
out of separate output ports of the beamsplitter. If the photonsare indistinguishable, the probability for the event is thesquare of the sum of the probability amplitudes for each pos-sibility considered separately. If the possibilities are distin-guishable, then the probability of the event is the sum of the
probabilities of the possibilities.
Now assume the beamsplitter to be a symmetric one, i.e.,
with equal probabilities to transmit and reﬂect light, and equalamplitudes for reﬂection and transmission from either side ofthe beamsplitter. It is common to call the probability amplitudesfor transmission and reﬂection tandr, respectively. The abso-
lute value for both tandrhas to be 1 =ﬃﬃﬃ

of transmission and reﬂection is 1 =2i ne a c hc a s e .H o w e v e r ,t o
conserve energy, or equivalently, probability, the transmissionand reﬂection amplitudes have to be out of phase by p=2f o rt h e

this phase to the reﬂection amplitude, so r¼expðip=2Þ=ﬃﬃﬃ

has two terms: when both transmit, it is tt¼1=2[ F i g . 1(c)];
and both reﬂect, it is rr¼/C01=2[ F i g . 1(d)]. The probability for
the event is then

That is, the two possibilities interfere destructively.

If the photons are distinguishable, such as when they
arrive at the beamsplitter at distinguishable different times,
then the probability is
Pdis¼jttj2þjrrj2¼1=2: (2)
Distinguishable different times mean that a measurement of
the two arrival times of the photons can be used to distinguishbetween the two possibilities. Other distinguishing attributes
are the photons’ polarization, energy, or spatial mode.
We note that the previous analysis applies to bosons, like
the photon. For fermions (for example, electrons), the ampli-tude rule of Eq. (1)is not a sum but a difference of the two
probability amplitudes.
9This fact is due to the exchange
symmetry of indistinguishable fermions, which unlike
bosons, cannot occupy the same state (i.e., both fermionshaving the same momentum). Thus, in the HOM experi-
ments with electrons,12the probability of Eq. (1)is 1.
Feynman explains the distinction between bosons and fer-mions with a similar type of experiment, of identical par-ticles in a head-on collision.
9This phenomenon is more
formally described in terms of the symmetry of the two-
particle wavefunction, presented in Sec. III. Ultimately, the
HOM experiment is a demonstration of the superposition of
the state of two particles and how it leads to measurable
interference effects that are purely quantum mechanical.
Recreation of this demonstration is not straightforward,
mostly because the experimental alignment requires mucheffort and expertise, and thus is time consuming. To see the
interference, both photons created from the same source—
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (describedbelow)—have to travel exactly the same distance to the
beamsplitter, so setting up the photon paths needs very careful
alignment. Additionally, the experiment requires hardwarethat facilitates scanning the photon path difference by tens ofmicrometers. A ﬁnal challenge occurs at the beamsplitter. The
photons’ spatial mode must fully overlap at the beam splitter
and along the output paths. Otherwise they will be spatiallydistinguishable. For educational purposes, this demonstration
h a sb e e nd o n eb e f o r ei nf r e es p a c e ,
13where the experimental-
ists implemented the following clever method of alignment: aMach–Zehnder interferometer was set up such that its sepa-rate arms were the two photon paths. Once the paths were
aligned to be equal via interferometry, the ﬁrst beamsplitter
was replaced by the down-conversion crystal.The purpose of this article is to report on a
Hong–Ou–Mandel interference demonstration that elimi-nates the free-space alignment of the photon beams reaching
the beamsplitter. Instead, we use a commercial pre-aligned
device. The cost of this device is within the norm for compo-nent hardware in common use in quantum optics instruc-tional physics laboratories. This new system adds its own
complication, though. That is, the down-converted photons
need to be coupled to single-mode ﬁbers. We ﬁnd this extraeffort to be a worthwhile trade-off. In Appendix A , we pro-
vide a suggested procedure for the required alignment. We
also note that this experiment is already sold commercially
as a black-box-type experiment.
14,15Our experiment is based
on the beam-splitting component in one of these commercialproducts, but our aim is a demonstration in which students
set up the entire apparatus, and it is done at a lesser cost.
The article is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we provide
a detailed description of the experimental apparatus. SectionIIIfollows with a quantum-mechanical description of the
phenomenon that ﬁts within the curricular formalism of an
undergraduate course, along with the experimental results.
Two appendices give alignment procedures, a parts list andcomponent costs.
II. APPARATUS
A diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure
has been sectioned to highlight important parts. The ﬁrst sectionis the source of photon pairs via type-I spontaneous parametricdown-conversion. A pump laser emitted horizontally polarized
light of wavelength 405.4 nm. It was steered toward a beta bar-
ium borate (BBO) crystal that produced photon pairs that werevertically polarized. Up to this point, this is a standard setup forundergraduate quantum optics experiments.
16,17In the central
section, collimators (C) collect photons into optical ﬁbers. They
were placed at 63/C14from the incident pump-beam direction and
located 1-m away from the crystal. Bandpass ﬁlters (F), set tocollect photons that are near the degenerate wavelength of810.8 nm, were attached to the collimators along with a
mounted iris. Before we continue with more detail of the cen-
tral section, we add that the third section is also standard:single-photon avalanche diode detectors (SPAD) fed digitalelectronic pulses from photon detections to an electronic count-
ing and coincidence unit, which in turn fed data to a laptop/
desktop with data acquisition programs written in
MATLAB .17
The central portion of the apparatus has several new com-
ponents. Figure 3shows a photograph that emphasizes this
section of the apparatus. The main component is a commer-
cial pre-aligned ﬁber-coupled beamsplitter (FCBS). Because
the polarization of the light has to be maintained, the ﬁbersare single mode and polarization maintaining (PMOF). Thetwo ﬁber inputs of the FCBS are connected to the collimators,
and the ﬁber outputs are connected to the two SPADs. The
ﬁrst departure from the standard experiments was the use ofPMOFs. They signiﬁcantly restricted the input light. To maxi-mize the coupling of the down-converted photons to the ﬁber,
we used collimators with adjustable focus (C). These collima-
tors have ﬁber connectors type FC, which lock the ﬁbers intoa speciﬁc orientation. To collect photon pairs with the samepolarization, both collimators were mounted to have the same
orientation of the FC connectors in their mount.
The collimators were mounted on mirror mounts via
adapters. One of the collimators’ mount was attached to amagnetic mount and placed in contact with an aluminum

plate with a 1-m radius of curvature (see Fig. 2) with center
of curvature located approximately at the position of the
crystal. The purpose of the latter was to allow the ﬂexibilityto translate the collimator sideways to optimize coincidencecounts. The curved path reduced/eliminated the walk-offerror that would be introduced if the collimator was trans-
lated linearly sideways. The other collimator’s mirror mount
was mounted on a double stack of translation stages set tomove the collimator toward or away from the crystal. Thebottom stage, attached to the breadboard, was a standard
manual translation stage with a micrometer screw, whose
purpose was to make coarse adjustments. On top of it was asmall motorized translation stage (MS) for doing an auto-matic scan of the crystal-collimator distance. The two stages
changed the photon-path difference.The last component of the arrangement was a pair of half-
wave plates. One was mounted on a manual rotation mountand the other on a motorized rotation mount (MW). They are
needed for two purposes: (1) to ensure that the photons enter
the optical ﬁbers with the same polarization orientation and(2) for scanning the polarization distinguishability of the
photons as described in Sec. III C.
III. TWO SITUATIONS
We describe the experiments in three parts. First, we
describe the HOM interference itself. Next, we describe twosituations where we can turn the interference on and off, one
based on the path length and the other based on the
polarization.
A. The HOM interference
This HOM interference phenomenon has been described
before in terms of number states.
13,18Here, we use an alter-
native approach in terms of momentum states. Photons 1 and
2 leaving their place of birth can arrive at the beamsplitter in
a state with either momentum jxiorjyi, as labeled in Fig. 2.
Each photon can be in these two possible states. Thus, the
full state of both photons is the tensor product of the two
photon spaces. Due to the bosonic nature of the quantumstate of the two photons, they must be described by a wave-
function that is symmetric by the interchange of the two par-
ticles. Thus, the initial state of the two photons is given by

ter (FCBS) provided the photon interference. Other hardware components included half-wave plates ( ^Whand ^W/) oriented by angles hand/to the vertical,
respectively, with one on a motorized rotation mount (MW); bandpass ﬁlters (F); adjustable-focus collimators (C), with one of them mounted on a motor ized
translation stage (MS) on top of a manual stage; polarization-maintaining optical ﬁbers (PMOFs); and single-photon avalanche diode detectors (SPA Ds).

That is, in the ﬁnal state, both photons end up traveling along
the same direction. Should we put photon detectors at eachoutput of the beamsplitter, we would not get any coinciden-
ces. Note that Eq. (8)is a nonseparable (entangled) state of
the two photons in the momentum degree of freedom.

In our photon counting experiment, when a photon impinges
on a detector, the detector outputs a pulse that is sent to anelectronic circuit. The circuit is set to record when a photonarrives at each of the two detectors within a certain time win-
dow, an event deﬁned to be a coincidence. In our HOM
experiment, the time window is about 40 ns and the interfer-ence effect results in no coincidences being detected.
Let us also consider the situation when there is no interfer-
ence, that is, when the photons are distinguishable. Forexample, suppose we know that one photon arrives before
the other because the length of paths of the photons from the
crystal to the beamsplitter are distinguishably not the same.Suppose also that the photon arrival time from differentpaths is still within the experimental coincidence window.
What would we measure?
One way to analyze the situation is this: assume photon 1
in momentum state jxi
1arrives at the beamsplitter distin-
guishably sooner than photon 2, which is in momentum statejyi
2. Then, the system’s initial state is jxi1jyi2and the ﬁnal
state will be

Thus, from Eq. (10), the probability of measuring a coinci-
dence experimentally will be P
c¼1=2. We get the same
result when we consider the other possibility, i.e., initial statejyi
1jxi2. To make it symmetric we could say that the ﬁrst
possibility occurs half the time and the second possibilityoccurs the other half. This still gives us P
c¼1=2.
Based on the previous discussion contrasting bosons and
fermions, we can repeat this analysis for the case of fer-mions. Then, the initial wavefunction must be antisymmetric[i.e., Eq. (3)with a minus sign instead of a plus sign],
because the total wavefunction must change sign with parti-cle exchange. The application of the beamsplitter operationpreserves the symmetry of the initial state, yielding an output
state that is antisymmetric (i.e., the same as the initial state),
underscoring that identical fermions cannot be in the state ofEq.(9). Thus, the symmetry of the wave function accounts
for the way the amplitudes combine in Eq. (1)(i.e., plus sign
for bosons and minus sign for fermions).
B. The dip
In parametric down-conversion, photon pairs are emitted
with energies E
1¼Eand E2¼E0/C0E, where E0is the
energy of the pump (parent) photon. Right before beingdetected, the photons go through energy ﬁlters, which restrictthe energy of the photons further. Thus, the apparatus detectsphotons in a superposition of energy states
jwi¼ð
dE aðEÞjEi
1jE0/C0Ei2; (14)
where aðEÞis a measure of the overall bandwidth of the pho-
tons that are being detected. The state of the photons in Eq.(14) is non-separable. That is, the photons are in an entangled
state of energy. Their exact energy is unknown to within arange of energies DEdetermined by aðEÞand they constitute a
wavepacket. As such, the photons are coherent to within thecoherence time Dt/C24h=DE,w h e r e his Planck’s constant.
Because ﬁlters are speciﬁed in terms of the wavelength, wecan express the energy bandwidth in terms of the wavelength:
DE¼hcDk=k
2,w h e r e cis the speed of light in vacuum. Thus,
a practical way to express the coherence is in terms of thelength of the wavepacket, also known as the coherence length
‘

Dk: (15)
If the photons arrive at the beamsplitter within the coherence
time, then they can be considered indistinguishable.(Assuming all other photon properties are identical.) Analternative reasoning is to say that the difference in the
310 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 4, April 2023 N. S. DiBrita and E. J. Galvez 310 04 October 2023 22:51:30
length of the two paths from the crystal to the beamsplitter is
less than the coherence length. What occurs in the intermedi-
ate cases? For that we need to go deeper into the quantum
mechanics formalism.
In Sec. III A , we analyzed the two extreme interference
situations: the photons are indistinguishable yielding no
coincidences, or the photons are distinguishable and coinci-dences are observed. In the former case, the photons are in a
quantum entangled state. In the latter, considering the two
possibilities, the photons are in a mixed state. To account for
mixed states, we need to resort to another quantum-
mechanical object for describing the state of the photons—the density matrix.

guishable case is given by the outer product of the vector

The landmark experiment by Hong, Ou, and Mandel dem-
onstrated the interference effect by scanning the differencein path and, therefore, the overlap of the interference of thetwo photon amplitudes, exhibiting a famous “dip” in thecoincidences. We can reproduce the dip analytically using asimple model. If we consider the photon wavepackets asGaussians with a width at half maximum given by ‘

where we have normalized the overlap such that pð0Þ¼1, as
shown in Fig. 4(b). If we now plot the coincidence probabil-
ity as a function of x0we recreate the famous HOM dip, as
shown in Fig. 4(c). We note that we present this simple
model just to capture the essence of the phenomenon as mea-
sured in the laboratory. A more accurate calculation wouldhave to take into account the actual measured bandwidth of
the light and other experimental details.
After following the alignment procedure outlined in
Appendix A and adjusting the waveplates so that photons are
input into the ﬁbers with the same polarization, the dip can
be found and scanned. In a lab experience lasting only a few
hours, the initial alignment is best done for the studentsbeforehand. Perhaps other students can bring the apparatusto this point as part of a several-week laboratory exercise, as
we do in the add-on lab of our quantum mechanics course.
17
Beyond this point students can be asked to “discover” the
dip, study it in some detail, and investigate the effect of the
bandpass ﬁlters on the width of the dip. In Fig. 5, we show
the measurement of the dip taken by an undergraduate stu-dent (the ﬁrst author of this paper), who did the experiment
as a senior capstone project. This scan of coincidences was
taken at 4 s per data point. The horizontal scale is the posi-tion of the motorized stage. (A
MATLAB program to acquire
such data is posted in our website, Ref. 17.) Data points were
taken every four stepper-motor steps of the motorized trans-lation stage, which correspond to a motion of the collimator
by 5.33 lm, or a time delay of 18 fs in arrival times of the
two photons. Error bars are the standard for Poisson statis-tics. Accidental coincidences were of the order of seven
counts.
The quality of the measured dip can be evaluated by the
visibility, deﬁned as v¼ðN
max/C0NminÞ=ðNmaxþNminÞ.W e
actually obtained this value by ﬁtting an inverted Gaussianto the data, giving v¼0:93, a remarkably good value, which
can be attributed largely to the advantage of using the com-
mercial ﬁber-coupled beamsplitter. The full width of the dipat half minimum (FWHM) is about 55 lm, which is of the
same order of the calculated coherence length of 66 lm.With a wider ﬁlter of (nominal) 30 nm bandwidth, we got
18lm, consistent with the calculation (22 lm). There is an
asymmetry in the shoulders of the dip. We saw different
shoulders when we did the experiment with different param-eters (ﬁlters and position of the collimators). It depends onthe shape of aðEÞin Eq. (14), which is related to the shape of
the transmission curve of each bandpass ﬁlter. We also note
that the dip appears only in the coincidence counts. The sin-gles counts (i.e., photons detected by each detector sepa-rately) are constant throughout the scan. It underscores that it
is a two-photon effect.
C. Polarization distinguishability
The photons reaching the beamsplitter can be distin-
guished by other degrees of freedom. That is, the path length
difference of the photons arriving at the beamsplitter can beset to zero, while the photons are still distinguishable. One
way this can be done is by manipulating their polarization.
18
The photons produced by type-I spontaneous parametric
down conversion have the same polarization. If we rotate thepolarization of one of them by 90
/C14, then the two photons are
distinguishable by polarization and the interference cancella-
tion disappears. If the polarization setting is between 0/C14and
90/C14, then the coincidence probability is somewhere in
between.
Because polarization is represented by two-dimensional
space, we can incorporate it in the pure-state description of
the light. The distinction between this and the situation ofSec. III B is more subtle, involving open and closed quantum
systems.21,22Without getting too technical, we proceed by
calculating the probability for this situation by fully account-
ing for polarization in the state of the light. It also providesan additional way to understand two-photon interference.
If we add the polarization degree of freedom for each pho-
ton, this doubles the Hilbert space of each photon, and there-
fore, the two-photon system becomes a 16-dimensionalHilbert space. Doing the matrix operations by hand is a bitunwieldy, with 16-element vectors and 16 /C216 operator
matrices, but using various software platforms, such as
MATHEMATICA or MATLAB , we can do the laborious linear-
algebraic steps easily. If we add polarization to the photon’sstate, then the initial state, where both photons are vertically
polarized is given by
jwi
i¼1ﬃﬃﬃ
2pjx;Vi1jy;Vi2þjy;Vi1jx;Vi2/C0/C1; (25)
where we have now added a label Vto the momentum state
of each photon in order to specify its polarization. Eachproduct state is of the form
jui¼x
y/C18/C19
1/C10H
V/C18/C19
1/C10x
y/C18/C19

where VandHspecify vertical and horizontal polarizations,
respectively. In the vector form, the initial state would be
jwii¼2/C01=2ð0000000100000100 ÞT. Before the pho-
tons reach the beamsplitter, they go through half-wave
plates. For symmetry, we add one for each momentum input.(Experimentally, two waveplates are needed to keep the opti-
cal path of the two photons as close to equal as possible.)
The waveplates for the xandymomentum states are oriented
by angles hand/relative to the vertical direction,

respectively. We can express the operator for a half-wave
plate oriented an angle hby
^Wh¼/C0cos 2h/C0sin 2h
/C0sin 2h cos 2h/C18/C19
: (27)
Because the two waveplates are attached to each momentum
state, the operator for the two waveplates acting on the spaceof the two photons has the form
^Z
h;/¼^Px/C10^Wh/C10^Py/C10^W/þ^Py/C10^W//C10^Px/C10^Wh;(28)
where ^Px¼jxihxjand ^Py¼jyihyjare projection operators
for the momentum states. It is left as an exercise for thereader to show that the state jwi0after the waveplates and
before the beamsplitter is
jwi0¼^Zh;/jwii¼1ﬃﬃﬃ
2pjx;2hi1jy;2/i2/C0
þjy;2/i1jx;2hi2Þ; (29)
where for simplicity we have labeled the polarization state
by the orientation of the polarization relative to the vertical
direction.
The beamsplitter acts only on the momentum states, leav-
ing the polarization states unchanged. Its operator is givenby
^B
4¼^B/C10^I/C10B/C10^I; (30)
where ^Iis the identity, representing the inaction of the
beamsplitter on the polarization degree of freedom. The nextsteps are mechanical: computing the ﬁnal state followed by acalculation of the coincidence probability. At this point inour lab program, we ask students not just to perform the cal-
culation but to devise how to calculate the coincidence prob-
ability P
cin the larger space following the prescription of
Eq.(10) and produce the result
Pc¼1
21/C0cos2ð2//C02hÞ/C2/C3
: (31)
Thus, the answer depends only on the relative orientations of
the two polarizations, which is 0 when they are equal.
Measurements for this section of the experiment follow
directly from the setup of the previous ones. Students canalso be given the freedom to take the data in whichever form
they decide. For example, the data of Fig. 6show a scan of
the angle /of the half-wave plate on the motorized mount.
It follows remarkably close to the expectation of Eq. (31) for
h¼0. At /¼645
/C14, the two input polarizations are orthog-
onal, and the coincidences are at a maximum, which corre-
spond to about 1150 counts, the same as the ones
corresponding to 1/2 probability in Fig. 5.A t/¼0;690/C14,
the polarizations are parallel, and we get destructive interfer-ence with about the same value of counts as at the dip.
Because of the simple functional form of the data of Fig. 6,
we ﬁt Eq. (31) with a visibility parameter vmultiplying the
cosine function, to the data (not shown to avoid clutteringthe ﬁgure), which resulted in an excellent match, with areduced chi-square of 1.04. The ﬁtted visibility was
v¼0:94, which is quite remarkable for a teaching laboratory
experience.IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we presented a simpliﬁed version of the
Hong–Ou–Mandel experiment that is suitable for the under-graduate instructional laboratory. The use of a ﬁber-coupled
beamsplitter greatly simpliﬁed the alignments. The develop-
ment of the experiment involved a one-semester senior cap-stone project. Once we knew how to overcome the
challenging parts of the apparatus, disassembly and reassem-
bly proceeded at the same pace as in other single-photon-
type of experiments. In Appendix A , we present some of our
recommendations for setup and alignment. We were quitesurprised by the high quality of the data, shown in Figs. 5
and6. Free-space alignment normally produces much lower
visibilities because of difﬁculties in the alignment. We foundthat the use of a motorized translation stage greatly stream-
lined ﬁnding the interference dip, and in making detailed
scans. The use of waveplates helped in ﬁnding the best visi-
bility, which was around 0.93–0.94. Such visibilities make
this experiment a strong demonstration of a purely quantuminterference effect. The motorized aspect of the scans also
allows the experiment to be performed remotely.

A discussion of this experiment leads to fundamental con-
cepts of quantum mechanics, such as the symmetry of thewavefunction. The lack of coincidence is indeed because the
wavefunction of the two photons must be symmetric due to
their bosonic nature. Should another part of the wavefunc-
tion, such as polarization24,25or spatial mode,26be antisym-
metric, it would require an antisymmetric momentumwavefunction so that the total wavefunction is symmetric.
This situation will lead to a maximum in the coinciden-
ces.26,27Our classical intuition leads us to associate a physi-
cal force (e.g., electromagnetic, gravitational) whenever
there is an interaction, but quantum mechanics allows such
an interaction between particles to exist just because they are
identical. This property also manifests tangibly with (identi-
cal) electrons in atoms via the exchange force (see Ref. 28
for an illuminating presentation). The same is the case here
with photons in a beamsplitter, which is also the basis for
using photons in quantum computation.29
The temporal overlap and polarization aspect of the
experiments presented above also underscores the require-
ment of indistinguishability for interference to occur. It
serves as a basis for discussing another remarkable quantum
Fig. 6. Recording of the coincidences as a function of the angular position /
of one of the half-wave plates, while the other half-wave plate was oriented
ath¼0/C14. Thus, the half-wave plate setting /is half the difference in the
angular orientation of the polarizations of the two photons.

interference experiment, also known as the “mind-boggling
experiment,” which exploits the indistinguishability aspects
of this interference phenomenon.30In that experiment, inter-
ference between photons of separate pairs is seen when the
two pairs are indistinguishable from each other, which leads
to important consequences for quantum computing purposes,
such as entanglement swapping,5teleportation,6and the
entanglement of multiple qubits. A recent discussion of the
more general case of Nphotons reaching the beam splitter
examines other situations not considered in this article.33
With quantum mechanics making irreversible inroads into
technology, experiments such as this one make students
appreciate the inner-workings of quantum mechanics. It con-stitutes an important step for understanding the technologicaltools of the future.

APPENDIX A: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
AND ALIGNMENT
Setting up the experiment must be done in stages. A ﬁrst
stage involves aligning the crystal and collimators for spon-
taneous parametric down-conversion. We did this with the
simplest of setups. The collimators are attached to multi-mode ﬁbers. We made marks on the breadboard where the
collimators should be placed, 1 m away from the crystal. We
used an alignment laser and a homemade plumb bob tomimic the path of the down-converted photons and couple
the light into the ﬁbers. Once this was done, we placed 30-nm ﬁlters on the collimators, turned the pump laser and the
detectors on, and looked for coincidences. After optimiza-
tion, the singles should be above 10 000 counts per second(e.g., for us it was /C2460 000 s
/C01), and the coincidences
between 5% and 10% of the singles counts.
Once the ﬁrst stage was completed, we disconnected the
multimode ﬁbers and attached the inputs of the ﬁber-coupledbeamsplitter to the collimators. At this point, it helped us to
couple the light from a laser into a ﬁber connected to one of
the outputs of the beamsplitter. We did this with a commerciallow-power handheld ﬁber-coupled laser, which could alsoserve as the alignment laser. The purpose of this was to sendthe light back from the collimators toward the crystal. We
used it to adjust the focus of the collimators to match the size
of the pump laser on the BBO crystal. This mode-matchingstep is important in coupling the photons into the ﬁbers.
After the previous stage was set, we observed singles
counts of the order 30 000 counts per second and about 800coincidences per second. At this point, we initiated thesearch for the dip in coincidences. Doing this by hand was
difﬁcult and tedious, mainly because the dip is of the order
of 10 lm wide, so very small steps of the translation stage
are needed, and that is difﬁcult to do by hand. Much easier isto do a motorized scan. This ﬁnds the dip reliably. We did soboth ways, and the motorized way was signiﬁcantly easier.
Once the dip was found, we switched to narrower band-
width ﬁlters (10 nm), which increased the width of the dip.
At this point, the dip was not optimally deep. The next andﬁnal stage involved adding identical waveplates in front ofboth collimators. Because they delay the light as it travelsthrough them, we had to ﬁnd the new location of the dip, dis-placed by the slight difference in thickness of the two wave-
plates. Adjustment of the relative orientation of the
waveplates at the dip location resulted in the best interfer-ence condition.

APPENDIX B: PARTS LIST
Table Ilists the main parts that are needed for this experi-
ment. Other parts can be obtained from Ref. 17. The central
piece for this experiment is the beamsplitter. As mentioned
earlier, we used a ﬁber-coupled beamsplitter, listed in the
table. It can also be custom-ordered to a commercial vendorof ﬁber-optical components with the speciﬁcation that it needsequal-length polarization maintaining ﬁbers and use a 50:50
beamsplitter at a wavelength of 810 nm. It can also be done
with a ﬁber beamsplitter,
15although we have not tried it.
