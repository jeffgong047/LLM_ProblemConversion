A lossless beamsplitter has certain (complex-valued) probability amplitudes for sending an
incoming photon into one of two possible directions. We use elementary laws of classical andquantum optics to obtain general relations among the magnitudes and phases of these probability
amplitudes. Proceeding to examine a pair of (nearly) single-mode wavepackets in the number-
states n
1jiand n2jithat simultaneously arrive at the splitter’s input ports, we ﬁnd the distribution of
photon-number states at the output ports using an argument inspired by Feynman’s scattering
analysis of indistinguishable Bose particles. The result thus obtained coincides with that of the
standard quantum-optical treatment of beamsplitters via annihilation and creation operators ^a
and ^a†. A simple application of the Feynman method provides a form of justiﬁcation for the

I. INTRODUCTION
In quantum optics, as in classical optics, beamsplitters
play an important role in many experimental settings.1,2
Typically, a lossless beamsplitter has two input ports (1 and
2) as well as two output ports (3 and 4). A well-collimated
wavepacket propagating in free space and arriving at one ofthe input ports can, to good approximation, be said to have
frequency x, wave-vector k¼x=cðÞ ^j, and polarization
state ^e.3,4Upon entering an input port, the incident packet
splits into a pair of wavepackets x;k3;^e ðÞ andx;k4;^e ðÞ that
emerge from ports 3 and 4 along the directions ^j3and ^j4,
respectively. In classical optics, one states that the E-ﬁeld
amplitude of the incoming packet, either E1^eorE2^e, divides
between those of the outgoing packets E3^eandE4^e. The var-
ious output-to-input ratios Eout=Ein(generally, four complex
numbers) then serve to specify the splitter’s operational char-acteristics. In practice, beamsplitters are often constructed inthe form of multilayer dielectric stacks, in which case their
characteristic output-to-input amplitude ratios are referred to
as their Fresnel reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients.
5–9In
this paper, we shall refer to the various Eout=Einratios as the
Fresnel coefﬁcients, even though the beamsplitter could have
a different physical structure such as a (lossless) diffraction
grating.
The classical output-to-input amplitude ratios Eout=Ein
also serve as the (complex) probability amplitudes for
single-mode wavepackets x;kin;^e ðÞ occupied by the single-
photon-number-state 1 jithat enter an input port and then
emerge from an output port as a single-mode packet
x;kout;^e ðÞ in the number state 1 ji.1,2In Sec. II, invoking the
principle of energy conservation (or, equivalently, photon-
number conservation) in addition to the classical time-reversal symmetry of lossless splitters,6,7we derive general
relations among the magnitudes and phases of the various
Eout=Einratios (i.e., Fresnel coefﬁcients) corresponding to
general-purpose lossless beamsplitters.
The behavior of a beamsplitter becomes much more com-
plex (and far more interesting) in the quantum regime, where
a multi-photon packet x;k1;^e ðÞ in the number-state n1ji
arrives at port 1 of the splitter, while a second packetx;k2;^e ðÞ in the number-state n2ji simultaneously arrives at
its port 2.10In Sec. III, we derive the distribution of photon-
number states in output ports 3 and 4 using an argument akin
to the one used by Richard Feynman in his scattering analy-
sis of indistinguishable Bose particles.11In a nutshell,
Feynman asserts that the photon (a Bose particle) should be
assumed to take all the allowed paths through a system, each
path having its own probability amplitude—a complex num-ber. When the various paths taken by the photon are physi-
cally indistinguishable, one must add all the probability
amplitudes that lead from a speciﬁc initial condition to a spe-ciﬁc ﬁnal condition along different paths, the goal being to
ﬁnd the overall probability amplitude of the corresponding
event. The probability of occurrence of the event is then the
squared absolute value of the probability amplitude thus
computed. The results of our analysis in Sec. IIIwill be seen
to be in complete accord with the standard quantum-optical
treatment of beamsplitters using the annihilation and creation
operators ^aand ^a
†, as explained in Sec. IV.
With its input in the nji10ji2state, the splitter resembles a
single-photon annihilator in the weak-reﬂectivity regime
when the output state approaches 1 ji3n/C01ji4. Similarly,
when the input state is nji11ji2, the splitter acts as a single-
photon creator in the limit when the state of the output
approaches 0 ji3nþ1ji4. These cases are brieﬂy discussed in
the examples presented at the end of Sec. IV, where we
argue that the well-known but often mysterious formulas
^anji¼ﬃﬃﬃnpn/C01ji and ^a†nji¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1pnþ1ji can be justi-
ﬁed even more directly by a straightforward application of
the Feynman method. The paper closes with a brief summary
and a few concluding remarks in Sec. V.
II. CHARACTERISTICS OF BEAMSPLITTERS
Consider a transparent (i.e., non-absorbing) beamsplitter
placed in a Michelson interferometer,5as shown in Fig. 1(a).
The Fresnel reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients at the
point of initial incidence are q¼qjjeiuqands¼sjjeius.

(Note that the interferometer is notrequired to have perpen-
dicular arms when a general splitter is used.)

Here, we are using the probability amplitudes w1andw2
for the emergence of a single photon from channel 1 or 2
instead of the returning E-ﬁeld amplitudes E1^eandE2^etypi-
cally used in classical optics for a unit-amplitude incident
E-ﬁeld ^e. Given that the overall probability of the photon
emerging from one or the other channel should equal 1 (i.e.,

The necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the satisfaction
of Eq. (3)are given below; any other choice of the phase
angles would make the required relation between q0s00jj and
q00s0jj dependent on D/¼/1/C0/2, an arbitrary parameter,
which is inadmissible because the intrinsic properties of a
beamsplitter should notdepend on its distance from the inter-
ferometer’s mirrors.

The above choice of the phase angles then necessitates that

The bottom line is that the splitter must have identical
magnitudes q0jjand q00jj for the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁ-
cients from its opposite sides and, similarly, identical magni-tudes s

coefﬁcients. The phase angles of q0andq00, however, need
not be the same, nor do the phase angles of s0ands00,
although u0

Additional restrictions on the various Fresnel coefﬁcients
are imposed by the requirements of time-reversal
Fig. 1. (a) The beamsplitter used in a Michelson interferometer provides two possible paths for an incoming photon, one that allows the photon to be reﬂ ected
back from mirror 1 (roundtrip phase ¼/1), and another that returns the photon after reﬂection from mirror 2 (roundtrip phase ¼/2). The returning photon has
a probability amplitude w1for emerging from channel 1 and a different amplitude w2for emerging from channel 2. (b) Given a speciﬁc angle of incidence and
a speciﬁc state of linear polarization, the splitter’s reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients q¼Eref=Eincands¼Etrans =Eincrepresent the complex amplitudes
of the reﬂected and transmitted E-ﬁelds corresponding to a unit-amplitude incident plane-wave. In general, the magnitudes and phases of qandscould depend
on the side of the splitter from which the incident beam arrives, hence the designations q;sðÞ ,q0;s0ðÞ ,q00;s00ðÞ ,q000;s000ðÞ for the four possible incidence
geometries.

interferometer are replaced by phase-conjugate mirrors,12we
must have
q/C3q0þs/C3s00¼1; (6)
q/C3s0þs/C3q00¼0: (7)
A phase-conjugate mirror reﬂects an incident beam with
itsE-ﬁeld magnitude intact but with the sign of its E-ﬁeld
phase reversed, causing the beam to retrace its path in space
as though the arrow of time had been reversed (i.e., the time
coordinate t!/C0 t). In the case of the Michelson interferom-
eter depicted in Fig. 1(a), replacing mirrors 1 and 2 with
phase-conjugate mirrors causes the reﬂected beams to return
to the beamsplitter with the complex conjugates of their ini-tial (complex) amplitudes, namely, q
/C3returning from mirror
1 and s/C3returning from mirror 2. Since the beams are now
retracing their original paths, they must combine at the split-ter to reconstruct the incident beam in channel 1—albeitphase-conjugated and propagating backwards—in accor-
dance with Eq. (6). There should be no (phase-conjugated)
beam returning through channel 2, since nothing had initiallyentered through this channel. The absence of a back-
propagating beam in channel 2 is now encoded in Eq. (7).
Multiplying Eq. (6)bys
0and Eq. (7)byq0, then subtract-
ing the second equation from the ﬁrst, we ﬁnd

III. NUMBER STATE njiPASSING THROUGH
A BEAMSPLITTER
An insightful argument in The Feynman Lectures on Physics
concerns the scattering of two or more indistinguishable Boseparticles (e.g., identical photons) into a given quantum state.11
Feynman explains why the probability of nidentical bosons
piling up within a single number-state njiis greater than the
corresponding probability for distinguishable particles by a fac-tor of n!. In this section, we begin by extending Feynman’s
argument to the problem of nidentical photons in a number
state njithat, upon arriving at a beamsplitter, split into two
groups of mandn/C0mphotons. We then proceed to generalize
the argument to the case of two (nearly) single-mode wave-packets x;k
1;^e ðÞ and x;k2;^e ðÞ , occupied by respective
number-states n1jiand n2ji, that enter a beamsplitter and sub-
sequently produce wavepackets in the number-states mji3and
n1þn2/C0m ji4at the splitter’s exit ports. (It is convenient to
assume that the splitter has perpendicular arms and symmetricFresnel coefﬁcients for its various input/output ports, even
though the analysis is readily extendible to the general case of
a non-perpendicular and asymmetric splitter such as the oneexamined in Sec. II.)
As shown in Fig. 2, a nearly single-mode light pulse (i.e.,
a large wavepacket) in the number-state njienters port 1 of a
conventional beamsplitter. The wavepacket is assumed to
have a large cross-sectional area (compared to k
2, where kis
the free-space wavelength) and a long duration (compared to2p=x), so that it is a good approximation to a traveling
monochromatic plane-wave; this is needed for the incoming
light pulse to be considered “single-mode.” The splitter and
the detector arrays are taken to be sufﬁciently large to fullyaccommodate such an incoming beam. The amplitude reﬂec-tion and transmission coefﬁcients of the splitter are qands,
with qjj
2þsjj2¼1 and /q/C0/s¼690/C14. The splitter is
assumed to be symmetric, with qandsbeing the Fresnel
coefﬁcients for both ports 1 and 2.13The photodetector
arrays in ports 3 and 4 are ﬁnely divided in the beam’s cross-
sectional plane, and also in the time domain, so that a single-
photon detection event can be attributed to a small areaDxDyin the cross-sectional plane, and also to a short time
interval Dt. The spatiotemporal dimensions Dx,Dy,Dtof all
detection cells must be as small as possible to enable unam-
biguous localization of individual photodetection events tothe extent allowed by physical laws.
14The total number of
cells associated with each detector array in space-time is,
Fig. 2. A nearly single-mode light pulse arrives in the number state njiat
port 1 of a conventional beamsplitter whose Fresnel reﬂection and transmis-
sion coefﬁcients are qands. Each photodetector array is ﬁnely divided in
the beam’s cross-sectional plane and also in the time domain, so that a
single-photon detection event can be attributed to a small area DxDyin the
cross-sectional xyplane, and also to a short time interval Dt.

thus, given by N¼NxNyNt; given the large volume of the
single-mode light pulse(s) under consideration, the numberNof detection cells will be assumed to be far greater than
the total number of the incoming photons. Detection of all n
photons within a speciﬁc set of ncells from the two detector
arrays constitutes a complete detection event.
In the following steps, we invoke Feynman’s reasoning to
calculate the number of ways that photons can be reﬂectedand transmitted at the beamsplitter.
(i) Assume at ﬁrst that the nphotons of incoming light
are distinguishable—as would be the case, forinstance, if they were small balls of differing colors.The probability amplitude for mphotons to reﬂect
while n/C0mphotons transmit at the splitter is q
msn/C0m.
(ii) Each detector cell in space-time has a probability 1 =N
of picking up an incoming photon with the corre-
sponding probability amplitude being 1 =ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Np
. The
amplitude associated with mphotons arriving at m
speciﬁc cells in port 3, and the remaining photonsarriving at n/C0mspeciﬁc cells in port 4, is, thus,
given by 1 =ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
mpﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nn/C0mp/C0/C1
¼1=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nnp
. Multiplying
this and the amplitude given in step (i), we obtain
qmsn/C0m=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nnp
for the amplitude of each complete
detection event.
(iii) Now we take into account the indistinguishability of
photons. For each speciﬁc set of detection cells, thereexist n!identical probability amplitudes, which must
be added together. This yields n!q
msn/C0m=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nnp
for the
total amplitude of such an event.
(iv) There existN
m/C18/C19
distinct combinations of detection
cells in port 3 and, similarly,N
n/C0m/C18/C19
distinct com-
binations of cells in port 4. Given that N/C29n/C21m,
the following approximation is well justiﬁed:

A similar approximation, of course, can be used for
N
n/C0m/C18/C19
. The total number of ways in which mpho-
tons get picked up at mcells in port 3 while the
remaining n/C0mare picked up at n/C0mcells in port
4 is, to an excellent approximation, given by
Nn=m!n/C0mðÞ ! ½/C138 . Considering that these detection
events are naturally distinguishable, it is their proba-
bilities (rather than their amplitudes) that must beadded together. This means that, to determine theoverall amplitude of detecting mphotons in port 3
(and n/C0min port 4), one must now multiply the
amplitude n!q
msn/C0m=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nnp
derived in step (iii) withthesquare root of the number of distinct detection
events, as follows:

m!n/C0mðÞ !p ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!pn
m/C18/C191=2
qmsn/C0m: (10)
(v) The above expression of the probability amplitude
for detecting mphotons in port 3 (and the remaining
n/C0min port 4) is almost complete except that it
needs to be normalized byﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
. To appreciate the
rationale for normalization, note that the correspond-ing probability of detecting mphotons in port 3,
namely, n!n
m/C18/C19
qjj2msjj2n/C0mðÞ, when summed over m
(from 0 to n), yields n!qjj2þsjj2/C16/C17n
¼n!instead of
the required value of 1 :0, hence the necessity of
normalization.
A different justiﬁcation for the need to normalize the prob-
ability amplitude of Eq. (10) byﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
is based on the detection
amplitude for the incoming light in the absence of thebeamsplitter. Upon removing the beamsplitter, the light
pulse will be fully detected by the detector array in port 4.
Each detection event will then have amplitude 1 =ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
np
,
which must be multiplied by n!to account for the indistin-
guishability of the photons. The total number of distinct con-
ﬁgurations of ndetection cells in port 4 is now
N
n/C18/C19
ﬃNn=n!, whose square root multiplied into n!=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Nnp
yields the overall amplitude for detecting all the incoming
photons at port 4 asﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
. Considering that the probability of
detecting all nphotons in this simple thought experiment
should be 1 :0, it is obvious that the results of such calcula-
tions must be normalized byﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
. We conclude that the
amplitude for detecting mphotons in port 3 (and the remain-
ingn/C0min port 4) is the normalized version of Eq. (10),
namely,n
m/C18/C191=2
qmsn/C0m.
Our elaborate ﬁve-step procedure for computing the
probability amplitudes of various photon numbers emerg-ing at the exit ports of a beamsplitter has now yielded aseemingly trivial result that is the same as what one
obtains if the nphotons entering through port 1 are all dis-
tinguishable from one another. The power of the method,however, is revealed when the same procedure is applied
to the case of two wavepackets in respective number-
states n
1jiand n2jientering through the input ports 1 and 2
of the beamsplitter. This is due to the fact that quantum
interference turns out to be far more consequential in the
latter case. The case of two wavepackets simultaneouslyarriving at input ports 1 and 2 will be discussed after thefollowing examples that pertain to the simpler case of a
single wavepacket in the number-state njientering through
port 1, as depicted in Fig. 2.

probabilities of mbeing 0, 1, or 2 will be 1 =4, 1 =2, 1 =4,

mji, it is seen that the packet exit-
ing port 3 approximates such a beam with c¼ﬃﬃﬃnpq=s.
The preceding analysis parallels Feynman’s “sum over
alternative paths that could lead to an event,” as described inhis QED book.15It is readily extended to the more general
case of two light pulses, one in the number state n1ji, the other
inn2ji, that simultaneously arrive at ports 1 and 2 of a lossless
beamsplitter. Assuming at ﬁrst that all the photons are distin-guishable, we take m
1photons from port 1 and m2from port 2
to go into port 3, with the remaining photons then emerging atport 4. For a speciﬁc choice of these m
1andm2photons, the
corresponding probability amplitude at the beamsplitter isq
m1sm2qn2/C0m2sn1/C0m1. Given that the number Nof detection
cells at each port is very large (i.e., N/C29n1þn2), the proba-
bility of detection at a speciﬁc set of m1þm2cells in port 3 is
1=Nm1þm2; similarly, the probability of detection at a speciﬁc
set of n1þn2 ðÞ /C0m1þm2 ðÞ cells at port 4 is
1=Nn1þn2/C0m1/C0m2. The product of these two probabilities is
1=Nn1þn2, whose square root must be taken as the probability
amplitude for the photons being picked up at those speciﬁccells in ports 3 and 4. Thus, the overall amplitude for theselected m
1þm2photons being picked up at a speciﬁc set of
cells in port 3 while the remaining n1þn2 ðÞ /C0m1þm2 ðÞ
photons are picked up at a speciﬁc set of cells in port 4 is

exist n1þn2/C0m1/C0m2 ðÞ !distinct ways of distributing the

Since these different conﬁgurations of our detector cells are

IV. ANALYSIS OF A BEAMSPLITTER USING

In quantum optics, the standard approach to analyze the
action of lossless beamsplitters on incoming photon-numberstates relies on the fundamental properties of the annihilationand creation operators ^aand ^a

isfy qjj2þsjj2¼1 and /q/C0/s¼690/C14. The splitter is
assumed to be symmetric, with qandsrepresenting the
Fresnel coefﬁcients for both input ports 1 and 2. Startingwith the 0 i
10i2/C12/C12/C12/C12 vacuum mode in the splitter’s input space
(ports 1 and 2), creation operators generate the number state

The last expression contains the probability amplitudes for the various number states m3i3m4¼n1þn2/C0m3i4/C12/C12/C12/C12 emerging
at ports 3 and 4. Note that, for each value of m3, one must add up all the probability amplitudes associated with terms m1and
m2whose sum equals m3.

Example 4 . Let n1¼n2¼1. The probability amplitudes
of the output states 0 i32i4/C12/C12/C12/C12 ,1i31i4/C12/C12/C12/C12 , and 2 i30i4/C12/C12/C12/C12 will then
beﬃﬃﬃ
2p
qs,q2þs2, andﬃﬃﬃ
2p
qs, respectively. Considering that
q2þs2/C12/C12/C12/C12¼qjj2/C0sjj2, it is clear that the three probabilities
will add up to 1. Also, when jqj¼jsj¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
, the probabil-
ity of the output being in the 1 i31i4/C12/C12/C12/C12 state vanishes. The two
input photons will then coalesce, appearing together either in
port 3 or in port 4 with equal probabilities. This, of course, isthe well-known Hong–Ou–Mandel effect.16
Note that, in the special case of q¼1=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
ands¼i=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p
,
the appearance of a single photon in each exit port requires
that both incoming photons be reﬂected, or both be transmit-ted, at the splitter. These two events have respective proba-
bility amplitudes q
2¼1=2 and s2¼i=ﬃﬃﬃ
2p/C0/C12¼/C01=2.
Since the two events are indistinguishable, their probabilityamplitudes must be added together, which results in zero
probability for the appearance of a single photon in each exitport. As for the 2-photon coalescence event in port 3 (or port4), the splitter must reﬂect one photon and transmit the other.
The amplitude for reﬂection at one input port and transmis-
sion at the other is qs¼i=2. Considering that qsjj
2¼1=4, it
is seen that the probabilities of the three possible outcomes
in this example fail to add up to 1 (that is,1
4þ14þ06¼1)
unless the relevant Bose enhancement factor (i.e., the radical
in Eq. (18)) for each of the 2-photon coalescence events is
properly accounted for.
It is in simple examples such as this that we ﬁnd a clear need
for invoking the arguments of Sec. III, which account for all
allowed distinguishable as well as indistinguishable detection
events. Even though, in practice, the detectors may not be subdi-
vided into a multitude of detection cells, the theoretical possibilityof such subdivisions (in both time and space) must be carefully
considered since, as a matter of principle, the distinguishable and
indistinguishable events require different treatments.
Example 5 . Let n
1¼n,n2¼0, and m3¼m1þm2¼1.
The probability amplitude for detecting exactly one photonin port 3 and n/C01 photons in port 4 isﬃﬃﬃnpqs
n/C01. Now, for a
given n, it is possible to choose qso small as to make the
magnitude of sn/C01arbitrarily close to unity. The above prob-
ability amplitude will then be ﬃﬃﬃﬃnpq(aside from a possible
phase factor). It is, thus, clear that the probability amplitude
for single-photon annihilation is proportional toﬃﬃﬃnp. (The
proportionality constant qis obviously needed here, since it
is the amplitude for a single photon to leave the incoming n-
photon packet via reﬂection at the beamsplitter.)
In the same setting, with qbeing sufﬁciently small, the
probability amplitude for 2-photon reﬂection at the splitter
isﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
nn/C01ðÞ =2p
q2, which is off by a factor ofﬃﬃﬃ
2p
when compared against the operator identity ^a2nji
¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
nn/C01ðÞp
n/C02ji . The discrepancy is due to the fact that
the splitter in this instance no longer acts as an elementary 2-
photon annihilator, simply because the emergence of n/C02ji
in port 3 is accompanied by the simultaneous appearanceof the 2-photon state 2 jiin port 4. A properly constructed
2-photon annihilator would consist of a pair of back-to-backsplitters (each having a sufﬁciently small reﬂection coefﬁ-cient q), so that transmission of an n-photon wavepacket
through the ﬁrst splitter results in the loss of a single photon,
followed by the loss of a second photon upon passagethrough the second splitter. With the caveat that a single pho-
ton has appeared in port 3 of each splitter, the state of the
wavepacket emerging at the second splitter’s port 4 will now
beﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
nn/C01ðÞp
q
2n/C02ji .
The artiﬁcial device of a weak beamsplitter followed by a
reliable photodetector used in the present example is conve-nient, of course, but by no means necessary. A single atomin its ground state, capable of absorbing a photon of energy
/C22hxfrom the single-mode number state nji, will also exhibit
an absorption probability amplitude proportional toﬃﬃﬃnp. This
is because each incident photon has a 1 =nprobability (corre-
sponding to a 1 =ﬃﬃﬃnpamplitude) of being absorbed by the
atom. Since the photons are indistinguishable, their absorp-tion amplitudes must be added together, yielding an overallprobability amplitude of n=ﬃﬃﬃnp¼ﬃﬃﬃnpfor single-photon
annihilation.
Example 6 . Let n
1¼n,n2¼1, and m3¼m1þm2¼0.
The probability amplitude for detecting exactly nþ1 pho-
tons in port 4 isﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1pqsn. Once again, for a given n,i ti s
possible to choose qso small as to make the magnitude of sn
arbitrarily close to unity. The probability amplitude, aside
from a possible phase factor, will then be ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1pq. The
amplitude for single-photon creation is, thus, seen to be pro-
portional toﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
nþ1p
. (The proportionality constant qis
needed here, since it is the amplitude for the single photonarriving at port 2 to bounce off the splitter and merge withthen-photon packet that enters through port 1 and goes
directly to port 4.)
In analogy with the preceding example, consider a single
atom in an excited state, capable of emitting a photon ofenergy /C22hxinto the number state njiof a single-mode wave-
packet that engulfs the atom. The probability amplitude that
this emission will raise the number-state to nþ1ji is propor-
tional toﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1p, ostensibly due to the possibility of stimula-
tion of the atom by any one of the nincoming photons or by
the corresponding vacuum mode.
17These nþ1 possibilities,
each with its probability amplitude of 1 =ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1p, are indis-
tinguishable and, therefore, their amplitudes must be addedtogether, yielding an overall probability amplitude ofﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1pfor single-photon creation.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The classical Fresnel reﬂection and transmission coefﬁ-
cients qandsthat relate the complex E-ﬁeld amplitudes of
the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted beams at the inputand output ports of a lossless beamsplitter can also serve asprobability amplitudes for single-photon reﬂection and trans-
mission at the corresponding ports. We have shown that, in
general, while qjj(and also sjj) must be the same for differ-
ent available input/output ports—satisfying qjj
2þsjj2¼1
in every instance—the phase angles uqassociated with dif-
ferent pairs of input/output ports could differ from oneanother, as can the phase angles u
s. Nevertheless, the man-
datory relations existing among the various phase angles
ensure the universality of the essential properties of beam-
splitters. For most practical applications where the splitters

are designed to have lateral symmetry as well as symmetry
between their front and back sides, the relation uq/C0us
¼690/C14will hold, with all pairs of input/output ports sharing
the same uqand also the same us.
The main goal of the paper has been to derive the proba-
bility amplitudes for different photon-number states that
emerge at the output ports of a lossless beamsplitter when
wavepackets in the number states n1ji and n2ji simulta-
neously arrive at its input ports. We used an extension of the
argument originally made by Feynman in his scattering anal-
ysis of indistinguishable Bose particles to arrive at our ﬁnal
result given in Eq. (17). We also showed how the same result
is obtained using standard methods of quantum optics that
rely on the properties of annihilation and creation operators
^aand ^a†; see Eq. (22). The operator-based methods, of
course, are powerful and ﬂexible and can handle complexproblems beyond the reach of our elementary arguments. For
example, one can use the operator algebra to prove that two
wavepackets in the Glauber coherent states c
1ji and c2ji
entering a lossless beamsplitter will emerge as coherent
states qc1þsc2 ji and sc1þqc2 ji at the corresponding
exit ports.18This and numerous other examples notwith-
standing, we believe that, for pedagogical purposes, it is
worthwhile seeing that the very important property of
beamsplitters given in Eq. (22) can be “explained” at a more
elementary level using the simple addition of probability
amplitudes associated with indistinguishable events.
The addition of probability amplitudes was also invoked
in Examples 5 and 6 to elucidate the Bose enhancement
implicit in the standard formulas ^anji¼ﬃﬃﬃnpn/C01ji and
^a†nji¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃnþ1pnþ1ji . In the presence of a single-mode
wavepacket in the number-state nji, the resonant absorption
of a photon by an atom in its ground state, or the stimulated
emission of a photon by an atom in an excited state, could
serve as simple examples to corroborate the action of annihi-
lation and creation operators via a straightforward applica-
tion of the Feynman method.
The feasibility of detecting the individual photons of a
wavepacket at speciﬁc locations in space and time served as
a basis for our method of analyzing the behavior of a beam-
splitter that culminated in Eq. (17). While detector arrays
capable of localizing individual photons in space and time
are commercially available nowadays, it is not known
whether the corresponding technologies have reached their
physical limits, or if more accurate detector arrays with
smaller pixels, narrower dead-zones, less jitter, and shorter
reset times will become available in the future. It is intrigu-
ing to contemplate the fundamental limitations that existing
(or future) photodetector arrays impose on the minimum
detector area DxDyand also on the minimum detection time
Dt. At a fundamental level, it might be useful to know, for
instance, if pinpointing individual photons with smaller
detector cells would require longer exposure times.
We close by speculating that the required normalization of
Eq.(10) byﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
(and of Eq. (16) byﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃn1!n2!p) may be inti-
mately tied to the action of the n-fold annihilation operator
^anon the number-state nji, which is formally expressed as
^annji¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
0ji. The process described in Sec. III, where all
nphotons contained in a single-mode packet are absorbed
by the detectors, is essentially an n-photon annihilation
operation that should end up in the unnormalized vacuum
stateﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
0ji. It is, therefore, plausible that the probability
amplitudes obtained by adding up the amplitudes of allthe indistinguishable events should require normalization
by the corresponding Bose enhancement factor, namely,ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
n!p
. Similarly, in the case of two single-mode packets arriv-
ing in the number states n1ji and n2ji at ports 1 and 2, the
ﬁnal vacuum state (reached after detecting all the incoming
photons) should beﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃn1!n2!p0ji, which necessitates that the
various probability amplitudes evaluated at the exit ports benormalized by the corresponding enhancement factorﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃn
1!n2!p.

10For there to be an arrival time and an exit time, the incoming electromag-
netic ﬁelds must be in the form of multimode wavepackets with large
cross-sectional areas and long durations to properly approximate single-
mode photon-number states—hence our use of the qualiﬁer “nearly” when
referencing single-mode wavepackets. When discussing two packets that
arrive simultaneously at the input ports 1 and 2 of a beamsplitter, we envi-
sion identical packets whose leading edges arrive simultaneously at the

entrance ports. In a thought experiment, one may imagine packets as large
as they need to be for the approximation to reach the desired level of accu-
racy. In practice, optical wavepackets with cross-sectional areas of about
1c m2and durations of a few nanoseconds will probably sufﬁce.

13The symmetry is not needed for our initial discussion, but will be invoked
later, when we extend the argument to the case of incoming wavepackets
with n1andn2photons simultaneously arriving at ports 1 and 2. Strictly
speaking, even in the latter case, the symmetry of the splitter is merely
convenient but not necessary for the validity of the argument.
14While the time interval Dtin a practical setup might include the measure-
ment time plus a photocell reset time (following each single-photon detec-
tion event), for the purposes of our thought experiment, the reset time istaken to be vanishingly small. We are also ignoring the possibility that two
or more photons might arrive simultaneously within a single detection
cell, since the available cells vastly outnumber the incoming photons. The
ultimate justiﬁcation for such assumptions is that our ﬁnal results coincidewith those obtained by the conventional methods of quantum optics, as
demonstrated in Sec. IV.

17Assigning a probability to stimulated emission when none of the incident
photons participate in the process might seem questionable. Recall, how-
ever, that the quantum rule ^a†0ji¼1jiallows for the stimulation of the
excited atom by vacuum ﬂuctuations.
