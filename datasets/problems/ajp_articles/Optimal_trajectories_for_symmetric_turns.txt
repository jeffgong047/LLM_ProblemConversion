The problem of determining minimal time trajectories in a plane constrained by an upper bound on
the magnitude of the acceleration vector is reexamined. In the previous work [Am. J. Phys. 49(7),
685–688 (1981)], a stationary solution of a functional, applied over curves in two-dimensional
velocity space, was used to ﬁnd explicit expressions for what was claimed to be a minimum turn
time trajectory. In this paper, this work is furthered by a formal demonstration that the turn time
associated with this trajectory is indeed lower than that corresponding to any other smooth
trajectory. Supporting evidence for this claim is provided by numerical procedures, which aredeveloped to allow comparisons between the turn times of competing trajectories across a range of
parameter values of the turn width, the initial speed, and the magnitude of the acceleration vector.

I. INTRODUCTION
Determining an optimal path that satisﬁes a set of con-
straints is a problem that has been studied for many years.
Such problems have widespread applications. For example,Dubins1investigated the shortest smooth path, constrained
by an upper bound on the average curvature, that connects
two points in the Euclidean plane with prescribed tangents.Such works have found applications in optimal control theo-
ries, planning algorithms, aeronautics, and robotics.2,3An
interesting analog of Dubin’s work, which was addressed byPalffy-Muhoray and Unruh,4involved the determination of a
curve of the minimum length in two-dimensional velocity
space constrained by an upper bound on the magnitude ofthe acceleration along with prescribed boundary conditions
on velocities and positions. An immediate application of this
work was a method for determining a minimal turn-time tra-jectory, which will be referred to here as an “optimal
trajectory.” They offered no formal proof of optimality.

This paper presents two separate lines of evidence to conﬁrm
that their result is an optimal trajectory when certain classes
of positional and velocity boundary conditions are imposed.
The following example illustrates the problem considered
in this paper. An automobile is traveling west along thesouthern border of a large uniformly paved empty lot, and
the driver wants to make a U-turn (180
/C14turn) as quickly as
possible without skidding with the requirement that, at theconclusion of the U-turn, the driver will be at a distance L
north of their current location and traveling east at the same
speed as the initial westbound speed. Which path and trajec-tory should be followed to minimize the turnaround time?
Here, the “path” refers to a curve in the plane, while
“trajectory” refers to the time parameterization of the planecurve given by the components of the associated vector val-
ued function xðtÞ;yðtÞ/C10/C11
.
LetOð0;0ÞandPð0;LÞbe the starting and ending points
of the turn. Here, the northernly direction aligns with thepositive y-axis, and the points Oand Pshare the same
abscissa (longitude). In terms of the components of the tra-
jectory, the point Oisxð0Þ;yð0Þ ðÞ ,a n di f Tdenotes the
time, it will take to complete the turn, then the point Pcan
be written as xðTÞ;yðTÞ ðÞ . Taken together this information
deﬁnes the following two pairs of positional boundary
conditions :x0ðÞ¼0;y0ðÞ¼0;xTðÞ¼0;yTðÞ¼L: (1)
The turn time
Twill depend on several factors, including the
initial and ﬁnal velocities v0and vf. For the main problem,
these velocities can be expressed in the plane vector form as
v0¼/C0 v0;0 hi ;vf¼v0;0hi ; (2)
where v0is the initial speed. The expressions in Eq. (2)are
symmetric with respect to the vertical axis in velocity space,
and these will be referred to as the velocity boundary condi-
tions . In this paper, the use of the phrase “symmetric turns”
primarily alludes to the symmetry of the velocity boundary
conditions, but the term also relates to the fact—which willbe seen later—that the optimal trajectory will be symmetricwith respect to the time T=2 and to the line y¼L=2.
It was shown in Ref. 4that to minimize the turn time, the
magnitude of the acceleration ajjmust be constant during the
turn.
4A proof of this fact is provided in the Appendix .
Trajectories with constant a¼ajjwill be referred to as
trajectories of constant magnitude acceleration or simply as
“a-trajectories,” where the latter is used in contexts where a
class of trajectories, each associated with a particular value
ofa, is considered. The minimal time trajectory will be an
a-trajectory; however, as will be seen, there are innumerable
a-trajectories that satisfy prescribed boundary conditions on
the position and velocity, which are not optimal.
The restriction on ajjcan be connected to a no-skid condi-
tion by considering the frictional force exerted by the pave-
ment on the car’s tires. Here, an appeal can be made to asimple model in which the upper bound for ajjis equated to
l
sg;where lsis the coefﬁcient of static friction and gis the
acceleration due to gravity. If ajjdoes not exceed lsg, trac-
tion will be maintained and no skidding will occur. If skid-
ding occurred, the frictional force would decrease because
the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction lkis less than ls. Also,
because skidding could occur at different locations and forvarying durations along a path, it is difﬁcult to calculate or
predict its effect on the total turn time. Thus, the no-skid
restriction simpliﬁes the analysis by limiting the ﬁeld of via-ble trajectories.
Before obtaining the minimal time trajectory and its corre-
sponding path, a preliminary problem will be addressed that
is similar to the main problem in its underlying assumptions
425 Am. J. Phys. 91(6), June 2023 http://aapt.org/ajp #2023 Published under an exclusive license by AAPT 425 04 October 2023 22:52:43
and boundary conditions; however, it differs in that infor-
mation about the car’s speed proﬁle vðtÞbut not its direc-
tion—that is, not the complete velocity vector vðtÞ—will
be assumed beforehand. In this case, imagine that the vehi-cle is autonomous, and its systems are programed to calcu-
late and execute a particular type of speed proﬁle vðtÞ
throughout the course of the turn. Upon incorporating thisadditional constraint, the problem to be addressed is that of
ﬁnding the a-trajectory for a given type of vðtÞthat satisﬁes
the boundary conditions. With or without the constraintimposed on vðtÞ, these types of problems stand in contrast
to those that restrict the actual motion to pre-determined
paths (see, e.g., Ref. 5).
A brief outline of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II,a
method is developed for determining a-trajectories when the
speed proﬁle vðtÞis given beforehand, and an analogous
method is discussed in Sec. IIIwhen a functional relationship
is speciﬁed between the components of the velocity vector
v¼v
x;vy hi . These methods, which are used to solve the pre-
liminary problem, will allow for numerical turn time com-parisons between various a-trajectories. In Sec. IV, the
trajectory obtained in Ref. 4is applied speciﬁcally to the
main problem, and in Sec. V, some numerical turn time cal-
culations are made and compared for three distinct a-trajec-
tories using speciﬁc values for a,L, and v
0. Section VI
contains a formal demonstration that the turn time associated
with the claimed optimal trajectory is indeed lower than thatcorresponding to any alternative smooth trajectory. In the
supplementary material,
6other numerical results and a
graphical procedure are marshalled to provide additionalsupportive collaborative evidence for the mathematical proof
given in Sec. VI.

components of the velocity vector by
dx

dt¼vy¼vtðÞsin/tðÞ; (5)
where /is the tangential angle, that is, the angle that the
velocity vector vmakes with the horizontal. The radius r
used in Eq. (4)is the reciprocal of the curvature jand can be
expressed in terms of the arclength sand the tangential angle
as (see Ref. 7, Sec. 13.4)j¼1

ds: (6)
Because v¼ds=dt, Eq. (6)becomes jv¼v=r¼d/=dtjj .
Inserting this value for v=rinto the right equality of Eq. (4)
yields the time derivative d/=dt¼6aN=v. The proﬁle
involving a decreasing /will be used here (negative sign),
and solving for /in this case yields
/tðÞ¼/0/C0ðt

vsðÞds; (7)
where /0is the initial heading. Note that aNcan be found
directly from the speed proﬁle v(t) by ﬁnding aNfrom Eq.
(4)and then solving Eq. (3)foraN. It will also be assumed
thatvðsÞ>0 for 0 /C20s/C20tin order to ensure that the integral
does not diverge. From this point, both xtðÞandytðÞcan be
found in terms of vby integrating Eq. (5). With Oas the
starting point, the a-trajectory becomes
xtðÞ¼ðt
0vsðÞcos/sðÞðÞ ds;ytðÞ¼ðt
0vsðÞsin/sðÞðÞ ds:
(8)
The results in Eqs. (7)and(8)are completely determined by
the value of a, the initial position, and the speed proﬁle vðtÞ.
However, the choice of vðtÞcannot be completely arbitrary.
Because aN¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

, the speed proﬁle must be cho-
sen so that the value of v0ðtÞ/C12/C12/C12/C12does not exceed a.
For the case of constant speed motion with vtðÞ¼v0, the
tangential acceleration aT¼dv=dtis zero, and from Eqs. (3)
and (4), the quantity aNequals a, which is the maximum
value of ajj. Therefore, from Eq. (4), the radius of curvature
has a constant value R¼v2
0=a, and from Eq. (7), the function
/tðÞ¼/C0 a=v0ðÞ tþ/0. Thus, from Eq. (8),
xtðÞ¼/C0Rsin/tðÞðÞ /C0sin/0ðÞ/C0/C1
;
ytðÞ¼Rcos/tðÞðÞ /C0cos/0ðÞ/C0/C1
: (9)
This veriﬁes the expected result that the a-trajectory traces
out a circular path.
A. Satisfying the boundary conditions
For a prespeciﬁed speed proﬁle vðtÞwith given accelera-
tion magnitude a¼ajj, the associated a-trajectory
xðtÞ;yðtÞ/C10/C11
from Eq. (8)will satisfy the boundary conditions
at point Obecause x0ðÞ¼y0ðÞ¼0 and because v0ðÞ
¼x0ð0Þ;y0ð0Þ/C10/C11
¼/C0 v0;0 hi ¼v0. However, in general, the
trajectory in Eq. (8)will not satisfy the boundary conditions
at point Pas it is not guaranteed that the trajectory
xtðÞ;ytðÞ/C10/C11
will include the point 0 ;LðÞ or that x0ðtÞ;y0ðtÞ/C10/C11
will equal 0 ;v0hi ¼vfat any particular time. This failure can
be illustrated by applying the constant speed a-trajectory
from Eq. (9)to the main problem. For this situation, the
desired path is semicircular with a radius of curvature ofL=2, and since a
T¼0, it follows from Eq. (3)thatv0¼v0jj
must equalﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
aL=2p
in order for the path to cross P.I fv0is
any other value, the trajectory will not cross P. Furthermore,
this constant speed a-trajectory is unique in that any other
trajectory satisfying the same boundary conditions will either
426 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 6, June 2023 Stephen Kaczkowski 426 04 October 2023 22:52:43
not be a constant speed trajectory or will not be an a-
trajectory.
Next consider the case where the tangential acceleration
aTis constant and non-zero. Then the speed proﬁle has the
simple form vtðÞ¼v0þaTt, which allows for analytic solu-
tions to Eq. (8). Because both aandaTare constant, Eq. (3)
shows that the quantity aNis constant as well. For this situa-
tion, Eq. (7)becomes
/tðÞ¼/0/C0aN
aTln 1 þtaT
v0/C18/C19
: (10)
After integrating by parts and using trigonometric sum iden-
tities for sine and cosine, Eq. (8)becomes
xtðÞ¼/C0 a2þ3a2
T/C0/C1/C01=2v2sin//C0c ðÞ /C0 v2
0sin/0/C0c ðÞ/C2/C3

and

0cos/0/C0c ðÞ/C2/C3
;
(12)
where c¼arctan 2 aT=aN ðÞ . (In these equations, the time
dependence on vand/has been suppressed.)
Although the trajectory in Eqs. (11) and(12) satisﬁes the
boundary conditions at point O, it will not, in general, satisfy
the boundary conditions at point P. One way to remedy this
problem is to use a piecewise linear speed proﬁle of the form
vtðÞ¼v0þaT
2T/C0T/C02t jj ðÞ : (13)
In this model, the value of the tangential acceleration for 0
/C20t<T=2i s aTbecause along this interval vtðÞ¼v0þtaT.
ForT=2<t/C20T,t h es p e e di s vtðÞ¼v0/C0taTþTaT,a n dt h e
value of the tangential acceleration is /C0aT. Conveniently, this
vtðÞsatisﬁes both the velocity boundary conditions from Eq.
(2)at times t¼0a n d t¼T, and for suitable choices of aTand
T, the corresponding a-trajectory will also satisfy all the posi-
tional boundary conditions given in Eq. (1).T h es p e e dp r o ﬁ l e
in Eq. (13) is an idealized mathematical model that (for
aT>0) may roughly describe speed variations associated with
a period of sustained positive tangential acceleration followed
by a period of braking. For this situation, v0w o u l dh a v et ob e
less thanﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
aL=2p
in order for the a-trajectory to include the
point P.I fv0were greater thanﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
aL=2p
, then the speed proﬁle
in Eq. (13)would model the opposite situation (i.e., for aT<0)
of a deceleration followed by an acceleration in speed.
For this speed proﬁle, the trajectory xtðÞ;ytðÞ/C10/C11
for 0 /C20t
/C20T=2 can be found from Eqs. (11) and (12), and for
T=2<t/C20T, the remaining portion of the trajectory xtðÞ;/C10
ytðÞican be obtained using the identity
xtðÞ;ytðÞ/C10/C11
¼xT/C0t ðÞ ;L/C0yT/C0t ðÞ/C10/C11
: (14)
Now as the motion proceeds from OtoP, the tangential
angle decreases from /0¼pto/f¼0. (Note: Because the
magnitude ofaTdoes not change for the speed proﬁle in Eq.
(13), the change in the sign ofaTatt¼T=2 will not produce
a discontinuity in /tðÞor in either component of the resulting
trajectory.)For a speciﬁc value of the initial speed v0, the suitable
choices of aTandTin Eq. (13) can be obtained as follows.
First apply Eq. (10) over the time interval 0 ;T=2 ½/C138 and use
/T=2ðÞ ¼p=2 to obtain an expression for T=2. Then appeal-
ing to the symmetries of velocity proﬁle and the trajectory,double this result to obtain

: (15)
At this point, the value of aTis still unknown, but it can be
obtained numerically from Eq. (12) using the constraint
yðT=2Þ¼L=2, which can also be expressed in the form

(16)
where ~aTis the dimensionless parameter given by ~aT
¼aT=a. (In this paper, Greek letters and symbols with a tilde
represent dimensionless quantities.) In fact, given ﬁxed val-
ues of L,a, and v0, there exists a unique value of ~aT(and,
thus, of aT), which will enable the resulting a-trajectory to
satisfy the one remaining positional boundary condition at
point P. This is possible because the expression on the right
hand side of Eq. (16), when viewed as a function of ~aT, has a
range of 0 ;1ðÞ and is increasing over the interval
/C01<~aT<1. Then using the value of aTfound from Eq.
(16) together with the resulting value of Tfrom Eq. (15)
allows the piecewise linear speed proﬁle from Eq. (13) to be
fully speciﬁed. In conclusion then, the corresponding a-tra-
jectory from Eqs. (11),(12), and (14) can be obtained explic-
itly from the fully speciﬁed speed proﬁle in Eq. (13).
The above analysis can be applied to other types of speed
proﬁles through numerical (as opposed to analytical) meth-
ods. For example, a parabolic speed proﬁle such as vtðÞ¼v0
þ4T/C02v0/C0v1 ðÞ tt/C0TðÞ or a sinusoidal proﬁle vtðÞ¼v0
þv0/C0v1 ðÞ sinp3t/C0T ðÞ =T/C0/C1
may be integrated to determine
a-trajectories where v1andTmay be found from the bound-
ary conditions.
III. CONSTRUCTING AN a-TRAJECTORY FROM A
GIVEN FUNCTION IN VELOCITY SPACE
Ana-trajectory associated with a symmetric turn can also
be generated if a functional relationship between the compo-
nents of v¼vx;vy hi is speciﬁed. That is, instead of specify-
ingvðtÞ, as in Sec. II,a na-trajectory can also be determined
if a functional relationship of the form vy¼fvxðÞis assumed.
In some cases, it is easier to obtain an a-trajectory from the
rectangular form of vas opposed to the polar form v¼v;/ðÞ
used earlier. To proceed, recall that a¼v0tðÞ/C12/C12/C12/C12where
v0tðÞ¼dvx=dt;dvy=dt/C10/C11, and if vyis expressed as a function
ofvxin the form vy¼fvxðÞ, then T¼a/C01ÐT

functional notation,

Here, the differential of time has been expressed by

1þf0vxðÞ/C2/C32q
dvx=a, and the function fsatisﬁes the
427 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 6, June 2023 Stephen Kaczkowski 427 04 October 2023 22:52:43
boundary conditions in Eq. (2). The functional Tv y½/C138serves
as a mapping that associates each velocity space curve vyto
a speciﬁc value of the turn time T. By replacing Tv y½/C138with t
and vf;xwith vx, the resulting expression deﬁnes vxas an
implicit function of time, and if the integrand has a straight-
forward antiderivative, an explicit analytic solution for vxtðÞ
may be obtainable. If so, then vycan also be expressed in
terms of time using vytðÞ¼fvxtðÞðÞ , and the a-trajectory
xðtÞ;yðtÞ/C10/C11
can be found by integrating each component of v
with respect to time.
In Sec. II, a piecewise linear speed proﬁle was used to
obtain an analytical expression for an a-trajectory. Finding
ana-trajectory from a function of the form vy¼fvxðÞis eas-
ier if fis an even function because then the boundary condi-
tion xðTÞ¼0 will be satisﬁed. This is because if fis even,
then the integrand in Eq. (17) will also be even, and conse-
quently, the velocity boundary conditions in Eq. (2)hold.
Furthermore, from Eq. (17), it follows that the components
ofvwill satisfy
vxtðÞ¼/C0vxT/C0t ðÞ ;vytðÞ¼vyT/C0t ðÞ (18)
for 0 /C20t/C20T, and therefore, xTðÞ¼ÐT
0vxdt¼0.
To illustrate, let function fbe the function
fvxðÞ¼bv0/C0vxjj ðÞ ¼vy; (19)
where the parameter bwill be chosen so that the boundary
condition L¼yTðÞwill be satisﬁed. Now the quantity Lcan
also be viewed as being dependent on vy, and the following
functional notation highlights this relationship:
Lvy½/C138¼1

Then substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (20) yields
La=v2
0¼bﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
1þb2;q
(21)
which allows bto be determined. Then from Eq. (17), the
turn time Tcan be found in terms of this value of busing the
equation
T¼2v0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1þb2q
=a¼2L=bv0ðÞ : (22)
Replacing Tv y½/C138with tandv0with vxin the upper limit of
Eq.(17) and integrating using the function fvxðÞ from Eq.
(17) leads to the expression
vxtðÞ¼/C0v0þat=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1þb2q
; (23)
and from this point, vytðÞcan be obtained from Eq. (19).
Finally, the a-trajectory xðtÞ;yðtÞ/C10/C11
can be found by integrat-
ingvðtÞ¼ vxtðÞ;vytðÞ/C10/C11with respect to time.
IV. MINIMAL TURN TIME TRAJECTORIES
Among the various types of velocity proﬁles that satisfy
the boundary conditions in Eq. (2), the following proﬁle,
which was derived from Ref. 4, will be shown to correspond
to the optimal a-trajectory:vy¼fvxðÞ¼v0c/C01cosh cðÞ/C0cosh cvx=v0 ðÞ/C0/C1: (24)
Here, cis a dimensionless parameter that can be found from
the boundary condition L¼yTðÞ. This expression was
obtained in Ref. 4from the solution of an isoperimetric prob-
lem (Ref. 10, Chap. 4) using standard techniques from varia-
tional calculus. For each non-zero value of c, the function
vy¼fvxðÞ from Eq. (24) is a catenary. When cis positive,
the catenary is inverted, and if cwere to assume a negative
value, then the catenary would be upright. As capproaches
0, the curve approaches the horizontal line vy¼0:
As described in Sec. III,a n a-trajectory can be obtained
from the function vy¼fvxðÞ. Substituting Eq. (24) into Eq.
(17) and evaluating the deﬁnite integral allow the turn time
Tto be expressed in the form
T¼2v0
asinh cðÞ
c/C18/C19
: (25)
Replacing Twith tandv0with vxin the upper limit in Eq.
(17) allows for a time dependent expression for vx, and
upon substituting this expression for vxtðÞinto the function
vy¼fvxðÞ found in Eq. (17), a time dependent expression
forvycan also be obtained. The results are

needs to be determined from Eq. (29) before the function
vtðÞcan be plotted and the turn time Tcan be calculated.
Figure 1(b) shows corresponding plots of the paths from the
initial point Oð0;0Þto the destination point Pð0;LÞ. These
graphs were obtained from plotting Eqs. (27) and(28) over
the interval 0 /C20t/C20T, and here higher v0values correspond
to curves that extend further westward.
In these optimal a-trajectories, the speed proﬁle vtðÞ
invariably drops down below v0near the beginning and near
the end of the U-turn. Here, it is also seen that slower initialspeeds correspond to sharper turns involving higher interme-
diate speeds that result in shorter paths, while higher initial
speeds necessitate wider turning radii and larger turn times.
The turn times for the three cases can be obtained from
Eq.(25), and denoting the three initial speed options by
v
0;1¼18;v0;2¼24;andv0;3¼30 m/s yields corresponding
turn times of T1¼7:91, T2¼8:30, and T3¼8:86 s.
Corresponding results obtained from the piecewise linearspeed proﬁle case in Eq. (15) yield higher Tvalues of 8 :03,
8:38, and 8 :94 s for cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The corre-
sponding a
Tvalues, found from Eq. (16) areaT;1¼2:28,
aT;2¼0, and aT;3¼/C02:16 m/s2. Another set of comparisons
can be made with the turn times for the a-trajectories based
on the velocity proﬁle vy¼fvxðÞfrom Eq. (19). First though,
bvalues must be calculated for each of the three initial speed
options, and from Eq. (21), these bvalues are found to be
1:76, 1 :25, and 0 :94. From this point, the turn time expres-
sion in Eq. (22) has all the data necessary to yield Tvalues
of 8:09, 8 :54, and 9 :13 s, which are higher than the corre-
sponding values from the piecewise linear speed proﬁle.
A. Fuller comparisons between the constant speed
a-trajectory and the catenary a-trajectory
In lieu of using speciﬁc parameter values, a general ana-
lytic comparison of 180/C14turn times can be made betweenthevtðÞ¼v0constant speed a-trajectory and the optimal a-
trajectory from Eqs. (27) and(28). The turn time for the a-
trajectory corresponding to the constant speed proﬁle will be
denoted by T0. This quantity is given by pL=2v0ðÞ ,o ri n
terms of Landa,
T0¼pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L

: (30)
T0will be used to calculate a dimensionless time ~Tgiven by
the ratio ~T¼T=T0, which will enable comparisons between
T0and the turn time Tof another trajectory satisfying the
same boundary conditions. Recall that for the constant speed
a-trajectory with given values of aandL, the initial speed v0
must equalﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
aL=2p
in order to satisfy the positional bound-
ary condition at P, hence La=v2
0¼2. Now the particular a-
trajectory associated with the catenary speed proﬁle in Eq.
(24), which has the same values of v0and vf, can be found
by ﬁrst setting La=v2
0¼2 in Eq. (29) to obtain 4 c2þ2c
¼sinh 2 cðÞ. Then solving for cyields c/C251:699 627 :
Substituting this value into Eq. (25) reveals that the ratio
~TccðÞ¼T=T0/C250:990 56 ;which is clearly less than one.
This result demonstrates that, for any choice of aandL, the
a-trajectory based on the catenary velocity proﬁle in Eq. (24)
with v0¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
aL=2p
yields a shorter turnaround time than the
vtðÞ¼v0constant speed a-trajectory.
VI. STATIONARY CATENARY SOLUTIONS
AND OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES
The functional Tv y½/C138in Eq. (17) maps a curve described by
vy¼fvxðÞ to a positive real number equaling 1 =atimes the
length of the curve in velocity space, and the quantity Lvy½/C138
in Eq. (20) corresponds to an area of a surface of revolution
that would result if vy¼fvxðÞ is rotated around the axis
vy¼0. Therefore, if the stationary solution for vygiven in
Eq.(24) truly corresponds to an optimal trajectory, then it
must be the shortest curve among all admissible curves that
share the same value of the functional in Eq. (20). In this sec-
tion, “admissible curves” include smooth functions in veloc-
ity space that satisfy Eq. (2).
The optimal nature of the result in Eq. (24) can be under-
stood from the property that, among all admissible curves

above the horizontal axis with ﬁxed length, the regular (or
upright) catenary is the curve associated with the minimalsurface area of revolution (Ref. 11, pp. 86–87). Speciﬁcally,
if^yxðÞdenotes a catenary over an interval ½c;d/C138having
length lwith ^ycðÞ¼^ydðÞ¼h>0 and ^yxðÞ/C210, then ^ymin-
imizes the surface area functional K
1y½/C138¼2pÐd
cyds. Now let
YxðÞbe a function formed by the transformation YxðÞ¼h
/C0yxðÞ, where yxðÞis an admissible function of K1. Then
YcðÞ¼YdðÞ¼0, and the inverted catenary ^YxðÞ¼h/C0^yxðÞ
will maximize the functional K2Y½/C138¼2pÐd
cYds because
K2Y½/C138¼2phl/C0K1y½/C138and because ^yis a minimum of K1.
Therefore, amongst all admissible curves of ﬁxed length, the
inverted catenary in Eq. (24) maximizes the integral expres-
sion in Eq. (20). However, what needs to be shown is that
amongst all admissible curves of ﬁxed surface area of revo-
lution, the inverted catenary has the shortest length.
A tool that can be used to help accomplish this goal
is found within Eq. (29). By taking the right-hand side
of this equation and considering the function ~SccðÞ
¼c/C02sinh 2 cðÞ/C02c ðÞ =2;the relationship between quantity
La=v2
0and the parameter ccan be more fully understood and
utilized. Here, the subscript “ c” refers to the fact that the
quantity is associated with the catenary solutions from Eq.
(24). Expanding the hyperbolic sine in Eq. (29) via a
Maclaurin series yields
~SccðÞ¼2X1
k¼12cðÞ2k/C01
2kþ1 ðÞ !: (31)
Because ~Scis an odd function of cand all coefﬁcients in the
above power series expression are positive, ~SccðÞis a strictly
increasing function of c. Looking back to Eq. (29), this
means that smaller (larger) values of the quantity La=v2
0cor-
respond to smaller (larger) values of c.
To approach the problem of ﬁnding the curve of shortest
length amongst all admissible curves of ﬁxed surface area ofrevolution, proceed by letting v
1;ydenote the unique inverted
catenary from Eq. (24), which has a value of csatisfying Eq.
(29) for ﬁxed values of the parameters a;v0, and L. Now
suppose v/C3
yis a non-zero, non-catenary function, which is
associated with the same set of parameters a;v0, and L.
Assume further that Lv/C3
y/C2/C3¼Lv1;y½/C138 and Tv/C3
y/C2/C3/C20Tv 1;y½/C138 .
Now from Eq. (25), it follows that for positive c, the turn
time Tis an increasing continuous function of c. Because the
absolute minimum of the general turn time functional in Eq.(17) isTv
y¼0 ½/C138 , and because vy¼0 is the limiting function
of Eq. (24) ascapproaches zero, it is possible to ﬁnd another
inverted catenary v2;ysuch that Tv y¼0 ½/C138 <Tv 2;y½/C138 ¼Tv/C3
y/C2/C3.
Next observe that if the inverted catenaries v1;yandv2;yare
associated with parameter values c1and c2, then
0<c2/C20c1. Because the proﬁle v2;yis an admissible curve,
it satisﬁes Eq. (2)and, therefore, has the same value of v0as
that of v1;yandv/C3
y. (By deﬁnition, a-trajectories based on the
velocity proﬁles v1;y,v/C3
y, and v2;yalso share the same value
ofa.) Since L¼~Scv2
0=aand because ~Scfrom Eq. (31) is an
increasing function of c, the inequality c2/C20c1implies that
Lv2;y½/C138 /C20Lv1;y½/C138 ¼L½v/C3
y/C138. However, by the argument pre-
sented in the preceding paragraph, inverted catenaries areassociated with a maximum surface area of revolution
amongst all admissible curves of the same length. Therefore,
Lv
2;y½/C138 >Lv/C3
y/C2/C3, but this contradicts the previous conclusion.
Thus, the initial assumption Tv/C3
y/C2/C3/C20Tv 1;y½/C138 is incorrect, and,hence, the inverted catenary solution from Eq. (24) corre-
sponds to the minimal time trajectory for a given set ofparameter values v
0;a;andL. This conclusion is in keeping
with the numerical examples presented in Sec. V, and addi-
tional supporting numerical investigations that conﬁrm thisresult are presented in the supplementary material.6
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, methods for obtaining plane trajectories of
constant-magnitude acceleration ( a-trajectories) were
derived and applied to a problem involving a turn with pre-scribed boundary conditions. Turn times associated withthree a-trajectories were calculated using speciﬁc values of
the turn width, the initial speed, and the magnitude of the
acceleration vector ( L;v
0, and a). Additional comparisons
were made between turn time results from Ref. 4over a wide
spectrum of these same parameter values (see the supple-
mentary material6). These comparisons provided numerical
evidence that the trajectory derived in Ref. 4is optimal with
respect to turn time. Afterwards, this claim was formallyproven using results from the calculus of variations.
The interested reader may wish to examine the effects of
this wider parameter space on the a-trajectories that result
from the more general velocity boundary conditions of the
form

ﬁles listed in this paper. Another problem of theoretical

from Sec. IIunder the same limiting conditions.

APPENDIX: OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES ARE
a-TRAJECTORIES
This appendix contains a proof that optimal trajectories
are always a-trajectories.
As in the main text, let adenote the maximum allowable
value of the magnitude of acceleration and denote the plane
curve Sas the path on which an object is traveling.
Following the argument presented in Ref. 4, if there is a
ﬁnite segment DSof this path along which ajj<a, then it is
possible to increase the object’s tangential velocity by eon
the ﬁrst half of DSand to decrease it by /C0eon the second
half without changing the endpoint velocities of DS. Doing
so will decrease the travel time along DS. Furthermore,

it can be shown that ajjis still less than aalongDS. A formal
proof Eq. (A1) , which is not given in Ref. 4, is provided
here. Let DSjj denote the length of the path DS, and let s
denote the arclength parameter associated with this path.That is, shas a value of 0 at the start of the path, and halfway
along the path, shas a value of s

path will be denoted by sf¼DSjj:Now

where v0in this context is the speed at s¼0 and vis the

One assumption underlying Eq. (A1) is that along the
segment DS;the magnitude of the total acceleration ajjis
less than a. Then, by way of comparison, another trajectory
along DSis considered in which the object’s tangential
acceleration is increased by efor the ﬁrst half of DSand
decreased by ealong the second half of DS. (Such a change
ensures that the velocities at the end points remain the samefor the two trajectories.) After executing these changes, thenew speed v

As alluded to earlier, since the speed at s¼0 and s¼sf
are unchanged and since vn/C21v, the time it takes to traverse
DShas decreased after these changes have been made.
Therefore, any trajectory that is not an a-trajectory is not
minimal with respect to the travel time.
