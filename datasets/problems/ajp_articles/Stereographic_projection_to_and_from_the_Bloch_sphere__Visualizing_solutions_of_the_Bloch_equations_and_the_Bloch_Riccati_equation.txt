Stereographic projection mapping is typically introduced to explain the point at inﬁnity in the
complex plane. After this brief exposure in the context of complex analysis, students rarely get anopportunity to fully appreciate stereographic projection mapping as an elegant and powerful
technique on its own with many fruitful applications in the physical sciences. Here, using a
classical description of nuclear magnetic resonance in the rotating frame, I show how stereographicprojection mapping to and from the Bloch sphere can be used for visualizing solutions to Bloch’s
equation and the Bloch–Riccati equation, respectively. After developing the fundamentals of
stereographic projection mapping using examples drawn from nuclear spin precession in therotating frame, the method is then applied to visualizations of composite pulse excitation of a spin-
1/2 system and to radiation damping in a system of isolated spins-1/2. In the case of the radiation-
damped system, these visualizations provide particularly vivid illustrations of loxodromic M €obius
transformation dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stereographic projection has proven to be a versatile and
elegant technique to solve problems in the mathematical andphysical sciences.1If physics students encounter stereo-
graphic projection at all, they most likely do so in mathemat-
ics2or mathematical physics3courses. These courses
introduce the Riemann sphere (alias Bloch sphere)4onto
which the entire complex plane can be mapped via stereo-graphic projection. From such a brief exposure to stereo-graphic projection, an exposure which is usually without anyphysics context, students might be tempted to think that ste-reographic projection has very few interesting or usefulapplications in physics.
A very different perspective is offered by a number of
insightful applications of stereographic projection mapping
to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
5–10and to optical
resonance,11and this article can be used as an introduction
to these applications. I will use the classical description ofNMR
12–14to illustrate fundamental features of stereo-
graphic projection mapping and to provide examples ofhow the technique can be applied to challenging NMRproblems. The Bloch equations
15are the equations of
motion of nuclear magnetization, whereas the Bloch–Riccati equation is obtained from the Bloch equations bystereographic projection mapping.
5–9With only the aid of
stereographic projection mapping, three-dimensionalgeometry, and complex analysis, solutions to the Bloch–
Riccati equation and Bloch’s equations may be visualized.
I will compare Bloch–Riccati equation solutions obtainedvia stereographic projection from both poles of the Blochsphere and show how these projection solutions are relatedby geometric inversion in the complex plane. The stereo-graphic projection mapping approach is then applied toprovide (i) an alternative visualization of NMR compositepulse excitation in the presence of a resonance offset
16,17
and (ii) a visualization of radiation damping7in an isolated
spin-1/2 system.II. BACKGROUND REVIEW
A. The Bloch equations
Consider a spin system in a spatially homogeneous and
static magnetic ﬁeld B0/C17B0^kwith a thermal equilibrium
value of magnetization M0. What then happens if a linearly
polarized oscillating magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the axisof a coil in the x,y-plane? This linearly polarized magnetic
ﬁeld can be decomposed into two circularly polarized compo-
nents, of which only one component, B
1¼B1cosðxt/C0uÞ^i
þB1sinðxt/C0uÞ^j, has a non-negligible effect. The
“laboratory frame” of an NMR experiment is deﬁned by the
orthogonal basis f^i;^j;^kg, the frame in which the coil is at
rest. As Rabi et al.18ﬁrst showed, the use of a rotating coordi-
nate system19greatly simpliﬁes the description of magnetic
resonance phenomena. In this rotating coordinate system,
deﬁned by the orthogonal basis f^i0;^j0;^k0g, a “rotating frame”
rotates at a frequency x¼/C0x^k/C17/C0x^k0with respect to the
laboratory frame, and in the absence of relaxation effects,the equation for the driving of the magnetization MðtÞ

From the torque equation of Eq. (1)follow two important
characteristics of the precessional motion. First, in the
absence of relaxation effects, the magnitude of mðtÞdoesn’t
change, and so the terminus of the magnetization vector mðtÞ
traces out a path on the surface of the unit spherem

Second, if the magnitude B1and phase uof the applied
radiofrequency ﬁeld Bein Eq. (2)are constant, then the
effective magnetic ﬁeld Beremains constant in the rotating
frame, and so the torque equation describes a magnetization
vector mðtÞ, which precesses in a cone of ﬁxed angle vwith
angular frequency xearound Be, as shown in Fig. 1. To see

as the North pole of the Bloch sphere.

is that locus of points? Answering this question will go beyond
the conventional textbook descriptions of stereographic projec-tion embodied in Eqs. (13)and(15), which rely on a single ray

BLOCH–RICCATI EQUATION
Just as the transformation of the Schr €odinger equation into
an equivalent Riccati equation simpliﬁes the solution processand leads to useful insight,27so does the stereographic pro-
jection mapping transformation of the classical Bloch equa-
tions into the Bloch–Riccati equation simplify the solutionprocess7,8and lead to useful insight, especially when the
Bloch–Riccati equation solutions can be visualized. Thesevisualizations broaden students’ perspectives by demonstrat-ing that the Riccati equation is useful in both quantum andclassical mechanics.
A. Projection from the North pole
Looking beyond the fate of just points under stereographic
projection mapping, the broader question then is to what
paths in the extended complex plane^C/C17C[1 are mag-
netization trajectories mapped? Answers are readily providedby complex analysis
2and three-dimensional geometry.22
Circles on the Bloch sphere that pass through the North pole
N¼ð0;0;1Þmap under pNonto extended lines in^C.2
Figure 2illustrates stereographic projection mapping pNof a
circular magnetization trajectory on the surface of the Blochsphere, demonstrating that the projection rays deﬁne astraight line in the complex plane, thereby visualizing a solu-tion of the Bloch–Riccati equation. Circles that do not pass
through the North pole N¼ð0;0;1Þmap under p
NorpS
onto circles in^C.22,28If straight lines are treated as “circles”
of inﬁnite radius, one can say that the stereographic projec-tion of any circle on the Bloch sphere is mapped to a circleon the complex plane.
The terminus of the precessing magnetization vector mðtÞ
around an effective magnetic ﬁeld B
edeﬁnes a circle Con
the Bloch sphere surface. This circle Cis the intersection of
a plane with the Bloch sphere, and the intersection of thatplane with the complex plane will be a straight line solutionof the Bloch–Riccati equation. Table Irecords the steps
required to determine these solutions without solving eitherthe Bloch equations or the Bloch–Riccati equation. In partic-ular, if Cis a circle (passing through N) cut out on the Bloch
sphere by the plane axþbyþcz/C0c¼0i nR
3, then ste-
reographic projection pNof Eq. (13) maps Cto the straight-
line equation axþby/C0c¼0,22a direct consequence of the
fact that all the rays of projection from the North pole thatpass through points on the circle must lie in the same planecontaining that circle (see Fig. 2). For two different radiofre-
quency phases u(row 1) or effective magnetic ﬁeld direc-
tions ^n/C17B
e=jBej(row 2), Table Ishows the deﬁnition of
(i) the intersecting plane with the Bloch sphere ( ^R3plane,
row 3), (ii) the intersection of this plane with ^R2(^R2line,
row 4), and (iii) the ﬁnal explicit Bloch–Riccati solutions
Z(t) and fðtÞdetermined from pN(^Csolutions, row 5).
B. Projection from the South pole
If a line Lin the complex plane Cdoes not pass through
the center zc¼ðx;yÞof a circle of inversion, then inversion
maps Lonto a circle that passes through zc(but punctured29
atzc25). Since the circle of inversion that relates the complex
parameters fandf0isjzj/C17jz/C0ð0;0Þj ¼ 1;zc¼ð0;0Þ, any

line Lin the complex plane representing a Bloch–Riccati
equation solution that does not pass through (0, 0) will be
mapped by the inversion circle jzj¼1 to a circle passing
through (0, 0).
If the radiofrequency phase factor u¼p=2, inversion in
the complex plane will map the point ð0;1=tan#Þ(the inter-
section point of the line parallel to the real axis deﬁned by
ZðtÞ¼< ½ ZðtÞ/C138 þicot#(see Table I) with the imaginary
axis) to the point ð0;tan#Þ, while the points ð61;tan#Þon
this line will be mapped to the origin (0, 0). These two points
deﬁne a circle of radius1

which represents the geometric inversion of the Bloch–
Riccati solution ZðtÞ¼< ½ ZðtÞ/C138 þicot#.
Figure 3illustrates the effect of geometric inversion for
the two solutions of the Bloch–Riccati equation, Z(t) and
Z0ðtÞ.24This ﬁgure veriﬁes that circles on the surface of the
Bloch sphere are stereographically mapped to circles visual-
izing Bloch–Riccati equation solutions. It also veriﬁes that
any line Lin the complex plane representing a Bloch–Riccatiequation solution (i.e., the ZðtÞ¼pNðmx;my;mzÞsolution)
that does not pass through (0, 0) will be mapped by the inver-
sion circle jzj¼1 to a circle passing through (0, 0) (i.e., the
Z0ðtÞ¼pSðmx;my;mzÞsolution).
IV. COMPOSITE PULSE EXCITATION
If the phase factor of the applied radiofrequency ﬁeld
u¼p=2 and the resonance offset xz/C17d¼0, then the
effective magnetic ﬁeld in Eq. (2)is
Be¼x1
c/C18/C19
^j0: (25)
Under these conditions, a radiofrequency pulse of duration
T¼p=x1will rotate the magnetization about the y-axis
from (0, 0, 1) to ð0;0;/C01Þon the Bloch sphere, inverting the
initial magnetization. Matters are not so simple if the reso-
nance offset d6¼0. As a consequence of the resonance offset
d, the axis of rotation ^nnow lies in the yz-plane, oriented at
an angle #¼cos/C01ðd=xeÞto the ^z-axis, and so after a nomi-
nal 180/C14
y-pulse30of duration T¼p=x1, it is clearly impossi-
ble to invert the magnetization by taking Mzð0Þ¼M0
!MzðTÞ¼/C0 M0. Over four decades ago, Levitt and
Freeman16,17engineered a simple but very effective solution

the North pole N¼ð0;0;1Þmap under pNonto extended lines in^C. The
three displayed rays of stereographic projection from the North pole point

the complex plane deﬁnes a straight line (in red) in^C. The blue circle dis-
played is the same circle displayed in Fig. 1, namely, that circle deﬁned by
the intersection of the spin precession cone with the Bloch sphere.

that had the initial trajectory during the initial 90 ypulse con-
tinued during a single 180/C14
ypulse, the ﬁnal result would not
be anywhere near ð0;0;/C01Þ, the South pole of the Bloch
sphere. Of course, the larger the resonance offset drelative
to the applied radiofrequency ﬁeld x1, the worse would be
the wayward trajectory of the magnetization vector under theaction of a single 180/C14
ypulse.
Figure 5illustrates many of the most signiﬁcant features
ofpN. During the initial 90/C14
y-pulse, ½mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138is
mapped to a straight line extending from the point at inﬁnity,
pNð0;0;1Þ, to the intersection with the circle of largest radiusat 0:924þ0:5i. The equation of this line is given by fðtÞ
¼< ½ fðtÞ/C138 þicot#¼< ½ fðtÞ/C138 þ0:5i(see Table I), where
cot#¼ðd=x1Þ¼0:5 deﬁnes the dimensionless resonance
offset parameter d0. Following the initial 90/C14
y-pulse, this part
of½mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138during the 180/C14
x-pulse is mapped to an
arc on the circle jfðtÞ/C02:465j¼1:62, while that part of
½mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138during the ﬁnal 90/C14
y-pulse is mapped to
an arc on the circle jfðtÞ/C0ð /C0 1:2iÞj ¼ 1:3. By comparing the
composite pulse trajectory endpoint at ð0:3106 ;0:0503Þin
the ﬁrst quadrant with a single inverting 180/C14
ypulse trajectory
endpoint (starred) at ð/C00:189 474 ;0:5Þin the second quad-
rant, it is clear that the composite pulse clearly outperforms a
single inverting 180/C14
ypulse but falls a little short of the
desired endpoint objective at (0, 0) (starred), what would be
the result of pNð0;0;/C01Þ.
This ﬁgure veriﬁes once again (also see Fig. 3) that circles
are stereographically mapped by pNto circles. As we would
expect from Sec. II B, all of ½mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138on the north-
ern Bloch hemisphere in Fig. 5is mapped outside the circle
of inversion jzj¼1, whereas all of ½mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138on
the southern hemisphere in Fig. 4is mapped inside jzj¼1.
V. RADIATION DAMPING
NMR experiments are conducted by placing a sample
inside a radiofrequency coil of inductance Lthat is tuned
with a capacitor Cto the Larmor frequency x0¼cB0. After
the application of a radiofrequency pulse, the precessingmagnetization in the plane of the coil induces by Faraday’s
law a current in the detection coil.12A careful accounting33
of (i) the voltage drops in the tank circuit containing the coiland tuning capacitor using Kirchoff’s law and of (ii) the
reaction magnetic ﬁeld from the induced current in the coil
leads to the following modiﬁed version of the Bloch

but also visualizations of ½pS/C138/C01½f0ðtÞ/C138 /C17 ½ mxðtÞ;myðtÞ;mzðtÞ/C138
on the Bloch sphere, the solution to the original problem
posed by the Bloch equations. The example of radiationdamping in NMR underscores just how useful stereo-graphic projection mapping can be in visualizing solu-
tions to the Bloch equations and the Bloch–Riccati
equation.
Normalized M €obius transformations
25can be algebrai-
cally classiﬁed using the trace of transformation matrix
Min the following manner:25the M €obius transformation
M(z)i sElliptic ; if TrM¼ðaþdÞis real and jaþdj<2;
Hyperbolic ;if TrM¼ðaþdÞis real and jaþdj>2;
Loxodromic ;if TrM¼ðaþdÞis complex :
(39)
Because Dis complex, Tr M¼2 coshDtis also complex,
and so the M €obius transformation of Eq. (36) is a loxodromic
transformation according to the classiﬁcation scheme of
Eq.(39).25The complex plane trajectory for f0ðtÞshown in
Fig. 6and its inverse stereographic mapping image

M€obius transformation dynamics. Mathematics texts
describe similar examples of these loxodromic dynamics in
the complex plane25,34and on the Riemann sphere,34but the
spiralling trajectories of these ﬁgures25,34are just mathemati-
cal trajectories, devoid of any physical meaning, whereas the
corresponding spiral trajectories in Figs. 6and7visualize
solutions of the Bloch–Riccati differential equation, which

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In a classical description of magnetic resonance,12,13mag-
netization dynamics either plays out on the stage of theBloch sphere, following the script of the Bloch differential
equations, or it plays out on the stage of the complex plane,
following the script of the Bloch–Riccati differential equa-tion. The stereographic projection mapping ptogether with
its inverse mapping ½p/C138
/C01allow the audience to follow this
play of magnetization dynamics on the stage of their choiceand to switch from one stage to the other whenever conve-
nient or necessary. If that audience is students, visualizations
of the solutions of the Bloch–Riccati equation can aidstudents in the interpretation and understanding of these
solutions.
While the Riccati equation can be introduced to advanced
students using quantum mechanical examples,
27it can cer-
tainly be introduced at an earlier stage as the Bloch–Riccatiequation of this article without any knowledge of quantummechanics as long as students have some facility with vec-
tors, complex numbers, and elementary three-dimensional
geometry. By emphasizing the stereographic projection map-ping connection between the time evolution of trajectorieson the Bloch sphere and trajectories on the complex plane,students will be able to develop a much better understandingof the projection technique, an understanding that could eas-ily elude them if they relied on the conventional textbookexplanations using rays of projection. In the supplementarymaterial,
26there are suggestions for further studies in which
students may use to deepen their understanding of the projec-tion technique.

4In quantum mechanics, the Bloch sphere is a graphical tool often used for
representing normalized states of two-level systems (qubits) in NMR
(spin-1/2), quantum optics, and quantum computing. When used as a tool
to represent photon polarization states, the Bloch sphere is called the
Poincar /C19e sphere. I do not distinguish between the Riemann sphere and the
Bloch sphere.
