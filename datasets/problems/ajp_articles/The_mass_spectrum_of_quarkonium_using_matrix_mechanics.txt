The matrix method is used to determine the mass spectrum (energy levels) of quarkonium, a
composite particle comprising a quark and an anti-quark. This two-body system is similar to the
hydrogen atom but at a reduced length scale. The results obtained by solving the Schr €odinger
equation for this system are in agreement with experimental and theoretical results obtained via
other techniques, showing that problems with complicated potentials can be tackled by
undergraduates. #2023 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is well known from elementary quantum mechanics that
for a particle of mass msubject to a central potential V(r),
the solution wðr;h;/Þof the Schr €odinger equation
Hwðr;h;/Þ¼Ewðr;h;/Þ (1)
is the product of a function that depends only on rand a
spherical harmonic: wðr;h;/Þ¼RðrÞYm
lðh;/Þ. As a conse-
quence, the general three-dimensional problem is reduced tosolving the one-dimensional radial equation

UðrÞ¼EUðrÞ; (2)
where UðrÞ¼rRðrÞandlis the orbital angular momentum
quantum number. Solving this equation determines the radialfunction R(r) and the energy levels.
In Ref. 1, it is shown that the matrix mechanics method1,2
produces results for the hydrogen atom problem in good
agreement with known exact results. Similar to theRayleigh–Ritz method,3–5the matrix method is based on the
choice of a discrete set of basis states in the system Hilbert
space. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is a variational method6,7
of approximately solving an eigenvalue problem to compute
eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions; it has theadvantage of being based on minimal and very generalassumptions and produces optimal solutions in the sense ofyielding eigenvalues close to the exact solutions. In the
matrix method, one decides on a ﬁnite number of basis states
denoted by N
max, and a truncated Hamiltonian of dimension
Nmax/C2Nmaxis constructed using this basis. This matrix is
then diagonalized to solve for the Nmaxlowest energy eigen-
values of the original Hamiltonian. One obtains upperbounds for these lowest eigenvalues; increasing N
maxleads
to results closer to the exact values. The matrix mechanics
method allows for the use of a simple set of basis states

inﬁnite potential well with eigenvalues E0

whereVinfðrÞ¼00 <r<a;

This inﬁnite potential well will be familiar to undergraduates
and is used as an embedding potential in order to employ asimple discrete basis in the system Hilbert space. The eigen-
value problem can, thus, be expressed in a matrix form that
is easier to tackle numerically than the differential equationform when using a continuous basis like the position opera-
tor eigenstates j~ri.
After embedding the potential of the system in an inﬁnite
spherical well of radius a, Eq. (2)takes the form

The matrix elements in Eq. (11) can easily be computed with
simple numerical integration techniques. After constructingthe matrix H
nm, it is numerically diagonalized to obtain the
various eigenvalues En, which approximate the true eigen-
values of the untruncated Hamiltonian. In this work, we donot compute the eigenfunctions Uand, hence, do not need
the coefﬁcients c
min Eq. (12), but they can be recovered
from the Jacobi routine used in the computation if needed.
II. APPLICATION TO CHARMONIUM
The particle world comprises two main groups. These are
the leptons, such as the electron and muon, and the hadrons,
such as the proton, neutron, and pion. Hadrons are composite
systems built of more fundamental particles called quarksand are divided into two types: mesons, which are made up
of quark-antiquark pairs, and baryons, which are made up of
three quarks. There are six “ﬂavors” of quarks: up (u), down(d), and strange (s), which are classiﬁed as “light” quarks,and bottom (b), charm (c), and top (t), which are classiﬁed as
“heavy” according to their masses. Quarkonium is the name
given to a system composed of a heavy quark Qand anti-
quark /C22Qbound by the strong interaction. Quarkonium is
very similar to the positronium system ( e
þe/C0bound state);
this is the origin of the name. In addition to electric charge,quarks also carry a strong interaction charge termed color.The strength of the strong interaction is determined by a
dimensionless coupling constant a
s, which is the analog of
the ﬁne structure constant aeof the electromagnetic interac-
tion. The quantum relativistic theory of the strong interaction
is QCD (quantum chromodynamics), which is similar to
QED (quantum electrodynamics), the theory of electromag-netic interaction.8,9The strong interaction between quarks is
mediated by the gluon just as the electromagnetic interaction
between charged particles is mediated by the photon.
A quarkonium system comprising a charm and anti-charm
(c/C22c) quark pair is known as charmonium. The charmonium
state J=wwas ﬁrst observed experimentally in November
1974 with the simultaneous discovery of a narrow resonance
decaying to eþe/C0and lþl/C0by groups at Brookhaven
National Laboratory10in the reactions pþBe!ðJ
!eþe/C0ÞþX!eþe/C0þXand at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center11in the reaction eþe/C0!w!ðeþe/C0or
lþl/C0or hadrons). Charmonium states can be produced in
hadron colliders such as the large hadron collider and teva-
tron or in eþe/C0colliders like SLAC in a variety of different
interactions.
The simplest approach to understand the quarkonium
spectrum involves the use of potential models to describe the
bound state in analogy with the quantum mechanical descrip-
tion of the energy levels of an atom. Given the large massesof the charm and bottom quarks, it was anticipated thatbound states of heavy quarks might be described by a non-
relativistic potential model
12–14analog of positronium.
Indeed, non-relativistic treatments of interactions based onthe potential concept provide a satisfactory description ofphysical reality in a rich variety of circumstances.15The
experimentally observed spectrum resembles a non-relativistic level scheme, and its main features can be repro-
duced under the assumption of such a scheme.
The treatment of quarkonium in the framework of non-
relativistic quantum mechanics is based on solvingSchr€odinger’s equation.
16Quarks and anti-quarks interact
via a central potential which depends only on the relative
distance Vðj~r1/C0~r2jÞ ¼ VðrÞ. This two-particle system can
then be reduced to a simpler problem involving only one ﬁc-titious particle of reduced mass l¼m
qm/C22q=ðmqþm/C22qÞ. Since
the ﬁctitious particle’s motion is governed by a central
potential, Schr €odinger’s equation reduces to a radial equation
as above
/C0/C22h2
2ld2
dr2UðrÞþVeffðrÞUðrÞ¼EUðrÞ: (13)
By solving Eq. (13), one can determine the mass spectrum of
the quarkonium system Mq/C22q, which is related to the eigenvalue
Eby the relation Mq/C22qc2¼Eþmqc2þm/C22qc2. To achieve this,
different numerical techniques have been used, including lat-
tice QCD,17the Numerov algorithm,18the shooting method,19
and the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method.20Motivated by the
result of Ref. 1and the fact that the quarkonium is very similar
to the hydrogen atom, we here apply the matrix mechanicsmethod to solve the radial equation of the charmonium systemto determine the masses of the different states. We use a non-
relativistic Hamiltonian
21of the form
Hnr¼TnrþVnr; (14)
where the kinetic and potential energy operators are

This form of the potential, shown in Fig. 1, is inspired by
nuclear and atomic physics and can be understood from thequalitative features of QCD. Additionally, the various termsin this expression are described in detail.
In QCD, the strong interaction becomes feeble at distances
less than 1 fm (a characteristic of the size of quarkonium), so
that quarks are weakly bound at small separations; this is“asymptotic freedom.” The QCD static potential can be
derived with perturbative QCD from the leading order single
gluon exchange contribution. This leads to a potential with aform analogous to the Coulomb potential, VðrÞ¼/C0 Ca
s=r,
where Cis a constant related to the colour conﬁguration of
the quarks; for the charm-anticharm pair, C¼4/3.
At distances beyond about 1 fm, the coupling becomes
strong, resulting in a conﬁnement regime that prohibitsquarks from acting as free particles. This can be interpretedas a long-range linear conﬁning potential, which appears as
the second term in the potential, VðrÞ¼br. The parameter b
is often called the QCD string tension.
The ﬁnal effect to take into account involves quark spin.

indicated that the strong interaction depends on the relative
spin states of nucleons. The interaction includes spin-dependent effects expected from one-gluon exchange whichgive rise to terms familiar from one-photon exchange in
QED, plus a spin-orbit Thomas precession term expected of
an object with spin moving in a central potential.
22The spin-
spin (or hyperﬁne) term appearing as the third term in Eq.(16) is an essential ingredient, contributing to the splittings
of energy levels of the nucleons and the quarkonium systemas well. ~S
qand~S/C22qare the individual spins of the quark and
the anti-quark. One can show that 2 ~Sq/C1~S/C22q¼ðSðSþ1Þ
/C03=2Þ, where S¼0 or 1 is the total spin of the system.23The
delta-function potential drðrÞrepresents zero-range contact
interactions, that is, an interaction that is nonzero only whenthe particles are at the same position, implying that thequarks are treated as point-like objects. In reality as theyare “dressed” by virtual gluons and quark-antiquarkpairs that affect the hyperﬁne splitting of the hadron spec-trum. This ﬁnite size effect is incorporated into the potentialby smearing the delta function. In a practical calculation,the point-like spin-spin interaction is smeared by replacingthe delta function d
rðrÞby the exponential form
ðr=ﬃﬃﬃppÞ3expð/C0r2r2Þ, where ris the smearing factor. Since
the exponential should be dimensionless, rhas units of
inverse distance. Thus, we can interpret 1 =ras the effective
size of the constituent quark. Effectively, smearing gives riseto a picture where constituent quarks are modeled as softspheres instead of point particles.
Other spin-dependent components include spin-orbit and
tensor interaction terms

These terms create a complication in that 1 =r3is singular for
r!0, which leads to divergent integrals. In Ref. 24, this
issue is addressed by including a cutoff distance rcin the cal-
culation such that within a small range r2½0;rc/C138, one sets1=r3¼1=r3
c. These terms are not very important for the
global features of the spectra21and are not considered here.
The values for the parameters as,b,mq, and rcannot be
predicted from this qualitative model. Instead, they are foundin Ref. 26by treating these as free parameters and matching
the solutions to this Hamiltonian to experimental observa-tions, as will be described in Sec. III.

These integrals are computed numerically with the trape-
zoidal method, and then the matrix His diagonalized with
the Jacobi routine.25In this work, the approximation of the
true eigenvalues is computed with the Jacobi method, notjust upper bounds as the Rayleigh–Ritz method returns.Once the eigenvalues are computed, the constant termðm
qc2þm/C22qc2Þis incorporated to obtain the mass of the cor-
responding charmonium state (see suplementary material28).
We adopt natural energy units, /C22h¼c¼1.1III. RESULTS

IV. CONCLUSION
Our results are in good agreement with those of Ref. 26,
where the Numerov method algorithm was used to solve theradial equation and ﬁnd the optimal parameters. The experi-mental values are well-reproduced, especially for S states(L¼0). Since these parameters are used as inputs into our
method, this agreement is expected, but it is still valuablefor undergraduates to have the experience of solving amodel for a real system using matrix mechanics. Small dif-ferences occur for P ( L¼1) and D ( L¼2) states; this is
because spin orbit and tensor interaction terms have been
neglected in our analysis and in that of Ref. 26. From Table
IIIand Figs. 3and2, we can conclude that there is a conver-
gence of the results, but it is slow as a function of a.O n e
needs a larger value of N
maxto reach the same accuracy
obtained with lower values of the width a. The reason for
this is that for larger a, the same basis state (say, w50ðrÞ)h a s
less spatial resolution than the 50th basis state for a smallervalue of a.
In this work, we have dealt with a two-particle system
interacting via a more complex potential than is typical ofwhat undergraduate students usually encounter. In this way,this work extends the scope of the matrix mechanics method
and demonstrates that it is a powerful approach to tackle
more complicated problems.
