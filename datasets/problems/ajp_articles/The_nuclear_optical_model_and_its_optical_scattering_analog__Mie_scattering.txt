The methods devised by Gustav Mie in 1908 to explain the scattering of electromagnetic waves
have a close analogy with quantum-mechanical models developed many years later to describenuclear scattering. In particular, these models use either a complex index of refraction or a
complex nuclear scattering potential to account for attenuation caused by non-elastic scattering.
We brieﬂy outline the historical development of these models and give examples illustrating theclose analogy between them, their parameters, and the resulting scattering. In both models, the
ratio of the incident wavelength to the object size, k/D, can be determined from the scattering
characteristics, allowing the extraction of microscopic particle dimensions. This close analogyallows students to simulate accelerator-based nuclear scattering experiments with table-top optical-
scattering experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electromagnetic, atomic, and nuclear scattering are major
tools in modern physics research,1–6but they are often only
brieﬂy covered in undergraduate curricula. This paperreveals important similarities between two models of scatter-
ing on very different length scales: the Mie optical-scattering
model and the nuclear optical model. The historical develop-ment of these models is outlined along with some of theirimportant applications. We show the close analogy between
the models and, in particular, that the Mie optical-scattering
model, with only a complex index of refraction togetherwith a suitable choice of the ratio of wavelength to objectsize, k/D, can also model nuclear scattering and enable
extraction of realistic nuclear dimensions. This analogy
provides insight into the nuclear optical model and its param-eters as well as many other scattering processes over a widerange of dimensions.
Gustav Mie’s model was published in 1908 and success-
fully reproduced the scattering of light from gold particlesembedded in a colloidal suspension.
1Such scattering produ-
ces a spectrum of colors depending on the angle of observa-
tion and includes as a special case Rayleigh scattering,
where the size, i.e., diameter D, of the scattering objects ismuch smaller than the incident wavelength, typically by afactor of ten or more.
3,4For example, the Rayleigh scattering
of sunlight from air molecules produces the blue overhead
sky on Earth. In contrast to Earth, scattered sunlight on theplanet Mars is mainly caused by scattering from dust par-ticles in the Martian sky, given that there is little gaseous
atmosphere on Mars and, hence, there is little Rayleigh scat-
tering. In this case, Mie scattering with k/C28Dfavors scat-
tering of the red part of sunlight at large angles, so theoverhead sky appears red, and sunsets appear blue on Mars
(Fig. 1). These planetary examples illustrate the importance
of the ratio k/D in determining important characteristics of
optical scattering, which we show is also true for nuclearscattering.

In Sec. II, we review optical scattering and diffraction in
more detail. In Sec. III, we outline the development of the
nuclear optical model, and in Sec. IV, we show that there isa close and useful relationship between optical and nuclear
scattering processes, over a wide range of dimensions. The
latter spans optical wavelengths (nanometers, 10/C09m) to
nuclear dimensions (femtometers, 10/C015m).
II. REVIEW OF OPTICAL SCATTERING AND
DIFFRACTION
The general form describing the scattering of an incident
plane wave from a primarily spherical object embedded in a
transparent medium and resulting in an outgoing spherical
wave can be written as6–8

elastic if there is no excitation of the scattering object (or
incident particles). Non-elastic scattering results in a loss of
incident intensity and corresponds to an attenuated value of
the scattering function, f(h,u).
In Mie optical-scattering calculations, the complex func-
tion f(h,u)is determined via an expansion of an incident
plane wave and outgoing spherical wave (Eq. (1)) into
partial-wave components in spherical coordinates usingspherical harmonics. These partial-wave components mustsatisfy Maxwell’s equations for waves incident on, transit-
ing, and then exiting the scattering object. The outgoing scat-
tered wave is constructed from the resulting modiﬁed partialwaves, and the scattering amplitude f(h,u) is determined.
Hence, the latter depends on the dimensions, shape, surfaces,
and index of refraction of the scattering object and the sur-rounding medium.
9The angle uis relevant for polarized
waves, but often polarization states can be averaged to yield
a scattering function independent of u, i.e., f(h). The mathe-
matical details are given in several references4including
those describing student optical-scattering experiments using
Mie-model calculations for data analysis.10,11
The scattered intensity vs angle, and in particular, the dif-
ferential scattering cross section away from zero degrees, is
given by dr/dX(h)¼f*(h)f(h).5–8Because f(h) varies with
wavelength, if there is a range of incident wavelengths, somewavelengths may be preferentially scattered at certain
angles, as is the special case for Rayleigh scattering of sun-
light that results in the blue sky.
The total calculated scattering cross section and, hence,
total attenuation is related to f(h¼0
/C14) via the optical
theorem,5–8
rTOT¼ð4p=kÞImfðh¼0/C14Þ; (2)
which is valid provided f(h), and, hence, the calculated scat-
tering cross section, is not inﬁnite at zero degrees. (Recallthat the classical Rutherford-model cross section for scatter-
ing from a point charge is inﬁnite at zero degrees, but this
does not hold for a realistic ﬁnite-size nuclear chargedistribution.

Several student- and instructor-friendly computer pro-
grams are available to calculate Mie scattering. One pro-
gram, particularly well-suited for student use, is MiePlot by
Philip Laven.9This program includes options to calculate
Mie, Debye, Rayleigh, and other scattering models, as well
as Fraunhofer diffraction.
A ﬁrst-order method for determining the dimensions of
microscopic objects embedded in an optical medium or vac-uum is far-ﬁeld Fraunhofer diffraction, which was ﬁrst stud-
ied in detail in the 1700 s. Recall that Fraunhofer diffraction
from a circular aperture with diameter D, which is compara-
ble in size to the incident wavelength k, yields a far-ﬁeld
diffraction pattern described by sin( h)¼mk/D, with the
ﬁrst two maxima at m¼1.63 and 2.68, and the ﬁrst two min-
ima at m¼1.22 and 2.23.4,12This is illustrated in Fig. 2for
k/D¼1/4. Invoking Babinet’s principle, this also is the type
of pattern expected for a circular, opaque object of the samedimensions.4,12Also shown in Fig. 2is a Mie scattering cal-
culation from a transparent spherical object with k/D¼1/4,
having a real or complex index of refraction.9A complex
index of refraction is often needed for many types of optical
and E&M scattering.2,13,14As expected, the effect of adding
an absorptive component to the index of refraction reducesthe scattering at large angles, where the optical path formany incident rays through the scattering medium is larger
than the path of many of the rays at forward angles.9
As seen in Fig. 2, analysis using Fraunhofer diffraction to
ﬁt the minima and maxima of the Mie scattering would
imply a larger object size, D(i.e., smaller k/D) by 15%–20%
for the calculations shown. This also is the case for diffrac-tion analyses of nuclear scattering, as often done in introduc-tory physics classes. However, when the size of the object isvery large relative to the incident wavelength, correspondingto a very small value of k/D, Mie scattering more closely
resembles Fraunhofer diffraction.
III. THE NUCLEAR OPTICAL MODEL
(COMPLEX SCATTERING POTENTIAL)
The nuclear optical model (NOM), which utilizes a com-
plex scattering potential, represents an evolution of several
early nuclear scattering models that used only real potentials.
This includes Rutherford’s model for classical scattering oflow-energy ions from nuclei via a long-range Coulombpotential, published in 1911.
4–6Only many years later
(1930s and beyond), when accelerators with higher-energynuclear beams became available (creating shorter ks) were
widespread deviations from Rutherford’s classical scatteringmodel observed. Figure 3shows examples of elastic scatter-
ing for a range of projectiles incident on a nickel target foil,all at approximately the same projectile velocity(ca.10 MeV/nucleon). There is a wide variation in the scat-
tering patterns, and several resemble the Fraunhofer pattern
shown in Fig. 2, as expected for small values of k/D.
The quantum-mechanical (QM) scattering of a subatomic
particle by an atomic nucleus can also, like Mie optical scat-tering, be described by Eq. (1)using a partial-wave expan-
sion where kandkare the incident particle’s de Broglie
wave number and de Broglie wavelength, k¼2p/k. The
wavenumber, k, for non-relativistic particles (as most cited
here) is k¼0.2187 sqrt ( A
IEI)fm/C01, where AIis the incident
particle’s atomic mass number, and EIis its kinetic energy in
MeV. The plane-wave Born approximation (PWBA) wasone the early QM nuclear scattering models treating incident
and scattered particles as waves, and it is introduced in many
QM and nuclear physics textbooks.7,16,17However, calcula-
tions using PWBA with only a real nuclear potential usuallydo not reproduce the observed nuclear scattering data in the
Fig. 2. Calculated intensity of light due to Mie scattering from spherical
drops when k/D¼1/4 and the indices of refraction are either real or com-
plex. This is compared to a classic Fraunhofer diffraction calculation from a
circular object with the same value of Dandk/D(Ref. 9).

energy regions discussed here (Fig. 3), as the model does not
include the attenuation and other alterations of the scatteredwaves due to nuclear reactions.
In the late 1930s, several researchers then proposed a
major improvement of the NOM by making the nuclear scat-tering potential complex with an imaginary, absorptive com-ponent U(r)¼V(r)þiW(r), together with the Coulomb
potential for charged ions.
18–20In 1954, Roger Woods and
David Saxon introduced a realistic NOM potential distribu-tion that followed the Fermi shape of the known charge dis-tributions,
4,21but with an increased diffuseness.22This
potential is denoted as a Woods–Saxon (WS) potential, butother nuclear potential forms are now included in theNOM.
23,24Especially important was the addition of a spi-
n–orbit potential to account for nucleon–nucleus scatteringof spin-aligned nuclei.
Further developments of the NOM include the determina-
tion of “global” NOM parameters24,25and the development
of a reformulated NOM to allow extraction of nucleon distri-butions from NOM potentials.26,27As with Mie scattering,
the NOM has wide-spread applications in modern physicsresearch including the analysis of nuclear reaction data using
distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA),5,6,17,27the cal-
culation of total nuclear reaction cross sections,5,6and the
calculation of single-particle nuclear levels including predic-tions for super-heavy “magic nuclei” A>300 (e.g. ,Z¼114
and 126, N¼148, 184, and 210).27,29
The special case of heavy-ion scattering (Fig. 3) is dis-
cussed in the supplementary material.27The early develop-
ment of the NOM and its justiﬁcation are reviewed in Refs.18–20 . Modern developments are reviewed in Ref. 28. Other
related materials, suitable for including in a course in QM,nuclear physics, or modern physics, can be found in the sup-plementary material for this paper.
27
Predating the nuclear optical model was the liquid-drop
nuclear model (LDM) of Weizsacker, Gamow, Bohr, andWheeler, which is used to describe many properties ofnuclei,
4–6including nuclear binding energies, LDM excitations,nuclear ﬁssion, and fusion–ﬁssion processes.30Given the suc-
cess of the LDM, it is not surprising that an optical model ofnuclear scattering analogous to the Mie optical-scatteringmodel of light from a liquid drop has proven to be very
successful.
IV. MIE OPTICAL-SCATTERING MODEL AS
SIMPLE ANALOG FOR NUCLEAR SCATTERING
A. Relationship between Mie optical-scattering
parameters and NOM parameters
Changes in the calculated NOM elastic scattering cross
sections with variations in certain NOM potential parameters
(strengths, radii, diffuseness, and hence D and k/D) parallel
many of the features of Mie optical-scattering calculationswhen speciﬁc Mie-model parameters are varied. Some areexpected, for example, changing the NOM potential radii
parameters shifts the calculated diffraction-like minima and
maxima in the NOM cross sections, as also observed in Miescattering when the parameter Dorn
Ris varied (Fig. 4).
Likewise changing the NOM real and complex nuclear-
potential strengths, V(r) and W(r), parallel closely the effects
seen when the real and imaginary parts of the index ofrefraction are changed in the Mie-model scattering calcula-
tions (Fig. 4). The scattering object appears, as expected, to
become more opaque for increasing values of n
IandW(r).
Hence, there is less impact on the scattered intensity whenthe scattering object becomes highly absorbing (Fig. 4).
However, this also depends on the magnitude of n
RandV(r),
i.e., refraction. Since the parameters used in Mie scattering
appear to have close NOM analogs, we can then expect (and
will also demonstrate) that nucleon–nucleus scattering canbe simulated with a suitable choice of Mie-model scatteringparameters. This can provide insight into these and similarscattering processes. We show that, perhaps unexpectedly,Mie scattering can simulate proton-nucleus and alpha-
nucleus charged-particle scattering, and even scattering from
exotic “halo” nuclei, N/C29Z.
B. Comparison: Mie optical-scattering calculations
with nucleon–nucleus NOM calculationsand nuclear-scattering data
The close similarity among the Mie optical-scattering cal-
culations, nuclear elastic scattering data (Fig. 5), and related
NOM calculations for neutron -nucleus elastic scattering is
shown in Fig. 6. (The NOM parameters are from global
NOM sets and included in the supplementary material.
27)A s
demonstrated, it is possible to simulate the angular distribu-tions of such scattering quite well by varying a few simpleanalog Mie scattering model parameters (Sec. IV A). Most
important, one needs to adjust the object size, D, i.e., the
ratio k/D, or the parameters determining D, to reproduce the
angles corresponding to minima and maxima in the scatteredintensity. For example, the n þPb data at E
n¼14 MeV (Fig.
5) corresponds to an incident neutron with de Broglie wave-
length k¼7.6 fm, and the NOM calculation shown corre-
sponds to a NOM real nuclear potential radius, R¼6.9 fm,
and imaginary (absorptive) potential radius, R¼7.5 fm.24,27
The data implies k/D¼0.45, and using this with the neutron
de Broglie wavelength indicates a nuclear-scattering objectwith R¼8.4 fm. This is reasonably close to the NOM
absorptive-potential radius for lead ( R¼7.5 fm).24,27An

model scattering cross sections, r/rR. The cross sections and angles are
shown in the center-of-mass frame, which is approximately the same as the
lab frame for these data.

analysis using Fraunhofer diffraction would require a smaller
value of k/D,implying a much larger scattering object
(R¼ca. 9.5 fm). Likewise, Fig. 6shows good agreement
between the n þNi NOM calculation with En ¼50 MeV
(k¼4 fm) and Mie scattering with k/D¼0.38. This k/Dimplies
R¼5.3 fm for Ni ( Aca. 58 ,Z¼28) compared to the real and
imaginary n þNi NOM potential radii of 4.6 and 4.9 fm.
A priori , owing to the long-range repulsive Coulomb
potential present, we might not expect Mie optical-scatteringcalculations to reproduce very well proton-nucleus scatteringor other charged-particle elastic scattering. In addition to theneutron scattering already discussed, Fig. 6also shows com-
parisons of Mie scattering and NOM calculations for pro-tons. Again, only the normalization, the index of refractionparameters, and the value of D (and thus k/D) for the Mie
scattering calculations are adjusted to reproduce the mainfeatures of the NOM calculations. The NOM calculationsemploying global parameters
24,27again closely correspond
to measured data (Fig. 5), where the proton cross sections (in
contrast to Fig. 6) are shown as ratio to Rutherford-model
calculated cross sections. While the effect of the nuclear
Coulomb potential is noticeable at some angles, the overall
features are nonetheless reproduced. The values of k/D
shown (or extracted from similar data) correspond closely tothe values of Dexpected for the NOM nuclear potentials
and, in particular, to the radius of W(r), the absorptive poten-
tial where RWis given by RW¼rWAT1/3with rwabout
1.3 fm.23,24,27
C. Alpha particles and other projectiles
In Fig. 7, we show alpha-particle (4He) elastic-scattering
cross sections, which appear to be highly diffractive withpronounced minima and maxima (again shown without
dividing by the calculated Rutherford-model scattering). A
reduced value for the complex part of the index of refractionis needed in the Mie-model calculations indicated. Recall
that
4He is tightly bound and the nuclear reactions possible,
e.g., nucleon transfers, are limited at the bombarding ener-gies shown by their highly negative reaction Q values. This
corresponds to a reduced absorptive-potential strength for
W(r), and hence a low value for the equivalent n
I.Again, the
impact of the repulsive Coulomb potential at forward angles
is evident, but this is minimized in the calculation for low- Z
targets (e.g., Si ,Z¼28). We also note the low value of k/D
needed (i.e., large D), approaching that for Fraunhofer dif-
fraction (i.e., k/C28D). However, the values of Dstill corre-
spond closely to the NOM absorptive potential dimensionsfor the target nuclei shown (e.g., Table 1, Ref. 25, and listed
in the supplementary material
27).
Returning to Fig. 3, we see that3He scattering is much
less diffractive compared to4He scattering.3He is loosely
bound relative to4He and subject to many more nuclear reac-
tions, i.e., those with positive or small reaction Q values, and
hence an increase in W(r). Thus, as anticipated, the3He data
can then be simulated in the Mie-model with an increase inthe complex component of the index of refraction relative to
that needed for
4He. However, otherwise, reasonable Mie-
model scattering parameters with suitable k/Dvalues can be
used to ﬁt the data, corresponding to reasonable nuclear-
potential dimensions.
Thus, somewhat unexpectedly, we ﬁnd even for charged
ions such as protons,3He, and4He that simple Mie scattering
calculations still simulate quite well the key features of the
multi-parameter NOM calculations that reproduce measured
nuclear elastic scattering for these projectiles. It can be veri-ﬁed, e.g., by students as exercises employing the NOM and
Mie models to ﬁt experimental data;
9,27,33,34this also applies
to deuteron- and triton-nucleus elastic scattering.23

same as the lab frame for the targets shown.

D. Simulation of scattering from an exotic, halo nucleus
N/C29Z
A new frontier in nuclear physics is the production and
study of nuclear reactions with exotic nuclei Z/C29Nor
N/C29Z, such as8B,8He,11Li, and others. These are often
short-lived radioactive nuclei that can be produced and stud-ied as secondary beams.
31This is typically done using frag-
mentation or nuclear reactions in a production target with anincident intense, stable primary nuclear beam. One can thenstudy traditional nuclear reactions such as nucleon transfers,elastic and inelastic scattering, and fusion–ﬁssion, by utiliz-inginverse kinematics, i.e., a heavy incident short-lived sec-
ondary beam on a low-mass nuclear target.
An example is shown in Fig. 8where a 576-MeV N /C29Z
secondary
8He beam ( Z¼2,N¼6; and T1/2¼119 ms) hasbeen produced and scattered from a hydrogen target to mea-
sure and analyze p þ8He elastic and inelastic scattering.32
This scattering event is equivalent to elastic scattering of a
72 MeV proton from a ﬁxed8He target (see kinematics equa-
tions given in Ref. 27). In the center-of-mass frame, this cor-
responds to Ec.m.¼(ATEI)/(A TþAI)¼64 MeV.27This
experiment was designed to test a “neutron halo” modelwhere8He consists of a compact4He (a-particle) core sur-
rounded by an extended 4-neutron halo.32This model can be
tested using the model’s nucleon distributions to generate
NOM potentials using a version of the reformulated NOM.
In order to ﬁt the data, a very diffuse, extended NOM poten-
tial and neutron distribution must be used, conﬁrming the
neutron halo model for8He.32
Applying the Mie scattering model also provides
support for the neutron-halo model. Figure 8shows two Mie

optical-scattering calculations.9One (dashed curve) assumes
a uniform index of refraction out to a ﬁxed radius, corre-
sponding to that expected for a conventional nucleus. The
other (solid curve) assumes a non-uniform, graded index ofrefraction falling uniformly from a maximum value to zero
at a large radius. The latter is consistent with the neutron-
halo model proposed for
8He and provides a better descrip-
tion of the data. (Details of the calculation are given in the
supplementary material.27)
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that Mie optical-scattering calculations
with a few simple parameters can accurately model nucle-
on–nucleus and other nuclear elastic scattering data, produc-ing results that are similar to the related multi-parameternuclear optical-model calculations used to describe such
data. Mie-scattering calculations can provide insight into the
nuclear optical model, its parameters, and the related nuclearscattering including scattering from exotic nuclei. A key
parameter characterizing these and similar scattering pro-
cesses over a wide range of dimensions is the ratio of inci-dent wavelength to the size of the scattering object ( k/D).
Our results suggest that table-top undergraduate laborato-
ries
10,11demonstrating Mie optical scattering, with appropri-
ate values of k/Dfor the light source and scattering objects,
can simulate large-scale nuclear-scattering measurements.
These would normally require access to a large nuclear parti-cle accelerator.

Fig. 8. Proton þ8He elastic scattering measured via inverse kinematics with
a 576-MeV8He radioactive secondary beam incident on a hydrogen target
(Ref. 32). The dashed curve is a conventional Mie optical-scattering calcula-
tion for a uniform sphere ( n¼1.30þi0.1,k/D¼0.65). The solid curve is a
Mie-scattering calculation assuming an extended, non-homogeneous sphere
as the object with a graded real index of refraction dropping from n¼1.40
to 1.00 and k/D¼0.54. [When the index of refraction is graded, MiePlot
does not allow it to be complex (Ref. 9)].
