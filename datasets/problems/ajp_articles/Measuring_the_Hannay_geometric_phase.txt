The Hannay geometric phase is the classical analog of the well-known Berry phase. Its most
familiar example is the effect of the latitude kon the motion of a Foucault pendulum. We describe
an electronic network whose behavior is exactly equivalent to that of the pendulum. The circuit can
be constructed from off-the-shelf components using two matched transconductance ampliﬁers thatcomprise a gyrator to introduce the non-reciprocal behavior needed to mimic the pendulum. One
may precisely measure the dependence of the Hannay phase on kby circuit simulation and by
laboratory measurements on a constructed circuit.

I. INTRODUCTION
Classical and quantum mechanical systems that return to
their initial state after a period of time evolution are of spe-cial interest in physics. After an adiabatic cyclic transforma-tion, quantum systems acquire, besides the standard
dynamical phase, an additional phase that depends only on
the geometry of the path taken. This is the well-known Berryphase.
1A similar type of phase was discovered by
Pancharatnam when studying the polarization of light.2For
classical systems in which the Hamiltonian includes time-dependent parameters, the dynamics can be quite compli-
cated. However, if these parameters change very slowly over
the period of the time-independent Hamiltonian, the dynam-ics is nearly periodic, as predicted by the adiabatic theoremin classical mechanics. In this case, the conserved quantity is
the phase space area enclosed by the system’s trajectory, i.e.,
the action. The angle associated with the action has a dynam-ical contribution set by the period and an additional contribu-
tion that depends only on the geometry of the cycle and not
on the period. This extra, purely geometric phase is calledthe Hannay angle.
3In 1851, Leon Foucault used a very tall
and heavy pendulum to demonstrate the Earth’s rotation. It
was found that the oscillation plane of the pendulum had a
rotation frequency that depended on the latitude where it waslocated,4perhaps the most familiar example of a classical
geometric phase. In our opinion, the Foucault pendulum pro-
vides an ideal introduction to the physics of the geometricphase.5The aim of this article is to describe an electronic
circuit that is an exact analog to the pendulum. In contrast
to previously proposed circuits, which used time-dependent
circuit elements6(see also Refs. 7–9), ours can be easily con-
structed with off-the-shelf components. This allows the
Hannay phase to be investigated by students via simulation
and with simple laboratory apparatus.II. THE FOUCAULT PENDULUM
Let us start by recalling the equations that describe a
Foucault pendulum, which can be found in manyintermediate-level mechanics textbooks.
10Deﬁning xandy

perpendicular to the local vertical direction, the equations ofmotion under the usual approximations are

0x¼0; (1)
€yþ2XTsinðkÞ_xþx2
0y¼0; (2)
where XTis the Earth rotation frequency, kis the latitude of
the pendulum location, and x0its oscillation frequency. The
motion of the pendulum’s oscillation plane depends on the
latitude and can be described in terms of a phase shift.11This
phase shift was shown to be an example of the Hannayphase.

and at t¼T¼2p=XT, the period of rotation of the Earth is
zðTÞ¼z0ðTÞe/C0i2psinðkÞ;
z0ðTÞ¼A1ei2px0=XTþA2e/C0i2px0=XT:
Since the pendulum frequency x0/C29XT, there are numerous
oscillations in one day, and we can safely consider x0=XT
¼n/C291, where nis an integer. Consequently, we ﬁnd
zðTÞ¼z0ð0Þe/C0i2psinðkÞ; (5)
which clearly shows that z(t) returns to its initial state with
an extra phase

This is the latitude dependence of the Foucault pendulum,
and the angle of the oscillation plane still has to travel to
complete a full 2 protation after a complete rotation of the
Earth. The corresponding Hannay phase of this classical sys-
tem is

where his the colatitude. If one views the pendulum from an
inertial reference frame with origin at the Earth’s center, thephase shift is equal to the solid angle swept out by the pendu-
lum’s path in one complete rotation of the planet.12
III. THE EQUIVALENT ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT
Equations (1)and (2)describe two coupled oscillators,
suggesting that an equivalent electrical circuit might be two
coupled LCoscillators. Note, though, that the pendulum cou-
pling is nonreciprocal: Eqs. (1)and (2)are not invariant
under an exchange of variables x() y. This complicates
the design of the equivalent circuit. We restrict ourselves to
passive electrical networks, where voltages and currents
depend only on time. A network interacts with its surround-
ings via pairs of terminals or ports. For any two ports aand
b, a network is called reciprocal if an excitation in agives
rise to a response in bthat is invariant under the permutation
a() b. As is well known, any combination of L,Cele-
ments gives rise to a reciprocal network. To introducenon-reciprocal behavior, a gyrator is used to couple the two
oscillators. Figure 1shows an electrical network that is gov-
erned by equations that are exactly analogous to Eqs. (1)and
(2)for the Foucault pendulum. The two LCoscillators have
the same resonant frequency x
0¼1=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
LCp
and are coupled
by a gyrator with transconductance G. The gyrator introdu-
ces non-reciprocal behavior into the network through the
equations relating voltage and current at its terminals: I1
¼/C0GV 2andI2¼GV 1. The time evolution of the circuit isgoverned by the following linear differential equations with
constant coefﬁcients:13

have exactly the same form, with xandyreplaced by V1and
V2, respectively, and

In order to obtain equivalent solutions to the differential
equations, the circuit must be started with the proper initial
conditions (initial capacitor voltages and inductor currents).
We will return to this point later.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
The behavior of the equivalent circuit can be simulated
using standard packages such as LT-Spice. Although a gyra-
tor is not included in the standard LT-Spice libraries, it can
be implemented using two voltage-dependent current sources
in a straightforward way. A plot of V1vsV2exactly reprodu-
ces the time evolution of the xandyprojections of the pen-
dulum bob. Initial conditions for simulation are set by the
initial capacitor voltages and inductor currents: VC0l
¼VC0r¼2:8 V, while initial currents through the inductors
are both zero. These initial conditions represent a Foucault
pendulum that starts with xð0Þ¼yð0Þand zero initial veloc-
ity. The geometric phase equivalent is now
g¼p
XTCG; (10)
so that different latitudes can be simulated just by changing
the value of G. Figure 2shows the results of simulations that
correspond to latitudes of 90/C14(pole) and 60/C14. For clarity,
only half of a full 2 protation (half of a day) is shown. For
these simulations, the circuit values are the following:
L¼0:7m H ;
C¼0:1lF;
G¼625 sin ðkÞlS;
where kis the latitude. For these component values, the
oscillation frequency ð2p/H20881LCÞ/C01ﬃ20 kHz. To set the value
ofG, we chose 40 oscillations to correspond to 1 day, i.e.,
XT¼2p/C220 kHz =40¼p/C2103s/C01, so 12 h of pendulum
motion correspond to 1 ms of simulation time. Then, from
Eqs. (6) and (10),G¼2XTCsinðkÞ¼625 sin ðkÞls.
With these values, about 40 oscillations are observable with
standard equipment despite the attenuation due to circuit
losses.
In a real, as opposed to simulated, circuit, unavoidable
component losses and unbalances arise and must be taken
into account. Equations (7)and(8)must be modiﬁed to read

tude (bottom), after 1 ms the oscillating plane reaches 45/C14þ180/C14sinð60/C14Þ¼200/C14. Note that the oscillation frequency remains unaltered when G(latitude) is
changed: 40 oscillations of the pendulum in 24 h equivalent (2 ms).

V. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS
The actual circuit used is shown in Fig. 4(with additional
construction details presented as the supplementary mate-rial14). Two identical inductors were made for L, using cop-
per wire wound on ferrite cores, for a value of L¼0:7m H
(pot core Q¼70). The wire used for the coils introduces a
parasitic resistance in series with each inductor of approxi-mately 2 X. Polyester capacitors with value C¼0:1lF
were selected to achieve the desired resonant frequencies.Voltages V
c1andVc2provide the initial charge on the capaci-
tors. Transistors T1andT4are IRFD9110 (N channel) power
MOSFETS, while T2andT3are IRFD420 (P channel) power
MOSFETS. These four devices form the switches shown inFig.3. The square-wave signal V
i(0–15 V ;20 Hz) is usedto commute the electronic switches, setting the start–stop
conditions. With this arrangement, the experiment isrestarted under the same conditions at 20 Hz, which allowsusing the oscilloscope in the average mode, ﬁltering noiseand improving the quality of the measurement.
The gyrator comprises transconductance ampliﬁers A
1and
A2, which are contained in a single LM13700 device, thus
ensuring a good match among ampliﬁers.15One of the main
drawbacks of using this device is that a modiﬁcation of G
requires the simultaneous change of the two precision resis-torsR
b. In this particular design, the main sources of losses
and unbalances are:
(1) Parasitic resistances in resonant circuits. See the supple-
mentary material for a detailed discussion.14
Fig. 4. Experimental circuit. A dual operational transconductance ampliﬁer (LM13700) is used to implement the gyrator, whose value is set by equal Rbresis-
tors. Low impedance MOSFET switches are used to impose initial conditions periodically, allowing easy visualization using an oscilloscope.
Fig. 5. Experimental results for latitude 90/C14(top) and 60/C14(bottom). Exponential attenuation is compensated in right plots using a time constant s¼0:4m si n
order to clarify the result. Note that the pendulum oscillates 20 times in 1 ms, exactly as in simulation, and that this value is not altered by the gyrato r.

(2) Finite input impedance on the trans-conductance ampli-
ﬁers LM13700 ( Raﬃ26 kX).
(3) Maximum slew rate of the ampliﬁers (max ð@v=@tÞ
¼50 V =ls). This nonlinear effect implies that the ampli-
ﬁer cannot impose a step current when excited with a(big) step input voltage. This is of importance in the ini-
tial transient response.
(4) Real switch behavior. When electronic switches are
closed ( T
2andT3in saturation), resistance is not null but
approximately 0 :3X. Aside from that MOSFETs have a
ﬁnite switching time. However, under normal opera-tional conditions, this can be ignored, if the design
ensures that the switching time is negligible when com-
pared with the oscillation period.
(5) Inductors and capacitors are not identical in both resonant
circuits. Small-value capacitors were added in parallel
with C to allow experimental tuning of the individual res-
onance frequencies. Unbalances range in the order of 1%.
(6) Mismatched ampliﬁer gains can also introduce unbal-
ance to the circuit. This issue is addressed by LM13700,which includes two well paired ampliﬁers with low
crosstalk.
(7) Magnetic coupling among inductors. This can be ignored
if made using ferrite cores.
The experimental results obtained using the circuit shown
in Fig. 4are summarized in Fig. 5. Measurements were per-
formed under the same conditions used for simulations dis-
cussed in Sec. IV. The exponential attenuation of the output
voltages V
1andV2, due to the unavoidable resistances dis-
cussed above, is a prominent feature of Fig. 5(left). The
time constant for the attenuation was calculated from Fig. 5
(left) and used to compensate for the attenuation in the phase
plane plots, Fig. 5(right). By adjusting the value of G, one
can easily change the value of k, corresponding to changing
the pendulum’s latitude, and determine the dependence of
the Hannay phase on k. Aside from a little widening of the
lobes due to the effects enumerated above, one obtains the
same geometric phase as in simulations.
VI. FINAL COMMENTS
It is feasible that to compensate for the attenuation of the
non-ideal reactive components, an active electronic circuit
with negative resistance can be added to each LC resonator.
This also can be achieved by replacing each LC resonator by
an opamp-based emulation. These variants certainly couldcontribute to obtaining a better approximation to the ideal
case. However, the corresponding implementations might
heavily increase the complexity of the circuit. In any case, it
is worth noticing that the mentioned possible inclusions are
not mandatory to obtain the Hannay Phase because, as it was
explicitly shown before, the exponential attenuation of the
signals can be compensated in a post processing procedure.
