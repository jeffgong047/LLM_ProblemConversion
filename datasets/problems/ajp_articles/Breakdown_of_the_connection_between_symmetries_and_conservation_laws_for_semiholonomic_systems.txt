Integrable velocity-dependent constraints are said to be semiholonomic. For good reasons,
holonomic and semiholonomic constraints are thought to be indistinguishable in Lagrangian
mechanics. This well-founded belief notwithstanding, here we show by means of an exampleand a broad analysis that the connection between symmetries and conservation laws, which
holds for holonomic systems, is not valid in general for systems subject to semiholonomic
constraints.

I. INTRODUCTION
The connection between symmetries and conservation
laws is fundamental not only in classical mechanics1but
also in quantum mechanics2and quantum ﬁeld theories.3In
classical mechanics, Noether’s theorem4establishes the
most general correspondence between invariance under con-
tinuous transformations and constants of the motion. The
conservation of linear momentum, angular momentum, andenergy for many-particle systems is associated with invari-ance of the action under translations, rotations, and time
displacements, respectively.
1,5,6This connection generalizes
toholonomically constrained systems as long as the
Lagrangian andthe constraints are invariant under the men-
tioned transformations.7Integrable velocity-dependent con-
straints seem, for all intents and purposes, to be equivalentto holonomic constraints because, in their integrated form,
they impose restrictions on the coordinates alone. The goal
of this note is to show, by means of an example and a gen-eral analysis, that integrable velocity-dependent constraints
are not equivalent to holonomic constraints as far as the con-
nection between symmetries and conservation laws isconcerned.
II. AN UNEXPECTED EXAMPLE
Nonintegrable velocity-dependent constraints are said to
be nonholonomic, whereas integrable velocity-dependent
constraints are called semiholonomic.
8,9A mechanical sys-
tem is semiholonomic if it is subject to velocity-dependentconstraints all of which are integrable either separately or
when taken together. The mechanical system we study from
now on is semiholonomic.
Consider a small block of mass mthat slides without fric-
tion on the inner surface of a cylindrical shell of mass Mand
radius R, as in Fig. 1. The system is in a uniform gravita-
tional ﬁeld and the cylinder rolls without slipping on a hori-zontal surface.
Let us construct a Lagrangian for this system with the use
of the coordinates xandhshown in Fig. 1, where xgives the
position of the cylinder’s center of mass with respect to theorigin of the chosen inertial reference frame. The kinetic
energy of the cylinder is
T
cyl¼M
2_x2þICM
2x2¼M_x2; (1)
where we have used ICM¼MR2and the rolling constraint
_x¼Rx, where xis the cylinder’s angular velocity about its
symmetry axis. Letting X,Ybe the Cartesian coordinates of
the block, we have
X¼xþRsinh;Y¼R/C0Rcosh; (2)
whence
_X¼_xþR_hcosh; _Y¼R_hsinh: (3)
Thus, the block’s kinetic energy is
Tblock¼m
2ð_X2þ_Y2Þ¼m
2_x2þmR2
2_h2þmR_x_hcosh:
(4)
The only varying potential energy is the block’s, given by
V¼mgY¼mgR/C0mgR cosh. Since L¼TcylþTblock/C0V,
it follows that the Lagrangian is:
L¼2Mþm
2_x2þmR2
2_h2þmR_x_hcoshþmgR cosh;
(5)
where an unimportant additive constant has been dropped.
Lagrange’s equations read
ð2MþmÞ€xþmR€hcosh/C0mR_h2sinh¼0; (6)
mR2€hþmR€xcoshþmgR sinh¼0: (7)
Since xis a cyclic coordinate of the Lagrangian (5), its con-
jugate momentum px¼@L=@_xis a constant of the motion

ð2MþmÞ_xþmR_hcosh¼px¼constant : (8)
The equation of motion (6)simply expresses the fact that
dpx=dt¼0. Aside from px, the total energy, E, is a second
independent constant of the motion. Therefore, this two-
degree-of-freedom system is integrable—see Sec. 9.7 of Ref.
7. The solution to the equations of motion by quadratures
will most likely involve elliptic or hyperelliptic functions.Finding such a solution is not the main purpose of this note,so we will not pursue this here.
The Lagrangian (5)does not depend on the cylinder’s cen-
ter of mass coordinate x; therefore, it is invariant under trans-
lations along the x-axis. In view of the connection between
translational invariance along a certain direction and conser-vation of the corresponding component of the total linearmomentum, it would be natural to expect the constant of themotion (8)to coincide with P
x, the x-component of the total
linear momentum. However, upon using (3), we ﬁnd that
Px¼M_xþm_X¼ðMþmÞ_xþmR_hcosh; (9)
which is not equal to the canonical momentum pxandis not
a constant of the motion . Therefore, in the present case,
invariance under translations does not imply conservation ofthe total linear momentum.
On second thought, the nonconservation of P
xis reason-
able because, in order for the cylinder to roll without slip-ping, there must be friction between the cylinder and the
horizontal surface. Since, from Newton’s second and third
laws, dP
x=dt¼fs, where fsis the static frictional force
exerted by the horizontal surface on the cylinder, which isthe total horizontal external force on the system, P
xcannot
remain constant.
A general theorem7states that if the Lagrangian takes the
standard form L¼T/C0V,w h e r e Vdoes not depend on the
velocities, and both the Lagrangian and the constraints, all
of them holonomic, are invariant under translations, thenthe total linear momentum is conserved. The reason for thefailure of this result in the present case appears to be theexistence of the velocity-dependent constraint _x/C0Rx¼0,
even though it is integrable. Letting /be the rotation angle
(positive clockwise) of the cylinder about its symmetryaxis, then x¼_/and the rolling constraint immediately
integrates to x/C0R//C0C¼0, with Can arbitrary constant.
In the case of an inﬁnitesimal translation along the x-axis,
dx6¼0a n d d/¼0. Therefore, in its integrated form,
the rolling constraint is not invariant under translationsbecausedðx/C0R//C0CÞ¼dx/C0Rd//C0dC¼dx6¼0: (10)
Another way to see this invariance failure is by noting that an
extended Lagrangian that yields the correct equations of motion
and the rolling constraint at a single stroke is given by

which is set up without using the rolling constraint _x¼R_/.

x/C0R//C0C¼0: (17)
Equation (16) is the same as Eq. (7). With the use of Eq.
(17), Eq. (15) becomes M€x¼/C0k. Once this is inserted into
Eq. (14) one reproduces Eq. (6). Thus, the extended
Lagrangian Lyields the correct equations of motion.
Equations (13) are sometimes referred to as the d’Alembert
generalized principle.8
It is clear that the extended Lagrangian Ldeﬁned in Eq.
(11) is not invariant under translations along the x-axis
because, although the unconstrained Lagrangian ~Ldoes not
depend on x, the added term containing the Lagrange multi-
plier does. As a consequence, the x-component of the total
linear momentum is not conserved. It should be noted that
for the unconstrained Lagrangian (12)the canonical momen-
tum conjugate to xis equal to Px, the x-component of the
total linear momentum, as expected. However, the use of the
rolling constraint _x/C0R_/¼0 to go from the unconstrained
Lagrangian ~Lto the reduced Lagrangian Lgiven in Eq. (5)
adds a contribution to the momentum conjugate to x, making
pxdifferent from Px.
By the way, the static friction force required to enforce the
rolling constraint is fs¼kinasmuch as the left-hand side of
Eq.(14)is equal to dPx=dt, as follows from Eq. (9). As is the
case for all forces in Newtonian mechanics, the constraint
force must be expressed exclusively in terms of coordinates,
velocities, and time.10Solving Eqs. (6)and(7)for€xand €h
and inserting their expressions in terms of hand _hinto Eq.
(14),fsis properly determined, if one so wishes.
An alternative way to treat the problem is by introducing
the new extended Lagrangian ~L¼ ~LþKð_x/C0R_/Þ, which
accounts for the constraint in its velocity-dependent form. It
can be easily checked that ~Lgives rise to the same equations
of motion as the above Lwith the new Lagrange multiplier
Fig. 1. The block slides without friction on the inner surface of the cylindri-
cal shell that rolls without slipping on a horizontal plane.

Krelated to the old one by _K¼/C0k. Now ~Ldoes not depend
either on xor/, implying that ~px¼@~L=@_x¼ðMþmÞ_x
þmR_hcoshþKand ~p/¼@~L=@_/¼MR2_//C0KRare con-
stants of the motion. These two constants of the motiondepend on the Lagrange multiplier, but with the use of the
constraint _x/C0R_/¼0 one ﬁnds that the combination ~p
x
þ~p/=Ryields the constant of the motion (8). This sheds light
on the meaning of the conserved canonical momentum px,
which appears as a mixture of linear and angular momenta
induced by the constraint. This distinct formulation is advan-tageous if the constraints are known to be integrable but their
expression in the integrated form is hard to ﬁnd. This may
happen in the event that there are two or more velocity-dependent constraints, which are integrable when taken
together but are not separately integrable.
In order to broaden the scope of our discussion, we pro-
ceed to a general analysis of semiholonomic systems thatmay behave similar to the mechanical system that has just
been studied.

as well as the constraint equations (22). Once the constraints
(22)are used, Eq. (27)coincides with the reduced Lagrange
equations (24).
Now, for the completion of our analysis: Let qj, for some
ﬁxed index j2f1;…;ng, be a cyclic coordinate of the
unconstrained Lagrangian ~Land of the velocity-dependent
constraints (19). This means that ~Land all of the constraint
functions gldo not depend on qj, but both ~Land at least one
of the constraint functions gldepend on _qj. Since neither ~L
nor the constraint functions gldepend on qj, the reduced
Lagrangian Lgiven in Eq. (23) does not depend on qj.
Therefore, the reduced Lagrangian is invariant under dis-placements of q
j,and the canonical momentum pj¼@L=@_qj
is a constant of the motion. On the other hand, because of
Eq.(20), at least one of the fldepends on qjsince at least one
of the gldepends on _qj. Therefore, the extended Lagrangian
(25) depends on qjand it follows that Pj¼@L=@_qjis not a
constant of the motion. This occurs because qjdoes not
appear in the constraints in their velocity-dependent formbut does appear in their integrated form. This is exactly whathappened in our example. In its velocity-dependent form, theconstraint _x/C0R_/¼0 does not depend on x, but in the inte-
grated form x/C0R//C0C¼0 it does. As it turned out, the
conserved canonical momentum p
xis different from Px, the
x-component of the total linear momentum, which is not
conserved.
As a general rule, since Pj¼@L=@_qj¼@~L=@_qj, where ~L
is the unconstrained Lagrangian, the nonconserved momen-tum P
jis a linear momentum component if qjis a

ifqjis a rotational coordinate.
IV. CONCLUSION
Semiholonomic and holonomic constraints are indistin-
guishable in just about every way. In particular, both holo-
nomic and semiholonomic constraints actually reduce thenumber of degrees of freedom of a mechanical system.9,11
This means that the reduced Lagrangian, which is obtained
by inserting the constraints into the unconstrainedLagrangian, gives rise to the correct equations of motion.
Furthermore, just like holonomic constraints, semiholonomic
constraints can be correctly treated by the d’Alembert gener-alized principle.
8Nevertheless, here we have shown that, as
far as the connection between symmetries and conservation
laws is concerned, holonomic and semiholonomic con-
straints behave differently. If the Lagrangian L¼T/C0Vand
the semiholonomic constraints in their velocity-dependent
form are invariant under translations along a certain direc-
tion, it does not follow that the corresponding component of
the total linear momentum is a constant of the motion. The
same applies to semiholonomic constraints that are invariant
under rotations in their velocity-dependent form. One can-not, in general, extend the connection between symmetriesand conservation laws, which holds for holonomic systems,to systems subject to semiholonomic constraints.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
