A simple model coupling a one-dimensional beam particle to a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is
used to explore complementarity and entanglement. This model, well-known in the inelastic scatteringliterature, is presented under three different conceptual approaches, with both analytical and numerical
techniques discussed for each. In a purely classical approach, the ﬁnal amplitude of the oscillator can
be found directly from the initial conditions. In a partially quantum approach, with a classical beamand a quantum oscillator, the ﬁnal magnitude of the quantum-mechanical amplitude for the oscillator’s
ﬁrst excited state is directly proportional to the oscillator’s classical amplitude of vibration. Nearly the
same ﬁrst-order transition probabilities emerge in the partially and fully quantum approaches, butconceptual differences emerge. The two-particle scattering wavefunction clariﬁes these differences
and allows the consequences of quantum entanglement to be explored.

I. INTRODUCTION
An understanding of quantum concepts is often built by
overlapping classical analogies, analytical models, andnumerical illustrations. After learning about a particle’s clas-
sical momentum, students are shown that a particle’s de
Broglie wavelength depends on the inverse of that momen-
tum. Students may then analytically model the one-
dimensional (1 D) reﬂection and transmission of de Brogliewaves from a potential barrier, whose analogous classical
counterparts would all have been stopped by the same bar-
rier. Further insight can be gained by numerically modelingsuch reﬂection and transmission events using wave packets.
Each of these approaches teases out new qualitative and
quantitative connections.
1
Recent years have seen an increasing consensus that the
concept of entanglement—the inability of some quantum
states to be written as the product of individual particlestates—should be a part of every student’s quantum toolkit.
As Schroeder pointed out in “Entanglement isn’t just for
spins,” entanglement generically arises when quantum par-ticles interact with each other.
2In that paper, Schroeder pre-
sented two dynamical models showing how entanglement
emerges, but lamented that such examples are rarely
included in quantum mechanics textbooks. “The reason,” he
conceded, “is probably that despite their conceptual simplic-ity, a quantitative treatment of either scenario requires
numerical methods.”
This paper presents a conceptually simple model that can
model entanglement without resorting to numerical methods.The level of mathematical difﬁculty in this treatment is simi-
lar to that of the commonly taught models involving poten-
tial barriers. The model is a simpliﬁed 1D treatment of
inelastic scattering. It is well-known to the electron spectros-
copy community
3and is similar to the model of a 1D atom
scattering off a 1D harmonic oscillator presented in this jour-
nal several decades ago by Knudson,4though this treatment
differs in its attention to the time-evolution of the scatteringprocess.
In the model under review, a beam particle is coupled to a
harmonic oscillator, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The modelHamiltonian sums the contributions of a 1D free particle of
mass m(position variable x, conjugate momentum p
x), a 1D
harmonic oscillator of reduced mass land resonance fre-
quency x0(position variable y, conjugate momentum py),
and an interaction term H1that couples the two systems

interaction: (1)
The coupling constant arationalizes units and tunes the
strength of the interaction, and the spatially varying “window
function” f(x) is taken to have units of length–2and to die off
asxapproaches 61. The negative sign in H1means that the
oscillator is attracted toward the beam when aandf(x) are
positive, but changing this sign would not signiﬁcantly alterany results.
Though its form is simple, this model can be used to cap-
ture real physics. For instance, in “Characterizing localizedsurface plasmons using electron energy-loss spectroscopy,”Cherqui et al.
5derived “classical” and “quantum”
Hamiltonians for the electron-plasmon interaction (their Eqs.14 and 15) that map, respectively, onto our Eqs. (1)and(30),
but for the fact that an electron couples to inﬁnitely manyplasmonic modes, while our beam couples to just one oscil-lator. For the plasmonic case, as an electron nears a nanopar-ticle, a surface charge is induced, which in turn interactswith the electron via the Coulomb potential. The physics inthis model is analogous, with the passing beam tugging onthe oscillator, and the oscillator in turn tugging back on thebeam.
In addition to its discussion of entanglement, this presenta-
tion also highlights conceptual issues surrounding classical/quantum complementarity.
6Complementarity is explored
implicitly as different approaches to the model are pre-sented—a classical approach (Sec. II), and, after a review of
perturbation theory (Sec. III), partially and fully quantum
approaches (Secs. IVand V). Complementarity then is
addressed explicitly in Sec. VI, where the transition from

one approach to the next is discussed, and Sec. VIIexplores
post-interaction entanglement, showing how predictions may
change in entangled systems following a measurement.Section VIII is a short summary.
II. CLASSICAL APPROACH
Solving the model in the classical approach requires only
standard tools. Applying Hamilton’s equations

which can be solved either by analytical or numerical
methods.
A. Analytical calculation
If we suppose that the kinetic energy of our beam far
exceeds the magnitude of the interaction energy between the
beam and the harmonic oscillator, we will be safe in approxi-mating the motion of the beam particle as
x/C25vt: (5)
Under this approximation, the equation of motion for the
oscillator becomes that of a driven harmonic oscillatorld2y
dt2¼/C0lx2
0yþafðvtÞ: (6)
Using the Fourier transform convention
~fðxÞ¼1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2ppðþ1
/C01dteixtfðvtÞ; (7)
we can transform both sides of Eq. (6)to obtain
/C0lx2~yðxÞ¼/C0 lx2
0~yðxÞþa~fðxÞ; (8)
which can easily be solved algebraically to give us
~yðxÞ¼/C0a~fðxÞ
lðx2/C0x2
0Þ: (9)
In principle, the story that this tells is simple. As the beam
passes, it pulls on the oscillator a bit, and once the beam isfar enough away, the oscillator will be left vibrating withwhatever amplitude it had once the beam and oscillator weresufﬁciently separated to effectively decouple. In principle,we should be able to ﬁnd the ﬁnal amplitude of the oscilla-tor’s vibration by performing the inverse Fourier transform
of Eq. (9)to ﬁnd y(t).
In practice, however, we would like our calculation to
depend less sensitively on phases, so instead we can calcu-late the work done on the beam. This work will be negative,
since the beam loses energy as it passes, but the magnitudeof this energy loss equals the magnitude of the energy gainby the oscillator, since the combined system is energy-
conserving. This transfer can then be used to calculate the
oscillator amplitude.
To calculate the work done on the beam, one can (a)
rewrite the work integral as an integral over time; (b) insertthe expression for y(t) as an inverse Fourier transform; (c)
reverse the order of the time and frequency integrals; and (d)perform the frequency integral by slightly displacing thepoles off the real axis by i/C15and using the residue theorem.
These steps are carried out in detail in the Appendix . This
gives us the result that

We might notice that this work done on the oscillator is pro-
portional to the oscillator amplitude squared. If the oscilla-tor’s classical amplitude is y

a beam particle, and the other ( y) represents the vibrational displacement of
an oscillator. The beam and oscillator are coupled via H1, a potential that
depends on the product of a coupling constant a, the oscillator displacement
y, and some spatially dependent function f(x), which may depend implicitly
on an impact parameter b.

For speciﬁcity, let’s consider an example. Suppose we
approximate a dipole potential with a thinner-tailed
Gaussian,7such that our window function f(x)i s
fðxÞ¼b/C02e/C0x2=b2: (14)
If we insert our approximate solution x/C25vtinto this
fðvtÞ¼b/C02e/C0v2t2=b2; (15)
we can take the Fourier transform (Eq. (7)) to yield
~fðxÞ¼e/C0b2x2=4v2

and the oscillator’s vibrational amplitude (Eq. (13))i s

B. Numerical calculation
Of course, one may avoid Fourier transforms altogether
and simply evolve the equations of motion numerically,
using, for instance, the Euler–Richardson method.8Using
units where /C22h¼x0¼m¼1,b¼10, and l¼100, and using
the window function speciﬁed in Eq. (14), the results of this
are shown in Fig. 2for four different initial velocities of the
beam particle (i.e., of dx/dtatt/C28/C0 b=v), of vequal to 1.0,
3.0, 7.0, and 15. In each of the subplots, the classical ampli-
tude ymhas been numerically checked and matches the value
predicted analytically in Eq. (18).
III. PERTURBATION THEORY REVIEW
However, there is a problem. The classical approach is
empirically inadequate for micro- or mesoscopic systems,since the beam particle, in fact, will not lose energy eachtime it passes the (generalized) oscillator. Sometimes the
beam particle will be observed to lose energy, but most ofthe time it will pass by without any energy loss at all.
As a result, we will want to develop a quantum version of
the model. We are interested in both analytical and numeri-
cal solutions, and when we want analytical solutions in quan-tum mechanics, we often turn to the perturbation theory. Solet’s brieﬂy remind ourselves, now, about time-dependentperturbation theory.

Suppose we have an unperturbed Hamiltonian operator ^H0
whose eigenvectors jn0iare known,
^H0jn0i¼E0
njn0i: (19)
Solutions of the Schrodinger equation,
i/C22h@jwi
@t¼^Hjwi; (20)
can be written, without loss of generality, in terms of coefﬁ-
cients cnðtÞ,
jwðtÞi ¼X
ncnðtÞe/C0iE0
nt=/C22hjn0i: (21)
When the Hamiltonian in question is the unperturbed
Hamiltonian ^H¼^H0, one can substitute Eq. (21) into the
Schrodinger equation to conﬁrm that the coefﬁcients cnare
constant in time. When the Hamiltonian is perturbed by a
weak (and possibly time-dependent) term^H1ðtÞsuch that
^H¼^H0þ^H1ðtÞ, the cncoefﬁcients will still be useful, since
they vary more slowly in time than state coefﬁcients would
without factoring out exp ð/C0iE0
nt=/C22hÞ.
Applying the operator hf0jexpðþiE0
ft=/C22hÞto both sides
of Eq. (20) and inserting the expansion of Eq. (21), we can
ﬁnd the time-dependence of any state coefﬁcient cfas

which will be sufﬁcient to let us calculate excitation proba-
bilities analytically for both of the common quantum-
mechanical approaches to the model being reviewed.
IV. PARTIALLY QUANTUM APPROACH
The partially quantized approach has us treat the oscillator
as quantized while treating the beam only as the source of a
time-dependent perturbation. If the beam is still modeled as
a classical particle whose path follows x/C25vt, the
Hamiltonian that acts on the oscillator wavefunction is

This form will allow us to use the perturbation theory, since
the energy eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator
jni, with En¼ðnþ1=2Þ/C22hx0, are well-known.
A. Analytical calculation
Of course, for the quantum harmonic oscillator, yandpy
do not commute but follow

terms of creation and annihilation operators

If the quantized oscillator begins its ground state of j0i
with energy E0¼/C22hx0=2, we can calculate its probability of
being kicked into its excited energy eigenstate jniat energy
En¼ðnþ1=2Þ/C22hx0using Eq. (26)
Pn¼1
/C22h2/C12/C12/C12/C12ðþ1
/C01hnj^H1ðtÞeinx0tj0idt/C12/C12/C12/C122
: (31)
This expression predicts that the only possible transition
(considering ﬁrst-order perturbations) is from j0i!j 1i,
with the probability
P1¼pa2
/C22hlx0j~fðx0Þj2: (32)
We might pause, now, to reﬂect on how this compares to
the outcome of the purely classical system. In the purelyclassical system, we found that the ﬁnal amplitude of the
oscillator y
mcould be calculated deterministically as a func-
tion of the initial beam speed. For the partially quantumsystem, the same can be said of the probability P1of ﬁnding
the quantum harmonic oscillator in its ﬁrst excited state.
In fact, if we compare ymandP1, we ﬁnd that
P1¼lx0
2/C22hy2
m; (33)
or, equivalently, that
ym¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2/C22h
lxP1s
: (34)
To belabor this point, we notice that the probability P1is
proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefﬁcient
toj1i, so, to ﬁrst order, the classical oscillation amplitude is
directly proportional to the magnitude of the quantum ampli-
tude of the j0i!j 1itransition.
B. Numerical calculation
What about a straightforward numerical solution? Suppose
we begin with the oscillator in its ground state, represented as
the normalized position wavefunction
w0ðyÞ¼h yj0i¼1

The most direct way to proceed is simply to use the time-

where in the position representation, the time-dependent

If the system starts in its ground state at some time t/C28/C0 b=v,
then it can be evolved forward in time using ﬁnite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) methods.10
The numerical calculation for this is shown in Fig. 3, for
v¼7 and the other model parameters kept the same as for
the classical simulations, as quoted in Sec. IV B. The dashed

which, as we might expect, follows the classical result y(t)
forv¼7 shown in Fig. 2, as will be further established in our
discussion of complementarity below (Sec. VI).
From there, one can also calculate the overlap between the
wavefunction and its various energy eigenstates to ﬁnd prob-
abilities. One may numerically calculate
hw1jwi¼ðþ1
/C01dyw/C3
1ðyÞwðyÞ (41)
to ﬁnd the probability of transition from j0i!j 1ias
P1¼j hw1jwij2(42)
and similarly to ﬁnd the probability of remaining in state j0i
asP0. These probabilities are shown on the right in Fig. 3,
and they match the analytical prediction of Eq. (32).
V. FULLY QUANTUM APPROACH
If we want to treat our model in a fully quantum-
mechanical way, the simplest way is to include the beam and
the oscillator in a combined quantum state.
To make the problem analytically tractable, it will be use-
ful to introduce a box length Lover which our wavefunction
runs in x, so as to make it normalizable. This will allow us to
smuggle in classical notions like the velocity of the particle,
since the time integral as the beam goes from /C0L=2t oþL=2
can be written, if we consider that the beam travels at a speed
of approximately vthroughout, as going from t/C0¼/C0L=2vto
tþ¼þL=2v.
Plane waves constitute energy eigenfunctions of the free
particle, which we can write in terms of k-vectors with
k¼mv=/C22h. We can also reuse the energy eigenstates of the
harmonic oscillator, which we will now express as jniy.S o
we can write a general quantum-mechanical state for the
beam-oscillator system as

Products of the plane waves along xand harmonic oscillator

Hamiltonian, but for the coupling term linking the two,
H1¼/C0ayfðxÞ: (46)
Using this, we can proceed here just as above, calculating
the transition coefﬁcient ckx;nast!1 using Eq. (24).
The initial state ji0i, with energy Ei, can be written as

It is worth noticing that while the energy eigenstates of the
oscillator are fairly well-localized in y, the plane-wave
energy eigenstates of the beam are spread out over the entirespace in x. Though these plane-wave beam states connect
only loosely to “particle” concepts, their status as energy
eigenstates of the uncoupled beam allows us to use a stan-
dard perturbation theory.
At this point, we can once again use Eq. (26) to calculate
our ﬁrst-order transition probabilities. We ﬁrst ﬁnd

However, the only way for Ldependence to vanish is if

reveals that this P1indeed matches that of Eq. (32).
B. Numerical calculation (setup only)
The numerical calculation for the purely quantum model
may at ﬁrst seem like a straightforward generalization of the
methods of Sec. IV B. That is, there is nothing to stop one
from using the Hamiltonian representation of Eq. (45), set-
ting up a large box, and following the time evolution of theSchrodinger equation
i/C22h@
@twðx;yÞ¼ ^Hwðx;yÞ; (56)
using FDTD methods just as above.However, this calculation is not likely to be terribly infor-
mative. Regardless of how sharply peaked the beam par-
ticle’s spatial wavefunction begins, it will tend to become
increasingly broad with time.11Understanding the ﬁnal state,
then, will require us to take the spatial Fourier transform of
the spread-out wavefunction in xto disentangle probabilities
for possible measurements of entangled harmonic oscillator
and beam momentum states.
Of course, we might start out with a partially transformed
wavefunction /C22wðkx;yÞand time evolve that using FDTD.
However, the equation of motion for this

/C22wðkx;yÞ
/C0aﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2pp y/C22fðkxÞ/C3/C22wðkx;yÞ; (57)
involves a convolution in each time-step
/C22fðkxÞ/C3/C22wðkx;yÞ¼ðþ1
/C01dk0/C22fðk0Þ/C22wðkx/C0k0;yÞ; (58)
which is possible, but which (as discussed below) would
obscure the x-dependence and would make it difﬁcult to dis-
tinguish between the “initial” and “ﬁnal” states.
C. Approximate solution
In the parts of the wavefunction wðx;yÞwhere the beam
position x/C280 and fðxÞ/C250, we should expect the “initial”
wavefunction to be essentially that deﬁned in Eq. (47),u pt o
a phase factor. When the beam energy is much greater than
the magnitude of the interaction energy, we should expectvery little of the beam’s incoming wave to be reﬂected.
When the beam reaches the region x/C290 where again
fðxÞ/C250, the beam and oscillator once again will evolve
without interaction. In this region, the “ﬁnal” wavefunction
could be sampled over a large range with x/C290 and the
Fourier transform could be taken in xto disentangle the out-
come probabilities.
To visualize this, we may construct an approximate ﬁrst-
order wavefunction for the scattering states.12From our ﬁrst-
order results, we may write13
jwfðkx;y;tÞi /C25 j k0ixj0iyþd1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃP1pjk1ixj1iy/C16/C17
e/C0iEit=/C22h;
(59)
where Eiis just the system energy established in Eq. (47),d1
is a complex phase factor with jd1j¼1, and the relationship
between k0andk1is set by Eq. (52).
In this “ﬁnal” region where x/C290, there will be negligible
further interactions between the beam and the oscillator.
Hence, the probability density of this approximate solution
will not evolve further in time
hwfjwfi/C25dkx;k0jw0ðyÞj2þP1dkx;k1jw1ðyÞj2: (60)
This is plotted in Fig. 4, using the same parameters as in
Fig. 3, albeit with the kx-states broadened for visibility.
Visualized in this way, it is easy to imagine these possibili-
ties as distinct “branches” of the wavefunction.
If this ﬁnal state density is stationary in time, how would
one go down from the higher-level descriptions of wðx;yÞor
801 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 David Kordahl 801 04 October 2023 22:58:01
/C22wðkx;yÞto the less informative descriptions of wðyÞor just
the classical xandy? This is the essential question of com-
plementarity, to which we now turn.
VI. COMPLEMENTARITY
How might one relate the fully quantum approach to the
partially quantum approach? The fully quantum approach of
Sec. Vuses maximally dispersed plane waves states to
describe the beam, while the partially quantum approach of
Sec. IVtreats the beam as a classical particle whose position
is sharply deﬁned at all times. Yet the reduced wavefunctionwðyÞshould follow:
wðyÞ¼ð
þ1
/C01dxwðx;yÞ: (61)
What assumptions might allow this to be true?
Thinking it through more carefully, we can integrate out x
on both sides of the two-particle Schrodinger equation (Eq.
(56)) to obtain a correct expression for the dynamics of wðyÞ,
assuming that the wavefunction and its derivatives vanish at
inﬁnity. In this case, we ﬁnd that
i/C22h@
@twðyÞ¼/C0/C22h2
2l@2
@y2wðyÞþ1
2lx2
oy2wðyÞ
/C0ðþ1
/C01dxayfðxÞwðx;yÞ: (62)
Comparing this to the Hamiltonian of the partially quantum
approach (Eq. (27)), we can see that the only difference will
occur in the interaction terms of the two approaches. Setting
these terms equal, we ﬁnd
ðþ1
/C01dx fðxÞwðx;yÞ/C25fðvtÞðþ1
/C01dxwðx;yÞ: (63)
In other words, for the partially and fully quantum
approaches to agree, f(x) must both be moved outside theintegral, which is reasonable only if f(x) varies much more
slowly in xthanwðx;yÞ, and must also follow fðxÞ/C25fðvtÞ,
which is reasonable only when xis near hxi, presuming that
hxi/C25 vt. Since the region near hxiis also where the interac-
tion term will be most signiﬁcant to the dynamics of thecombined wavefunction, such an approximation may be less
egregious than it ﬁrst seems.
On a more limited level, how might we recover the time-
dependence of w/C3ðyÞwðyÞwhen our approximate hwfjwfi
appears to be stationary in time? Here, we need to integrateout the jki
xparts of jwðkx;y;tÞi, including their time depen-
dence. We can do this reduction explicitly for our approxi-
mate ﬁnal-state wavefunction, Eq. (59)
jwðy;tÞi ¼X
kxhkxjeiEkt=/C22hjwðkx;y;tÞi
¼j0iye/C0ix0t=2þd1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P1p
j1iye/C03ix0t=2: (64)
An easy way to check that this reproduces the dynamics of
wðyÞas calculated in Sec. IVis to obtain the expected value
ofy. For our reduced approximate wavefunction (Eq. (64)),
we can calculate hyias
hwðy;tÞjyjwðy;tÞi ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2/C22hP1
lx0s
Red1e/C0ix0t/C2/C3
: (65)
The amplitude of the oscillation for this expected value
exactly matches the amplitude of the classical displacement
for the oscillator [Eq. (34)], just as it should.
The single-particle wavefunction wðyÞcan also be linked
to the classical oscillator displacement yusing Ehrenfest’s
theorem.14For any quantum operator ^A, Ehrenfest’s theorem
predicts
d
dth^Ai¼1
i/C22hh^A;^H/C2/C3
iþ/C28@^A
@t/C29
: (66)
We may apply this machinery to connect the partially
quantum approach to the classical approach. Using the
Hamiltonian, Eq. (27) and the position-momentum commu-
tator, Eq. (28), we can easily calculate
^py;^Hhi
¼þi/C22h/C0lx2yþafðvtÞ/C0/C1
; (67)
which can be inserted into Eq. (66)to yield
dh^pyi
dt¼/C0lx2
0hyiþafðvtÞ: (68)
This can be compared with the classical equation
dpy
dt¼/C0lx2
0yþafðvtÞ; (69)
demonstrating that h^pyiandpyfollow the same dynamics.
The same exercise can be carried out for hyiandy, and the
ﬁrst-order equations in time can then be combined to yieldsecond-order equations al aEq.(4).
VII. ENTANGLEMENT
Schroeder has pointed out that interactions in quantum
systems generically introduce entanglement.2Returning to
Fig. 4. A schematic visualization of the two-particle wavefunction density,
before (left) and after (right) scattering.
802 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 David Kordahl 802 04 October 2023 22:58:01
the approximate ﬁnal-state wavefunction of Eq. (59),w ec a n
easily conﬁrm that the state is indeed entangled, since it can-
not be written as the product of single-particle wavefunctions.
How, then, would our expectations about measurements bealtered by the order in which we measure the oscillator andthe beam?
In the usual way of discussing quantum mechanics, the
wavefunction jwi“collapses” upon measurement.
15The
modiﬁed wavefunction post-measurement jw0ican be written
in terms of a projection operator ^Pas
jw0i¼^Pjwiﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
hwj^Pjwiq : (70)
The projection operator, here, collapses the wavefunction
into a determinate state for whatever relevant quantity has
just been measured, and the denominator serves to reinforcenormalization on the collapsed wavefunction.
Measuring one particle in a system but not the other
requires us to alter the ﬁnal state wavefunction using a par-
tial projection operator.
16For instance, where we ﬁrst to
measure the ﬁnal momentum of our beam particle with avalue k
1, the projection operator,
^Pk1¼jk1ihk1jx/C10^1y; (71)
could be applied to our wavefunction approximation (Eq.
(59)) to produce a post-collapse wavefunction of
jw0i¼j k1ixj1iy; (72)
where we have omitted the factor of d1e/C0iEit=/C22h, since this is a
phase factor of unit magnitude. Notice, then, that any subse-quent predictions for the oscillator would simply match those
of its ﬁrst energy eigenstate.
Likewise, where we ﬁrst to measure the oscillator’s dis-
placement as y
0, we could update our wavefunction using the
projection operator
^Py0¼^1x/C10jy0ihy0jy; (73)
which, realizing that hy0jniy¼wnðy0Þ, would lead to the
updated wavefunction (again, omitting a phase factor) of
jw0i¼w0ðy0Þjk0ixjy0iyþd1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃP1pw1ðy0Þjk1ixjy0iyﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
jw0ðy0Þj2þjw0ðy0Þj2q :(74)
From this, we ﬁnd that a measurement of y0far from the ori-
gin increases the probability that the beam has reduced its
momentum from k0tok1, since the oscillator’s ground-state
wavefunction w0ðyÞ(Eq. (35)) has thinner tails than the
excited-state wavefunction w1ðyÞ(Eq.(36)).
These results are summarized in Fig. 5, which uses all the
same model parameters as in Figs. 3and4. If the beam
momentum is measured ﬁrst, this changes our predictions for
the oscillator displacement probabilities. If the oscillator dis-placement is measured ﬁrst, this changes our predictions forthe beam momentum probabilities.
While such claims are undoubtedly of academic interest,
we should concede how minimally they bear on most real
experiments. To make an analogy with real experiments, the“oscillator” is just the sample being studied, and the “beam”
is just the probe being used. Given the results of Fig. 5,w h y
is the order of quantum measurements not a critical part ofall experimental protocols?
It is because any “measurement” typically involves further
interactions and, thus, further branching and entanglement.The entanglement of the sample with the probe allows exper-
imental measurements of the probe to tell us something
about the sample,
17but it typically is difﬁcult to make fur-
ther measurements on the sample that preserve quantum
coherence. After all, most quantum systems whose positions
can be pinned down (e.g., an atomic defect in a crystal) inter-act with their substrates and the beam alike, and the intru-
sions of environmental decoherence conspire to obviate the
need for such worries.18
VIII. CONCLUSION
What, then, has been learned? Three complementary
approaches to a simple model Hamiltonian yield results thatconceptually differ, but quantitatively match. In the classical
approach, the beam particle transfers a predictable quantity
of energy to the oscillator as it passes. When the classical
oscillator is replaced by a quantum oscillator, the quantum
oscillator’s displacement expectation value oscillates with anamplitude matching that of the classical oscillator, and the
quantum amplitude of the ﬁrst excited state has a magnitude
that is directly proportional to the classical amplitude. Whenboth the beam particle and the harmonic oscillator are treated
as quantum objects, however, the interaction between the
two objects induces entanglement. The conditions allowingthese three approaches to match were explored, and the con-
sequences of partial wavefunction “collapse” on measure-
ments of entangled systems were demonstrated.

Fig. 5. Left: If the beam momentum is measured ﬁrst as /C22hk0(top left), the
oscillator displacement predictions can be found by integrating over the
ground-state wavefunction jw0ðyÞj2. If the beam momentum is measured ﬁrst
as/C22hk1(bottom left), the oscillator displacement predictions can be found by
integrating over the excited-state wavefunction jw1ðyÞj2. Right: Given a
measurement of oscillator displacement y0, smaller magnitudes of y0increase
the probability of measuring the beam in its original momentum state /C22hk0
(top right), and larger magnitudes of y0increase the probability of measuring
the beam in its reduced momentum state /C22hk1(bottom right).
