We present an overview of the thermal history of the Universe and the sequence of objects (e.g.,
protons, planets, and galaxies) that condensed out of the background as the Universe expanded andcooled. We plot (i) the density and temperature of the Universe as a function of time and (ii) the
masses and sizes of all objects in the Universe. These comprehensive pedagogical plots draw
attention to the triangular regions forbidden by general relativity and quantum uncertainty and help
navigate the relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics. How can we interpret their
intersection at the smallest possible objects: Planck-mass black holes (“instantons”)? Does theirPlanck density and Planck temperature make them good candidates for the initial conditions of the
Universe? Our plot of all objects also seems to suggest that the Universe is a black hole. We explain
how this depends on the unlikely assumption that our Universe is surrounded by zero densityMinkowski space.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Condensation of objects
The early Universe was a hot plasma of fundamental rela-
tivistic particles: quarks, leptons, photons, and gluons. Therewere no composite objects such as protons, atoms, planets,or galaxies.
1–5As the Universe cooled, composite objects
condensed out of the background much as droplets of steamcondense out of hot water vapor as it cools. This condensa-tion happened when the binding energy of an objectexceeded the background energy. For example, as theUniverse expanded and cooled during the quark-hadron tran-sition, the binding energy of the strong force overcame thebackground energy as the quark-gluon plasma condensedinto protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. With furtherexpansion and decrease in temperature, during the epoch ofbig bang nucleosynthesis, the binding energy of the residualstrong force overcame the background energy as the hotplasma of protons and neutrons condensed into atomicnuclei. Further expansion and cooling led to the formation ofhelium and then hydrogen atoms when the binding energy of
coulomb forces overcame the background energy. With fur-
ther cooling, chemical bond energies overcame the kineticenergy of atoms as they condensed into molecules. Furthercooling allowed matter-overdensities to form stars, planets,galaxies, and clusters of galaxies as their gravitational bind-ing energy overcame their kinetic energy.
1,2
As a result of this sequence of condensations, due to the
strong force, electromagnetism, and gravity, the Universe isnow ﬁlled with protons, atoms, molecules, stars, planets,black holes, and galaxies whose densities are higher than thecurrent average density of the Universe. These condensationscan also be described as ﬁrst-order symmetry-breaking phasetransitions from a disordered higher symmetry hot phase to amore ordered lower symmetry cooler phase.
3,4To help quan-
tify the context for this sequence of transitions, we computeand plot (Fig. 1) the time dependence of the decreasing den-
sity and temperature of the Universe.
B. Changing dominant densities in the Universe
Starting with inﬂation, the dominant densities have been
the densities of the false vacuum energy of inﬂation ( X
Ki),radiation ( Xr), matter ( Xm), and ﬁnally today, vacuum energy
or dark energy ( XK). The three transitions among these four
epochs are known, respectively, as reheating, matter-
radiation equality, and the beginning of vacuum energy
domination.
The details of inﬂation are largely unknown.3,12For sim-
plicity, we assume the initial condition at the Planck time
that the Universe was at the Planck temperature and the
Planck density ( tp,Tp, and qp, respectively). We assume the
Universe underwent inﬂationary expansion13–15that ended at
the grand uniﬁed theory (GUT) scale ( t/C2410/C032s) when
reheating produced a radiation-dominated Universe with anenergy density equal to the energy density during inﬂation:q
GUT¼qKi.16Following Refs. 1and 17, we also assume
radiation domination before inﬂation. These assumptionsconstrain inﬂation to start at t/C2410
/C036s.
As the Universe expanded, the scalefactor ( a) increased.
Since the density of radiation qr/a/C04, while the density of
matter qm/a/C03, expansion led to matter-radiation equality:
qr/C24qm. After equality, the Universe became matter domi-
nated and gravity, like the other stronger forces before it,could begin to condense or accrete objects out of thebackground.
C. Relativistic degrees of freedom in the early
Universe: g
/C3
A couple of minutes after the big bang ( t/H11407102s), as the
Universe expanded and the scale factor of the Universeincreased, the average temperature of the photons ﬁlling theUniverse decreased according to Eq. (1). If we want the tem-
perature at earlier times, the more general Eq. (2)is needed.
It depends on both the scale factor and on g
/C3, the number of
relativistic degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium with
the photons1,3,18

microwave background (CMB) photons.19Theg/C3in Eq. (2)

can be thought of as a measure of the heat capacity of the hot
relativistic plasma. It is analogous to the number of degreesof freedom of a polyatomic gas. As the temperatureincreases, more vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom
become available. Energy added to the system has to be par-
titioned among the increasing number of degrees of freedom,rather than directly increasing the temperature of the system.With more degrees of freedom, the heat capacity of the gas
increases.
Similarly, as we go back in time (before t/C2410
2s) to the
increasingly high energies of the early Universe, g/C3increasesas the two degrees of freedom of photons are joined in ther-
mal equilibrium by the degrees of freedom of the increas-ingly numerous relativistic particles. Hot relativistic particles
act like massless photons since their energy, E¼ðp
2c2
þm2c4Þ1=2is dominated by their momentum and can be
well-approximated by E/C25pc. As we go back in time, get-
ting closer to the big bang, g/C3increases. Thus, we need to
replace Eq. (1)with Eq. (2), from which we can see that as
we get closer to the big bang, Tdoes not increase as fast as
/C24a/C01. In the lower panel of Fig. 1, we can see that g/C3begins
to increase for t/H11351102s. If photons are the only form of radi-
ation, Eqs. (1)and(2)are identical since g/C3¼2 (one degree
of freedom for each of the two photon spin states).
Currently, neutrinos are not in thermal equilibrium with
the 3 K photons of the cosmic microwave background. The
relativistic degrees of freedom of neutrinos are not included
in our g/C3for temperatures T/H113511010K when they are
decoupled from photons.
Similar to temperature in Eq. (2), the energy density qrof
a relativistic gas also depends on g/C3. If we only have pho-
tons, the energy density is given in Eq. (3). However, if there
are other relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium withphotons at a common temperature T, to compute their com-
bined energy density we need to multiply Eq. (3)byg
/C3=2t o
obtain the generalization Eq. (4).1,7,8Finally, using Eq. (2),
we substitute for Tin Eq. (4)and obtain Eq. (5): the energy
density in all relativistic degrees of freedom (in thermalequilibrium with photons) as a function of scale factor and

Comparing Eqs. (2)and(5), we see that both temperature
and density have the same g/C01=3
/C3 dependence. Inserting the
g/C3of the lower panel of Fig. 1into Eqs. (2)and(5)enables
us to plot in the upper panel of Fig. 1the time dependence of
the background temperature and density during the conden-
sation of objects in the Universe.
II. PLOT OF ALL OBJECTS
A. Objects and isodensity lines
In Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the
Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons, plan-ets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids, and the
Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass of 70 kg
and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity), while whalesare represented by a mass of 10
5kg and a radius of 7 m.
Objects with uniform density qare described by m/qr3.
Thus, in a log(m)–log(r) plot such as Fig. 2, all objects of the
same density fall along the same isodensity line of slope 3.For example, atoms and objects made of atoms, such as lifeon Earth (viruses, bacteria, ﬂeas, humans, and whales) aste-
roids, moons, planets, and main sequence stars, lie close to
the atomic density line q
atomic/C24qwater¼1g m =cm3. At the
top of the plot, this line is labeled “atomic 103s,” because
Fig. 1. (Color online) Top panel: The decreasing average temperature and
density of the Universe as a function of time (and on the upper x-axis as a
function of scale factor a). The solid black line is the energy density of radi-
ation and matter ( qrþqm). The dashed black line is the energy density of
the vacuum. The red line is the average temperature of the Universe. The
background is color-coded to show the densities that dominate the Universe
as a function of time. From left to right starting at the Planck time, the domi-
nant densities are: pink (radiation, Xr), grey (false vacuum energy of inﬂa-
tion,XKi), pink (radiation, Xr), blue (matter, Xm), and light grey (vacuum
energy or dark energy, XK). The transition from the matter domination to
the current dark energy domination occurred at t/C252:4/C21017s after the big
bang (about 6.1 /C2109years ago). Because of the logarithmic time axis, this
transition is barely distinguishable to the left of the vertical “now” line
(4:4/C21017s). This plot assumes a KCDM Universe with
Xm¼0:3060:02;XK¼0:7060:02;Ho¼7062k ms/C01Mpc/C01. “GUT” is
the energy scale of grand uniﬁed theories, “EW” is the electroweak energyscale, “QGP” is the epoch of quark-gluon plasma while “BBN” is the epoch
of big bang nucleosynthesis. Bottom panel: The effective number of relativ-
istic degrees of freedom g
/C3as a function of time. Estimates of g/C3for times
t/H1140710/C010s are from Refs. 1and6–9.A tt/C2410/C010s, the particles of the stan-
dard model are relativistic and produce 106.75 degrees of freedom. The
large uncertainty in g/C3fort/H1135110/C010s is the notional range taken from Ref. 6.
At these earlier times and higher energies, the values of g/C3are poorly con-
strained and depend on the model of high energy particle physics (Refs. 1
and10). The values of g/C3in the bottom panel, when inserted into Eqs. (2)
and(5)produce the temperatures and energy densities in the top panel. To
be explicit and simple, we have assumed g/C3ðt<10/C032sÞ¼g/C3ðt¼10/C032sÞ.
Times before the Planck time are labelled “sub-Planckian unknown.” On
any log(time) axis, t¼0 is inﬁnitely far to the left. This choice precludes all
models in which time has no beginning (e.g., Ref. 11).

objects along this isodensity line have the density of water,
and because the entire Universe had this density at the end of
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, /C24103s after the big bang.
Protons, neutrons, and neutron stars are found along the
slope ¼3, nuclear density line which is /C2414 orders of mag-
nitude more dense than anything made of atoms:
qnuclear =qatomic/C241014. It is labeled “nuclear 10/C06s” because
the entire Universe was at this nuclear density a millionth of
a second after the big bang.
The largest objects in the upper right are super-clusters of
galaxies with densities approximately 20% larger than thecurrent matter density of the Universe. For completeness, we
have also plotted the largest known voids. The current matterdensity is the longest diagonal isodensity line on the right
labeled at the top “now 10
17s”). This density is the value in
Fig.1of the black ( qrþqm) line at t¼now.
B. Black holes and the zone forbidden by gravity
In Fig. 2, gravity and quantum uncertainty create large for-
bidden triangular regions where no known objects can exist.
All Schwarzschild black holes, from the smallest Planck-
Fig. 2. (Color online) Masses, sizes, and relative densities of objects in our Universe. Time-dependent background densities are color-coded as in F ig.1. The
diagonal white dashed isodensity lines correspond to the intersections in Fig. 1of the vertical isochron lines with the black density line. Gravity and quantum
uncertainty prevent objects of a given mass from being smaller than their corresponding Schwarzschild radius [Eq. (6)] or Compton wavelength [Eq. (7)].
Schwarzschild black holes lie on the black m/rdiagonal line which is the lower boundary of the “forbidden by gravity” region. The masses and Compton
wavelengths of the top quark (t), Higgs boson ( Ho), proton (p), electron (e), and neutrinos ( /C23) are plotted along the Compton ( m/r/C01) diagonal line. Among
these, the top quark has the smallest Compton wavelength, because it has the largest mass: 173GeVc/C02. The smallest possible object is a Planck-mass black
hole indicated by the white dot labeled “instanton” (Ref. 20). Its mass and size are ðm;rÞ¼ð mp;lpÞ. The smallest observable (not yet evaporated) primordial
black hole (PBH) that could have survived until today has approximately the same size as a proton (Ref. 21). The large low-mass black dot in the SMBH (super
massive black hole) range is the 4 /C2106solar mass black hole at the center of our galaxy (Ref. 22), while the more massive large black dot is Ton 618. The
dashed horizontal line at m¼mpemphasizes the orthogonal symmetry of black holes ( m/r) and particles ( m/r/C01). Our Universe is represented by the
“Hubble radius” and has a mass and size that places it on the black hole line, seemingly suggesting that our Universe is a massive, low-density black hol e( S e c .

mass instantons to the super-massive black holes (SMBH) at
the centers of the largest galaxies, lie on the diagonal m/r
line labelled “black holes.” Black holes lie on this linebecause the radius and mass of a Schwarzschild black holeare linearly proportional,
29

c2m: (6)
Interestingly, the “Hubble radius” (representing the
Universe) also lies on this black hole line (Sec. III A ). The
“forbidden by gravity” region illustrates that all objects of a
given mass are larger than a black hole of that mass, and allobjects of a given radius are less massive than a black hole
of that radius.
C. Compton wavelengths and the zone forbidden
by quantum uncertainty
The effective sizes of small massive particles can be repre-
sented by their deBroglie wavelengths: k
deB¼/C22h=mv, where
mis the mass of the particle. The higher the velocity vof a
particle, the smaller its deBroglie wavelength. In the relativ-
istic limit when v!c, the deBroglie wavelength asymptotes
to the smaller Compton wavelength kc,
kdeB¼/C22h
mv!v!c/C22h
mc¼kc: (7)
The Compton wavelength marks the boundary where relativ-
istic quantum effects become signiﬁcant. On scales smaller
than kc, the concept of a single quantum mechanical particle
(“object”) breaks down and we must switch to a ﬁeld
description in which particle creation and annihilation occur,
preventing further spatial localization. In other words, locali-zation of a wave packet to constrain a particle to a size less
than its Compton wavelength is prevented by pair-
production. Since the Compton wavelength is the lower limitbeyond which object size and position are conﬂated by quan-
tum uncertainty, we take the Compton wavelength as the
effective minimum radius of a particle. This produces them/r
/C01line [Eq. (7)] delimiting the triangular “quantum
uncertainty” region in Fig. 2.
In addition to composite particles, we also plot fundamen-
tal structureless particles, e.g., quarks and leptons. As exam-ples, we plot the top quark, electron, and neutrinos. These all
lie along the Compton wavelength boundary. For complete-
ness, we would also like to plot massless photons. However,since the Compton wavelength of a massless particle (pho-
tons, gluons, and gravitons) is inﬁnity, we plot photons at
ðm
eff;sizeÞ¼ð E=c2;kcÞwhere their angular wavelengths
kc¼/C22hc=E. Thus, photons of the entire electromagnetic spec-
trum can be plotted. They fall along the Compton limit line
since meff/C24k/C01
c. The narrow rainbow at E/C2410/C09GeV is
the entire visible spectrum, while the entire electromagnetic
spectrum extends from the shortest wavelength gamma ray
kc¼lpto the longest radio waves extending off the plot
beyond the size of the observable Universe.
D. Stellar mass black holes and degeneracy pressure
Figure 3illustrates some important features of stellar evo-
lution. When a main sequence star (right side of Fig. 3)r u n s
out of fuel, it can no longer maintain the thermal radiation
pressure Prad, to counteract gravitational pressure Pg:
ðPrad!0<PgÞ. It collapses and becomes a white dwarf
held up mostly by electron degeneracy pressure ( Pe/C24Pg).
Counter-intuitively, more massive white dwarfs are smaller
than less massive ones because as gravity compresses mas-sive particles, temperatures increase, velocities increase, and
the deBroglie wavelengths k
deBof the electrons decrease and
at relativistic energies asymptote to their smaller Comptonwavelengths [Eq. (7)]. Gravity cannot compress the sizes of
the electrons to be less than their Compton wavelengths.
This size limit is the source of the electron degeneracy pres-sure that holds up white dwarfs. However, if a white dwarf
can accrete more mass than the Chandrasekhar limit
/C241:4M
/C12,30gravitational pressure at the center is enough to
overcome electron degeneracy pressure ( Pg>Pe). Electrons
are pushed into protons producing neutrons, and thus, white
dwarfs collapse into neutron stars held up by neutron degen-
eracy pressure.31If a neutron star can accrete more mass
than the Volkoff–Oppenheimer–Tolman limit of /C243M/C12,31Fig. 3. (Color online) A zoomed-in version of the small rectangle in Fig. 2containing neutron stars (“NS”), white dwarfs (“WD”), main sequence stars, brown
dwarfs (“BD”), and the heaviest mass planet ( /C2413 Jupiter masses). This plot illustrates the role of degeneracy pressure in the gravitational collapse of stars.
Brown dwarfs cannot collapse further due to electron degeneracy pressure, preventing fusion ignition in their cores. They will not become main seque nce stars.
When main sequence stars (right) run out of fuel they collapse into white dwarfs held up by electron degeneracy pressure. White dwarfs follow the radiu s-
mass relation r/m/C01=3(blue dashed line) (Ref. 32). When a white dwarf accretes material and its mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit /C241:4M/C12(Ref.
30), it becomes a neutron star “NS” which, with further mass accretion, becomes a black hole “BH,” see Sec. II D.
822 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 10, October 2023 C. H. Lineweaver and V. M. Patel 822 04 October 2023 22:58:11
the star will continue to collapse, overcoming neutron degen-
eracy pressure and collapsing into a black hole.
III. SOME FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
A. Is the Universe a black hole?
In our expanding Universe, Hubble’s law relates the reces-
sion velocities to the distance: vrec¼Hr. At a speciﬁc dis-
tance rHcalled the Hubble radius, the recession velocity is
equal to the speed of light,
rH¼c
H: (8)
The Hubble volume is a sphere of radius rHcentered on us
and is often taken as the size of the Universe. At present,r
H/C2514 Gly.33In Fig. 2, the most massive point on the black
hole line is labeled “Hubble radius” at the point ðmU;rHÞ
where the mass of the Universe is the critical density times
its volume: mU¼qcð4=3Þpr3
H.
Using Eq. (6), we can write the density of a black hole as
qBH¼m
V¼m

3pr3
s¼m
4
3pc2
2Gm/C18/C193
(9)
¼3c6
32pG3m/C02: (10)
Thus, qBH/m/C02and the more massive the black hole, the
lower its density. This can also be seen in Fig. 2, where the
most massive black holes are on the lowest density isoden-sity lines. In particular, when the size of a black hole is thesize of the Universe ( r
s¼rH), we can use Eqs. (6)and(8)in
Eq.(10) to obtain
qBH¼3H2
8pG¼qc; (11)
where qcis the critical density. Thus, a Schwarzschild black
hole the same size as our Universe has the same mass anddensity as our Universe. This seems to suggest that the entireUniverse is a black hole. Although this idea has beenexplored in Refs. 34–37 ,F i g . 4illustrates why this is not the
case.
B. Where exactly do the black hole and Compton
boundaries cross?
In Fig. 2, the black hole diagonal line has a slope of þ1
since log ðmÞ/ logðrÞ[Eq. (6)]. The diagonal line of the
Compton wavelengths has a slope of –1 since log ðmÞ/
/C0logðrÞ[Eq. (7)]. Thus, these two lines are orthogonal and
should cross at the instanton which is “a black hole whose
Compton wavelength is equal to its Schwarzschild radius.”
28
We want to verify that this instanton crossing point happens
atðlp;mpÞ. The Compton wavelength [Eq. (7)] of a Planck-
mass particle is
kcðmpÞ¼/C22h
mpc¼/C22h
cG
/C22hc/C18/C191=2
¼/C22hG
c3/C18/C191=2
¼lp; (12)where lpis the Planck length and the Planck mass
mp¼ð/C22hc=GÞ1=2. Thus, the Compton wavelength of a
Planck-mass particle equals the Planck length: kcðmpÞ¼lp.
However, what about the black hole diagonal line? Is theSchwarzschild radius of a Planck-mass black hole equal tothe Planck length?
r

c2/C22hc
G/C18/C191=2
¼2/C22hG
c3/C18/C191=2
¼2lp:
(13)
There is an unexpected extra factor of 2. Thus, the two diag-
onal lines do not cross at exactly ðlp;mpÞ. Instead we have
the radius of a Planck-mass black hole equal to twice theCompton wavelength of a Planck-mass particle (see p. 225of Ref. 38).
Insight into this factor of 2 may be found by considering
not the simpliﬁed case of a non-rotating Schwarzschild blackhole but the more general case of a rotating Kerr black hole.For convenience, we ﬁrst deﬁne a length proportional to theangular momentum Lper unit mass r
L¼ðL=mÞc[Ref. 16,p
60, Eq. (2.100)]. Then, in the equatorial plane of the rotatingblack hole, we have singularity solutions

L"#1=2
; (14)
where the 6indicates there are two solutions and the angular
momentum parameter rLcan take on values in the range
rL2½0;rs=2/C138. These two solutions are called the inner
(Cauchy) horizon and the outer horizon. For rL¼0
(non-rotating), we recover the Schwarzschild solution rþ
¼rsas the outer horizon. However, we also have a solution
for the inner (Cauchy) horizon r/C0¼0 that is often ignored.
Importantly, rþ<rsfor all non-zero values of rL. For all val-
ues of rL, the average of the two solutions equals rs=2. For a
Fig. 4. We can imagine our Universe being surrounded by two different
background densities: (1) zero density (dashed grey lines) or (2) a critical
density with the same density as our Universe (horizontal black line). If our
critical density Universe with “us” in the middle is surrounded by a zero
density ﬂat Minkowski spacetime then we can use the Schwarzschild metricto conclude that we are living in a black hole and headed for a big crunch.
However, if the Universe outside the Hubble radius “ r
H” has the same criti-
cal density as the inside, then the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric tells
us we are living in a ﬂat universe and we cannot use the Schwarzschild met-
ric (Ref. 29) to describe our situation because the Schwarzschild radius of a
black hole has been calculated under the assumption that the black hole is
surrounded by empty q¼0 ﬂat Minkowski spacetime.

maximally rotating black hole, the two horizons merge,
r6¼rs=2. The inner (Cauchy) and outer horizons for a max-
imally rotating Planck-mass black hole are both equal to thePlanck length: r
6¼lp¼kcðmpÞ.
The Reissner–N €ordstrom metric for a charged (non-rotat-
ing) black hole leads to analogous solutions: maximallycharged Planck-mass black holes have r
6ðmpÞ¼rs=2
¼lp.39,40Thus, the most fundamental length in both the Kerr
and Reissner-N €ordstrom metrics for a Planck-mass black
hole is the Planck length lp¼rs=2. In Fig. 2, if we had repre-
sented the radius of a black hole by the average of the outerhorizon and the inner (Cauchy) horizon: r
BH¼ðrþþr/C0Þ=2,
the black hole line and the Compton wavelength line wouldcross exactly at the instanton point ðl
p;mpÞ.
IV. DISCUSSION
The Planck-mass instanton is the smallest mass a black
hole can have without entering the region of quantum uncer-tainty. Instantons seem to be the smallest objects in theUniverse (white dot in Fig. 2).
20On the upper left side of
Fig. 1, we have assumed the initial condition that the
Universe started out at the Planck time with the Planck den-sity and Planck temperature. In Fig. 2, the intersection point
of the vertical white line at the Planck length and the diago-nal dashed white line at the Planck density is an instanton.The Hawking temperature of an instanton is the Planck tem-perature.
16Thus, we have assumed that the initial conditions
of the Universe are that of an instanton. Instantons seem to
be an essential ingredient for quantum cosmology, and their
study is an active ﬁeld of research that is beyond the scopeof this paper.
20,26,27,41–47
It is possible that some kind of quantum degeneracy pres-
sure holds up the core of a black hole and prevents it frombecoming a Schwarzschild singularity.
48,49If so, the cores of
black holes could be Planck-density objects located in the“forbidden by gravity” region along the Planck isodensityline. Or the cores could have sizes corresponding to the innerCauchy horizons [ r
/C0in Eq. (14)], also located in the
“forbidden by gravity” region.
How can we interpret the doubly forbidden black triangu-
lar region labeled “QG” (quantum gravity) on the left side ofFig. 2? What does it mean to be doubly forbidden? In this
region, the size rof an object violates both general relativity:
r<r
s¼2Gm=c2and quantum uncertainty: r<kc¼/C22h=mc.
In terms of mass m, gravity and quantum uncertainty prevent
the mass of an object from satisfying

The Compton limit involves only the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. However, as we approach the instanton, a term rel-evant to gravitational effects also contributes to the uncer-tainty. Including this gravitational term extends theHeisenberg uncertainty principle into what is known as thegeneralized uncertainty principle.

Carr and collaborators have raised some fundamental
issues about the orthogonal symmetry of the black hole line
(m/r) and Compton line ( m/r/C01) around the horizontal
dashed line in Fig. 2. They refer to this symmetry as the
“Compton–Schwarzschild correspondence,” which plays afundamental role in quantum gravity.
20,27,51,52The history of objects in the Universe can be seen as a his-
tory of condensations of composite objects from an undiffer-entiated background. Although composite objects condensed
when the binding energy of the object exceeded the back-
ground energy, notice in Fig. 2that no known objects con-
dense before the electroweak (EW) energy scale at 10
/C010s,
because the binding energies of all known composite objectsare less than the background energy at these early times.Perhaps there are composite objects embedded in the quark-
gluon plasma (QGP) held together by the uniﬁed strong,
weak and electromagnetic forces. Two important open ques-tions are: What were the ﬁrst composite objects? and If weconsider virtual particles to be objects, where do they belongin the diagram?
V. CONCLUSIONS
There is a long inspiring pedagogical tradition in physics
of putting everything into one log-log plot. This traditionincludes a logarithmic overview of all space (powers often
53), a logarithmic overview of all time (time in powers of
ten54), and “the complete history of the Universe” (Fig. 3.7
of Ref. 1). Okun’s “the physical theories cube” (Fig. 2 of
Ref. 55) is a powerful pedagogical tool that enables us to
imagine the variation of three fundamental constants 1 =c,G,
and/C22h. Each of the eight vertices of his cube corresponds to
different physical theories.
Here, we provide an overview of the history of the
Universe and the sequence of composite objects (e.g., pro-tons, planets, galaxies) that condensed out of the backgroundas the Universe expanded and cooled. We describe the roleof the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom
(g
/C3) needed to understand the thermal history of the
Universe during the ﬁrst few minutes after the big bang. Wecompute and plot the background density and temperature ofthe Universe (Fig. 1). To extrapolate into the ﬁrst billionth of
a second, we make some common, explicit, but speculativeassumptions.
We then make the most comprehensive pedagogical plot
of the masses and sizes of all the objects in the Universe
(Fig. 2). This plot draws attention to the unphysical regions
forbidden by general relativity and quantum uncertainty—regions bounded by black holes and the Compton limit. TheCompton limit creates an ambiguous region beyond which
object size and position are conﬂated by quantum uncer-
tainty, thus undermining the classical notion that the size ofan object can be arbitrary small. Figure 2also helps navigate
the relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics andhelps formulate some fundamental questions about the limits
of physics: How can we interpret the regions forbidden by
general relativity and quantum uncertainty? How should weinterpret the fact that the two boundaries of the forbiddenregions intersect at the instanton (Planck-mass black holes)?Are instantons the smallest possible objects? Do their size,density and temperature make them the best candidates for
the initial conditions of the Universe (Fig. 1)? Is the
Schwarzschild radius the minimum size for an object of agiven mass? Or might the non-singular cores of black holesbe objects with the Planck density?
