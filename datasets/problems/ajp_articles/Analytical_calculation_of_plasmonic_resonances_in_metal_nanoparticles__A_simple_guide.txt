Localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in metal particles are used in medical, chemical, physical, and
biological sensing applications. In this paper, we revisit the classical description of LSPs. We use the
Drude model and the Quasi-Static approximation to describe the plasmon resonances in terms ofthe material and the size of the particles embedded in a dielectric host. We then incorporate the
Clausius–Mossotti relation to include shape effects in the classical description. Finally, we incorporate
surface damping and retardation effects to arrive at a uniﬁed, classical description providing anintuitive and realistic model of plasmonic resonances in metal particles.

I. INTRODUCTION
Advances in nanotechnology and photonics go hand in
hand, from super-resolution microscopy helping us visualizelife at the nanoscale,1to extreme-UV lithography enabling
the creation of nanoscale chips needed to analyze it.2At the
intersection of photonics and nanotechnology lies the topic
of plasmonics.3Plasmonics involves the creation, study, and
manipulation of signals embedded in optical-frequencyoscillations of surface electrons along metal-dielectric inter-faces. Plasmonics conﬁnes optical-frequency signals tosubwavelength-size volumes, thereby providing the interfacebetween optical electromagnetic ﬁelds and nanoscopic devi-ces and circuitry.
When an electromagnetic ﬁeld interacts with a metal
nanoparticle, it will lead to charge oscillations in the metal.These collective oscillations, known as plasmons, are excitedwhen the frequency of the electromagnetic ﬁeld matches the
resonant frequency of the metal nanoparticle. The electrons
are free to move within the boundaries of the particle but areultimately conﬁned to its surface. For these reasons, theeffect is called a localized surface plasmon (LSP). Giventhat the oscillation is at the same frequency as the incomingﬁeld, the effect is interchangeably called plasmonicresonance.
Designing metal nanoparticles to answer questions in
nanophysics, nanochemistry, and nanobiology requiresunderstanding the plasmonic resonance. Due to quantummechanical effects, the properties of nanoscale objects often
cannot be explained intuitively. Fortunately, the most promi-
nent plasmonic effects can be explained within a classicalframework. We will begin with a historical perspective.Then, to model the plasmonic resonance in metal nanopar-ticles, we will need a framework to describe three distinctfeatures: the metallic characteristic, the size (the “nano”),and the shape of the particle. We will introduce the Drudemodel, a reasonable description of electrons in metals. Thequasi-static approximation will then let us take into account
the nanoscale size of the particles. Additionally, the generali-
zation of the Clausius–Mossotti relation will let us considera particle embedded in a dielectric medium and the effect ofits shape. By combining these aspects, we are able to build aclassical model for the plasmonic resonance in metal nano-particles. We will then deal with some of the limitations ofthe quasi-static approximation by introducing ﬁnal correc-
tions to the model, to extend its validity as far as possible.As our assumptions are all based on classical electromagne-tism, the ﬁnal model will be classical too.
II. BRIEF HISTORY OF PLASMONICS
While nanotechnology emerged as a ﬁeld only a few deca-
des ago, peculiar optical phenomena due to nanoparticleshave intrigued humankind since ancient times. Witnessingand harnessing such “technologies” far preceded any possi-ble scientiﬁc explanation: photonic crystals shape light, thuscreating spectacular iridescent colors in butterﬂies,
4lead-
based quantum dots have been involved in black hair dyesmanufactured by ancient Greeks and Romans,5and copper
nanoparticles were employed in red opaque glass productionin Egypt and Mesopotamia.6
One of the most impressive pieces of glasswork incorpo-
rating metal nanoparticles is the Lycurgus cup (Figs. 1(a)
and1(b)). Dated around the 4th century, this Roman cage
cup is made up of dichroic glass, so that an observer sees itred if light passes through it, but green if light is reﬂected tothem. Recent analysis showed that the dichroism is due tothe presence of colloidal gold and silver nanoparticles dis-persed throughout the glass. The embedded particles havediameters around 70 nm, meaning that they are invisible tooptical microscopy and require transmission electron micros-copy (TEM) to be seen.

Michael Faraday is credited with performing the ﬁrst sci-
entiﬁc experiments on the optical properties of nanoparticles,focusing on gold colloids in the 1850s. He was puzzled bythe ruby red color of the solutions he synthesized (Fig. 1(c)),
far removed from the aureate color of bulk gold. A satisfyingclassical explanation of this phenomenon came only in 1904,when Maxwell Garnett combined the new Drude theory ofmetals with Lord Rayleigh’s description of electromagneticproperties of small spheres.
8Shortly after, in 1912, Richard
Gans successfully extended the description of optical phe-nomena to oblate and prolate spheroids.9However, these the-
ories were all purely based on the optical properties of bulkmetals, and it was not until 1970 that they were modiﬁed byUwe Kreibig and Peter Zacharias to take their nanoscale sizeinto account.
10For the ﬁrst time, they explained the elec-
tronic and optical response of silver and gold nanoparticles

in terms of localized surface plasmon excitations. It became
clear then that size, shape, arrangement, medium, and tem-perature all have a crucial role in controlling the intensityand frequency of plasmonic resonances.
From the early 2000s on, the interest in plasmonics
boomed, thanks to novel nanofabrication techniques, com-
mercialization of simulation software and the plethora ofbiological and biomedical applications.
11,12To summarize
50 years of research and more than a century of theoretical
modeling, we start by examining the object under study, themetal nanoparticle, and its deﬁning features.
III. CLASSICAL DERIVATION OF PLASMONIC
RESONANCE
A. Drude model for metals
The electric properties of materials are characterized by
the dielectric constant /C15, which relates the electric displace-
ment ~Dto the electric ﬁeld ~Ethrough the equation ~D¼/C15
0~E
þ~P¼/C150/C15~E. When the applied ﬁeld is sinusoidal, the dielec-
tric constant is a complex number; the imaginary part repre-
sents the out-of-phase response of the material. Within the
Drude model, the complex dielectric function of a metal isgiven by

Two derivations of this well-known formula can be found in
the supplementary material.43Here, xP¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

is the
plasma frequency and cis the damping frequency, both
dependent on the metal considered. The plasma frequencydepends on the carrier density, N, the electron charge, e, and
the effective mass of the electron, m. The damping frequencycis given by Matthiessen’s rule for different independent
collision events, each possessing a time constant s

This equation provides the statistical rate at which the elec-
tron motion in the bulk material is disrupted due to collisionsbetween electrons and nuclei, defects, impurities, or otherelectrons. Furthermore, an extension to the Drude model hasbeen formulated to account for the positive background ofions in the constant term /C15

In Table I, we report the Drude parameters for common
plasmonic metals, ﬁtted from experimental data in Ref. 14.
Note that the experimental and ﬁtted data do not matchcompletely, as the Drude model is an approximation of theactual complex dielectric function, which can include inter-band and intraband transitions. Throughout the paper, we
will take gold as a typical metal for plasmonics.
With these concepts in hand, we can provide a simple yet
rigorous derivation of plasmonic resonance in metalnanoparticles.
B. Quasi-static approximation
If a nanoparticle is much smaller than the wavelength
(Fig. 2), then all the electrons inside the nanoparticle feel the
same electric ﬁeld and oscillate in phase. This approach is

called the quasi-static approximation (QSA). Let dbe the
size of the nanoparticle, kthe wavelength, ~kthe wave vector,
xthe angular frequency of the incoming ﬁeld ~E0;~rthe rela-
tive position of an arbitrary point with respect to the center
of the nanoparticle, and tthe time. If d/C28k, then ~k/C1~r/C250
and mathematically we obtain
~E0ð~r;tÞ¼~E0eiðxt/C0~k/C1~rÞ/C25~E0eixt: (4)
Because of this, the polarization is uniform, and the effect of
the quasi-static approximation on the total dipole moment ofthe nanoparticle ~p
npis very conveniently translated to
~pnp¼V~P; (5)
where Vis the volume of the nanoparticle and ~Pis the polari-
zation density. The quasi-static approximation lets us dropthe dependence on the position ~r.
The careful reader might point out that the wavelength
inside the nanoparticle may not be the same as the one in thedielectric medium. The concept of wavelength itself mayeven be ill-deﬁned if the ﬁeld decays exponentially insidethe metal. A relevant comparison would then be between thesize of the nanoparticle and the skin depth dof the metal.
For common metals like gold, silver, copper, and aluminum,the skin depth at optical frequencies is on the order of a few
tens of nanometers. If d/H11351d, then the ﬁeld can penetrate the
nanoparticle completely and the uniformity of the polariza-tion can still be assumed. Refer to the supplementary mate-rial
43for more details regarding skin depth.
It is important to note that particles larger than the wave-
length may produce a plethora of effects that cannot beexplained as the simple radiation of a dipole, due to theoccurrence of multipolar effects. Eventually, extremely largeparticles will exhibit the optical properties of bulk metal.
C. Generalization of the Clausius–Mossotti relation
for ellipsoids
Let us now consider an isolated ellipsoid having a com-
plex dielectric function /C15
mand semiaxes, respectively, ax,ay,
andaz, immersed in a dielectric material (from this point on
referred to as the “host”) having a real and positive dielectricconstant /C15
h(Fig. 3(a)).
The nanoparticle’s dipole moment ~pnpis a function of its
polarizability tensor a$as well as of the local electric ﬁeld
~Eloc. The latter is different from the applied ﬁeld ~E0because
of the polarization of the host, but if the dielectric medium islinear, homogeneous and isotropic, then the local ﬁeld will
be proportional to the applied ﬁeld ( ~Eloc¼/C15h~E0), and so
~pnp¼/C150a$~Eloc¼/C150/C15ha$~E0: (6)
To calculate the polarizability, we, therefore, need to ﬁnd the
relation between the dipole moment and the electric ﬁeld.
First, we notice that the local electric ﬁeld is the superpo-
sition of the applied ﬁeld and the opposing ﬁeld produced bythe displacement of charges. Although it is a well-knownfact that, in the static limit, the electric ﬁeld in a conductor iszero, we have to consider that under the QSA the order of
magnitude of the skin depth is comparable with the size of
the nanoparticle. In this case, the local electric ﬁeld ~E
loc,
deﬁned at the boundary of the nanoparticle, creates a polari-zation in the metal ~P
m; hence electric charges appear at its
surface (Fig. 3(b)). As a consequence, the host dielectric also
polarizes near the surface ( ~Ph). We can treat the boundary as
an effective medium, encompassing both the charges in the
metal and in the host. The effective polarization ~Pcan be
deduced from the difference between the two opposingpolarizations. ~Pis in the opposite direction from that of the
applied ﬁeld, thus generating a restoring force. The localelectric ﬁeld, for every j-th axis ( j¼x,y,z), is then

obtain the polarizability

It is important to note that a$is a diagonal matrix. In other
words, if the incoming ﬁeld is aligned with one of the axesof the ellipsoid, the polarization will be parallel to it. This
considerably simpliﬁes the calculations.
Normally, we would have to calculate the integral in Eq.
(8), given an arbitrary set of semiaxes lengths. Such calcula-
tion is not trivial. Fortunately, an important property of the
depolarization factors can drastically simplify the results for
simple geometries. The sum of the three depolarization fac-tors is
X
j¼x;y;zLj¼1: (14)
A simple, novel proof of this property can be found in the
supplementary material.43
Thanks to this normalization property, some easy geome-
tries (see Table II) can be treated without calculating the
integrals explicitly. Anisotropy is then reﬂected by the
matrix nature of a$, eventually leading ~pnpto not be parallel
to~E0.
The Clausius–Mossotti relation, used to describe the
polarizability of spherical particles in a vacuum
aj¼3v/C15m/C01
/C15mþ2;j¼x;y;z; (15)
in which vis the volume of the spherical particle, coincides
with Eq. (13) forax¼ay¼az, and /C15h¼1. For this reason,
Eq. (13) is the generalization of the Clausius–Mossotti
relation.
D. Plasmonic resonance
We now have all the tools to calculate the plasmonic reso-
nance. However, what does it mean for a nanoparticle tohave a plasmonic resonance? Why do we talk about a plas-
monic peak? The simplest way to picture such an effect is bydirectly plugging the result of the Drude model (Eq. (3))i n
the calculation of the polarizability (Eq. (13)). For a sphere
with gold-like Drude parameters, put either in vacuum orwater, we get the typical wavelength dependence of thepolarizability shown in Fig. 4.
The functional form for jajis a sharp peak. At the angular
frequency where the polarizability is maximal, the electronsoscillate with a higher amplitude. Given such a sharp featurein the frequency, we refer to the peak position as the reso-nance frequency.
To calculate the plasmonic resonance frequency, one can
maximize jaj. From Eq. (13), it is easy to see that if the
denominator approaches zero, the polarizability intensitydrastically increases, leading to a strong dipole moment at
frequency x
res. This resonance condition translates to the
requirement that, in a given direction
Re/C15mðxresÞ ½/C138 ¼ /C01/C0Lj
Lj/C15h;Im/C15mðxresÞ ½/C138 /C25 0: (16)
We see that the resonance frequency depends on the geomet-
rical features of the nanoparticle and on the dielectricmedium in which it is immersed. The generalized formulafor the resonance frequency x
resfor an arbitrary metal nano-
particle can be obtained by combining Eq. (16) with the
result of the Drude model (Eq. (3))

where the reasonable assumption of xP/C29chas been intro-

The shift due to changes in /C15henables a multitude of sensing
applications. In the host dielectric environment, variationsdue to chemical, physical or biological activity result in factin shifts in plasmonic peaks.

posed by Okabe and Ito and made popular by Wong (Ref. 41).)

As expected, Eq. (18) predicts the correct positions20for the
resonance peak for a nanosphere with gold-like Drude parame-ters: when in vacuum x

w h i l ew h e ni nw a t e r xres/C253:6/C21015rad/s ( kres/C25520 nm).
This surprisingly simple result is already sufﬁcient to explain
the color of Faraday’s colloidal gold (Fig. 1(c)). As the solution
contains gold nanospheres, the resonance frequency xreswill
be in the cyan-green part of the spectrum, so it appears ruby red
when illuminated by white light.
Unfortunately, only a few materials satisfy Eq. (18) in
the optical range. For the resonance to exist, the imaginary
part of the dielectric function must be sufﬁciently low. Forthis reason, the most signiﬁcant plasmonic materials are
also the most conductive: silver, gold, copper, and alumi-
num. Other less commonly used metals are palladium, plat-
inum and nickel.21An invaluable contribution to the
investigation of plasmonic candidates was given by Eadon
and Creighton, in their review of the ultraviolet/visible
spectrum of 52 different metal nanospheres, in vacuum andin water.22Nowadays, the search for novel plasmonic can-
didates focuses on metallic alloys, (doped) semiconductors,
and metamaterials.23
Measurable effects due to the plasmonic resonance
include absorption and scattering, which are quantiﬁable by
their cross sections. In the dipolar regime ( d/C28k), the
Rayleigh formula for cross sections can be applied15
rabs¼/C0kIma½/C138;rsca¼k4
6pjaj2; (19)
where kis the wave number. It is important to note the cross
sections’ dependence on aand, as a consequence, on the vol-
ume: since the absorption cross section rabsscales linearly
with Vwhile the scattering one rscascales quadratically with
it, it is reasonable to assume that smaller particles mainlyabsorb light while larger particles mainly scatter it.
However, the most prominent effect of plasmonic reso-
nances is that of ﬁeld enhancement. Outside the particle, the
total ﬁeld is a superposition of the incoming ﬁeld ~E0and of
the dipolar ﬁeld generated by the particle itself. For a contin-
uous wave, the local ﬁeld outside the nanoparticle takes the
shape of a classical dipole ﬁeld24~Eð~rÞ¼~E0þ1
4p/C150/C15h3ð~r/C1~pnpÞ~r/C0r2~pnp
r5; (20)
where ris the distance from the center of the particle. As
can be intuited, resonances in awill reﬂect on ~pnpand subse-
quently on ~Eð~rÞ. Field enhancement is typically quantiﬁed
byjEj2=jE0j2(as in Fig. 5). This factor can make the local
electric ﬁeld tens or hundreds of times higher than the
incoming ﬁeld. The shape of the particle can be engineered
to create radiation enhancements that are wavelength-, polar-ization-, and direction-dependent, just like in classical
antennas.25,26
One interesting effect can be noted in Fig. 5: along the
direction orthogonal to the oscillation, the radiated ﬁeldcauses destructive interference with the incoming ﬁeld, lead-
ing to areas where the ﬁeld is quenched ( jEj2=jE0j2<1)
instead of enhanced. This is possible because, in Eq. (20),
for some ~rand at a certain frequency, ~r/C1~pnp¼0 and
j1/C0ða=4pr3Þj2<1.
The ﬁnite-difference time-domain simulations in Fig. 5
solve Maxwell’s equations in discretized space and time,
characterizing each portion of space with the complexdielectric function /C15and complex magnetic permeability l.
These simulations introduce minimal approximations and
accurately compute the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, present-ing a case very close to reality. Using this simulation, the
plasmonic resonance occurs at 540 nm, instead of 520 nm, as
shown previously in Fig. 4. This shift is mainly explained as
an effect of radiation damping,
27which shows that the quasi-
static approximation does not always provide accurate
answers. This is why we need to look beyond it.
IV. BEYOND THE QUASI-STATIC
APPROXIMATION
The quasi-static approximation describes nanoscale pro-
cesses fairly well, such as the absorption of certain colors or
the local ﬁeld enhancement in the proximity of metal nano-
particles. However, it fails to predict other effects related toparticle size: in the quasi-static approximation, particle size
is irrelevant, as long as it is smaller than the incoming wave-
length. Can we extend this theory to include the particle’ssize and shape?
The ﬁrst correction we will introduce takes into account
the collisions of the electrons with the nanoparticle bound-
aries, which have implicitly been neglected until now. Then,

Brinkslab/LSP ). The results were plotted in Spyder, using the color-vision deﬁciency friendly and perceptually uniform color map “batlow” (Ref. 42.)

the second correction will take us closer to the multipolar
regime by involving retardation effects. Considering the
classical nature of this extended model, it is impressive how
well it ﬁts experiments for such nanoscopic objects, as wewill see.
A. Surface damping
Up to now, we have implicitly considered the damping
frequency cto be dominated by the collisions of electrons
with other electrons, lattice nuclei or phonons. At a verysmall scale, however, electrons will also impact the particleboundary. This is notably the case when the dimensions of
the particle are smaller than the mean free path, that is, the
average distance traveled by the electron between two con-secutive collisions. In other words, if the particle is smallenough, the electrons will impact the boundary much more
often than they collide with other objects.
15The empirical
model developed hereafter aims at taking this effect intoaccount, and well matches experimental data. In the end, it is
very similar to the exact one obtained via semiclassical
calculations.28,29
As the free electrons move at the Fermi velocity vF, the
characteristic time between two consecutive collisions withthe boundary will be
s

vF; (21)
where kboundary is the characteristic length of the process. By
applying Matthiessen’s rule (Eq. (2)), the damping frequency
will become

where cbulkis the bulk metal damping frequency and kMFPis

For a sphere of radius r, Kreibig10used the linear relation

used by other authors.30–34A simple and intuitive motivation
for a coefﬁcient of4
3is provided hereafter, based solely on
geometrical considerations.
Consider a spherical nanoparticle of radius rinside which
electrons can travel only in straight trajectories. LetOðx;y;zÞbe the initial point on the surface where an electron
has just collided with the boundary, and let O

Since the scattering is assumed to be isotropic inside the
sphere, all the points O0belonging to the surface have the
same probability of being hit.

Now let us examine the consequences of surface damping.
Around the plasma frequency, it is almost always true that

nance peak in a. A calculated example for a nanoparticle
with gold-like parameters in water is provided in Fig. 6(a)
for various particle sizes.
B. Modified long-wavelength approximation
The dipolar approximation is valid as long as the dimen-
sions of the metal nanoparticle are such that d/C28k.
Otherwise, variations in the incoming ﬁeld will not be negli-
gible, and multipolar modes will eventually be excited.
Between this dipolar treatment and the brute-force computa-
tional solution of Maxwell’s equations lies the so-called
modiﬁed long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), a cor-
rection to the polarizability obtained in the quasi-static
approximation (QSA) that includes retardation effects.17
The MLWA treats each atom in the nanoparticle as a
dipole emitter and takes into account that its electric ﬁeld
propagates at the speed of light c(and not instantly), causing
a retarded dipolar ﬁeld. While in the QSA we imposed
~k/C1~r¼0 (Eq. (4)), in the following derivation of the MLWA
equations, the dipole radiation is expanded in a Taylor series
up to the third order ðkrÞ3. The inﬁnitesimal electric ﬁeld is
integrated over the volume of the particle, and ﬁnally a cor-
rected polarizability aMLWA is deﬁned.
Using the complex notation, an oscillating dipole moment
pcan be expressed as

(33)As an extension of the QSA, we can treat the nanoparticle as
a single emitter with a radiated ﬁeld EMLWA being the super-
position of all the dipole ﬁelds with respect to its center. A
convenient reference system takes ~r!/C0~r(r!r;h!/C0 h;
/!/), meaning that every vector starts from a point emit-
ter in the sphere and points to its center. This coordinate
change does not inﬂuence the signs in the equation because

For sufﬁciently small nanoparticles, we retrieve the QSA
(aMLWA ;j/C25aj), as expected. For relatively small yet ﬁnite
volumes, the imaginary term proportional to k3can be
neglected ( aMLWA ;j/C254paj=4p/C0ajk2=aj). For larger vol-
umes, the imaginary term dominates the denominator.
The term ajðk2=ajÞin Eq. (38)is called dynamic depolariza-
tion, because it is obtained in a dynamic calculation ( k>0), and
its coefﬁcient is real, corresponding to a change in the effective
particle depolarization factor. Let us recall that ajis proportional
to particle volume ( aj/axayaz). Asðaxayaz=ajk2Þincreases, a
more negative value of /C151is necessary to meet the resonance
condition. At small but ﬁnite particle volumes, this effect enhan-
ces the plasmonic resonance; at larger volumes, it is responsible
for the shift of the resonance peak.

The term /C0iaj2
3k3in Eq. (38) is called radiative damping,
because it arises from the spontaneous emission of radiationby the induced dipole. The term grows rapidly with particlevolume. Being imaginary, it contributes heavily to /C15
2and,
therefore, to the resonance damping. For relatively large par-ticle volumes, it accounts for the damping by radiative lossesand results in a broadening and a strong decrease in the plas-monic resonance (also counterbalancing the enhancementdue to dynamic depolarization just mentioned).
According to this approximation, an increase in particle
size ( a
j) will result in a red-shifted, broadened and less
intense plasmonic resonance. This is indeed what we noticein Fig. 6(b) in the calculated peaks for a nanoparticle with
gold-like parameters immersed in water. The MLWA usuallyworks well for nanoparticles of dimensions up to /C25200
nm,
36above which multipolar resonances cannot be
neglected, and computational methods are required.
The complete analytical model combines the corrected
Drude model, the generalized Clausius–Mossotti formula forpolarizability, the surface damping effect and the MLWA. In
Fig. 7, an example for a gold elongated ellipsoid having
a
x=ay¼ax=az¼2 is presented against a gold sphere of
r¼25 nm, of the same volume. The cross sections are calcu-
lated in the dipolar limit using Eq. (19). Agreement between
the ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and themodel is remarkable, both in the peak positions and the ratioof cross section components. Experimental evidence alsocorroborates this result.

V. FINAL REMARKS
Starting from a general model for metals and from the
polarization of a particle immersed in a dielectric host, we
explored the effects of several features on the ﬁnal resonance
peak induced by an external oscillating electric ﬁeld.
The analytical approach took us far into the understanding
of the plasmonic resonance. However, as already hinted atthe end of Sec. IV, the corrections to the quasi-static approxi-
mation have their own limitations. In fact, neglecting keyfeatures in the shape of the particle like spikes, neat edges,ﬂat sides, or amorphous protrusions will result in incorrectpredictions. Yet where the analytical approach fails, numeri-cal simulations can be used. The most common numericaltechniques include generalized Mie theory, ﬁnite-differencetime-domain (FDTD), discrete dipole approximation (DDA),ﬁnite-element method (FEM), and boundary element method(BEM).
38,39Each simulation technique has its own advan-
tages and drawbacks.
Should this material be used as didactic reference, the
authors strongly suggest the incorporation of at least someexamples of applications from state-of-the-art research.These examples should be tailored depending on the interestof the course and can be directed towards optics, biophysics,or condensed matter physics. To learn more about light-matter interaction or expand knowledge about state-of-the-art plasmonics and emerging applications, the authorsrecommend Fox’s
40and Maier’s3books, which provide
valuable insight into the ﬁeld and are very accessible forlecturers and students alike.
The properties of plasmonic resonances depend on mate-
rial shape and intrinsic properties. The analytical approachsupplied here is limited to ellipsoidal geometries but alreadytakes into account virtually all relevant material properties(in a classical approximation). However, while only simula-tions will provide reliable descriptions of the plasmoniceffects in realistic nanoparticles, the outlined fundamentalapproach, no matter its ﬂaws, provides an understanding ofwhy and how plasmonic resonances emerge in nanoparticles,and thus gives an intuitive basis and plausibility check fornumerical design.
