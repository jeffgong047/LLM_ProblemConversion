Gravitational orbits and the Lambert problem

(Received 23 June 2021; accepted 16 October 2021)
The Lambert problem is to determine the gravitational orbit between two points that has a speciﬁed
time of ﬂight, allowing the second point to be a moving target such as a satellite. After a review ofgravitational orbits, a solution of the Lambert problem is presented using the path equation
directly. However, because the time interval is speciﬁed, the solution requires a search procedure.
An example is given to illustrate the method.

INTRODUCTION
During the 18th century, Lambert introduced the problem
of ﬁnding an orbital trajectory that satisﬁed Newton’s law of
gravity and went from one point to another point in a speci-
ﬁed amount of time. A modern application could be a rocketcarrying supplies to a space station. The starting point occurswhen the rocket is above the atmosphere, and the rocketmotor has stopped. The end point is the rendezvous with thespace station, and, since the space station is in orbit, the timeof ﬂight of the rocket must be known in order for the rendez-
vous to occur. Another application could be ﬁxing the
splashdown point for a rocket test. The target point is onthe surface of the Earth (ocean), and this point moves due tothe rotation of the Earth. The determination of the orbit con-verts a boundary value problem into an initial value problem.In particular, the solution determines the initial velocity, a
signiﬁcant feature in these examples and other practical
applications.
One approach to this problem uses Lambert’s equation.

Several web pages discuss this in detail but require a com-prehensive understanding of conic sections. Another, in thetext by Bate et al. ,
2uses universal variables. The solution
method presented here uses the path equation and the rela-tion between time and orbit angle directly.
GRAVITATIONAL ORBITS
Gravitational orbits are determined by Newton’s law of
gravity. For a single centrally symmetric gravitationalsource, the equation of motion for an orbiting body is
~a¼/C0
GM~r
r3; (1)
where ~ais the acceleration of a body, Gis the gravitational
constant, Mis the source mass, and ~ris the position of the
orbiting body relative to the source center.
Equation (1)is an approximation. For a planet orbiting the
Sun, it ignores the masses of the other planets. For an Earthsatellite, it ignores the oblateness of the Earth. However, thesolution of Eq. (1)is a valuable starting point for a more
detailed analysis.
3We can also approximate that the gravita-
tional source center is an inertial reference frame if the orbit-
ing body mass is negligible.
The ﬁrst result from Eq. (1)is conservation of angular
momentum, implying that the orbit is in a ﬁxed plane, and atwo-dimensional analysis may be used.The second result from Eq. (1), using conservation of
energy or the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector,4is the path
equation

where ris the radial distance, his the orbit angle, and pande
are constants of integration. It is convenient, but not neces-
sary, to recognize Eq. (2)as that of a conic section and iden-
tifypas the perpendicular radius (semilatus rectum) and eas
the eccentricity. The point of minimum radius, periapsis, is
ath¼0.
The conservation of angular momentum and Eq. (2)lead
to the relation between orbit angle and time, t, from periapsis

LAMBERT PROBLEM
The solution of the Lambert problem in the orbit plane has
as speciﬁed quantities the initial and ﬁnal radii r
1andr2, the
angle cbetween ~r1and~r2, and the time-of-ﬂight tf. Figure 1
shows a possible elliptic orbit with a focus at the Earth centerand going through the two points. Also shown are the radii
for the two points, the bisector of the angle cand the major
axis of the to-be-determined ellipse. The angle between the

bisector and the major axis (toward apoapsis) is designated
g. Also let v¼p/C0c=2. Then the angle of ~r1from periapsis
isv/C0g, and the angle of ~r2back to periapsis is vþg.
Because the time-of-ﬂight is speciﬁed, the solution of the
Lambert problem involves a search on some parameter.Here, pis chosen as the search parameter. Applying Eq. (2)

with due regard to the signs of qandr. Now p,e,v, and g
are known so h1¼v/C0gandh2¼2p/C0ðvþgÞ. Hence, the
time t1from periapsis to ~r1and the time t2from periapsis to
r*

ﬂight between ~r1and r*
2is then t¼t2/C0t1. Finally, it is a
case of varying pto ﬁnd t¼tfby some suitable search pro-
cedure. The example below uses a simple method.

CONCLUSION
Gravitational orbits are determined by Newton’s law of
gravity. The equation of motion, Eq. (1), is all that is needed
to obtain Eqs. (2)–(5) .
Equations (6)–(11) provide the mathematical analysis to
solve the Lambert problem. Equations (8)–(11) may be
implemented in a computer program. Note that Eqs. (8)–(11)
and(4)and(5)are all single valued so the direct solution of
the Lambert problem is unique.
The values of pandegive the size and shape of the orbit
so that it may be visualized. In particular, the periapsis radiusisp/(1þe). As shown in the example, each step converts
ðp;r
1;r2;cÞtoðp;e;g;tÞ. Then the requirement that t¼tf
ﬁxes the values of p,e, and g. The choice of pas the search
parameter is appropriate because it is a familiar physicalquantity. A table of t,p, and eis valuable when selecting an
initial trial value for p.I fp,r
1, and r2are scaled by a factor
k, then eandgare unchanged and tis scaled by a factor k3/2,
extending the value of the table.
According to Eq. (9), the angle gbetween the bisector and
the direction opposite periapsis (to apoapsis if it exists) iszero when r
1¼r2and, with Eq. (8), is small in many cases
of interest. However, if a very short time-of-ﬂight is speci-ﬁed, the speed will exceed escape speed and the orbit will behyperbolic.
Any presentation of gravitational orbits becomes more
real with the addition of applications. One often used is theHohmann transfer. The direct solution of the Lambert prob-
lem serves the same purpose and adds meaning to the phrase
“launch window.”
