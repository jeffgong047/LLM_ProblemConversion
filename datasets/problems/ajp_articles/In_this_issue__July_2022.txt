Inharmonicity in plucked guitar strings
Chris J. Murray and Scott B. Whitﬁeld
90(7), p. 487
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064373It is a standard undergraduate problem to derive the funda-
mental frequency of a string, and that of all its harmonics,
from the classical wave equation. However, this is not at all
representative of what happens in a real-life instrument. Theauthors here take the physics analysis a step further and con-sider the rigidity of the string to calculate the characteristicfrequencies of plucked guitar strings. Resonance frequenciesare no longer proportional to the fundamental frequency,
thus reﬂecting the inherent inharmonicity of the instrument.
The model is then compared with experimental data takenfor nylon and steel strings of various sizes. This paper couldserve as the basis for an undergraduate mechanics or acous-tics laboratory.
Acoustic analog to multiple avoided-crossings in two
coupled acoustic cavities
Arjit Kant Gupta and Anjan K. Gupta
90(7), p. 494
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0067830Avoided-crossings occur when two quantum mechanical
systems having identical energy levels are made to interact.The energy levels then split, some moving to higher energy,the others to lower energy. This paper presents a classicalmechanical analog of such quantum systems: When twoacoustic cavities are coupled to one another, modes of identi-
cal frequency are split. This work shows how a relatively
simple acoustic system can help students understand quan-tum mechanical phenomena such as band formation. Thismaterial is appropriate for an undergraduate class on wavephysics, building a connection with condensed matterphysics.
Earthquake size: An example of a statistical distribution
that lacks a well-defined mean
Takuya Okabe and Jin Yoshimura
90(7), p. 501
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0010261Some physical systems, such as solar ﬂares, the number of
citations of scientiﬁc papers, random walks, the lifetime ofatoms in a given momentum state, or the allotting of income,follow a power law distribution. This means that the relevantquantity Xhas a probability distribution pXðÞ/X
/C0a, with
a>0. In that case, the mean value of Xdiverges, so that the
true mean value for Xcannot be deﬁned, and the calculated
mean depends strongly on the sample size. In this paper, thenot-so-intuitive properties of power law distributions are
illustrated using the distribution of earthquake energy as apractical example, which could be used in undergraduate
lectures in statistical physics or mathematical methods for
physics.
Oblique angle collisions of two pendulum balls
Rod Cross
90(7), p. 506
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0082240
In introductory mechanics courses, we frequently use col-
lisions between balls to illustrate concepts in energy and
momentum conservation. However, collisions between real
balls are more complicated, involving friction forces
between the balls that can create gripping or sliding interac-tions and result in spinning balls, and also involving the con-
version of mechanical energy into other forms of energy.
Through a clever experimental geometry that could easily bereplicated in the teaching laboratory, the author measures
oblique collisions between different types of balls and ana-
lyzes the resulting motion.
Motion of a charged particle in the static fields of an
infinite straight wire
Joel Franklin, David J. Grifﬁths, and Nelia Mann
90(7), p. 513
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0077042A long wire is a classic geometry for problems involving
both current and charge. Here, the two are combined, and the
resulting motion of a free particle in the combined ﬁelds isfound analytically, both in non-relativistic and relativistic
limits. The motion shows surprising periodicities along dif-
ferent coordinates, depending on the initial conditions. Thesesituations could make interesting additions to courses in
mechanics, electromagnetism, or computational physics.
A novel method of images for solving Laplace’s equation
and deriving demagnetization factors for spheroidal
bodies
Anupam Garg, J. B. Ketterson, and Jinho Lim
90(7), p. 520
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0071665I love teaching the method of images: the uniqueness theo-
rem provides an easy solution to problems that initially seemhopelessly complex. But the downside is that, after teaching
one geometry in lecture and assigning another for homework,
there’s nearly nothing else available for students to work out.This paper gives us another geometry: the prolate spheroid.
Then, as an added bonus, the authors show how the same
mathematics yields the demagnetization factor for a prolatespheroid, a result that is used widely in magnetization mea-
surements but is seldom derived because—until now—the
known mathematical approaches were extremely challenging.

advanced levels will surely enjoy this paper.
Resources-oriented instruction: What does it mean, and
what might it look like?
Amy D. Robertson, Lauren C. Bauman, Yohannes M.
Abraham, Brynna Hansen, Hung Tran, and Lisa M. Goodhew
90(7), p. 529
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009796Instructors may worry how their students will develop
physical understanding if, instead of telling them how todescribe physical interactions, we allow them to reason forthemselves, starting with their own ideas, explanations, and
observations. This paper analyzes one episode, showing how
students working in a small group, and with the encourage-ment and guidance of an experienced teaching assistant, areable to move signiﬁcantly closer to a standard physics expla-nation of the behavior of waves on a spring.
Is the equivalence principle useful for understanding
general relativity?
Peter C. Aichelburg
90(7), p. 538
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0010106This work examines Einstein’s equivalence principle
within a static spacetime metric framework. Familiarity withMinkowski geometry is assumed, but most of the insightsthat are offered do not require knowledge of the general the-ory. Readers can gain a deeper understanding of the alter-ation of time and frequency in the context of rigidacceleration, as well as an appreciation of the validity of the
resulting local light bending even in a spatially curved
geometry.

Observing hyperfine interactions of NV
2centers in
diamond in an advanced quantum teaching lab
Yang Yang, Hyma H. Vallabhapurapu, Vikas K. Sewani,
Maya Isarov, Hannes R. Firgau, Chris Adambukulam, Brett
C. Johnson, Jarryd J. Pla, and Arne Laucht
90(7), p. 550
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0075519Several new and more advanced experiments that probe
the nitrogen-vacancy (NV/C0) center in diamond are pre-
sented. With only small required improvements, these labo-
ratory exercises implement the low-cost, room-temperatureoptically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setupdescribed in a previous paper [(AJP 88, 1156 (2020)]. The
experiments are designed to highlight the interaction of the
NV
/C0centers with surrounding nuclear spins via the hyper-
ﬁne interactions and provide instructional lab students with
an in-depth understanding of physical concepts that are
important for various quantum technologies.
