(Received 2 December 2021; accepted 11 May 2022)
In 1977, Michel H /C19enon proved a remarkable theorem for planar N-body orbits in power-law
potentials that relates the rate of change of the perihelion angle (the precession rate), the rate of
change of the period evaluated at constant energy, the angular momentum of an orbit, and thepower law of the potential. We provide a simple proof of this theorem for two bodies in periodic
orbits that interact via a radial power-law force, which is, of course, equivalent to a one-body
problem with a power-law central potential. We discuss this theorem’s underlying assumptions andimplications, including its relation to Bertrand’s and Bohlin’s theorems, and we illustrate it with
several numerically calculated examples.

I. INTRODUCTION
The classical mechanics of two bodies interacting via a
radial force law has been studied in great detail over the past
300 years.1,2Bertrand’s theorem2states that central poten-
tials result in closed, elliptical orbits for all two-body bound
systems only for potentials proportional to 1 =r(Newtonian
gravity) or r2(harmonic oscillator). Therefore, for these two
potentials, precession of the perihelion occurs only whenthere is an external perturbation. A range of particular results
about the rate of change of this precession angle is known,
3
so much so that one might be forgiven for believing that
everything that can be known about orbits has been knownfor at least one century.
Yet, there is one comparatively recent (1977) non-trivial
result in this ﬁeld: H /C19enon’s theorem
4relates the rate of change
of the perihelion/aphelion angle to the rate of change of theperiod at ﬁxed energy for an N-body system moving in a plane.
H/C19enon’s theorem holds for any power-law potential, not only
for the two precession-free potentials discussed above.
Power-law potentials form an important subset in classical
mechanics: It is well known that power-law or homoge-neous
5potentials lead to simple scaling laws.1,6It is perhaps
less well known that these scaling laws lead to certain dual-
ity relations between periodic orbits in power-law potentials
of the form VðrÞ/C24raandVðrÞ/C24r/C22awhen the powers aand
/C22aare related by ðaþ2Þð/C22aþ2Þ¼4. This duality was dis-
covered by Bohlin7,8and Kasner9in the early 20th century
and discussed at length in this journal10–12and else-
where.13–16In some presentations, this duality appears as a
mere mathematical curiosity, but it is a direct consequence
of the homogeneity of the potential, i.e., of the underlying
scaling symmetry.
Normally, the properties of physical systems implied by
symmetry are studied in some detail in textbooks, but the scal-ing symmetry appears to be an exception, perhaps because of
the prevailing attitude that its consequences must be trivial.
However, as the example of H /C19enon’s theorem shows, the con-
sequences of classical or “engineering” scaling in point particledynamics are far from fully understood, and still farther from
being well known, even among experts in classical dynamics,
let alone the wider physics community.The purpose of this article is to present H /C19enon’s theorem,
provide an undergraduate-level proof for the two-body case,
and connect it with other results based on scaling arguments.
In particular, we shall show that H /C19enon’s theorem is consis-
tent with the aforementioned (power-law) conformal duality
in Newtonian two-body dynamics. Indeed, Bertrand’s theo-
rem receives a new meaning in view of H /C19enon’s theorem.
We also show how to use H /C19enon’s theorem and the duality
law to ﬁnd all power-law potentials integrable by means of
elliptic integrals.
This paper consists of six sections. After the Introduction,
in Sec. II, we brieﬂy review the preliminaries. Then in Sec.
III, we state H /C19enon’s theorem for two body motion and dis-
cuss some of its basic consequences. In Sec. IV, we show the
proof of this version of H /C19enon’s theorem. In Sec. V, we pre-
sent several examples of integrable motions in power-law
potentials. In Sec. VI, we put these results into their wider
historical perspective, summarize, and draw conclusions.
II. PRELIMINARIES
The original H /C19enon’s theorem addresses planar periodic
N-body orbits, where N¼1;2;3;…, with non-zero angular
momentum in power-law binary potentials including, but not
limited to, Newtonian gravity. Here, we only address the
case of two bodies ( N¼2) interacting via a radial force, and,
of course, the equivalent case of one body in a ﬁxed central
potential. First, in Sec. II A, we remind the reader of some
basic facts of two-body motion in central potentials. Then in
Sec. II B, we specialize to power-law potentials, of which the
Newtonian gravity is a special case. Power-law potentials
allow similar solutions when parameters are scaled, and in
this discussion, we will hold ﬁxed masses, coupling constant,and energy. The scale-invariant period and angular momen-
tum that facilitate this stipulation are shown in Sec. II C.
A. Periodic two-body orbits in central potentials
It is well known
1,3that the problem of two bodies ( N¼2)
interacting via a central potential V(r) is integrable (in
Liouville’s sense), because it can be reduced to the problemof a single body moving in an effective potential V

Angular momentum conservation implies planar motion of
the particles.1,2After removing the center-of-mass motion,
theN¼2-body problem turns into a planar one-body prob-
lem that can be parametrized with two variables: The radiusr(from the center of attraction) and an angle h. The equa-
tions of motion in these two variables can be separated. In
bounded motion, the radius moves between some minimum
(perihelion) and maximum (aphelion), whereas the anglegenerally increases or decreases monotonically.
In an inertial frame of reference, the trajectories of peri-
odic orbits form closed curves such as ellipses or Rosetta-
like curves as shown in Fig. 1. Because the trajectories are
periodic, the period T
rof radial oscillation and the time Th
for the angle hto increase by 2 pare commensurate.
Equivalently, when viewed in a co-rotating frame of refer-ence, the trajectory is a closed curve with a period that iscommensurate with the inverse of the angular frequency of
the frame’s rotation. When we refer to the “period” of such a
system, we will always mean T
rrather than the time required
for the orbit to return to precisely the same conditions.
In quasi-periodic orbits, on the other hand, these two periods
are incommensurate—such orbits have perihelia that slowly
precess in such a way that the curves never close and ﬁll up theplane after sufﬁciently long time, see Fig. 1(b). Equivalently,
when viewed in a co-rotating frame of reference, the trajectory
is a closed curve with a period that is incommensurate with theinverse angular velocity of the rotation.
As far as H /C19enon’s theorem is concerned, there is no intrinsic
difference between periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, as both
may have precessing perihelia, and in both cases, we will refer
to the radial period, T
r, simply as the period. The shift of the
angle of the perihelion, /, during one radial period will be
called the precession angle U¼D/¼/ðTrÞ/C0/ð0Þ.I nt w o -
body problems, both UðE;L;aÞand TrðE;L;aÞcan be
expressed as deﬁnite integrals over the radius rthat depend
parametrically on the energy Eand the angular momentum L,
see Eqs. (1)and(3). When the motion proceeds in a power-law
central potential, there are additional constraints on thesedependences.
B. Two-body trajectories in power-law potentials
When the potential is a power law, VðrÞ¼V
aðrÞ
¼sgnðaÞgara, where sgn ðxÞ¼x=jxjand ga>0, thesolutions are generally (for a range of angular momenta and
energies) bounded and quasi-periodic for powers /C02<a
<þ1. For powers /C02>a>/C01, the motion is generally
unbounded, and thus, non-periodic, though there may exist
individual periodic orbits (at speciﬁc values of energy andangular momentum) which are unstable. For future conve-nience, we set g
a¼/C22ga/C0a, where ais the length scale and /C22g
is the (universal) coupling strength with dimension ofenergy; /C22gandaare set to ﬁxed constant values, whereas the
energy Eand the angular momentum Lare non-vanishing
and apparently independent variables that are also constantsof the motion. However, due to the power-law nature of thepotential, there are non-trivial relations among these nomi-nally independent constants. Section II C will explain the
interdependence of the mass m, the coupling /C22g, the length
scale a, and the dynamical constants of the motion EandL.
The period T
rof the radial motion and the perihelion shift
angleUcan be expressed as integrals over one period1,2with
upper and lower integration limits depending on the angularmomentum L: Eq. (14.6) in Ref. 1for the period Tof a peri-
odic orbit reads

In the following, these two integrals will be of paramount
interest, but there are other dimensional integrals that can berelated to these two by way of partial integration with respect
to the energy Eand angular-momentum L.

C. Scaling of orbits in power-law potentials
The Newtonian equation of motion for a nonrelativistic
particle in a homogeneous potential VaðrÞis
m€r¼/C0 r rVaðrÞ¼/C0 asgnðaÞgara/C01^r:
Scaling the spatial coordinates in this equation according to
r!krdemands a temporal rescaling as t!kð1/C0a=2Þtin
order to preserve the form of the equation of motion. In thisscaling, we see
r!kr;
t!k
ð1/C0a=2Þt;
p!pka=2;
E!kaE;
L!k1þa=2L;
Ir!k1þa=2Ir:(9)
Alternatively, we may introduce a new scaling parameter
sunder which energy Escales linearly
r!s1=ar;
t!s1=a/C01=2t;
p!s1=2p;
E!sE;
L!s1=2þ1=aL;
Ir!s1=2þ1=aIr:(10)
Using these relationships, one can build scale-invariant com-
binations of independent dynamical variables such as
TjEj1=2/C01=a;TR/C0ð1/C0a=2Þ, and jEjjLjð/C02a=ð2þaÞÞ. These scalinginvariants depend on dimensional variables in a unique way,
however. For example,
(1) The energy dependence T/C24jEj1=a/C01=2of the period Tis
determined by the spatial scaling rules. It has a unique
prefactor (see, e.g., Problem 2 in Sec. 11 of Ref. 1)
T/C24ﬃﬃﬃﬃm
ErE
ga/C18/C191=a
/C24jEj1=a/C01=2ﬃﬃﬃﬃmpgaðÞ/C01=a; (11)
so the mass mand coupling constant gadependences of
Talso follow from scaling laws. Since the dimensional
coupling ga¼/C22ga/C0acan be replaced by /C22g, which has the
dimension of energy, and a length unit a, we have
uniquely determined the dependences not just on the
energy Ebut also on the coupling ga, and/or the length
scale a, and on the mass m. In other words, and as adver-
tised earlier, homogeneity of the potential implies scal-
ing rules that imply the change of mass and of the
coupling constant, as well as the spatiotemporal scaling.
(2) The dimensionless phase Uhas no dimensional prefac-
tor: It can only depend on dimensionless scale-invariant
quantities, such as 2 ma2E=L2;2ma2k=L2,o rrmin=max=a,
i.e.,
U¼Ua2ma2E
L2;2ma2k
L2;rmax
a;rmin
a/C18/C19
: (12)
Thus, even though the energy Eand the angular momentum
Lare independent variables, under scaling transformations
they change such that the constraint jEjjLjð/C02a=ð2þaÞÞ¼const :
remains fulﬁlled. This relation can be rewritten as
LjEjð/C01=2/C01=aÞ¼Ls:i:¼const :, which serves as a deﬁnition
of the scale-invariant angular momentum Ls:i:. Different val-
ues of the scale-invariant angular momentum Ls:i:reﬂect its
independence of energy E. Therefore, we must take into
account this and all other constraints stemming from scalingsymmetry.

This equation will be proven in Sec. IV. Note that:
(1) This result implies L/C24ð@T=@UÞE, whereas one might
have naively expected L/C24_U/C24ð@U=@TÞ. The explana-
tion for this counter-intuitive inverse proportionality is
that it is not a derivative with respect to time t, but with
respect to the period T;
(2) Both sides of Eq. (13) are homogeneous of degree
1/C0a=2, i.e., they transform as kð1/C0a=2Þunder scaling Eq.
(9). This means that one could have written entirely
in terms of scale-invariant variables Ts:i:¼TjEjð1=2/C01=aÞ

B. Some consequences
There are four special values of aworthy of discussion:
(1) In the case of the so-called “strong” force ( a¼/C02), the
pre-factor on the right-hand side of Eq. (13) vanishes,
thus leading to the statement ð@T=@UÞE¼0. The only
periodic solution is a circular orbit with E¼0 and a ﬁxed
value of angular momentum L. Its dual /C22a¼61case
corresponds to a hard sphere (or solid-wall) potential.12
(2) In the self-dual case a¼0,/C22a¼0, the right-hand side of
this formula goes to inﬁnity, thus implying ð@T=@UÞE
!1 . Note, however, that a¼0 corresponds to free
motion, as the potential is a constant. Consequently,there can be no periodic orbits, and the corresponding
notions such as the period Tand perihelion shift Uare
both undeﬁned.17Therefore, this singularity is illusory.
(3) For Newtonian gravity or the Coulomb force, the perihe-
lion of the elliptic orbit does not precess UðT;L;EÞ¼0,
which would seem to imply ð@U=@TÞE¼0, which in
Eq.(13) implies E=L¼0 for arbitrary ﬁnite values of L
at ﬁnite ﬁxed values of E. This apparent paradox is
resolved by examining H /C19enon’s theorem for the case
a¼/C01
@T
@U/C18/C19
E¼/C0L
2E; (14)
and noticing that the period T(L,E) is also independent
of the angular momentum at ﬁxed value of energy E, i.e.,
that both ð@U=@LÞE¼0 and ð@T=@LÞE¼0 hold.18
Therefore, Eq. (14) is an identity of the 0 ¼0 type,
whereas Eq. (13) has the form of 0 =0¼E=L<1. Thus,
there is no paradox. Indeed, this means that the E(L)
function for the Keplerian two-body orbits is (inﬁnitely)multivalued, and that one cannot deduce UðT;L;EÞ
¼const :ð¼0Þfrom H /C19enon’s theorem alone.
(4) The harmonic oscillator potential /C22a¼2, is the dual of
Newtonian potential; there is no perihelion precession inthe harmonic oscillator and the angular momentum isarbitrary at ﬁxed values of energy for arbitrary numberof particles N. For this reason, we have ð@U=@TÞ
E¼0=0
here, just as in the N¼2 Newtonian potential.
Note, moreover, that Eq. (13) for exponents aand /C22a
can be connected by means of the duality relation
ðaþ2Þð/C22aþ2Þ¼4. This implies an identity relating the
rates of change of the periods dTaanddT/C22a, to the rates of
change of the perihelion shifts dUaanddU/C22a. This is the dif-
ferential form of the conformal duality relations.10,11,13
IV. PROOF
In the special case, we are considering of two-body sys-
tems in power-law potentials, and the proof can be reduced
to a series of (purely) algebraic operations, i.e., Eq. (13)
becomes an identity, albeit a non-trivial one to prove.19
The radial action IrðL;EÞ, Eq. (4), can be expressed
explicitly in terms of the previously deﬁned xr, Eq. (8), and
f(L), Eq. (6), by means of the following identity (this is Eq.
(B3) in Ref. 20, modulo the energy Efactor)

The above proofs amount to repeated applications of (sev-
eral) identities among partial derivatives of functions of tworeal independent variables E,L. This may give one the false
impression that H /C19enon’s theorem for two-body motion is a
mere identity. That is not so, because in deriving Eq. (15) we

have repeatedly used the scaling symmetry, by way of Eqs.
(9) and (10), which do not hold for inhomogeneous
potentials.
V. EXAMPLES
Let us now show a few examples that illustrate why this is a
non-trivial result. According to Wh ittaker22and Broucke,23
there are exactly 14 values of the power athat can be expressed
in terms of elliptic functions and/or elliptic integrals.24The nine
integer values are shown in Table I, and the ﬁve fractional val-
ues are shown in Table II. Note that some of the same values
appear also in the second row, the so-called dual powers /C22a,i n
these tables. Manifestly, only 9 þ2¼11 of these exponents are
independent, whereas the remaining three can be obtained by
way of conformal transformations.
The Coulomb and harmonic oscillator, which are solved in
terms of trigonometric functions, are but two of these 14. They
have been treated in Refs. 10,11,a n d 25and shall not be
repeated here. As discussed in Sec. III B,t h e s et w oe x a m p l e s
are indeed trivial, albeit only for N ¼2 bodies. Another special
case, the so-called “strong potential,” a¼/C02, has been treated
by Wu and Sprung,12again, so it will not be repeated here.
Whereas the remaining eight cases are expressible in
terms of elliptic functions and/or integrals, their derivatives
generally lead to very complicated expressions that have to
be evaluated numerically, which we do here for three values
ofa, which equals six when their duals are taken into
account. These examples ought to serve as a benchmark for
the interested reader to compare with their own calculations.
A. Numerical check of H /C19enon’s theorem for elliptic
integrals a523=2;21=2, 1/2
Henon’s equation (13) can be checked by numerical calcu-
lations: First, calculate T(L) by numerically integrating Eq.
(1)with integration boundaries shown in Eq. (2)and then
invert it to ﬁnd L(T) (at ﬁxed energy E). This will be used to
compare /C0ð1=2þ1=aÞL=EanddT=dU, where UðLÞis inte-
grated from Eq. (3), again using integration boundaries
shown in Eq. (2).Case a¼/C03=2
We show the angular momentum L(T) and the perihelion
precession angle UðTÞas functions of period Tfor relative
periodic two-body orbits in the homogeneous potential witha¼/C03=2 at ﬁxed energy E¼/C01=
2 in Fig. 2.
Note that in Fig. 2, the perihelion precession angle Uis
effectively negative at a¼/C03=2: We have UðL¼0Þ=
ð2pÞ¼2 and, as the angles are only deﬁned modulo 2 p,w e
may set it equal to zero: UðL¼0Þ=ð2pÞ¼0. In Fig. 3,w e
compare the negative of the quantity ð1=2þ1=aÞðL=EÞas
directly calculated and the same quantity calculated by way
of H /C19enon’s identity, Eq. (13)—note the symmetry of curves
above and below the horizontal axis, which conﬁrmsH/C19enon’s theorem.
Cases a¼/C01=2anda¼1=2
Similarly, we show in Fig. 4the perihelion precession
angle UðTÞas a function of period Tfor relative periodic
two-body orbits for a¼/C01=2 and a¼1=2. We see that
Uhas the same sign and the same sign of its slope for both
a¼/C01=2 and a¼1=2. Assuming continuity in a, it follows
thatUis also non-zero with the same sign of slope at a¼0
in agreement with the argument based on Bertrand’s theorem

H/C19enon’s theorem is a consequence of scaling symmetry in
a simple power-law mechanical system, just like the confor-mal duality, but it has not reached a wider audience as yet;Table II. Five fractional-valued powers aand their duals /C22ain power-law

herewith we hope to provoke curiosity among teachers and
students of physics alike.
H/C19enon explained4his path towards this theorem: His for-
mulation and subsequent derivation of the general formulafollowed an initial observation of a special case in his studyof the “isochron” model of spherical star clusters
26and in his
studies of planar three-body problem.27Yet, H /C19enon’s origi-
nal proof of his theorem was based on Routh’s formalism28
of integrating out ignorable degrees of freedom (cyclic varia-bles), which is not standard fare in undergraduate, or evengraduate-level textbooks (for an exception, see Ref. 29).
H/C19enon was not the only person interested in this topic due
to Einstein’s calculation of Mercury’s perihelion shift inGeneral Relativity. Indeed, there was at least one close
encounter
30(but still a miss) before H /C19enon’s formulation,
and another one20thereafter. There are other consequences
of homogeneity of power-law potentials, such as the confor-mal duality relations,10–13 ,16which was used in Tables Iand
II.H/C19enon’s theorem ﬁts nicely into this line of thought,
though H /C19enon did not mention duality explicitly in his paper.
Indeed, neither have the many authors of subsequent papersabout conformal duality.10–13 ,16All of this leaves us with the
question: Why was H /C19enon’s theorem discovered so late, in
the historical development of the subject, and why has itbeen missed and/or overlooked so often?

5“Power-law” and “homogeneous” are synonyms in the context of one- and
two-body problems, as there is only one distance variable involved. That
is not the case anymore as the number of bodies increases.
6Indeed, these scaling laws are so simple that they are often overlookedin textbooks on theoretical physics, one signiﬁcant exception beingLandau–Lifshitz (Ref. 1); whereas, at the other extreme, they are called
“engineering” rules (Ref. 31) and/or are widely ignored. In stark con-
trast, the scaling properties of continua, both classical and quantum,such as those of phase transitions in statistical mechanics, or of quan-
tum ﬁelds, are highly non-trivial—having been the subject of intense
research for decades with many signiﬁcant new results and no end insight.

17The logarithmic potential is also often associated with scale invariance,
i.e., with the a!0 limit of the power-law potential. However, in this
potential, an additive constant appears under scaling transformations. Of
course, the equations of motion are invariant under such additive con-
stants, but the energy Eis not. Thus, the above proof of H /C19enon’s theorem
must be modiﬁed for the logarithmic potential. One can pass from the log-
arithmic potential to the limit a¼0 of the power-law if one subtracts a
constant which tends to 1, however.
18Of course, the deeper reason for these perhaps somewhat confusing facts
is the existence of the conserved Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, whichexists in the two-body case only and implies a period that depends only on
the energy Eand not on the angular momentum: T¼TðEÞ.
19The fact that in spite of great attention paid to the two-body problem over
the years (centuries), H /C19enon’s theorem was not discovered in that context
is testimony to its non-triviality.
