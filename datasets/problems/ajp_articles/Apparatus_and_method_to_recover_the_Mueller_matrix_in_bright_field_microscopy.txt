We present a simple experiment developed for the advanced physics instructional laboratory to
calculate the Mueller matrix of a microscopic sample. The Mueller matrix is obtained fromintensity-based images of the sample acquired by a polarization-sensitive microscope. The
experiment requires a bright-ﬁeld microscope and standard polarizing optical components such as
linear polarizers and waveplates. We provide a practical procedure for implementing the apparatus,measuring the complete Mueller matrix of linear polarizers used as samples, and discuss the
possibility of analyzing biological samples using our apparatus and method. Due to the simplicity
of the apparatus and method, this experiment allows students to increase their knowledge aboutlight polarization and initiate their training in optical instrumentation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Visible light is an electromagnetic wave in which electric
and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate perpendicularly to the directionof propagation. When the electric ﬁeld oscillation is welldeﬁned over time, light is said to be polarized. Depending onhow the electric ﬁeld is oriented, the polarization state oflight can be classiﬁed as linear, circular, or elliptical polari-
zation. The latter type of polarization provides the most gen-
eral description of polarized light. Polarization is a standardtopic in undergraduate physics courses, which are focused onthe wave properties of light.
1
Polarization can be useful in a variety of imaging applica-
tions. In photography, the insertion of polarizers in imagingsystems reduces glare from light scattering, increases con-
trast, eliminates hot spots from reﬂective objects, and detects
hidden image features.2Polarization is also used to evaluate
stress in amorphous solids such as glass and plastic.3Stress
from temperature and pressure proﬁles in birefringent andnonhomogeneous materials introduces localized variationsand gradients of the material properties. This stress can be
observed and quantiﬁed in transparent objects using polar-
ized light methodologies
4due to the localized changes in the
refractive index.5Polarization has also been used in thechemical, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage industries,
enabling the detection and quantiﬁcation of the chemicalcompounds. Many organic chemical compounds (including
active pharmaceutical ingredients and sugars) are optically
active, rotating the polarization state of the light in differentdirections based on their nature and concentration.
1
Polarimetry has also provided a vast number of applications indifferent ﬁelds of astrophysics from solar physics to cosmol-ogy. For example, polarimetry allows the description and mea-surement of magnetic ﬁelds of astrophysical objects (intensityand orientation), quantities that cannot be measured directly.
6
Polarization has also been used in microscopy.7–9In a
simple polarization microscope system, two linear polarizers
are inserted. The ﬁrst polarizer is inserted in front of the illu-mination source to polarize the incident light linearly,whereas the second polarizer is set in front of the sensor(commonly known as the analyzer).
10The transmission axis
of the analyzer is rotated at 90/C14to the transmission axis of
the ﬁrst polarizer. If an anisotropic or birefringent specimenis inserted between the crossed polarizers, the specimen pro-
duces two perpendicular wave components (ordinary and
extraordinary wavefronts) with a phase difference betweenthem. These wavefronts are then recombined by constructiveand destructive interference at the analyzer.

conﬁguration, the analyzer only transmits light that has expe-
rienced a specimen-induced phase shift between the perpen-
dicular components and continues to block all the light from
the source initially polarized by the ﬁrst polarizer. The
resulting high-contrast intensity is proportional to the speci-
men thickness and birefringence.11Since many biological
samples, including cancer cells12,13and tendons,14are intrin-
sically birefringent, polarization-sensitive microscopy has
been a hot topic in biological studies over the last decades.
Polarization-sensitive microscopy has enabled the detection
and screening of diseases by analyzing the polarimetric prop-
erties of biological samples. In 2009, Palacios et al. com-
pared the capability of different techniques for extracting
information from biological samples,15concluding that
polarization-sensitive techniques provide more information
than nonpolarization approaches to the study of biological
and inorganic samples. In 2015, Pirnstill and Cot developed
a cheap, portable polarization microscope for detecting
malaria in blood samples using a cell phone.16In 2018,
Wang et al. studied the change in the birefringence in
bladder normal and cancerous tissue.12
Due to the wide-ranging application of light polarization
in many important ﬁelds, educators introduce students to the
fundamentals of this topic in basic instructional and research
activities. Several polarization experiments are commonly
taught in the introductory optical laboratory: veriﬁcation of
Malus’ law,17measurement of the Brewster angle for the
glass–air interface,18computation of the Stokes parame-
ters,19and retrieval of the reﬂected and transmitted waves’
polarization characteristics.
Polarization-based techniques are commonly based on
estimating the Jones or Mueller matrices of the studied sam-
ples. While the estimation of the Jones matrix requires an
optical interferometer,20the Mueller matrix can be calcu-
lated directly from intensity-based images,21resulting in a
more straightforward optical conﬁguration. Another advan-
tage of the Mueller formalism is its applicability to polarizedand depolarized light.22Using the Mueller formalism, the
sample’s birefringence, diattenuation, and depolarization can
be estimated. These parameters represent a biological sam-
ple’s polarization properties.23
In this paper, we present a complete method for estimating
the Mueller matrix from intensity-based measurements. We
also provide a detailed description of the required experimen-
tal system, including alignment procedures and softwaretools, so that students can carry out a measurement of a sam-
ple’s polarimetric properties. First, we present the alignment
protocol to convert a brightﬁeld microscope into apolarization-sensitive microscope by inserting a polarization
state generator (PSG) and a polarization state analyzer (PSA).
Then, we use our system to study the polarizing properties ofa linear polarizer whose transmission axis is oriented at 0
/C14,
þ45/C14,a n d9 0/C14with respect to the PSG and two biological
samples. The proposed method for obtaining the Muellermatrix only requires conventional optical elements in a sim-
ple arrangement, making it easy to implement and use. The
system is a valuable educational tool, providing students use-ful experience with the polarization properties of light.
II. DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS AND METHOD
This section describes the apparatus and method we use to
estimate the Mueller matrix for a sample, where the sample’s
polarization properties vary across its transverse ﬁeld of view.
A. Apparatus to record the intensity-based images
In this particular case, the estimation of the Mueller matrix
is based on the recording of 36 intensity-based images using
a brightﬁeld microscope. Figure 1shows the optical conﬁgu-
ration of the brightﬁeld microscope using a collimated beam.
A sample is imaged using an inﬁnity-corrected microscope
objective (MO) lens, which forms the image of the sample atthe inﬁnity. Thus, to produce a real sample image, one must

insert a tube lens (TL). Under this conﬁguration, the micro-
scope’s image plane is located at the back focal plane (bfp)of the TL lens. The digital sensor (i.e., a CCD or CMOScamera) is placed at the bfp of the TL to ensure that focusedimages are recorded. The distance between the MO and TLis such that the telecentric regime is guaranteed (e.g., afocalconﬁguration).
To convert the brightﬁeld microscope into a polarization-
sensitive microscope, we insert polarization state generator(PSG) and polarization state analyzer (PSA) systems before thesample and after the TL, respectively. While the PSA system isalways composed of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) followed bya linear polarizer (LP), the PSG system depends on the polari-zation state of the illumination source. To check the polariza-tion state of the source, insert and rotate a LP right after theillumination source. If the intensity of the emerging light
remains invariant to the rotation of the LP, the source is ran-
domly polarized. Otherwise, the source is elliptically polarized.
When using a randomly polarized source [Fig. 1(a)], the
PSG system comprises a LP followed by a QWP. For line-arly polarized sources, the PSG system is composed of ahalf-wave plate (HWP) followed by a QWP [Fig. 1(b)].
Finally, for elliptically polarized sources, an LP can beinserted before the HWP and the QWP [the inset inFig.1(b)]. The transmission axis of the LP must be aligned
with the major axis of the polarization state of the source toensure the highest intensity of the beam. The alignment ofthis additional LP is performed by rotating the LP until themaximum intensity of the emerging beam is observed.Alternatively, one can use a depolarizer instead of the addi-tional LP, converting the elliptically polarized source into arandomly polarized source. Therefore, the PSG is the sameas the randomly polarized case [Fig. 1(a)].
The next step is the alignment of the PSG and PSA sys-
tems. The alignment procedure depends on the polarizingelements used for the PSG and the PSA systems. First, wedescribe the alignment protocol of the polarizing elementswhen using a randomly polarized source. Before aligning theelements, a calibrated LP is needed. If there is no such ele-ment in the laboratory, a LP can be calibrated using a line-arly polarized source.
The general procedure for calibrating a LP is to place it after
the beam emerges from the source and rotate the LP until itsminimum intensity is found. This minimum can be checkedeffortlessly by observing a histogram of the recorded image.(Usually, commercial camera software provides the histogramof the current acquisition.) There are two orientations in whichthe intensity is minimum: at 90
/C14or 270/C14with respect to the ori-
entation of the source. In either of these two orientations for the
LP, its transmission axis is orthogonal to the polarization axis of
the source. For example, if the source is vertically polarized(say, perpendicular to the laboratory table plane), the LP trans-mission axis is horizontal (say, parallel to the laboratory tableplane). After calibrating the LP, this polarizer is inserted afterthe randomly polarized source and set in a ﬁxed orientation. Theorientation of the calibrated LP must not be a speciﬁc one; itcould be either vertical, horizontal, or otherwise. Nevertheless,this orientation must be kept invariant during the alignment pro-tocol since it refers to the zero reference of the whole system.
Next, insert the LP of the PSA system (LP-PSA). The ori-
entation of the LP-PSA is such that the intensity of the beamrecorded by the camera is minimum. This orientationremains ﬁxed throughout the alignment protocol. The nextelement to align is the LP of the PSG system (LP-PSG).Before inserting the LP-PSG, the calibrated polarizer is
removed from the microscope path; thus, only the LPs of thePSG and PSA systems are kept in the setup. The orientationof the LP-PSG is such that the intensity of the beam recordedby the camera is minimum. This orientation is ﬁxed duringthe rest of the alignment procedure. Now, insert the QWP-PSG after the LP-PSG and before the sample. Rotate theQWP-PSG until the recorded intensity is minimum. Thereare two orientations of the fast axis of the QWP-PSG thatgenerate a minimum intensity: 0
/C14and 90/C14with respect to
the transmission axis of LP-PSG. Choose the one in whichthe QWP’s fast axis is parallel to the transmission axis of theLP-PSG. Now, insert the QWP-PSA before the LP-PSA. Theorientation of the QWP-PSA is such as to guarantee: (1) itgenerates a minimum intensity at the camera and (2) its fastaxis is parallel to the transmission axis of the LP-PSG.
Finally, rotate the LP-PSA 90
/C14clockwise.
The alignment protocol is slightly different if the source is
linearly polarized. If the direction of the polarization state ofthe source is known, there is no need to use a calibrated LP.The ﬁrst element to be aligned is the LP-PSA. Assuming thatthe orientation of the polarization state of the source isknown, the orientation of the LP-PSA is such that the inten-sity of the beam recorded by the camera is minimum. Thenext element to be set and aligned is the HWP-PSG. Its orien-tation is such that the intensity of the recorded beam is mini-mum. Although two HWP-PSG orientations are generating aminimum intensity (i.e., 0
/C14and 180/C14to the orientation of the
source), both are always parallel to the polarization state ofthe source. Next, insert the QWP-PSG after the HWP-PSG.The orientation of the QWP-PSG is such that: (1) the inten-sity of the beam recorded by the camera is minimum and (2)the orientation of the QWP-PSG’s fast axis is parallel to thetransmission axis of the source. Finally, insert the QWP-PSAbefore the LP-PSA. The QWP-PSA is oriented with the samerestrictions as the QWP-PSG. Once all the polarizing ele-ments are aligned, rotate the LP-PSA 90
/C14clockwise.
Suppose the source is elliptically polarized [the inset of Fig.
1(b)]. In that case, an additional LP is inserted after the source,
and the same alignment protocol as when the source was line-arly polarized is followed. Alternatively, a depolarizer can beused instead of the LP. In this case, the alignment of the systemis the same as the one for a randomly polarized source. If usingthe LP, consider the most general case in which the ellipticalpolarization state is unknown. There are three differentapproaches to aligning this additional LP. In the ﬁrst case, theorientation of the transmission axis of the LP is at 0
/C14or 90/C14.
Insert the LP after the source and rotate the source to obtainthe maximum intensity after the calibrated LP (e.g., alignment
of the ellipse’s major axis to the transmission axis of the LP).
If the source cannot be rotated, the second possibility is torotate the calibrated LP to align its transmission axis parallel tothe major axis of the ellipse of the source. As the transmissionaxis of the calibration LP has been rotated, the polarizing ele-ments of the microscope must be aligned accordingly. The lastand simplest option involves inserting a calibrated LP with itstransmission axis oriented either at 0
/C14or 90/C14without rotating
the source. This option is only recommended if the source’sintensity is strong enough, so losing intensity is not a concernthroughout the microscope.
Once the system is aligned (regardless the type of the
source’s polarization state), we record 36 required intensity-based images by rotating the polarizing elements of bothPSG and PSA systems. Using these 36 intensity-based
704 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 9, September 2022 Obando-Vasquez, Doblas, and Trujillo 704 04 October 2023 23:17:03
images, we estimate the sample’s Muller matrix. In our
method, the following polarization states in both PSG andPSA systems must be generated: vertical polarization, i.e.,90
/C14(V), horizontal polarization, i.e., 0/C14(H), linear polari-
zation at þ45/C14(P), linear polarization at /C045/C14(M), right-
handed circular polarization (R), and left-handed circularpolarization (L). The orientation angles of the polarizing ele-ments of the PSG and PSA systems to their reference zero(i.e., the orientation angles obtained during the alignmentprocedure) are found in Appendix B . To ease the applicability
of the proposed apparatus and method, we have provided theorientation angles when the source is randomly polarized and
elliptically polarized. The insertion of all the latter polarizing
elements in the proposed apparatus does not produce anyvignetting effects in the recorded images since these elementsdo not act as the microscope’s entrance and exit pupils.
B. Method to estimate the Mueller matrix
Several methods have been reported to calculate the 16
elements of the Mueller matrix for a random sample basedon recording multiple intensity-based images ranging from16 up to 49 images.
24,25The fewer the number of images,
the less acquisition time is required. Nonetheless, those
methods are prone to inaccuracies. On the contrary, themethods requiring more images provide higher accuracy andless noise sensitivity since each element of the Muellermatrix is overestimated.
26There must be a tradeoff between
the number of images and the acquisition time. Therefore,we propose the method that requires 36 images
25since it bal-
ances this tradeoff providing accurate results with a reduced
number of images (36 versus 49 images). The 36 intensity-
based images are recorded by changing the polarization stateof both the polarization state generator (PSG) and polariza-tion state analyzer (PSA) systems (see Sec. II A and
Appendix B ). Based on these polarization states of PSG and
PSA systems, the Mueller matrix, M, is

In Eq. (2),25the ﬁrst letter represents the polarization state
of the PSG system, and the second one corresponds to thepolarization state of the PSA system. For example, in the HV
image, the polarization states of the PSG and PSA systemsare horizontal and vertical, respectively.
Once the Mueller matrix is calculated, we can estimate the
values of the diattenuation (D),27–29polarizance (P),27–29
retardance (R),27,28depolarization ( D),29and the angle of
polarization ( h)30,31via Eq. (3). Diattenuation is a property
that describes the magnitude of the variation of the transmit-
ted irradiance as a function of the incident polarization
state.29Polarizance is the ability of a medium to polarize
light and is usually measured through the degree of polariza-tion of light when passing through a medium. Diattenuationand polarizance can be considered as the opposite effect. In ahomogeneous medium, the polarizance and diattenuation areequal.
28Depolarization is deﬁned as the property of a
medium to convert a polarized beam into a depolarizedone.29The retardance map reveals the phase change induced
by the sample within the EM components of the light.27,28
We apply the polar decomposition reported by Chipman and
Lu27to calculate the diattenuation, polarizance, retardance,
and depolarization. Finally, the angle of polarization is theorientation of the transmission axis of a linear polarizer tothe optical reference of the system. The polarization angle h
is only relevant if the sample has linear polarizing behav-
ior.

We have implemented a numerical simulator of the polar-
imeter as a tool for instructors and students to review con-cepts before experimenting in the laboratory.32These
numerical simulations aim to recover the same output
Mueller matrix as the one used in the input sample afterapplying the technique. Thirty-six intensity-based images of10/C210 pixels are computationally generated in Python (ver-
sion 3.8.5) and the Py-pol library for each input sample.
33,34
This library allows the generation of the pointwise Mueller
matrix for the input sample and each polarizing element inthe PSG and PSA systems. Assuming that the PSG system iscomposed of an LP and a QWP, and the PSA system is alsocomposed of a QWP and the LP [Fig. 1(a)], the resulting

knowledge (e.g., equations) into real applications.
Therefore, students should validate the method numericallyby mimicking a sample composed of linear polarizers whose
transmission axes are oriented at different angles before the
laboratory session.
The laboratory procedure described in this section is
aimed to be followed by a student from scratch under theinstructor’s supervision. Depending on their level of exper-
tise in optical instrumentation, the overall time to implement
the proposed system could take between 2 h (experiencedstudent) and 10 h (inexperienced student with basic knowl-
edge in geometrical optics and light polarization). For an
inexperienced student with basic knowledge in optics, threesessions for implementation are recommended. In the ﬁrstsession, the student could implement the microscope system,
which will take at least 2 h. The student will build a bright-
ﬁeld microscope by determining the conjugated planes in anafocal system comprising an inﬁnity-corrected microscopeobjective and a tube lens. The digital camera will be located
at the back focal plane of the tube lens. In the second session,
which will take at least 5 h, the student will implement andcalibrate the polar imetric system, inserting the polarizingelements of PSG and PSA systems. The recording of the 36
brightﬁeld microscopic images will also occur during the
second session. During a ﬁnal 3-h session, the student willmeasure the Muller matrix using the calibrated system.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section is devoted to the experimental details of our
brightﬁeld microscopy approach (see Fig. 1). The sample in
the experimental brightﬁeld microscope is illuminated bylight from a collimated diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS)
laser with 532 nm wavelength and 4.5 mW power (Thorlabs
CPS532). The microscope includes an inﬁnity-corrected MOwith a lateral magniﬁcation of 40 /C2and a numerical aperture
NA of 0.75, and a TL of 200-mm focal length. A Basler
acA5472-17 lm CMOS sensor (5472 /C23648 pixels, 2.4- lm
2
pixel size) is placed at the microscope’s image plane,
allowing the acquisition of focused intensity-based images.For this DPSS laser, the spot of its collimated beam is
large enough to ﬁll the sample area uniformly. The laser
beam’s diameter is around 3.5 mm, while the ﬁeld of view(FoV) of the system is (5472 px /C12:4lm/40/C2)¼0.329 mm
and (3648 px /C12:4lm/40/C2)¼0.218 mm in each direction.
Therefore, there is no need to expand the illuminating beamspot. If using an illumination source with a small spot, anafocal system comprised of two positive lenses of different
focal lengths could be used to attain the necessary illumina-
tion spot size.
The PSG and PSA systems are inserted in the microscope
to provide polarization-sensitive measurements. Since theDPSS laser is elliptically polarized, there are two possibili-
ties, as described in Sec. II A. In this case, a depolarizer
(Thorlabs DPU-25-A) was used to change the polarizationstate from elliptical to random polarization. Thus, the polar-izing elements of the PSG and PSA systems are two LP
(Thorlabs LPVISE100-A) and two achromatic QWP
(Thorlabs AQWP10M-580). Because these polarizing ele-ments must rotate to record the 36 intensity-based images,the elements are mounted onto motorized rotational stages,
two K10CR1/M for the LP, and two ELL14K for the QWP,
both products are from Thorlabs. Appendix C provides the
list of the optical elements used in this experimental setupand their costs. The use of motorized rotational mounts
instead of manual rotational mounts may improve the accu-
racy of the measurements by avoiding precision errors while
setting angular positions of the elements. We compare theperformance of both rotational mounts in Sec. IV.
Before evaluating the performance of our method, users
should experimentally verify if any microscope element
changes the polarization state of the light beam. For this veri-
ﬁcation, apply the described technique when no sample is inthe setup in order to characterize the effect of MO and TL on
the polarization state of light. Figure 3represents the experi-
mental Mueller matrix for an anisotropic sample with atransverse section equal to 328 /C2219lm
2at the sample
plane. Since the sample is isotropic, each Mueller element’s
value should be constant (within the experimental error)
across the imaged area. Based on this expectation, we haveaveraged the values around the central part of the images in
Fig.3. This area (red rectangle in the element m
00in Fig. 3)
encloses 256 /C2256 px2, which is equivalent to 15 /C215lm2
at the sample plane. The mean and standard deviations for
each 256 /C2256 px2central Mueller element are calculated
and reported in Fig. 3. Students may increase the size of the
red rectangle at will to perform their statistical analysis.Nonetheless, the computation of the polarization properties
may be tedious if one selects a larger area of the whole
image.
When comparing these values to the theoretical ones of a
non-polarizing element, which corresponds to the 4 /C24 iden-
tity matrix, the agreement between the experimental and the-
oretical results is evident but not perfect: An average error of
10.8% for the measured Mueller elements in Fig. 3has been
obtained. Using the central region of the Mueller matrix,marked by the red rectangle in Fig. 3, we have estimated the
values of the diattenuation (D), polarizance (P), and depolari-
zation ( D) using Eq. (3). The experimental diattenuation,
polarizance, depolarization, and retardance are 0.18 60.16
a.u., 0.30 60.12 a.u., /C00:0560:20 a.u., and 0.18 60.019 rad,

For each element of the Mueller matrix, the mean and standard deviation
across the region of the imaged ﬁeld of view enclosed by the red rectangle
are reported. The microscope is a nonpolarizing system.

respectively. The experimental uncertainty of these parame-
ters has been estimated through uncertainty propagation and
partial derivatives (see Appendix A for the equations used for
these estimations). Since no lenses manufactured with aniso-
tropic media are included in the microscope, the expected
theoretical values of these three parameters are zero. Whilethe depolarization parameter matches the theoretical expecta-
tion, the values of the diattenuation and polarizance are
slightly higher than the theoretical. This disagreement maybe related to the distortions in the recorded images (shown in
Fig.3) and some inaccurate orientations of the polarizing ele-
ments. Nonetheless, despite this difference, we can concludethat the microscope does not signiﬁcantly affect the polariza-
tion state of the incident light.
A. Linear polarizer measurement
In the ﬁrst experimental validation of our method, we use
a LP (Thorlabs LPVISE 100-A) oriented at three angles: 0
/C14,
þ45/C14, and 90/C14. The calculated Mueller matrices of the LP
oriented at these three angles are shown in Fig. 4. The agree-
ment between the experimental and theoretical Muellermatrices is high. Table Ipresents the LP’s theoretical and
experimental polarimetric parameters for the three orienta-
tion angles: diattenuation, polarizance, depolarization, andangle of polarization. Again, the degree of correlation
between theoretical and experimental results for the LP at
þ45
/C14andþ90/C14is high. Nonetheless, there is some discrep-
ancy for the LP at 0/C14. In this experiment, the retardance is
not reported since this quantity will reach an undetermined
value for a pure polarizer sample, as can be expected accord-ing to Eq. (3). Section IVexamines potential error sources in
our experimental data. The software implementation to cal-
culate the pointwise Muller matrices from the 36 intensity-based recorded images and the corresponding polarimetric
parameters can be found in Ref. 32, written both inMATLAB (tested in version 2019b) and in Python (tested in
version 3.8.5).
B. Biological samples measurement
Finally, we present and discuss the experimental results on
two biological samples from Carolina Biology using our
apparatus. These microscopic samples are a mammal tendonslide (item No. 312788) and a mammal muscle-tendon junc-
tion slide (item no. 312806). According to the literature,
tendon samples have shown polarimetric properties. The left-side panels in Fig. 5show the brightﬁeld images without PSG
and PSA systems. Because both slides are heavily stained
using haematoxylin (H&E), we cannot discriminate any sam-ple information in these images. The regions with dark inten-
sity values correspond to the samples’ areas. However, the
Mueller matrix of these biological samples provides moreinsight in that we can analyze each sample’s polarimetric
properties in highly stained areas, i.e., the regions where we
could not directly see any sample information.
Figure 5shows the polarizance, depolarization, diattenua-
tion, and retardance maps of the sample’s region enclosed bythe cyan rectangle in the brightﬁeld image. These maps were
obtained using our open-access Python code in Ref. 32,
which follows the method described in Sec. II. The polari-
metric maps in Fig. 5show that both samples display similar
polarizing behavior. First, they do not exhibit signiﬁcant
depolarization. Second, they induce some degree of polari-zance, diattenuation, and retardance in the incident light.
This behavior agrees with that reported in Ref. 12and vali-
dates the experimental polarization-sensitive microscope andmethod for characterizing the polarimetric properties of bio-
logical samples. A potential application related to this work
may be identifying, classifying, and screening microscopicsamples using polarization. In particular, one could integrate
this approach with learning-based methods for image

other ﬁelds.
IV. DISCUSSION
We have presented a method for calculating the Mueller
matrix of a sample based on 36 images. Although the pre-
sented experimental results have a high correlation with the
theoretical ones, there are still some discrepancies. This sec-tion will provide an error analysis of the proposed technique
and its instrumentation as well as discuss somerecommendations for reducing these discrepancies to achieve
more reliable results.
A. The illumination source
In these experiments, we employed a collimated DPSS
laser module with 532 nm wavelength and 4.5 mW power
(Thorlabs CPS532) as the illumination source due to its
availability in the laboratory. The main inconvenience ofusing a coherent light source is that the recorded images are
distorted by the diffraction patterns generated by any small

matrix, the mean and standard deviation across the imaged ﬁeld of view are shown.

amount of dust present in the optical elements and the
speckle noise.35This noise source produces arbitrary
changes in the recorded intensity values, disturbing the mea-surements. Low-coherent light sources, such as a LED,
13,36
are unaffected by high-coherence noise. Therefore, this light
source could provide more homogeneous intensity imagesthan those recorded by high-coherent sources, yielding a
more accurate estimation of the Mueller matrix with the pre-
sented methodology. A collimated wavefront should illumi-nate the sample with our microscopic imaging system.
Therefore, one should be careful to select the proper LED
illumination. Suppose the selected LED source does not emita collimated wavefront (e.g., it is a conventional LED
source). In that case, additional wavefront-shaping optical
elements should be inserted after the LED source to createthe required collimated beam.
B. The usage of motorized mounts versus manual mounts
Our method requires a particular set of polarization states
for the PSG and PSA systems. A possible cause of error in
the measurement of the Mueller matrix can be the exact
angular position of the polarization elements in both the PSGand PSA systems. Note that any slight deviation in the posi-
tion of the PSG and PSA elements affects the intensity in the
recorded image and, consequently, the calculated Muellermatrix. In our apparatus, we attached the polarization ele-
ments on motorized mounts to change the angular position
of the elements.
Figure 6shows the comparison of two Mueller matrixes
from a LP at 90
/C14using motorized mounts [Fig. 6(a)] and
manual rotating mounts [Fig. 6(b)].
Although the calculated Mueller matrix using manual rotating
mounts still captures the trend of the theoretical expectation, theelements present higher experimental errors (e.g., the standarddeviation is higher than the one provided by the data using
motorized mounts). Comparing the results shown in Fig. 6,
motorized mounts have reduced both human and systematicerrors due to the uncertainty in the angular pos ition of the polar-
izing elements, leading to polarimetric measurements with
reduced uncertainty. Therefore, motorized mounts are recom-m e n d e di ft h eq u a n t i t a t i v eM u e l l e rm a t r i xi su s e dt os c r e e na n d
diagnose biological samples with high accuracy. Another advan-
tage of using motorized mounts instead of manual ones is reduc-ing the acquisition time. While an average student may take
30–45 min to record the 36 images using manual mounts, the
acquisition time may be reduced to 5–7 min if the acquisitionprocess is correctly automatized using the motorized mounts.
Note that an automatic acquisition stage requires minimum stu-
dent effort and intervention.C. The inverse-matrix correction
Finally, the experimental results can be improved by using
the inverse-matrix correction method.
7This approach aims
to compensate for any experimental error introduced by thesystem without sample, M
system , by calculating its inverse
matrix and multiplying this result to the measured Muellermatrix, M
measured . Thus, mathematically, a corrected mea-
sured Mueller matrix is generated via Mcorrect ¼M/C01
system
Mmeasured . This method is suitable when the Mueller matrix
with no sample present in the setup diverges from the iden-tity matrix as in our case (see Fig. 3). Note that if the system
is perfectly nonpolarizing, its Mueller and inverse matriceswould equal the identity matrix. Nonetheless, the imple-mented system deviates from a perfectly nonpolarizingdevice due to experimental errors. Therefore, we can correctthese errors by compensating with the inverse Muellermatrix of the system. Table IIcompares the polarimetric
parameters of a linear polarizer at 0
/C14without and with
inverse matrix correction. As stated before, the retardance ofthe linear polarizer sample is not reported nor used for theinverse-matrix correction since its insertion will generate asigniﬁcant difference from the theoretical expectation.
Note that the corrected values present a smaller error with
respect to the theoretical expectations, validating the good-ness of the inversion-matrix approach. Table IIshows the
mean and the standard deviation of each polarization prop-erty and the error with respect to the theoretical value ofeach property. The error has been calculated with the equa-tions presented in Appendix A .
V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have presented a lab experience to esti-
mate the Mueller matrix in bright-ﬁeld microscopy based onthe intensity-based method. The proposed method requires36 intensity-based images in which the polarization states ofthe PGS and PSA systems have been changed. Before thelaboratory session, students are encouraged to validate the
method numerically by mimicking a sample composed of
linear polarizers whose transmission axes are oriented at dif-ferent angles. We have also presented a guide to build andalign a polarization-sensitive microscope from a conven-tional brightﬁeld microscope. The polarimetric parameters ofstandard linear polarizers are retrieved accurately followingthese guidelines. The hallmark characteristics of the pro-posed method are its simplicity and efﬁciency. The methodhas been implemented in
PYTHON and MATLAB and is available
in Ref. 32. Another advantage of the proposed method is that
it allows the retrieval of the Mueller matrix across the trans-verse section of a sample, being suitable for analyzing bio-logical and other intricate samples. The presented laboratoryexperiment will allow students to develop a deeperTable II. Polarimetric parameters of a linear polarizer oriented at 0/C14without and with the inverse-matrix correction.

APPENDIX A: ESTIMATION OF UNCERTAINTY FOR POLARIMETRIC PARAMETERS
In this section, we provide the equation to estimate the uncertainty of the diattenuation (D), polarizance (P), depolarization
(D), and angle of polarization ( h). The experimental uncertainty of these parameters depends on the uncertainty of the elements
of the Mueller matrix. We have quantiﬁed the experimental uncertainty of the polarimetric parameters using partial derivativesof the measurement with respect to each of the Mueller matrix elements as follows:

APPENDIX B: ORIENTATION ANGLES OF THE PSG
AND PSA SYSTEMS
We provide the angles of the polarization elements of both
the PSG and PSA systems with respect to their zero refer-
ence. Positive orientation angles are rotated clockwise.As mentioned in the manuscript, the polarization elements of
the PSG system depend on the polarization state of the illu-
mination source, distinguishing two main cases: (1) a ran-
domly polarized source and (2) a linearly polarized source.The orientation angles of the polarization elements for bothcases are given in Tables IIIandIV.

APPENDIX C: ELEMENTS LIST
Table Vreports the list of elements and their prices used
in the polarization-sensitive microscope. This list should be
seen as a reference list. Also, in Table VI, we provide a low-
cost alternative elements list for a horizontal optical setup.Alternative optical elements and components may be inter-changed without affecting the experimental results.However, cheaper optical elements and components, such asmanual rotary stages and low-cost polarizing elements, maylead to a polarization-sensitive microscope with reduced per-formance. For example, the performance of low-cost polariz-ing elements may differ from their theoretical expectation,introducing some experimental inaccuracies. Additionalinaccuracies may be introduced by replacing the motorizedrotational stages by manual rotational stages. These experi-
mental inaccuracies may be overlooked if the experimentaims for educational training.
Table Vreferences the elements used in our experiment.
Nevertheless, the experiment results do not depend on spe-ciﬁc elements. Consider that the less expensive the opticalelement is, the less ideal its behavior. In other words, it ispossible to experiment with cheaper QWPs and LPs, but theinstructor cannot expect perfect behavior. If the instructor isinterested in teaching purposes only, using less expensive ele-ments, such as manual rotary stages, is also recommended.
