The crane operator’s trick and other shenanigans with a
pendulum
Stephan Schlamminger, Leon Chao, Vincent Lee, David
B. Newell, and Clive C. Speake
90(3), p. 169
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006965Next time you want to control the oscillations of a pendu-
lum, you might want to call a crane operator for help: they
are experts in juggling swinging loads that are being trans-
ferred from one point to another. Using the Laplace trans-form formalism, this paper exposes their trick to damp the
load’s oscillations and shows how it can be applied to
improve metrological measurements of the gravitational con-stant. The paper can be useful in undergraduate mechanics
class or as an example of the use of Laplace transform for
system control, but you’ll also want to read it just to learnabout this example of physics in action. The link above will
also take the reader to the article’s video abstract, which
includes simulations that provide an excellent introduction to
the work.
Gravitational orbits and the Lambert problem
Ian R. Gatland
90(3), p. 177
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0060998The Lambert problem requires ﬁnding an orbit that passes
through two points in a speciﬁed time interval. It was posed
and solved by Lambert in the 18th century (long before it
was needed for spaceﬂight!), but the solution can still bechallenging for undergraduates. This paper presents an
insightful iterative method that could be presented in an
introductory mechanics course.
A new microscopic look into pressure fields and local
buoyancy
S. Meneses Jo ~ao, J. P. Santos Pires, and J. M. Viana
Parente Lopes
90(3), p. 179
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0060479Local pressure ﬁelds are integral to understanding buoy-
ancy, atmospheric phenomena, and other systems, but stan-
dard statistical mechanics approaches only derive the globalthermodynamic pressure from the microscopic description of
the system. In this article, the authors present a way to obtain
the local pressure ﬁeld as a derivative of the system’s parti-tion function using a soft-wall barometer potential. The
approach has both a formal mathematical description as well
as an intuitive physical explanation. Teachers of advancedundergraduate or graduate statistical mechanics may ﬁnd this
inspiring material for projects or problem sets.
Multivalued specific heat
Matheus G. Pacheco, Reinaldo de Melo e Souza, and
Daniela Szilard
90(3), p. 187
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006899Speciﬁc heats are usually assumed to be constant in ther-
modynamic processes for sake of simplicity. But becausethey are actually temperature dependent, they must also be
path dependent, and for processes that are tangent to an iso-
therm this creates difﬁculty because DQ/DT is not deﬁned; itis then necessary to invoke multivalued speciﬁc heat func-tions. This paper explores the conditions any path mustsatisfy in order to possess a single-valued speciﬁc heat. As a
bonus, the authors use thermodynamic concepts to prove a
geometric theorem regarding the areas of triangles and trape-zoids bounded by hyperbolas. Appropriate for undergraduatethermodynamics classes.
General formalism for calculating the thermal efficiency
of thermodynamic cycles defined in a p-Vdiagram
Viktor K €onye and J /C19ozsef Cserti
90(3), p. 194
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064010Calculating the efﬁciency of a thermal engine is often
tricky for students. Plus, it is not usually fun. This papershows that this is not inevitable. Starting from the parametri-zation of the engine’s cycle in the pressure-volume diagram,and knowing the ﬂuid’s equation of state, the authors show
that one can easily (numerically) calculate the amount of
heat given to or released by the system, and hence determinethe corresponding efﬁciency. They showcase their methodon cute-looking cycles, although it can also be applied topractical engines. Appropriate for undergraduate thermody-
namics classes.
Progressive quantum collapse
William J. Mullin, Asaad R. Sakhel, and Robert J. Ragan
90(3), p. 200
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0009255Instantaneous collapse of a wave function to one of its
eigenstates upon measurement is one of the distinguishing
features of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics. Most introductory quantum textbooks teach cal-culation techniques that rely upon this assumption of instan-taneous collapse, with unitary time evolution betweenmeasurements. This paper uses these standard techniques
for individual particles, but applies them to a coherent
many-body state that is measured one particle at a time.When calculated in this way, collapse of a many-body state

is a process rather than being instantaneous. But when the
many-body state is coherent, that collapse occurs veryquickly. This relatively simple exercise may help QuantumII students think more deeply about the concepts of collapse,and also about coherence in a many-body state.
Unexplored aspects of a variational principle in
electrostatics
Kolahal Bhattacharya and Debapriyo Syam
90(3), p. 207
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0060116Students who have been introduced to variational methods
in mechanics or optics could gain unexpected new insights
through the employment of this approach in an at-ﬁrst-sight-
unrelated domain. The authors show that the determinationof electrostatic ﬁeld lines occurs in a manner analogous toFermat’s principle in optics, and some properties of the vec-tor ﬁeld can be deduced directly from transformation proper-ties of the corresponding action integral.
Measuring the speed of light using optical feedback from
a picosecond diode laser
Abdulaziz M. Aljalal
90(3), p. 211
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0007144An accurate speed-of-light measurement is performed in
which the spatial distance between successive optical pulsesfrom a picosecond diode laser is measured. The pulses aregenerated at known time spacing of 12.5 ns. The requiredsetup occupies a space of only 2 m /C20.5 m, and it does not
implement either a fast detector or an oscilloscope. Thisexperiment is suitable for an undergraduate physics instruc-tional laboratory course or as an independent student project.
The “spring” Stirling engine
Alejandro Romanelli
90(3), p. 218
https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0007153Simpliﬁed analytic representations and physical models
can be helpful in understanding the physics of complex devi-ces and processes. This paper describes a “toy” Stirling cyclewhere a displacer connected to a spring oscillates inside anair-ﬁlled test tube where one end of the tube is closedand heated externally while the other is connected to a liq-
uid-ﬁlled U-tube. The displacer sweeps cold and heated airback-and-forth within the tube, with the work producedbeing used to move the liquid. Analysis of the systemdynamics predict a period on the order of 0.1 second.Readers are invited to work toward building an engine basedon this model.
Breakdown of the connection between symmetries and
conservation laws for semiholonomic systems
Nivaldo Lemos
90(3), p. 221
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0067183
Noether’s theorem provides a deep connection between
symmetries and conservation laws. A system’s invarianceunder time translations, spatial translations, or rotationsleads to the conservation of energy, linear momentum, andangular momentum, respectively. In this note, using a sim-ple system of a mass sliding inside of a hollow cylinder, theauthors illustrate that the connection between symmetriesand conservation laws is more subtle than one might expect.Here, students and instructors interested in classicalmechanics will ﬁnd an instructive example of Lagrangianmechanics, and those who are broadly interested in symme-tries and conservation laws will also ﬁnd this to be an engag-ing read.
Quantifying biomolecular diffusion with a “spherical
cow” model
Frederico Campos Freitas, Sandra Byju, Asem Hassan,
Ronaldo Junio de Oliveira, and Paul C. Whitford90(3), p. 225
https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0075952This paper in the Computational Physics section introdu-
ces the ideas needed to apply physics methods to study prob-lems in molecular biology. It then discusses how simplemodels and molecular dynamics simulations can be used tobetter understand protein folding.
