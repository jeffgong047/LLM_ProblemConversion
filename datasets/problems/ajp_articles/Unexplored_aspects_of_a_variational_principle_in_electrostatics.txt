The electrostatic ﬁeld magnitude can play a role in a variational principle similar to the role of the index
of refraction in geometrical optics, allowing the determination of electric ﬁeld lines. This was identiﬁed
in the context of the grounded conducting sphere image problem. Assuming the knowledge of themagnitude of the electric ﬁeld, in this paper, we validate this principle for the general case and explore
some of its consequences.

I. INTRODUCTION
A variational principle constitutes one of the most power-
ful methods of physical theories. The most popular of themis, of course, Hamilton’s principle of stationary action.1In
geometrical optics, one would use Fermat’s principle2that
asserts that light rays follow the path about which the opticalpath length is stationary. Many major results of geometrical
optics can be directly derived from this principle.
One of the methods of solving boundary value problems in
electrostatics is the method of images.3Its name is perhaps
due to the apparent similarity between the image formationby a plane mirror and the placement of an image charge in the
case of an inﬁnite grounded conducting plane. Though not
widely recognized, there is a deeper similarity even in othercases, for example, the grounded conducting sphere imageproblem.
4In this case, one ﬁnds analogues of the mirror
image and object distance relations as well as magniﬁcation
formulae. This observation led to the discovery of a varia-tional principle dÐ

AEd s¼0 in electrostatics5like Fermat’s
principle in geometrical optics, where AandBare two ﬁxed
points lying on the same electrostatic ﬁeld line. Here, it is
assumed that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is known as afunction of position. Due to the conservative nature of the
ﬁeld, the integralÐ
B
AE/C1dsbetween two ﬁxed points AandB
is stationary, irrespective of the curve. However, the proposedvariational principle leads to the curve between Aand B
superimposed with the local direction of the ﬁeld.
Though this principle was originally contemplated to
explain the analogy with virtual image formation in mirror-
optics, it can have important implications. For example,recently, it has been applied to demystify the nonlocalityproblem in the Aharonov–Bohm effect
6that has resolved a
fundamental paradox of quantum physics. Even in the classi-
cal domain, there are other yet unexplored illuminatingaspects of this principle that can shed light on the propertiesof electrostatic ﬁelds. We shall discuss some of these in this
paper. We shall start by giving a proof of the variational
principle in two dimensions in Sec. II. Furthermore, we shall
construct an electrostatic Lagrangian from this principle in
Sec. IIIand observe the results when the system is invariant
under spatial translation or rotation. Finally, we shall con-clude with an application of this principle to derive Green’sdifferential equation that relates the rate of change of the
electrostatic ﬁeld, in the direction perpendicular to an equi-
potential surface, to the principal radii of curvature of thesurface.II. PROOF OF dR

(IN TWO DIMENSIONS)
For pedagogical reasons, in this section, we shall ﬁrst obtain
the Euler–Lagrange equation in the two-dimensional space that iscompatible with the variational principle. Afterwards, the validity
of this equation will be demonstrated using an independent
approach. Let us assume that the electrostatic ﬁeld Eis conﬁned
to two dimensions (say, in the x–yplane). Then, the variational
principle between the ﬁxed points can be expressed as

Therefore, the task in hand is to prove that the left-hand side of
Eq.(2)indeed equals zero in a manner independent of the pro-
posed variational principle. Now, the electric ﬁeld vector Eis
related to the potential /byE¼/C0 r /. Let us represent the
ﬁeld line through the point ( x,y)b ywðx;yÞ¼k, which implies
thatrwis perpendicular to the ﬁeld lines directed along r/.

This result can also be obtained by drawing an electric ﬁeld
line on the x–yplane and noting that the gradient at any point

assuming continuity of the second partial derivatives for the
electrostatic potential and taking into account the expression
fordy=dxfrom Eq. (5). From Eqs. (6)–(8) , we ﬁnd that the
left-hand side of Eq. (2)indeed equals zero. Hence, the origi-
nal proposition is true when the points AandBlie on an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld line. A coordinate-free proof, on the other
hand, is given in Ref. 5.
III. AN ANALOGUE OF NEWTON’S SECOND LAW
The strong similarity of the proposed principle with Fermat’s
principle dÐB
And s¼0, where ndenotes the index of refraction,
calls for a careful comparison of the properties of the light rays
and those of the electric ﬁeld lines. In three dimensions, the light
ray path is speciﬁed by a differential equation, which is nothing
but the Euler–Lagrange equation from Fermat’s principle. Letus deﬁne a stepping parameter a, such that the position of a
point on a ray can be expressed as: r¼½xðaÞ;yðaÞ;zðaÞ/C138.A sa

Additionally, if we denote r
0¼dr=da, then the differential
equation of the light ray path can be expressed as:7

have jr0j¼jdr=dsj¼1, and Eq. (9)reduces to
rn¼d

ds/C18/C19
: (10)
Evidently, this is the standard form of the equation, which
can be derived from the eikonal equation in geometricaloptics.8In this context, we notice that a similar Euler–
Lagrange equation can be derived for the electrostatic ﬁelds,from dÐ

Thus, as far as the differential equations of light rays and of
the ﬁeld lines of the static ﬁelds are concerned, the scalarﬁelds nandEbehave in a similar manner. Now, both Eqs.
(10) and(11) are coupled nonlinear equations. If, however,
we choose the parameter ain Eq. (9), such that jdr=daj¼n,
then Eq. (9)reduces to a much simpler form, that resembles
Newton’s second law of motion:7

In a similar manner, if in electrostatics, the stepping parame-
terais chosen in such a way that

implying that jdr=daj¼E, then the spatial evolution of the
electric ﬁeld lines is governed by
d2r
da2¼rE2
2/C18/C19
: (14)
Following Ref. 7, one can identify the analogue of potential
energy as /C0E2=2, the analogue of mass as 1, and the ana-
logue of total energy as E¼ð 1=2Þjdr=daj2/C0E2=2¼0.
From Eq. (14), we can readily calculate the differential equa-
tion of the electric ﬁeld lines if the function E¼j r /jis
known and vice versa. For example, if we know that theelectric ﬁeld near a charged plate is constant, then Eq. (14)
asserts that the equation of the electric ﬁeld line isd
2r=da2¼0, i.e., ris linear in a. Hence, eliminating afrom
xðaÞ;yðaÞ, etc., we easily ﬁnd that the ﬁeld lines yðxÞ;zðxÞ,
etc., are nothing but straight lines. It is clear that this equa-tion can also be used to calculate the equations of the fring-ing ﬁeld lines if the electric ﬁeld magnitude is known. Forexample, one can deduce the shapes of the ﬁeld lines at the
edges of a parallel plate capacitor, from the information of
potential or ﬁeld. A general expression of the electric ﬁeldnear a conductor, dependent on local surface parameters wasderived in Ref. 9.

original conﬁguration. In fact, this can be accomplished in a
straightforward manner without an explicit reference toNoether’s theorem just by using the Euler–Lagrange equa-tions, when the symmetry information can be incorporatedinto the Lagrangian function. We shall demonstrate this forthe electrostatic systems using the following systems witheither (a) translation symmetry or (b) rotational symmetry. Letus ﬁrst note that the variational principle can be expressed as

since dx=da¼Ex, etc. This is consistent with our earlier dis-
cussion in Sec. III. There we deﬁned the analogue of the
kinetic energy as T¼ð1=2Þjdr=daj2¼E2=2 and the ana-
logue of the potential energy as /C0E2=2. Thus, the
Lagrangian is: T/C0V¼E2.A. Translation symmetry

using Eq. (19). If the electric ﬁeld vector lies in the x–zplane,
then the above result means that the tangential component ofthe ﬁeld vector has a constant value across the surface.
Clearly, this derivation, based on the Lagrangian formula-
tion of electrostatics, is consistent with the usual approach
that begins withÞ
E/C1dr¼0 and in which the line integral
is evaluated along a closed path that skims inﬁnitesimallyabove and below the boundary between two media.
B. Rotation symmetry
Suppose the electric ﬁeld has an axial symmetry. Let the z
axis be this symmetry axis. Then, the use of the cylindrical
polar coordinate system ðq;h;zÞis more convenient (as
shown in Fig. 1(b)). The symmetry about the z axis translates
to:E¼Eðq;zÞwhich is independent of h. The factor

The left-hand side of the above equation is the counterpart of
the Smith–Helmholtz function in optics. The preceding exer-cise shows that this function is an invariant in the axiallysymmetric system in electrostatics as well. Examples of suchsystems include dipoles, a thin charged wire, a charge placedin front of a grounded conducting sphere, etc. DifferentiatingEq.(23) with respect to a, we can obtain a general relation

V. APPLICATION TO PROVE GREEN’S
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
At every point on a smooth two dimensional surface, there
are two principal radii of curvature R1(larger) and R2
(smaller). The principal directions corresponding to these
radii are mutually orthogonal. So, at that point, the surfacenormal planes in the principal directions are perpendicular toeach other, and both are orthogonal to the local tangentplane. Now, Green’s differential equation (also known asThomson’s theorem) relates the normal derivative of electro-static ﬁeld Ein a charge free region near an equipotential
surface to the mean curvature j¼ð1=2Þð1=R

where dndenotes a differential length element in the direc-
tion of the outward normal at a point on the equipotentialsurface. This equation has been proved by manyauthors,
11–13often by lengthy approaches and differential
geometric techniques. Here, we present a simple proof of thetheorem using Eq. (11). Let us note that
r/C1E¼r/C1ð E^nÞ
¼rE/C1^nþEr/C1^n
¼dE
dn/C1^nþEð2jÞ; (26)
where we have used Eq. (11) in evaluating the ﬁrst term and
the deﬁnition j¼r/C1 ^n=2 (see, for example, Eq. (4.3.28) in
pp. 178 of Ref. 14). Just outside the equipotential, where
Laplace’s equation holds, we have r/C1E¼0. Therefore,
from Eq. (26), we have
dE
dn¼dE
dn/C1^n
¼/C02jE
¼/C01
R1þ1
R2/C18/C19
E: (27)
Thus, the fact that the mean curvature at a point on a surface
is given by j¼r/C1 ^n=2 leads to perhaps the simplest proof
of this equation. We can also say, that if at a pointr/C1E¼q=/C150, where qis the source charge density and /C150
denotes the permittivity of vacuum, the general relation will
be
dE
dnþ1
R1þ1
R2/C18/C19
E¼q
/C150: (28)
An example of the above relation can be found in the case of
a uniformly charged sphere of radius Rwith charge density
q¼3Q=4pR3. The electrostatic ﬁeld at a point rð<RÞis
given by E¼qr=3/C150. The normal direction is along the
radial direction ^r, which shows dE=dn/C17dE=dr. Again, the
equipotential surface at this point is a sphere of radius rand
has a mean curvature of j¼1=r. Note that, here,
R1¼R2¼r. Evaluating the sum on the left-hand side of Eq.
(28), we ﬁnd that the right-hand side equals q=/C150.
VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we explored some aspects of the variational
principle in electrostatics observed in Ref. 5in the context of
the method of images. Signiﬁcant new insights were gained
when we discovered that the spatial evolution of the electro-static ﬁeld lines could be expressed as an analogue of
Newton’s second law of motion. We also deduced a general
relation between the transverse coordinates of the electricﬁelds for an axially symmetric electrostatic system. Finally,
we showed that the equation of the electric ﬁeld lines can be
used to give a simple proof of Green’s differential equationin electrostatics. It is anticipated that the use of this principle
will lead to more interesting physical ideas in the future.
