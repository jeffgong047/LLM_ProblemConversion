The equivalence principle (EP) is at the heart of general relativity (GR), tested in many aspects. In
discussion, it is often referred to explaining qualitatively the inﬂuence of gravity on physicalphenomena, but is this qualitative approach supported by the theory? We compare clock rates,
frequency shifts, light deﬂection, and time delay in simple static spacetimes to the analogous
phenomena seen by accelerated observers in Minkowski space. In contrast to previous studies, we donot assume that the gravitational ﬁeld is weak and see, as we proceed, how the ﬁeld is constrained by
the EP. Special care is taken that results are only observer-, but not coordinate-dependent. By this, we
clarify some of the issues raised in the literature and show which gravitational effects can and whichcannot be simulated by acceleration. The paper may also serve as a starting point for discussions on the
implications of the EP.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is well known that Einstein’s “most fortunate thought of
his life”1that a body in free fall is weightless led him to the
idea that gravity is a geometrical property of space and time.
In his paper of 1911, “On the inﬂuence of gravity on the
propagation of light,”2Einstein postulated that a uniform
gravitational ﬁeld is equivalent with regard to all physical
processes to a system in uniform acceleration with respect to
an inertial frame. Later,3he referred to this as the
“equivalence hypothesis,” and it has become known as the
equivalence principle (see comment4). One ﬁnds a discus-
sion of the equivalence principle (EP) in almost all textbooks
on general relativity (GR); see, for example, the study byDwayne Hamilton.
5However, its exact formulation, inter-
pretation, and usefulness for understanding physical phe-
nomena in the presence of gravity is still under debate.6–10
Noteworthy is a very skeptical comment by Synge.11There
exist a number of different formulations of the principle andefforts to classify and relate them, see, for example, Di
Casola et al.
12and references therein. For an analysis of the
EP in quantum mechanics, see Giulini.13
The aim of the present paper is not to contribute to this debate
but to stick to Einstein’s original version of 1911 and discuss itsrole for understanding GR not only on a qualitative level butalso to explore some of its mathematical consequences. The EPis often used for a pedagogical introduction to GR. That relativerates of clocks are affected by gravity and the fact that gravityalso inﬂuences the propagation and the frequency of light can
be inferred qualitatively by making use of it. Einstein himself,
in the cited paper, applied the EP to derive the redshift formulaand to obtain an expression for the bending of light passing nearthe sun on the basis of Newtonian gravity. Here, we discusswhether these arguments can be made more precise by makingthe following assumptions:•Gravitation is described by a metric tensor theory. (We do
not require Einstein’s equations to hold, in general, except
when discussing local light bending where the
Schwarzschild spacetime is considered as an example.)
•Test particles, in our case clocks and detectors, movealong time-like geodesics and light rays along null geode-
sics. This assumes that all the internal degrees of freedom
as well as the self-gravitating ﬁeld can be neglected.
•In the absence of gravity, special relativity is valid.
We restrict our discussion to static gravitational ﬁelds and
discuss to which extent the inﬂuence of gravity on clocks
and light rays can be reproduced by going to an appropriateaccelerated, i.e., non-inertial, reference frame in the absence
of gravity. It is generally agreed that the EP can hold strictly
only locally, when tidal forces can be neglected (but see
comments on this issue by Ohanian14). Nevertheless, and in
contrast to most of the articles on the EP, we do not makeuse of a weak ﬁeld approximation, nor do we require, except
for light bending, conﬁnement to small regions of spacetime.
Rather, as we go along, we see how the gravitational ﬁeld
will be restricted in order to match the effects seen by an
accelerated observer in the absence of gravity. Not surpris-ingly, at the end it turns out that if the EP is to be valid with-
out restrictions, the Riemann tensor of spacetime has to
vanish and the gravitational ﬁeld is spurious.
Although most of the calculations presented are elemen-
tary, we make use of differential geometry and assume
spacetime to have a Riemannian structure. The main draw-back in most of the publications dealing with the EP is that
arguments rely on speciﬁc coordinates. Here, we take care
that results are only observer-, but not coordinate-
dependent. This presentation clariﬁes some of the issues
raised in previous papers and also gives a new perspective
that might be useful when addressing the EP and its
consequences.

The paper is organized as follows: For the discussed phe-
nomena, we ﬁrst repeat the qualitative argument before turn-ing to its mathematical formulation. In Sec. II, we start by
comparing non-inertial clocks to an inertial clock at encoun-ter. Speciﬁcally, in a static gravitational ﬁeld (metric), weconsider a freely falling clock passing two stationary clocksand compare their rates, Fig. 1. By virtue of the EP, the sta-
tionary clocks are replaced by accelerated clocks inMinkowski space and their rates compared to an inertialclock. (A similar “operational” approach was followed byAnderson and Gautreau.
15) We discuss if and how it is possi-
ble to reproduce the relative rates under the inﬂuence of
gravity by suitable acceleration in Minkowski space. (Armsand Serna16proposed an experiment along this line.) Since
we want to mimic the effect of a static gravitational ﬁeld, thecorresponding acceleration should be uniform, that is, con-stant in proper time in the rest frame of the observer, but notnecessarily equal for all observers. Two cases are discussed:rigid motion, where spatial distances in the momentary restframe stay constant and, alternatively, clocks that undergoequal acceleration. Before turning to the frequency shift oflight rays propagating in a static ﬁeld in Sec. III, we summa-
rize results and make comments on the restrictions imposedon the gravitational ﬁeld in order to match the effects seenby accelerated observers. Especially, we argue that the ratioof static clock rates even in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld can-not be reproduced in Minkowski space.
In contrast to time dilation, the Doppler shift for light is of
ﬁrst order in the relative velocities, and it is interesting to seehow this compares to the gravitational frequency shift.Again, we discuss this for both cases, rigid and equalacceleration.
Section IVis devoted to light bending. Here, we consider
the picture of Einstein’s famous elevator, not freely falling,
but at rest in a static gravitational ﬁeld and compare the
results with a uniformly accelerated cabin without gravity.By local, we mean that we do not integrate the orbit of theray but rather look at the bending of the ray at a given point.More precisely, we calculate the curvature of the projectionof the ray onto the subspace orthogonal to a static observer.We show that the spatial curvature of the ray is equal to theacceleration that a static observer feels at that point. Usingthe same acceleration for the cabin in Minkowski space, onecannot expect to reproduce the whole orbit; however, onedoes obtain the same local curvature of the ray as seen by anaccelerated observer. This holds true for the rigid as well asfor the equally accelerated cabin. A number of papers have
considered the role of the EP for derivation of the light
deﬂection.
9,10One of the issues discussed is to disentangle
the contribution of the static acceleration from that due tothe curvature of three-space. Without any approximation,
our calculation for the Schwarzschild spacetime shows that
there is a contribution from the space curvature even to thelocal bending.
At the same time, the spatial curvature gives a contribu-
tion to the acceleration of static observers. However, both
contributions are such that the above statement remains true.Thus, the local bending does depend on the curvature of
three-space, but so does the static acceleration. In this sense,
the local bending can be deduced from the EP and, aspointed out by Ehlers and Rindler,
17is a purely kinematic
effect. Finally, in Sec. V, we touch upon the question
whether the time delay experienced by a light ray in the pres-ence of a gravitational ﬁeld, the Shapiro effect,
18has its
counterpart in Minkowski space. For the sake of simplicity,
we consider a radial ray bouncing back from a mirror locateddeeper in the gravitational potential and show that a similar(but not equal) effect can be seen by an accelerated observer
in Minkowski space.
II. RELATIVE CLOCK RATES
In a general, spacetime considers a geodesically moving
clock C intersecting the trajectories (worldlines) of two
non-inertial clocks A and B. Let u
A,uB,a n d uCbe their
corresponding four velocities. We deﬁne the scalar productof four vectors by ðu/C1wÞ¼u
agabwb,w h e r e gabis the
spacetime metric and we use the signature ð /C0þþ þ Þ .
The scalar products of the four velocities of A and B at theencounter with clock C are related to their corresponding
relative velocities by the c-factor, which in standard
local Minkowski coordinates is cðvÞ¼ð 1/C0v
2=c2Þ/C01=2
(from now on, we set c¼1, which implies that time is mea-
sured in units of length; 300 000 km corresponding to
approximatively 1 s),
ðuA/C1uCÞ¼/C0 cA;C;ðuB/C1uCÞ¼/C0 cB;C: (1)
Here and in the following, the scalar products of the four
velocities are to be evaluated at the crossing of the world-
lines. An observer associated with clock C with proper time
sCsees clock A running at reduced rate (time dilation)
according to the following:
dsA¼cA;CdsC¼/C0 ð uA/C1uCÞdsC; (2)
and similarly for B with respect to C. Taking the rate of C as
reference, the ratio between the rates of A and B is given by
dsA
dsB¼cA;C
cB;C¼ðuA/C1uCÞ
ðuB/C1uCÞ: (3)
(Note that this is not to be understood as a differential but as
the ratio of the rates as seen by an observer moving with
clock C.) This operational procedure of assigning relative
clock rates for clocks at different points in spacetime maylook ad hoc at ﬁrst sight. However, for the special gravita-
tional setting we have in mind, we show that this relation is
independent of the speciﬁc geodesic of C.
Fig. 1. Falling clock, the rates of two static clocks, A and B, are compared
to the rate of a freely falling clock C (l.h.s.). Analogous, the accelerated
clocks A and B in Minkowski space pass by an inertial clock C where rates
are compared (r.h.s.).
539 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Peter C. Aichelburg 539 04 October 2023 23:12:49
More speciﬁcally, we look at the situation of a freely fall-
ing clock C in a static spacetime passing two stationary
clocks A and B situated at different heights (see Fig. 2). For
simplicity, we restrict spacetime to 1 þ1 dimensions and
write the metric as follows:
ds2¼/C0fðrÞdt2þhðrÞdr2; (4)
where f(r) and h(r) are the arbitrary positive functions of the
coordinate r, except that we require f0ðrÞ>0, so that the
freely falling clock moves along the negative r-direction
(note that any spherically symmetric static metric in fourspacetime dimensions can be written in this form when
restricted to the radial direction, see, e.g., Ref. 19).
The clocks A and B are at rest, say at r
AandrB, and we
calculate the scalar products ðuA/C1uCÞandðuB/C1uCÞatrAand
rB, respectively.
Using proper time along the trajectories tðsÞand rðsÞ
implies
ðu/C1uÞ¼/C0 fðrÞ_t2þhðrÞ_r2¼/C01; (5)
where the dot means differentiation with respect to proper
time. Note that because of the signature of the metric, propertime sis related to spacetime distances by ds
2¼/C0ds2=c2,
butc¼1 here. The four velocities (we use the term “four
velocity” although here we restrict to 1 þ1 dimensions) of
the static clocks as depicted on the left in Fig. 2are
uA;B¼f/C01=2ðrA;BÞ
0 !
: (6)
The freely falling clock C moves along a geodesic. Time
independence of the metric implies that the scalar product of
uCwith the (Killing) vector ﬁeld n, where na¼da
t, is con-
stant along the geodesic (see the Appendix ). Writing
ua
C¼_tda
tþ_rda
r,
ðn/C1uCÞ¼/C0 f_t¼/C0/C15¼const :; (7)
where /C15determines from where C starts to fall. Making use of
(5)and(7)the four velocity of uCcan be written as follows:uC¼_t
_r/C18/C19
¼/C15f/C01
ð/C152f/C01/C01Þ=h/C2/C31=2 !
: (8)
Now suppose that clock C starts to fall from the place
r¼rC>rA>rB. We calculate the scalar product between
the four velocities uCwithuAwhen C reaches A,
ðuA/C1uCÞjrA¼/C0/C15f/C01=2ðrAÞ; (9)
and similarly for C with B and making use of (3), to give
ðuB/C1uCÞjrB

fðrBÞ/C18/C191=2
¼dsA
dsB/C12/C12/C12/C12
G; (10)
where the subscript G refers to gravity while M will be used
for the corresponding expression in Minkowski space. Thus,
the ratio of the clock rates between A and B can be deter-mined from the knowledge of the relative velocities with
respect to C at encounter. Although the velocities depend on
the height from which C starts to fall, the ratio of the clockrate is independent. This independence can be understood by
a simple geometrical argument that is given in the Appendix ,
which is based on the fact that spacetime is static.
Now, we consider clocks in Minkowski spacetime. The
freely falling clock C becomes a clock in uniform motion
and for simplicity one may choose a system where C is at
rest, while A and B undergo accelerations (right hand side ofFig.2). Then, applying (2)one has

M¼ð1/C0v2

AÞ1=2: (11)
To reproduce the gravitational result for a general metric (4),
we just need to arrange the velocities of A and B in such away that, at encounter with clock C, the relation (10) is
satisﬁed.
A. Constant acceleration
So far we have only trivially adjusted the velocities of A
and B at encounter with C, but not speciﬁed the acceleration
Fig. 2. Clocks in spacetime, static clocks A and B in gravity in comparison with accelerated clocks in Minkowski space. C is an inertial reference clock in both
cases.

of how to achieve this. In the gravitational setting, the clocks
A and B sit at ﬁxed positions in the static ﬁeld and experi-
ence a constant gravitational force. For a particle in
Minkowski space with acceleration parallel to its velocity,the relation between the proper acceleration aand the three

Ifais constant, setting a¼ac2(but remember that we have
chosen c¼1), one may integrate (12) in 1þ1 dimensions,
leading to hyperbolic motion (we use coordinates tandxin
Minkowski space) to give
ðxðtÞ/C0kÞ2/C0t2¼1
a2; (13)
where kis an integration constant and thas been chosen so
that the velocity is zero for t¼0. This implies that
k¼xð0Þ/C01=a. From (13), we see that the velocity can be
written as follows:
v¼dx
dt¼t
x/C0k¼ðx/C0kÞ/C01ðx/C0kÞ2/C01
a2/C18/C191=2
;(14)
and, thus,
ð1/C0v2Þ¼a/C02ðx/C0kÞ/C02: (15)
We now assume clocks A and B to move with constant
proper accelerations along the trajectories xAðtÞandxBðtÞas
follows:
ðxAðtÞ/C0kAÞ2/C0t2¼1
aA2; (16)
and correspondingly for B. We assume that both clocks start
to accelerate at the same time with respect to the inertial clock
C (this can always be achieved if the spacetime distance of
their starting points is spacelike). In order that the trajectoriesdo not cross, we choose k
A>kBand xAð0Þ>xBð0Þ.T h e
clock rates of A and B are compared to the rate of the inertial
clock C at xC>xAð0Þwhen they meet, i.e., xAðtÞ¼xCand
xBðtÞ¼xC. From (15), we see that the ratio of the proper
times of A and B at the location of C is given by
dsA
dsB/C12/C12/C12/C12
xC¼1/C0v2
AðxCÞ
1/C0v2
BðxCÞ !1=2
¼aBðxC/C0kBÞ
aAðxC/C0kAÞ: (17)
Thus, the ratio of the clock rates depends in general on the
location of clock C. When both accelerations are equal i.e.,setting a¼a
A¼aB, the ratio is
dsA
dsB/C12/C12/C12/C12
xC¼xC/C0kB
xC/C0kA: (18)
If clock A starts to accelerate from the location of clock C,
i.e.,xAðt¼0Þ¼xC, then inserting for xC/C0kAfrom (16) at
t¼0,(18)reduces to
dsA
dsB/C12/C12/C12/C12
xC¼aðxC/C0kBÞ¼1þða=c2ÞDl; (19)where

where we have explicitly displayed the velocity of light c.I n
this special case, the result is the same as the one for clockslocated at a height difference Dlin a weak gravitational ﬁeld
of acceleration a.
Fora
Adifferent from aB, the ratio of the clock rates will
only be independent of the location of the reference clock C,according to (17),i fk
A¼kB. Then, from (17)it follows that
dsA
dsB/C12/C12/C12/C12
M¼aB
aA; (21)
similarly to the gravitational case where the ratio is indepen-
dent of the height from which clock C starts to fall. Giventwo clocks resting at different heights in a static gravitationalﬁeld (1 þ1 dimensions), there always exist two uniformly
accelerated clocks in Minkowski space so that the ratio oftheir proper times read off when passing the same, but arbi-trary point in space equals the proper time ratio of corre-sponding stationary clocks in the gravitational ﬁeld.
B. Rigid motion
In our example of the two static clocks, it is tacitly
assumed that the distance between the clocks remains con-stant, but as is well known, spatial distances in relativity areobserver-dependent. So what does it mean that a body is inrigid motion? For special relativity, the answer was alreadygiven by Born
21in 1909 and shortly after generalized by
Herglotz22and Noether.23The Born deﬁnition, which also
carries over to general relativity, says that rigid motionimplies that the distance of neighboring particles measuredin the momentary rest frame remains constant (see Ref. 24
and also Refs. 25and26in the context of Minkowski space
and references therein). We give the mathematical formula-tion of this in the Appendix . It is clear that clocks resting in a
static gravitational ﬁeld are in rigid motion. In Minkowskispace, any motion that is a symmetry is a rigid motion,among them constant rectilinear acceleration.
20In the con-
sidered case, only if kA¼kBthe two clocks are in rigid
motion with respect to each other and they keep a constantproper distance separation, but note that rigid motion impliesthat A and B have to undergo constant but differentaccelerations.
C. Equivalence principle
Let us see what this means for the EP as Einstein formu-
lated it. Einstein had in mind a uniform ﬁeld, i.e., a staticﬁeld where the acceleration (force) is everywhere the same.In GR, the four-acceleration of a body is measured by itsdeviation from the geodesic motion. For a static clock in thegravitational ﬁeld (4), the absolute value of its 4-acceleration
ais given by the following expression [we give an explicit
derivation in the Appendix (A8) :

The situation in Minkowski space for equally accelerated
clocks, aA¼aB¼g, has already been considered, leading to
(18) and in the special case to (19). One sees that (25) agrees
only to ﬁrst order in gDl, where Dlis the proper distance
between the clocks in both cases. This is somewhat surpris-
ing: The ratio of the rates of two clocks resting at differentheights in a static gravitational ﬁeld of constant acceleration
cannot be simulated by clocks with constant and equal accel-
eration in Minkowski space. This contradicts Einstein’s for-mulation that a uniform gravitational ﬁeld is equivalent in
regard to all physical processes to a system in uniform accel-
eration, but at the time, Einstein had in mind the uniformﬁeld in Newtonian gravity. One may question whether the
generalization of Newton’s uniform gravitational ﬁeld (24)
is not too special. If one considers a general f(r), then in
order to reproduce the gravitational result with accelerated
clocks in Minkowski space, we have to require

that is, the accelerations aAandaBare related to the gravita-
tional potential and not to its gradient, and will not be equalto the gravitational acceleration as given by (22). If we use
these accelerations in the expression for the clock rates in
Minkowski space, then

Enforcing this to be equal to (26)leads to the condition

Since this should be valid for arbitrarily chosen rAandrB,w e
have

which integrates to
fðrÞ¼br/C0C
2/C18/C192
; (30)
where Cis an integration constant. Thus, if we require
that the accelerations of A and B are equivalent to the accel-
eration that the corresponding clocks experience in thestatic ﬁeld, then the gravitational ﬁeld is restricted to (30).
Calculating the curvature tensor for this metric shows that it is
identically zero, which implies that spacetime is ﬂat but
expressed in accelerated coordinates (Rindler20). This is not
unexpected since tidal forces prevent accelerated clocks in
Minkowski space from mimicking the gravitational effects
exactly. Moreover, as shown, even the effect of a gravitational
ﬁeld of everywhere equal magnitude cannot be simulated by
equally accelerated clocks. Also, if one tries to generalize theconcept of a uniform ﬁeld to four-dimensions, the only vacuum
solution to Einstein’s equations is ﬂat spacetime.
27Thus, no ana-
log to Newton’s uniform ﬁeld in GR exists.
III. FREQUENCY SHIFT
Already in 1907, Einstein wrote “There exist ‘clocks’…,
whose rates can be controlled with great precision, these areproducers of spectral lines” and concluded that the wave-
length of light coming from the sun’s surface should be
“larger by about one part in two millions.”
28(For recent
experimental veriﬁcation of the gravitational redshift, see
Ref. 29and references therein.) In this respect, frequency is
directly related to the inverse of proper time and the results
of Sec. IIcarry over. Nevertheless, let us see how the EP can
be applied directly to light rays. First, we give the qualitativeargument: Consider now two detectors A and B (instead of
clocks) vertically mounted in a static gravitational ﬁeld. A
light ray is sent vertically past them where the frequency ismeasured. Invoking the EP in the gravity-free case, the
detectors are accelerated. Therefore, the detectors will have
different velocities as the ray passes and, due to the Doppler
shift, register different frequencies. In the gravity setting
given by the metric (4), the detectors rest in the static ﬁeld
and the light ray follows a geodesic. Therefore, the geomet-
ric arguments given for clocks in the Appendix also apply to
light rays [compare to (10)] and give
xB
xA/C12/C12/C12/C12
G¼ðu/C1lÞB
ðu/C1lÞA¼fðrAÞ
fðrBÞ/C18/C191=2
; (31)
where xAandxBare the measured frequencies, lis the tan-
gent null vector along the ray, and the scalar product is to be
evaluated at rAandrB, respectively. As expected, this is the
inverse ratio as for clocks rates.
How is this mapped into Minkowski spacetime? In
Minkowski space, the relativistic Doppler shift is given by
/C22x¼x01þv
1/C0v/C18/C191=2
; (32)
where /C22xis the frequency measured by an observer moving
with velocity vtoward the emitter of proper frequency x0.
We need to know the velocities of the detectors when the raypasses. As for the clocks, we consider the two detectors to be
rigidly accelerated, while the light ray travels along a straight
worldline. The trajectory of constant acceleration is againgiven by (13)and from (14), we ﬁnd for k¼0,
1þv
1/C0v¼xþt
x/C0t: (33)
Consider a light ray propagating toward the accelerated
detector whose trajectory is given by x¼x0/C0t, where
542 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Peter C. Aichelburg 542 04 October 2023 23:12:49
x0>1=a. When the ray reaches the detector, the correspond-
ing coordinates ðx;tÞagree, and from (13)we get
ðx/C0tÞ/C01¼ðxþtÞa2¼x0a2; (34)
and, therefore,
1þv
1/C0v¼ðx0aÞ2: (35)
If we apply this to the two detectors in the case kA¼kB(one
may set both k’s to zero by a simple translation in x-direc-
tion), then we get
xB
xA/C12/C12/C12/C12
M¼x0aB
x0aA; (36)
which is independent of the trajectory of the ray and is the
inverse of the corresponding clock rates. This shows that inorder to reproduce the gravitational frequency, shift thedetectors to be in relative rigid motion; however, as dis-cussed in Sec. II C, the required acceleration in Minkowski
space will not agree with the acceleration (force) of the staticdetectors.
IV. LOCAL BENDING OF LIGHT RAYS
The total deﬂection of a light ray passing close to a mas-
sive star is, of course, a non-local effect and the EP can
hardly be valid, but instead of considering the total deﬂec-
tion, one can look at the “local” bending. The idea is to cal-culate the curvature of the spatial orbit of the ray at a givenpoint and compare it with bending in ﬂat spacetime as seenby an accelerated observer. By orbit in this context, we meanthe space and not the spacetime trajectory (worldline).Geometrically, this means that the wordline of the ray isprojected onto the hyperplanes of ﬁxed (Killing) time (seeFig.3).
Let us repeat the qualitative argument that can be found in
many textbooks on GR: Without gravity, consider an accel-erated cabin with a light ray penetrating horizontally fromone side (Fig. 4). During the time the light ray takes to reach
the opposite wall, the cabin has moved, causing the ray notto hit exactly the opposite point. If the cabin is accelerated,then the ray will deviate from a straight line as viewed fromthe cabin. Applying the EP, the same light bending should
occur in a cabin resting in a (static) gravitational ﬁeld. [For aspacetime picture see (Fig. 5)].
We start by considering this effect in Minkowski space.
For this, we need two space directions; thus, we consider an
accelerated cabin in spacetime of 1 þ2 dimensions with
coordinates ðt;x;zÞ:
ds
2¼/C0dt2þdx2þdz2: (37)
Now the question arises: How should the cabin be acceler-
ated? As before, we assume constant acceleration, but since
the cabin is an extended object, rigid motion is the natural
requirement (but see comment at the end of Sec. A.).
A. Accelerated cabin
The cabin should undergo rigid acceleration in the z-direction.
Different cross sections of the cabin trace out a one-parameter
congruence of two-dimensional surfaces in spacetime (in 1 þ2
dimensions), parametrized by a,
zðt;aÞ2/C0t2¼1=a2;xðt;aÞ¼const : (38)
Points of equal z-coordinate experience the same accelera-
tion, while the acceleration varies from point to point in thez-direction. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the
Fig. 3. Geometry of light bending by gravity the ﬁgure shows schematically
a light ray in curved spacetime passing near a star. The projection of the ray
onto a surface orthogonal to the static observers traces out a spatial orbit.
Fig. 4. Light bending by gravity and as seen by an accelerated observer inMinkowski space (dashed curve on the right).
Fig. 5. Light bending for accelerated observers, the ﬁgure shows two crosssections of an accelerated cabin in Minkowski space. A light ray in x-direc-
tion entering at z
0stays in the plane z¼z0, while ending up in a different
cross section from the one in which it started.
543 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Peter C. Aichelburg 543 04 October 2023 23:12:49
light ray enters at the instant when the cabin is momentarily
at rest, traveling along the positive x-direction, i.e., t¼0
with xð0Þ¼0;zð0Þ¼z0, so that
x¼t;z¼z0: (39)
We introduce new coordinates ( T,X,Z) so that Zis constant
along the accelerated trajectories (one could also transformto a Rindler co-moving time coordinate,20which would lead
to the same local bending),
T¼t;X¼x;Z2¼z2/C0t2: (40)
Then, the light ray in the new coordinates is given by
Z2¼z2
0/C0T2;X¼T: (41)
Thus,
Z¼ðz2
0/C0X2Þ1=2; (42)
and the local bending turns out to be
d2Z
dX2¼/C0z2
0ðz2
0/C0X2Þ/C03=2: (43)
AtX¼0, where the ray enters the cabin orthogonal to the
acceleration we have
d2Z
dX2/C12/C12/C12/C12
X¼0¼/C01=z0¼/C0a0; (44)
where a0is the proper acceleration of the cabin at the point
z0. Transforming the metric (37) to the co-moving coordi-
nates T,X, and Zleads to
ds2¼/C0dT2þdX2þðTdTþZdZÞ2
T2þZ2: (45)
Since for T¼0 the spatial metric is ﬂat, we may calculate
the ﬁrst curvature jof the curve Z(X) making use of the stan-
dard formula (for consistency in later application we take asdeﬁnition for jthe absolute value of the second derivative
along the curve),
j¼d2Z
dX2/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C121þdZ
dX/C18/C192 !/C03=2
; (46)
evaluated at X¼0 gives (44). This shows that an accelerated
observer in Minkowski space will measure the curvature of alight ray to be equal to its acceleration (in units where c¼1).
Calculations where all points of the cabin undergo accelera-tions of the same magnitude follow along the same line lead-ing to the same curvature (left as an exercise to the reader).This is not surprising since the difference between rigid andequal accelerations is expected to show up only in non-localeffects.
B. Bending by gravity
Now, we look at the local bending of light in a gravita-
tional ﬁeld. Consider the static metric in 2 þ1 dimensions of
the formds
2¼/C0fðzÞdt2þdx2þdz2: (47)
For the trajectory of a light ray, the tangent vector is null,
/C0fðzÞ_t2þ_x2þ_z2¼0; (48)
where the dot now denotes the derivative with respect to an
afﬁne parameter along the ray. Note that the ray tracing fol-lows indeed from the Lagrangian
1
2ðfðzÞ_t2/C0_x2/C0_z2Þ. Then,
thetandxindependence leads to
fðzÞ_t¼C1; _x¼C2; (49)
where C1andC2are the integration constants. Inserting this
into(48)gives
fðzÞð_z2þC2
2Þ¼C2
1: (50)
Since xdepends linearly on the afﬁne parameter, we may
write
_z¼dz
dx_x¼dz
dxC2 (51)
to get z(x),
fðzÞdz
dx/C18/C192
þ1 !
¼C1
C2/C18/C192
: (52)
If we choose as initial conditions ðdz=dxÞ¼0a tz¼z0, i.e.,
the ray enters the cabin at z0in the positive x-direction,
orthogonal to the acceleration of gravity, then
C1
C2/C18/C192
¼fðz0Þ (53)
and
dz
dx¼fðz0Þ
fðzÞ/C01/C18/C191=2
: (54)
The second derivative of zwith respect to xgives the local
bending of the ray,
d2z
dx2¼/C0fðz0Þ
2fðzÞ2df
dz: (55)
Since the spatial slices of the metric (47) are ﬂat, the curva-
turejof the orbit is simply given by the absolute value of
the above expression evaluated at z¼z0,
jjz0¼1
2fðzÞdf
dz/C12/C12/C12/C12
z0: (56)
This in turn is equal to the four acceleration of a static
observer (13),a tz¼z0. How does this compare with the
local bending of a light ray seen by a uniformly acceleratedobserver in Minkowski space? As shown, at the point wherethe direction of the ray is orthogonal to the acceleration ofthe cabin, the resulting curvature of the ray is equal to theacceleration (divided by c
2) and is therefore equal to the
bending by the gravitational ﬁeld.

C. Local bending in the Schwarzschild spacetime
Now, we turn to a more physical spacetime: the gravita-
tional ﬁeld produced by a spherically symmetric mass, the
famous Schwarzschild metric,
ds2¼/C0Adt2þA/C01dr2þr2d/2;A¼1/C02GM=r:
(57)
The acceleration of a static observer can again be obtained
from (22), yielding
jaj¼1
2A0A/C01=2¼GM
r2A/C01=2: (58)
The analysis of the propagation of a light ray in the metric
(57) may be found in any textbook on GR (see, e.g., Ref.
26). The spatial orbit rð/Þsatisﬁes
d2r
d/2¼2
rdr
d//C18/C192
þr/C03GM: (59)
If the EP is valid, there should be a relation between the
acceleration experienced by a static observer and the bending
of the ray. As before, we look at the bending where
ðdr=d/Þjr0¼0 and the ray trajectory is orthogonal to the
gravitational acceleration, i.e., at perihelion. Then
d2r
d/2/C12/C12/C12/C12
r0¼r0/C03GM: (60)
Although the coordinates rand/have a geometrical meaning,
one would like to have a coordinate invariant expression for
the curvature. Since the two-dimensional subspace t¼const :
of the metric is not ﬂat, we cannot simply apply the formula of
Euclidean space. Following Eisenhart,30the curvature of a
curve in Riemannian space is given by its principal normal as
follows:
ki¼tjDjti; (61)
where tis tangent to the curve and the covariant derivative D
in our case refers to the induced metric on t¼const :slices
of(57)(see(63)below).
The curvature jofrð/Þis given by the absolute value of
ki[indices refer to ðr;/Þ],
j¼jkj¼jgijkikjj1=2: (62)
Given the spatial metric
dl2¼A/C01dr2þr2d/2; (63)
we consider ﬁrst an arbitrary orbit r(l),/ðlÞ, parametrized by
the arclength of the curve l, therefore,
1¼A/C01r02þr2/02; (64)
with a prime denoting the derivative with respect to l.
Calculating the curvature of the orbit according to (61) at the
point where r0¼0 results in the following:
krj0¼r00
0/C0A0r0/0
02k/j0¼/00
0: (65)(For details see the Appendix .) From (64), we infer that, at
r0,ð/0Þ0¼1=r0, and after differentiation that /00
0¼0.
Taking the absolute value of kgives
jj0¼A/C01=2ðjr00/C0A=rjÞj0: (66)
Now we consider the spatial orbit of a light ray, i.e., its pro-
jection onto a t¼const :surface. To make use of (66),w e
need to translate the derivatives with respect to /into those
with respect to l,
dr
d/¼dr
dl/C1dl
d/¼r0=/0; (67)
which yields
d2r
d/2¼1
ð/0Þ2r00/C0r0
/0/00/C18/C19
: (68)
Evaluating at r0¼0,
d2r
d/2/C12/C12/C12/C12
0¼r00
ð/0Þ2/C12/C12/C12/C12
0¼r00r2j0: (69)
Substituting for r00in(66) from (69) and making use of (60),
we ﬁnd
jj0¼GM
r2A/C01=2j0; (70)
and the value agrees with (58). We conclude that the curva-
ture of the spatial orbit of a light ray in the considered static
gravitational ﬁeld (here speciﬁcally in the Schwarzschild
spacetime) is equal to the acceleration of a static observer atthat point. As shown for the accelerated cabin, a light ray inMinkowski space will show the same curvature as seen by
an observer subjected to the equivalent acceleration as the
static observer. In this sense, the EP is conﬁrmed withoutassuming the gravitational ﬁeld to be weak. Note that, to ﬁrst
order in GM/r, Eq. (70)is just the Newtonian value.
It has been argued that the EP contributes only one half to
the total deﬂection of the ray, and the other half comingfrom the space curvature. The authors
9,10tried to disentangle
these two effects. However, our derivation for the
Schwarzschild metric shows that even for local light bend-ing, the space curvature plays a role, an effect which, how-
ever, does not contribute in the weak ﬁeld approximation. It
may be veriﬁed that modifying the Schwarzschild metric tohave ﬂat space slices, would lead to an additional factor A
1=2
in(70), but then, the acceleration of a static observer changes
accordingly. Thus, the above statement about the equiva-lence of the local light bending in a static ﬁeld and the corre-
sponding accelerated observer remains valid.
V. TIME DELAY AND THE EP
Consider the metric for a general spherically symmetric
and static gravitational ﬁeld,
ds
2¼/C0fðrÞdt2þhðrÞdr2þr2dX2: (71)
To simplify, we look only at a radial light ray starting at
r¼r2to be reﬂected at r1<r2and back to r2and calculate
545 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 7, July 2022 Peter C. Aichelburg 545 04 October 2023 23:12:49
the proper travel time as measured by an observer at r2(see
Fig.6).
From ds2¼0, we have
dr
dt¼6hðrÞ
fðrÞ/C18/C19/C01=2
: (72)
The elapsed coordinate time for the ray from r1tor2is
Dt¼ðr2
r1hðrÞ
fðrÞ/C18/C191=2
dr; (73)
while the proper time at r2is given by
Ds¼fðr2Þ1=2Dt¼fðr2Þ1=2ðr2
r1hðrÞ
fðrÞ/C18/C191=2
dr: (74)
If, as in Sec. II, we assume that f0>0, then
Ds>ðr2
r1hðrÞ1=2dr¼Dl; (75)
but the integral is just the proper (physical) distance Dl
between r1andr2; therefore, ðcÞDs>Dl. (where the velocity
of light was introduced for clarity). A ray in the opposite direc-tion will take the same time, and the total time for the bounc-
ing ray is twice this value. Without gravity, fðrÞ¼hðrÞ¼1,
we simply have Ds¼Dl. Thus, for the static observer, the
bouncing ray will take longer proper time for the same distancein a gravitational ﬁeld than in ﬂat spacetime.
What does this have to do with the EP? If we set fðrÞ¼r
2
and hðrÞ¼1, the metric resembles ﬂat space in Rindler
coordinates.20This means that the observer and mirror with
r¼const :are in uniform acceleration in Minkowski space.
They are in rigid motion and thus keep constant distant toeach other. Explicitly, we have
Ds¼r
2lnðr2=r1Þ>r2/C0r1¼Dl (76)
(c¼1), which shows that there is a time delay of signals for
rigid accelerated observers in Minkowski space. However,the magnitude of the time delay will not coincide with theone in gravity. As argued, the acceleration cannot mimic the
changes of the gravitational ﬁeld along the path of the ray.VI. CONCLUSION
We have analyzed whether the effects of gravity on clock
rates and the propagation of light rays can be reproduced inMinkowski spacetime as seen by suitably accelerated observ-
ers. We assumed that gravity is described by a spacetime
metric and restricted ourselves to static spacetimes.Moreover, freely falling clocks and light rays were assumed
to follow geodesics of the given metric. No assumptions
were made about the gravitational strength; i.e., we did notrequire the ﬁeld to be weak nor did we consider theNewtonian limit. The main results can be summarized as fol-
lows: (i) Given two clocks resting at different heights in a
static gravitational ﬁeld (1 þ1 dimensions), there always
exist two uniformly accelerated clocks in Minkowski space
so that the ratio of their proper times read off when passing
the same but an arbitrary point in space, equals the propertime ratio of corresponding stationary clocks. If in additionone imposes that the accelerations are equivalent to the
acceleration that the static clocks experience, then this
restricts spacetime to be ﬂat. (ii) The ratio of the rates of twoclocks resting at different heights in a static gravitationalﬁeld of constant acceleration cannot be simulated by con-
stant and equally accelerated clocks in Minkowski space.
(iii) Local light bending in static spherically symmetricspacetimes can be simulated by accelerated observers in
Minkowski space despite the fact that the bending depends
(also) on the curvature of the spatial subspace. This holdsalso for strong gravitational ﬁelds. (iv) The effect of timedelay of light rays also exists for rigidly accelerated observ-
ers in Minkowski space, but this covers only part of the
delay in a gravitational ﬁeld since the curvature of space-time also contributes to the effect. So is the EP useful to
understand the effects of gravity? The answer is ambiva-
lent: on the one hand, it may serve as a tool for understand-ing which effects caused by gravity on physical systems areof inertial nature, i.e., which effects can be simulated by
acceleration. For example, it tells us why astronauts are
weightless despite the existence of tidal forces. On the otherhand, care must be taken when applying it to simple quali-
tative arguments, which, as shown, do not ﬁnd their mathe-
matical correspondence.
Of course, this is all encoded in the theory of GR. Since a
uniform gravitational ﬁeld does not exist in Einstein’s the-ory, in any “true” gravitational ﬁeld, there are tidal forces
acting, but this does not make the concept of the EP useless
for understanding some of the implications of GR.

APPENDIX: MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT
(i) We give a simple argument leading to Eqs. (7)and(10).
Since the spacetime metric (4)is static, there exists a
timelike Killing vector ﬁeld n, which simply is
n¼@=@t, satisfying

The static clocks A and B follow Killing trajectories,

and, therefore,

Thus, the scalar product between the Killing vector
(ﬁeld) and the four velocity of a geodesic is constantalong the geodesic, and we conclude

Since the norm of nisfðrÞ1=2, this results in (10).
(ii) In the following, we give a brief derivation of Eq. (22).
Because nis Killing,

(iii) Rigid motion in mathematical terms implies that (see
Ref. 24)
Luhab¼0;hab¼gabþuaub; (A9)
where Luis the Lie-derivative in the direction u, which
is tangent to the worldlines of the rigid motion and hab
is the induced metric orthogonal to u. If the motion is
along a Killing trajectory, then (A8) is trivially satisﬁed.
In Minkowski space, the ﬂow of an isometry (symme-
try) is either i) rectilinear motion with constant velocityor ii) motion with uniform angular velocity or rectilin-ear uniform acceleration. One may wonder why the geo-metrical argument given above does not apply for the
clocks in Minkowski space, i.e., why the ratio of the
clock rates in Minkowski space is not independent ofthe site? Since the trajectories of uniformly acceleratedclocks follow integral curves of a “boost” Killing ﬁeld
and clock C being inertial thus follows a geodesic. Theanswer is that although the accelerated clocks move onKilling trajectories, A and B move along different Killingcongruences for different k’s, which can be represented as
a combination of the boost-Killing ﬁeld x@
tþt@xand a
time translation @t, i.e., nk¼ðx/C0kÞ@tþt@x.
