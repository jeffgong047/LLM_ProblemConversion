The dynamics of a swinging payload suspended from a stationary crane, an unwanted phenomenon
on a construction site, can be described as a simple pendulum. However, an experienced crane
operator can deliver a swinging payload and have it stop dead on target in a ﬁnite amount of timeby carefully modulating the speed of the trolley. Generally, a series of precisely timed stop and go
movements of the trolley are implemented to damp out the kinetic energy of the simple harmonic
oscillator. Here, this mysterious crane operator’s trick will be revealed and ultimately generalizedto capture the case where the load is initially swinging. Finally, this modus operandi is applied to a
torsion balance used to measure G, the universal gravitational constant responsible for the
swinging of the crane’s payload in the ﬁrst place.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many engineers have developed robust control algorithms
for the automation of industrial cranes to solve the problem of
damping the swinging motion of a suspended load.1–3Still,
few have analyzed the capabilities of the most classic control-ler—the human crane operator. While the pendulum provides
a simple yet fascinating system to study physics,
4most
articles on damping or excitation achieve their goal by chang-ing the effective lengths of the pendulum.
5–7Moreover, the
papers that describe damping rarely take advantage of the
Laplace transformation, with12being an exception.8–11Here,
we study a pendulum with a suspension point that is allowed
to move horizontally via a trolley. Using the Laplace trans-
form to obtain the pendulum’s motion, we show that damping
can be achieved simply by timing the suspension point’s
motion. In short, the authors combine their experience of driv-ing overhead cranes (SS, LC) with their love for physics (all
authors) to unveil the principles behind one of the tricks used
by crane operators. This trick consists of two stop-and-gomotions of the trolley. These can damp out the undesirable
swinging motion of the pendulum so that it stops dead on tar-
get in a ﬁnite amount of time. These movements will be ana-lyzed and explained in Sec. III. Finally, this technique is
applied to a torsion pendulum physics experiment at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) formeasuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation G,s h o w i n g
the ubiquity of simple harmonic motion, ranging from con-
struction sites to the modern laboratory.
Figure 1shows an idealized diagram of a typical tower
crane with two degrees of freedom: the horizontal motion
provided by the trolley and the vertical motion by the hoist.For this analysis, the load is assumed to have already been
lifted to the proper height, and vertical motion during liftoff
and touchdown is ignored. A point load with mass mis sus-
pended by a rope with ﬁxed length land negligible mass and
can swing at small angles with a period T
o. The horizontal
position of the load (mass) is given by xmand that of the trol-
ley (on the crane) by xc. The corresponding velocities are
abbreviated by vm¼_xmand vc¼_xc, respectively. The angle
hof the rope with respect to vertical can be obtained fromsinh¼ðxm/C0xcÞ=l. With the trolley at rest, the velocity
and acceleration of the load tangential to its arcuate motion
arel_hand l€h. For small excursions ( h/C281), the velocity
and acceleration can be approximated as _xmand €xm, respec-
tively. Hence, the linearized differential equation ofmotion is

ing coefﬁcient that accounts for the ﬂuid friction force c_xm,

term c_xmis included in Eq. (1)for completeness, but, from
here on, we neglect it to avoid complicating the equations and
overburdening the physical insight with mathematics. In addi-
tion, the experimental oscillator discussed in Sec. Vexhibits
almost no damping so that this approximation is valid in that
case also. Without damping, Eq. (1)c a nb er e w r i t t e na s

ters. A table in Appendix B gives the transformations that
are used in this article.

II. STARTING WITH THE LOAD AT REST
Let us start with a simple case that does not require any
shenanigans. For t<0, both the load and the trolley are ini-
tially at rest with xm¼xc¼0. A series of two movements
are examined: at t¼0, the trolley begins to move at constant
velocity (Sec. II A), and at t¼s, it comes to a stop (Sec.
II B). Following these two motions, the crane operator’s trick
to stop the load from swinging is revealed (Sec. II C).
A. Trolley starts moving
We assume that for t<0, the trolley is at rest, and at t¼0,
it instantaneously starts to move with constant velocity vc.
Hence, xc, determined by the Heaviside function u(t) multi-
plied with vct, is given by

Note that in the formal deﬁnition, uð0Þ¼0:5, but this point
is inconsequential here because uðtÞt¼0 for t¼0. The cor-
responding Laplace transformation XcðsÞis obtained using
Appendix B so that the position of the load in the Laplace

xmðtÞ¼ vct/C0vc
xosinxotðÞ : (7)The horizontal velocity of the load, vm, is the time derivative
ofxm
vm¼vc/C0vccosxotðÞ : (8)
Equation (8)shows that the average speed of the load, vm,
is equal to the steady speed of the trolley, vc.H o w e v e r ,i t s
speed oscillates with an amplitude of vc, so, with respect to
the construction site, the load’s speed varies from 0 to 2 vc.
Att¼kTo, the speed of the load is zero. Here, as through-
out the text, kdenotes a positive integer. If the operator
stops the trolley at those instants, both the velocity of the
trolley, vc, and the of load, vm, will be zero. Furthermore, as
is apparent from Eq. (7), the position of both the load and
the trolley will then be vckTo. The mass will hang straight
down, with h¼0, from the resting trolley. Thus, the pendu-
lum will be at rest and will remain at rest until the next
stimulus arises.
B. Trolley starts moving and then stops
In this section, we use the Laplace transformation to ﬁnd
the motion of the load after the trolley is brought abruptly to
a stop, and we check the claim that stopping the trolley at
times t¼kTowill result in the load hanging at rest. As
before, the trolley starts moving at t¼0 with a velocity vc,
but now comes to a stop at t¼s. In the Laplace domain, this
motion is given by

where the ﬁrst term represents the motion starting at t¼0,
and the second term represents the stop at a later time s.I n
the Laplace domain, a time shift by srequires multiplication
by exp ð/C0ssÞ. The transformation back to the time domain
gives Eq. (7)added to a similar term, but with a negative
sign and shifted in time by s. Hence, the distance traveled by
the load is given, for t>s,14by

The equation is different from Eq. (8)as it is the outcome of
two changes in the trolley velocity instead of one. The sec-ond sine in Eq. (14) describes the free pendulum motion
with a phase shift. Its amplitude is modulated by the ﬁrst
sine that is dependent on s. Thus, the load velocity becomes
zero when x
os¼k2p, or rather s¼kTo, exactly as conjec-
tured above.
C. The crane operator’s trick
Section II Bdescribes a trajectory where the load is at rest
both initially and ﬁnally. However, during the translation,the horizontal displacement of the load with respect to the
trolley can be quite large, up to v
c=xo. To avoid pendulum
motion during transport, the trolley starts at t¼0 with vc=2
and then, at t¼s, the velocity is increased to vc. The crane
operator’s secret is in calculating the value for s. In the s
domain that stimulus is
XcðsÞ¼vc=2

Thus, if xos¼ð2kþ1Þp,o rs¼To=2þkTo, the pendulum
motion is cancelled. The crane operator’s trick is to start the
trolley with half the desired velocity. Half a period later, theload passes directly below the trolley with a velocity that is
twice as fast as the trolley. At that point, the crane operator
doubles the trolley speed to match the speed of the load.After this maneuver, or set of movements, the load glides
along with constant velocity.
Since all good things must come to an end, the trolley
must be stopped before the end of the track. Stopping withzero swing can be accomplished by performing the same
trick in reverse: the trolley’s speed is reduced to v
c=2 and
then, an odd multiple of To=2 later, reduced to zero.
D. Finite acceleration of the trolley
The analysis above has one shortcoming. It assumes that
the trolley speed can go from 0 to vcorvc=2 instantaneously,
which, unfortunately, is impossible. Instead, assume that, at
t¼0, the trolley starts accelerating with acover a duration of
dt. A second acceleration with the same duration begins at
t¼s. In the sdomain, the stimulus is

The term in the ﬁrst line describes the motion with constant
velocity and is identical to that of the trolley. Note that, for
t>sþdt, the velocity of the trolley is vc¼2acdt.
Fors¼To=2þkTo, the ﬁrst and third cosines as well as the
second and fourth cosines are the same with oppositesign and cancel. Hence, all oscillatory terms vanish for
s¼T
o=2þkTo, and the load tracks the trolley.
In summary, both crane operator tricks are valid even if
the trolley’s acceleration is ﬁnite. Note that we assume
that both accelerations, at t¼0a n da t t¼s, are identical
and applied for the same duration, dt. This assumption
may not hold in a real-world situation, such as if the
motor moving the trolley outputs a constant mechanical
power.
III. STARTING WITH A SWINGING LOAD
The scenario discussed in this section may be uncommon
in the world of crane operators, but is applicable to the phys-
ics experiment discussed later. As previously, we assume the
trolley to be initially at rest at xc¼0, but the load is now
assumed to be swinging. Without loss of generality, we set
t¼0 as the time when the load swings directly under the
trolley at xm¼0 with positive velocity vmð0Þ¼ vo. One
could, for instance, imagine that a gust of wind causes the
load to swing at the beginning of the crane operator’s shift in
which the task is to move the load from xm¼0t o xm¼xg,
so that it arrives with the smallest possible pendulum ampli-
tude. To avoid unnecessary complication, we assume that thetrolley can move with inﬁnite acceleration but has a maxi-
mum speed of v
c.
The load’s motion will be damped using two identical
trolley movements performed at a known speed vceach of
duration dt. The combined distance traveled by the trolley
isxg¼2vcdt. To succeed in the task, the crane operator
has to quickly solve the equations of motion and deter-
mine the times t1andt1þswhen these trolley operations
are to be executed, as the ground recipients are notori-
ously impatient.
The two moves can be described in the Laplace domain
similar to Eq. (15). However, how should the initial con-
ditions be taken into account? The easiest way is to
assume that the pendulum is at rest and add a delta-
function impulse term to the stimulus, which reproduces
the initial conditions. This term is virtual because the
crane operator does not actually have to physically exe-cute this step. If the trolley experiences an initial impulse
given by x
c¼dðtÞatt¼0, then the pendulum at rest has,
by deﬁnition of the response function,

To obtain the desired initial condition, i.e., a velocity vo, the
virtual stimulus must, therefore, be xc¼ðvo=x2

For the pendulum to be at rest, the terms within the two
square brackets must be equal to zero. Inspecting the
terms inside the second set of square brackets yields
two possible ways the product can be zero. First, onecould choose x
os¼p. However, for that case, the result
would be
vmðtÞ¼ vocosxotðÞ : (24)
As we have seen in Sec. II C, making two moves an odd mul-
tiple of half a period apart will not change the energy stored
in the pendulum’s motion, and the load’s amplitude will notbe damped. The second way to make the terms vanish would

IV. EXAMPLES BY SIMULATION
In this section, we examine two examples based on the
equations derived previously. We assume l¼20 m, resulting
in a pendulum period of 8.97 s for small angles. The goal is
to move the load by 6 m horizontally to the right with a trol-
ley speed of vc¼1ms/C01, yielding dt¼3s .
In the ﬁrst example, it is assumed that the load has a
velocity amplitude of vo¼1ms/C01. According to Eq. (28),

load and dotted red line the velocity vcof the trolley. Bottom: the solid blue
line indicates the position xmof the load and the dotted red line the position

rest at the target position.

s¼5:32 s which, as an input for Eq. (25), yields t1¼2:57 s.
Figure 2shows a numerical simulation of this example
where the solid traces represent the position xm(bottom
panel) and the velocity vm(top panel) of the load while the
dotted traces represent the position xcand velocity vcof the
trolley. To better visualize the initial swing, t1begins a full
period late, i.e., t1¼8:97 sþ2:57 s¼11:54 s.
The calculation has been made by numerically solving the
differential equation (1)with the Runge–Kutta method. The
program is written in Python and is freely available at
https://github.com/schlammis/pendulum . The simulation
also allows solving the nonlinear differential equation of
motion and the equation when friction is nonzero ( c6¼0).
Both topics would go beyond the scope of this article.
The second example is a case where the initial velocity
amplitude of the load vo¼5ms/C01is larger than four times
the trolley speed. According to Eq. (30),s¼17:95 s, which
yields t1¼0:74 s. Figure 3shows the position and velocity
of both the load and the trolley in this case. Similar to the
previous example, t1begins a full period late at t1¼9:72 s.
The wait time between the two movements is twice the pen-
dulum period, s¼2To¼17:95 s. Due to the large initial
velocity of the load, the motion can only be attenuated and
not fully removed after the maneuver.
V. APPLICATION IN THE LABORATORY
The equations derived in Sec. IIIdo not only apply at a
construction site. They can also be helpful in a physics labo-ratory, especially one involving a harmonic oscillator, which
is not so unusual in science and engineering. In the present
case, the above-described crane shenanigans are directly
applicable to a torsion balance that is used to measure the
gravitational constant G.
15
As shown in Fig. 4, the torsion balance is comprised of
four cylindrical copper test masses, each of mass approxi-
mately 1 kg, resting on a disk suspended from a weak torsion
spring. This assembly is inside a vacuum vessel. An autocol-
limator monitors the small angle utthe disk makes with
respect to a ﬁxed direction via one of four mirrors attached
to the disk. The measurement range of the autocollimator is
60:17/C14. A source-mass assembly consisting of four cylindri-
cal source masses on a carousel is located outside the vac-
uum chamber. The operator can rotate the carousel around
the symmetry center to an angle uswith the help of a stepper
motor.
Depending on the difference us/C0ut, a gravitational
torque ncan act on the pendulum. The torque can be
written under the form n¼GCðus/C0utÞ,w h e r e CðuÞis a
function that depends on the angle difference, but also
on the mass distribution of the experiment (itself depend-
ing on the various distance of the masses to the rotation
center, their height, and densities). Experimentally,
numerical integration over the test and source mass vol-umes is necessary to determine Cwith relative uncertain-
ties of /C241/C210
/C06.
The experiment is performed as follows. The source
masses are moved to the angle where the maximum clock-
wise torque acts on the pendulum, us¼us;max. Due to the
gravitational torque, the pendulum oscillates around an

signiﬁcantly attenuated amplitude at the target position.
Fig. 4. Top: three-dimensional model of the torsion balance. Bottom: topview of the system. The torsion balance is composed of a disk suspended
by a thin torsion strip, inside a vacuum chamber (omitted for clarity), on
which four cylindrical test masses are placed at 90
/C14from one another.
Outside the chamber are four cylindrical source masses on a carousel that
can rotate about the strip center. The angle of the torsion balance is mea-
sured from the dash-dotted line to the test mass labeled 1. This angle is
very small, utjj/C280:01/C14. The angle of the source mass assembly usis
measured from the dash-dotted line to the source mass labeled A. The
gravitational torque depends on us/C0ut/C25usand is maximal for

strip, jðut;max/C0ut;0Þ, counteracts the gravitational torque,
andut;0denotes the unknown equilibrium position of the
pendulum in the absence of external torque. The torsion pen-dulum is then observed with an autocollimator for a few peri-
ods, to determine u
t;max, after which the source masses are
moved counterclockwise to the position us;minwhere the tor-
que acting on the pendulum is minimal, i.e., maximal coun-
terclockwise torque. The pendulum is observed again, and
we obtain jðut;min/C0ut;0Þ¼GCðus;min/C0ut;minÞ. The proce-
dure is repeated to achieve a good precision on ut;max
/C0ut;min. By using the difference, the unknown angle ut;0
drops out. From these measurements, the gravitational con-
stant can be obtained as
G¼jut;max/C0ut;min
Cðus;max/C0ut;maxÞ/C0Cðus;min/C0ut;minÞ; (31)
where the numerator is obtained from the successive mea-
surements discussed above and the denominator from thenumerical integration of C. The torsional constant, j,i s
obtained by measuring the resonant frequency of the pendu-
lum, f

of the setup, see Ref. 15.

/C0ut;min¼0:008 74/C14¼153lrad. One detail worth mention-
ing is that the pendulum is constantly swinging. Hence, todetermine the equilibrium position of the pendulum with the
source masses in either state, a sine function must be ﬁtted to
the data obtained with the autocollimator, offset by u
t;maxor
ut;min. The uncertainty in the equilibrium position is smaller
for smaller pendulum amplitude, for, in this case, the nonli-
nearities of the autocollimator affect the results to a lesserdegree.

which closely resembles Eq. (4).
The same crane operator is in charge of maneuvering
the source masses, and, like before, only two movements
per maneuver are allowed. The task is to optimize the timingof both movements, given by the parameters t
1,dt, and s
to damp the pendulum as much as possible. One difference
here is that the torque does not change linearly withrespect to the source mass position but depends onn

Note that this expression corresponds to the ﬁrst order
expansion, valid if the masses are point masses. It is areasonable accurate approximation for the cylindricalmasses used in the experiment. The problem can then be
solved with a method similar to what has been describedfor the crane. The exact differential equation of motionand their solutions are beyond the scope of this text butcan be found on the GitHub page mentioned earlier.Spoiler alert: the crane operator’s trick similar to the onedescribed in Sec.

Figure 5shows the pendulum angular position utas a
function of time. When the source mass is set at þus;max, the
corresponding usandutcurves are in magenta, whereas
when it is set at /C0us;max, the corresponding usandutcurves
are in cyan. The pendulum response to the source massmaneuvers are plotted with thin dotted lines. To understandthe source mass motion plotted in Fig. 5, recall that there is a
maximum amplitude that can be damped in one maneuver,see Eq. (29). For the torsion pendulum, this amplitude corre-
sponds to 146 lrad. To achieve this reduction, the wait time
between the two moves in one maneuver is s/C0dt¼107 s.
This wait time is long, almost a full period. Alternatively, bysetting s¼dt, the pendulum swing amplitude is reduced by
137lrad instead of 146 lrad. Thus, the amplitude reduction
per maneuver is worse, but the average reduction per unittime is greater. Hence, for amplitude larger than 137 lrad,s
is set to zero. For smaller amplitudes, the ideal sis calcu-
lated. In the latter case, the wait time between two moves isclearly visible in the last two maneuvers in Fig. 5. More

These datasets are used to determine G. In between the two extreme
states, the source masses are moved according to the procedure
described in the text. The data taken during the maneuver (not used to
determine G) are shown as thin lines. The damping of the oscillatory
motion of utcan be seen. The inset in the top graph shows the pendulum
motion after a little more than an hour. The torsional amplitude is
1.6lrad, more than 1000 times smaller than at the beginning of the
experiment.

At the beginning of the data shown in Fig. 5, the pendu-
lum had an amplitude of 1830 lrad. After 15 maneuvers,
the amplitude has been reduced to 1.5 lrad, which shows
how effective the crane operator’s trick is. However, anattenuation of 99.9% seems to be the limit of this methodfor two main reasons: (1) there is some variation in dt,t h e
time it takes to perform one movement, and (2) the torque
on the pendulum is not exactly proportional to the sine ofthe angular position of the source masses as mentionedearlier. Other than that, this work would likely get the nod
of approval from the Society of Meticulous Crane
Operators.
From the physics point of view, the damping of the tor-
sion pendulum is desirable because it ultimately reducesthe uncertainty of the angular pos ition during the mea-
surement. The values of u
t;maxandut;minare determined
by measuring the pendulum motion over one period.Fitting a large amplitude curve to determine the equilib-rium position is more prone to systematic effects caused
by nonlinearities of the autocollimator. Here, the authors
employ the crane operator’s tricks to achieve some seri-ous damping: the amplitude of the oscillations in u
tafter
an hour of such maneuvers is about 1200 times smaller
than the initial amplitude. In contrast, a wait time of the
order of months would be necessary before the oscilla-tions naturally decay via dissipation in the torsion strip tothe same levels if no trick is applied.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have taken a light-hearted look at a
practical application of Newtonian mechanics, usingLaplace transformation. We started with a simple exam-ple. The trolley of a crane starts moving with constant
velocity. We calculated the effect that this impetus has on
a classical harmonic oscillator: the load suspended fromthat trolley. The translation property of the Laplace trans-formation allows us to easily consider the effect of two
such impulses in opposite directions, i.e., starting and
stopping the trolley. With a few trigonometric manipula-tions, we showed that if the two impulses are separated intime by an integer number of pendulum periods, no
energy is added or subtracted to the pendulum motion of
the load. In the classroom, the formalism can be shown onthe whiteboard, with a simulation using the code providedon GitHub, and experimentally by moving the top of a
plumb bob by hand. The technique can be extended to
include the initial swinging condition of the pendulum.We use a variation of the crane operator’s trick on a tor-sion balance in our current research, determining the grav-
itational constant.
We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can
be valuable for the classroom. First, the math is not toocomplicated and can be followed on the whiteboard.Second, the freely available python code can be down-
loaded, and students and teachers alike can play with
different parameters, including damping. Finally, themotivated reader may endeavor to build an actualexperimental realization of the systems discussed here—
either a crane or a torsion balance. The topic can be
approached from many different angles and is, therefore,fun and educational.Applying the techniques discussed above, we found it
satisfying that the torsion pendulum follows precisely thesimple, albeit uncommon, mathematical formalism. We
hope that the students and their teachers can ﬁnd the same
satisfaction in this system, even if only by simulation.This satisfaction can inspire a lifelong passion for under-standing the world using mathematical and physical
reasoning.
