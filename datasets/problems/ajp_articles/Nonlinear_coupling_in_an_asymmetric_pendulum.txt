We investigate the nonlinear behavior of a simple pendulum ﬁxed to an elastic rod, which can only
vibrate horizontally. When released without initial angular momentum, the plane of the pendulumrotates, and the bob traces a delicate stationary pattern. We explain this effect as amplitude
modulation due to the nonlinear coupling between the two degrees of freedom. We construct a
theoretical model and approximately solve the equations of motion analytically (using the method
of multiple scales); we also solve these equations numerically. In the analytical solution, the
modulation period depends not only on the dynamical parameters but also on the pendulum’sinitial release position, which is typical of nonlinear systems. Finally, we build a simple apparatus
and conduct a quantitative experiment. The approximate analytical solutions exhibit the same
trends as the numerical results and experimental data. After adding linear dissipation, thenumerical and experimental results match fairly well. This system can serve as an instructive
demonstration as well as a nonlinear dynamics research project for undergraduate students.

I. INTRODUCTION
The trajectory of an ideal two-dimensional asymmetric pen-
dulum is a Lissajous ﬁgure, the superposition of two indepen-dent simple harmonic motions. A common example of an
asymmetric pendulum is a “Y-suspended” pendulum.1–3When
the frequency ratio of the two oscillations x1=x2is a rational
number, the trajectory will be stationary. When x1=x2is not a
rational number, the motion is quasi-periodic, and the trajec-tory varies with time due to a growing phase drift.4Singh et al.
observed that the quasi-periodic motion of a 2D asymmetric
pendulum shifted from planar to elliptical and back to planaragain.5The period in which the pendulum returned to the
planar motion was related to the strength of the symmetry
breaking introduced by an added spring.
Once linear coupling is introduced to an oscillating system
with two degrees of freedom, such as by connecting two pen-
dulums with a weak spring, two normal modes result.6The
resultant motion is described as a linear superposition of thetwo normal modes. If the frequencies of these two modes are
slightly different, “beat” motion arises, in which the ampli-
tudes of the pendulums vary slowly and the energy is trans-ferred cyclically between them.
If a real asymmetric pendulum is observed, perfectly inde-
pendent motions are very unlikely to occur. The conversion
between radial and azimuthal oscillations is common forasymmetric pendulums. However, the nonlinear coupling
between the two oscillations is often overlooked. Here, we
study the dynamics of such a pendulum with weak nonlinearcoupling.
The pendulum is shown in Fig. 1(a). Using a string, a bob
is suspended from the end of an elastic rod that is ﬁxed to an
iron stand. The rod is supported with another taut string to
avoid vertical deﬂection. Because the rod moves synchro-
nously with the Bob (this will be shown in Sec. II B), the sys-
tem’s degrees of freedom can be reduced. As a result, we
refer to this system as “quasi-two degree of freedom” (quasi-
2DOF). If the pendulum’s initial plane of motion is parallelto the rod, the motion will spontaneously convert from pla-
nar to elliptical motion and back again. An experimental
video clip and an animation are included in thesupplementary material.
7A typical pattern for this pendu-
lum’s motion is shown in Fig. 1(b), and a Lissajous ﬁgure is
plotted in Fig. 1(c)for comparison. At ﬁrst sight, the pattern
resembles a Lissajous ﬁgure with varying phase. However,
unlike the quasi-2DOF pendulum, in a Lissajous ﬁgure, the
amplitudes in the xandydirections are ﬁxed. This implies
that there is an exchange of energy between the oscillations
in the azimuthal ( x) and radial ( y) directions. The amplitude
change is apparently a consequence of the coupling between
the two degrees of freedom.
We build a theoretical model and determine the pendu-
lum’s equations of motion in two-dimensions. We then solve
the equations numerically and ﬁnd an approximate analytical
solution using the method of multiple scales. Because the
coupling is nonlinear, the motion cannot be simply decom-
posed into two normal modes. To overcome this difﬁculty,we focus on the system where the rod is suitably hard, and
thus, the nonlinearity is small, so it can be treated as a pertur-
bation on top of the two independent oscillations. In the
approximate analytical solution, each motion consists of two
oscillations with slightly different frequencies. We introduce
the nonlinear modulation period and the modulation depth to
describe the motion. These quantities depend not only on the
dynamical parameters but also on the pendulum’s initial
release positions. The approximate analytical solutions are
consistent with the numerical solutions with good accuracy
when the nonlinear effect is weak and the trends of the
experimental results are in agreement with theory.
This apparatus has appealing visual effects and controlla-
ble parameters. This work provides an instructive demonstra-
tion as well as a potential research project for undergraduate
students. This problem has aroused extensive interest among
students as a popular competition problem in the 2018
International Young Physicists’ Tournament and the China
Undergraduate Physics Tournament.8Our work and a recent
work by Fu9are solutions to this problem. In the work of Fu,
a soft rod is used, and the conversion between radial and
azimuthal modes is examined using the mechanism of para-metric resonance when the radial frequency is nearly twice
the azimuthal frequency. Here, we focus on the nonlinear

coupling effect and derive an analytical solution using a per-
turbation method in the case of a stiff rod. Though we haveonly discussed the case when the radial and azimuthal fre-quencies are nearly the same, our work can easily be
extended to other frequency ratios.
The phenomenon described in this study is ubiquitous in
many other two-dimensional pendulum systems such asspherical pendulums, Foucault pendulums, and harmono-
graphs. In particular, a Foucault pendulum may involve
asymmetry due to imperfect suspension or nonlinear cou-pling due to sideways motion, which can cause additional
rotation that masks the terrestrial effect.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL
A. Equations of motion
We write the Lagrangian of the pendulum using Cartesian
coordinates. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the origin Ois taken as
the bob’s static equilibrium position. The bob’s coordinates
xc;yc;zcare taken with respect to O. The bob’s coordinates
relative to the rod’s oscillatory end are denoted by xandy.
The horizontal deﬂection of the rod’s end is denoted as X
and is presumed to be small. This deﬂection is approximatelyone dimensional, and therefore, we have

where lis the string length and we have used the small angle
approximation because we focus on small amplitude oscilla-
tions. We consider a hard rod whose natural frequency is
much higher than that of the pendulum. Since the rod is slen-der and the deﬂection is small, we can model the rod using
the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The rod is treated as a can-
tilever beam bent by a force at the free end.
11The deﬂection
at any point is approximately proportional to the force, and
the strain energy and the kinetic energy are both quadratic.
Hence, the total kinetic energy of the bob and the rod isT¼1

where mis the mass of the bob and 1 =2M/C3_X2is the rod’s

that we do not consider the dissipation at this point.Dissipation may destroy the periodicity of the amplitudemodulation and obscure some of the features of the motionpatterns. In addition, we do not want to increase the difﬁcultyof the analytical calculation further.

Although the (bracketed) nonlinear terms in Eqs. (7a) and
(7b)look complicated, it can be seen from Eqs. (8)that the
nonlinear terms actually come from the vertical motion,which is usually neglected for pendulums with small ampli-tudes or when considering only short-term behavior. Thismeans that all two-dimensional pendulums may have suchterms that cause nonlinear coupling between the two dimen-sions. The precession of a spherical pendulum
12is one such
example. Over time, the effects of these small terms accumu-late and periodically modulate the amplitudes in the xandy
directions.
It is quite complicated to solve a nonlinear equation set with
three independent variables. Fortunately, we notice in the exper-iment that the rod’s end moves synchronously with the bob inthe x-direction, which makes it possible to reduce the degrees offreedom to two. Since the magnitudes of the nonlinear terms aremuch smaller than the other terms, we can treat them as pertur-bations. First, we temporarily remove them and examine theundisturbed linear system, i.e., the generating system in theterminology of the perturbation theory. In Sec. II B,w es t a r t
with the linearized equations and try to reduce the number ofdegrees of freedom.
B. Simplification: Two degree of freedom model
When the nonlinear terms are ignored in Eq. (7), the pen-
dulum’s equations of motion for the undisturbed system arereduced to

In Eq. (9b), it can be seen that yis independent of x, and its
solution is simple harmonic motion. The variables xandX
are still coupled. Substituting the trial solution

into Eqs. (9), it is then found that

The frequency xxis an effective natural frequency of the
bob’s azimuthal oscillation, which is slightly lower than thependulum’s natural frequency and x

quency on the order of the rod’s natural frequency.By substituting each kin Eqs. (12)into Eq. (9a), we have

For the solution with lower frequency xx, the bob’s oscilla-
tion amplitude is much greater than that of the rod. For the
solution with a high frequency x0, the oscillation amplitudes
are approximately the same magnitude. Typical experimentalconditions lead to the bob’s displacement being much greater
than the displacement of the rod’s end. Therefore, we neglect
the high-frequency solution and obtain
XðtÞ¼jxðtÞ: (14)
Thus, the rod moves synchronously with the pendulum in the
xdirection. By substituting Eq. (14)into Eqs. (9), the equa-
tions reduce to

Apparently, for the undisturbed system, the anisotropy is a
result of different azimuthal and radial oscillation frequen-cies introduced by the elastic rod.
Retaining the nonlinear coupling terms, we obtain the fol-
lowing equations of motion:
€xþð1/C0jÞx¼/C0 ð 1/C0jÞðx_x
2þx_y2þxy€yþx2€xÞ;(16a)
€yþy¼/C0 ð y_y2þy_x2þxy€xþy2€yÞ: (16b)
In this equation and below, we have switched to dimension-
less variables: xandyrepresent x/landy/l, and trepresents
xyt.
It should be noted that in Eqs. (16), there is only one
parameter, j, that determines the frequency difference
between the two directions. It should also be noted that jis
independent of the effective mass of the rod M/C3. The mass of
the rod has little effect on this system, because the kineticenergy of the rod is negligible compared to its elastic poten-
tial energy, when we consider only the low-frequency
motion.
III. NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS
A. Numerical results
Using Wolfram Mathematica’s NDSolve functionality
13
to solve Eqs. (16), we obtain the results shown in Fig. 2.I n
the calculation, j¼0:01, and the pendulum is released from
xð0Þ¼0:1;yð0Þ¼0:2;_xð0Þ¼ _yð0Þ¼0. The numerical
results obtained from the simpliﬁed Eqs. (16) show no
observable difference when we substitute the same parame-
ters into the original Eqs. (7); thus, the approximations of
Sec. II Bare reasonable for this set of parameters. Figures
2(a)and2(b)show the xandyoscillations, respectively. The
oscillations resemble “beat” motion, in which the amplitudes
are modulated periodically. The time span in the ﬁgures istwice the amplitude modulation period T. After a time 2 T,
the pendulum returns to its initial planar motion, and the tra-
jectory forms a complete stationary pattern, as shown in the
596 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 8, August 2022 Jiaet al. 596 04 October 2023 23:14:07
background of Fig. 3. It can be seen the pendulum’s phase
evolution period is also 2 T.
To illustrate the phase and amplitude evolution, we plot
evolution diagrams in Fig. 3. The background blue pattern
clearly shows the stationary envelope of the trajectory. Theyellow curves show the short-term trajectory for the bob’snext oscillation. In each oscillation, the trajectory is nearlyclosed since the rate of precession is very small. Hence, wecan approximate the yellow curves as ellipses graduallyrotating and transforming. After the bob is released at theupper-right point in Fig. 3(a), the planar motion gradually
becomes elliptical and both the major axis and the bob rotateclockwise, as can be seen in the animation.
7The rate of pre-
cession increases and reaches a maximum when the majoraxis of the ellipse passes the x-axis in Fig. 3(c). Then the rate
of precession begins to decrease, and ﬁnally, the oscillationreturns to planar at time T, as shown in Fig. 3(e). At this
time, the amplitude of the yoscillation has returned to a
maximum, and the amplitude for the xoscillation has
returned to a minimum. Afterward, the pendulum reverses itsrotation counterclockwise from Fig. 3(e) to Fig. 3(h) and
ﬁnally returns to Fig. 3(a). In the absence of damping, the
motion is quasi-periodic. Hence, the duration from Fig. 3(a)
to Fig. 3(h) and back to Fig. 3(a) is the phase modulation
period, 2 T.
We perform a Fourier transformation of the xandyoscil-
lations and obtain the frequency spectra shown in Fig. 3. The
frequencies of the main peaks in xand ydirections are
denoted by r
xandry. Both spectra are composed of several
discrete, evenly spaced peaks, and their spacing is twice thefrequency difference between the main peaks r
y/C0rx.W e
will show this analytically in Sec. III B. Note that a discrete
spectrum with spacing Dxgives rise to the amplitudemodulation (“beat”) phenomenon with beat period T¼
2p=Dx¼2p=2ðry/C0rxÞ. Meanwhile, the main peak fre-
quency difference ry/C0rxresults in the phase difference
changing with period 2 T¼2p=ry/C0rx.
To see how the nonlinear coupling affects the pendulum’s
motion, we utilize an approximate analytical solution inSec.III B.
B. Approximate solution from the method of multiple
scales
The method of multiple scales was ﬁrst introduced by
Sturrock
14in 1957 and then developed by Nayfeh15–17and
others.18,19The underlying idea is to consider multiple inde-
pendent variables, or time scales, instead of a single variable.

tions. The frequencies of the main peaks are denoted by rxandry.
Fig. 3. These ﬁgures show how the motion evolves in a period. The yellow
ellipses depict short-term motion, and the arrows on the ellipses depict the
rotation direction of the bob. The red points are the points of tangency, and
the red arrows beside the points show how the points move. In (a), the bob is
released from the upper-right point. The direction of rotation is clockwise
from (a) to (e) and counter-clockwise from (e) to (h) and back to (a). The
ellipse axes rotate in the same way.

More speciﬁcally, the position xis originally thought to be a
function of a single variable t, but now we consider it to be
a function of several different time scales ent, where eis a
dimensionless, inﬁnitesimally small quantity. Thus, we canseparately deal with effects on different time scales. Takinga lightly damped oscillator as an example, on the smallest
time scale, the motion is simple harmonic which may be
called “fast” motion. On a longer time scale, the resistanceforce can be treated as a perturbation that results in a slowchange in amplitude. Compared to other perturbation meth-
ods such as the Lindstedt–Poincar /C19e method and the averag-
ing method, the method of multiple scales has theadvantages that it can deal with the phase shift more easilyand allows one to obtain the analytical solution to an arbi-
trary order.
15Because the derivations are somewhat lengthy,
we have included the details in the Appendix , and we will
only show the main results here.
As derived in the Appendix using the method of multiple
scales, the second order approximate solution to Eq. (16)is
x¼acosrxtþð1/C0jÞab2
2b2/C0a2/C04jcosð2ry/C0rxÞt; (17a)

where aandbare two constants related to the initial condi-
tions, and

2j/C01
4a2;ry/C171/C01

To relate aandbto the (known) initial position, we set t¼0
in Eqs. (17)and obtain
x0¼aþð1/C0jÞab2
2b2/C0a2/C04j; (18a)
y0¼bþð1/C0jÞa2b
2a2/C0b2þ4j: (18b)
The solution for aand bin terms of x0and y0is multi-
valued, and unrealistic solutions are eliminated. Thus, thenumerical and analytical results can be compared.
From Eq. (17), we see that the x(ory) oscillation is the
superposition of two harmonic components with a small
angular frequency difference 2 ðr
y/C0rxÞ/C172Dr. More spe-
ciﬁcally, the dimensionless frequencies of the primary andsecondary peaks are denoted as r
xandr0
x(ryandr0
y) for the
x(y) oscillation. From Eqs. (17), the analytical approxima-
tion gives
r0
x¼2ry/C0rx¼rxþ2Dr; (19a)
r0
y¼2rx/C0ry¼ry/C02Dr: (19b)
The superposition of the two components results in an ampli-
tude modulation whose period is given by
T¼2p
2Dr’4p
a2/C0b2þ2j: (20)
When only the leading terms— acosrxtand bcosryt—in
Eqs. (17a) and(17b) are considered, the angular frequency
difference between xand yoscillations is ry/C0rx¼Dr.
This means that the period of the phase difference betweenthe two directions is 2 p=Dr¼2T, twice the period of the
amplitude modulation obtained from Eq. (20).
We plot the numerical and analytical trajectories in Figs.
4(a)and4(b)forj¼0:01;x0¼0:04;y0¼0:08 for both the
numerical and analytical solutions. There are only subtle dif-
ferences between the two trajectories. However, when we takelarger initial displacements x
0¼0:06;y0¼0:12, the differ-
ences become obvious, as seen in Figs. 5(a)and5(b). We also
plot the frequency spectra of the numerical results for theseparameters in Figs. 4(c) and5(c). The predicted spacing
between the ﬁrst and second peaks resulting from Eqs. (19)is
consistent with the numerical result as shown in Fig. 5(c).
The main and secondary peaks in the frequency spectra cor-
respond to the two terms in the analytical result (17). Whenthe amplitude is small, as in Fig. 4(c),o n l yt h eﬁ r s tt w op e a k s
for each oscillation are signiﬁcant, and the others are negligi-
ble. In this case, the analytical results ﬁt well with the numeri-
cal results. When the amplitude is increased, as in Fig. 5(c),
the effects of the other minor peaks are not negligible, and theapproximate analytical solution is not as accurate.
Next, we study how the coupling coefﬁcient jand the ini-
tial amplitudes affect the nonlinear coupling. We label theamplitudes of the primary and secondary peak as h
xandh0
x
for the xoscillation. In order to estimate the magnitude of
the nonlinear coupling, we introduce a parameter
fx/C17h0
x=hx; (21)
which can be used to study the accuracy of the analytical
results. If the motion only comprises two harmonic compo-
nents, fxis the modulation depth, i.e., the ratio of the modu-
lation amplitude to the carrier amplitude.20A larger
modulation depth results in a larger difference between themaximum and minimum amplitudes and indicates more sig-
niﬁcant coupling between the oscillations. The modulation
depth f
xcan be found from the ratio of the coefﬁcients of the
second term and ﬁrst term in Eqs. (17a)
fx¼ð1/C0jÞb2
2b2/C0a2/C04j: (22)
Figure 6(a) shows how fxdepends on jforx0¼0:03;
y0¼0:06, where jvaries from 0.001 to 0.01. It is found that
fxbecomes smaller as jincreases, indicating that the nonlin-
ear effect is weaker for larger j.
Moreover, we study how the main peak frequency rxand
the secondary peak frequency r0
xchange with j. We compare
the analytical and numerical results in Figs. 6(b)–6(d) .
Although rxandr0
xchange very little with j, the modulation
frequency Drincreases drastically. This means that the aver-
age precession speed signiﬁcantly increases for greater j.
To see how the amplitudes affect the motion, we plot the
modulation depth fx, peak frequencies rxandr0
x, and the fre-
quency difference Dras functions of the initial positions in
Figs. 7(a)–7(d) . We take j¼0:0146, and the initial positions
x0¼a;y0¼2awith avarying from 0.01 to 0.06. Both rx
andr0
xdecrease as aincreases, but the modulation frequency
Dris nonmonotonic and reaches a minimum near a¼0:05.
In Fig. 7(a), we ﬁnd that the modulation depth is greater for
larger a, showing that the nonlinearity is stronger for larger
amplitudes. The analytical results gradually deviate from the
numerical curve for larger amplitudes due to stronger nonlin-earity. The comparison to experimental results is discussedin Sec. IV.

IV. EXPERIMENT
We have created a simple experiment that can even be
conducted at home. The apparatus consists of a nonelasticstring, a small steel ball, a plastic rod, an iron stand, and acellphone camera with slow-motion mode (Redmi k30 pro inour experiment). First, we ﬁxed the plastic rod on the stand
and ensured that it would not wobble. Then, we suspended
the ball at the end of the rod with the string. Our pendulum
length was 55 cm. Finally, we ﬁxed the camera in position
over the ball facing downward. A video of the apparatus can
be found in the supplementary material.
7
To release the ball with a certain initial amplitude, we made
a series of markers on the table top, tied another string to the
ball, and then dragged the ball with the string ensuring that the
ball was aligned with the desired marker. We then started
recording and burned the string. We used an open-source soft-
ware, Tracker,21to analyze the video. The modulation period T
is the time it takes the ball to return to its initial planar motion,
and by measuring T, one can determine Dr¼p=T. The param-
eterjcan be determined from the ratio of the pendulum’s natu-
ral frequency to the natural frequency of the rod. These two
frequencies were obtained with the camera’s slow-motionmode (240 fps) to be 4.17 60.02 rad/s (pendulum) and
285.960.6 rad/s (rod). Then j¼4:17=285:9’0:0146,
which is the same value used in the computation for Fig. 7.T h e
experimental results are given in Figs. 7(a)and7(d).
In our experiment, we set y
0¼2x0. Speciﬁcally, the xcoor-
dinate ranges from 5 mm to 26 mm, and the ycoordinate
ranges from 10 mm to 52 mm. For a¼0:047, a graph of xvs
tis shown in Fig. 8(a), and the trajectory is shown in Fig.
8(b). The decaying amplitude is a clear indication that dissipa-
tion is present. To cope with the dissipation, the modulation
depth was obtained with a simple approximation, as follows.As shown in Fig. 8(a), we labeled the initial amplitude as h
1,
the amplitude at t¼T=2a s h2, and the amplitude at t¼Tas
h3, and we take h2to be the maximal amplitude and ðh1þ
h3Þ=2 to be the minimal amplitude. We approximate fxas

By examining Fig. 7(a), we ﬁnd that although the trend of
the experimental data is the same as the theoretical curves,
the values are systematically below both the analytical and
numerical results. After careful analysis, we conclude that
there are two main sources of deviation: the dissipation and
the small angle approximation. To investigate these effects,we performed a revised numerical simulation. In this calcu-
lation, we abandoned the small angle approximation shown
in Eq. 3, and we added a resistive force proportional to the
bob’s velocity with the dimensionless resistance coefﬁcient
0.0013, which was obtained by ﬁtting the amplitude decay.This simulation gives us the “Revised” curves in Fig. 7(a).
For the experimental modulation frequency Drin Fig. 7(d),
the errors are less than 10%. We have tried to consider the
effect of dissipation and small angle approximation, but this
does not improve numerical results effectively. We speculatethat the remaining differences may be caused by
unaccounted-for systematic errors, such as not considering
the moment of inertia of the bob, the frictional torque of the
pivot, and unintended sway which occurs if, upon release,
the bob’s center of mass is not in alignment with the string.
V. CONCLUSION
The phenomenon of conversion between radial and azi-
muthal oscillations described in this study is common
for asymmetric pendulums. We explain this phenomenon

as amplitude modulation due to nonlinear coupling.
The pendulum’s motion patterns are solved both numeri-cally and analytically and then compared with the experi-mental data. The method of multiple scales proves to be aneffective way to approximate this system and allows us toexplicitly express the amplitude modulation period Tin
terms of the coupling coefﬁcient and the amplitudes. The
dependence of Ton the amplitudes is typical nonlinear
behavior. If the rod were removed, the system would appar-ently degenerate to a spherical pendulum. The elastic coef-
ﬁcient of the pivot point would approach inﬁnity, and thus,
the nonlinear coefﬁcient jwould be zero. It may, therefore,
be a good idea to vary the length of the rod in order to
change the parameter jand experimentally examine the
motion with different levels of nonlinearity. The advan-tages of this experimental system are that it has appealing
visual effects, and the strength of the coupling and other
oscillation parameters are controllable allowing easy com-parison with theory.

Here, we take m¼2.nstarts from 1 since we consider the

Substituting Eqs. (A2) and Eq. (A3) into Eq. (16) and
equating the coefﬁcients of e,e2, and e3separately, we obtain

Because we have included all the information about the com-
plementary solution in the ﬁrst order solution Eqs. (A7),w e
should not consider the complementary solution when goingto higher orders, or else the coefﬁcients will be underdeter-
mined. Nayfeh in his book16has a further discussion. Hence,
the complementary solution of the second order equations is0. In addition, from Eqs. (A9) we know that a particular solu-
tion of Eqs. (A8) equals 0. Taking the complementary and
particular solutions together, we have
