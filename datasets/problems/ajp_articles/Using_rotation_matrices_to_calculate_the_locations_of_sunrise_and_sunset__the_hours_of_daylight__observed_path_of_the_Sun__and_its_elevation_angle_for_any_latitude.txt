During the course of one year, I photographed 95 sunrises along the east bank of the Columbia River
from my home on the west bank in Richland, WA (46.3/C14N latitude). I then calculated the seasonal
phenomena listed in the title with the intention of explaining the variation of the photographed sunrises.The calculations use a simpliﬁed model of the Sun-Earth system and employ rotation matrices to
predict the path of the Sun, as observed at any location in the northern hemisphere, throughout the year.
These predictions are in good agreement with those listed by NOAA and also with the photographicdata. The analysis presented here provides a novel way to calculate and understand the seasonal
variations of visible sunlight.

I. INTRODUCTION
Several years ago, I began a retirement project by taking
daily photographs of sunrises visible from my home on theColumbia River in Richland, WA, during an entire year.Figure 1shows a sample of those photographs taken in
September and October 2018. The photos and their analysis
were published in Ref. 1. More recently,
2the changing num-
ber of daylight hours and the elevation of the Sun at noonwere studied using geometric diagrams.
Other authors treat the same phenomena. The text by
Meeus
3discusses corrections to the basic theory due to
small effects, such as the refraction of sunlight in the
Earth’s atmosphere, that affect the number of daylight
hours. References 4and 5are popular texts for amateur
astronomers. Levine6used vector analysis to understand theduration of daylight and the position of the rising and set-
ting Sun.
In contrast to the above treatments, this paper studies the
apparent motion of the Sun by employing rotation matrices .
Using a simpliﬁed model of the solar system, discussed in
Sec. II, this approach sacriﬁces some accuracy to provide
physics students and instructors with an easier analysis anddeeper understanding of the phenomena. Reference 2pro-
vides a good background to this approach.
II. SIMPLIFIED MODEL
AND THE OP-COORDINATE SYSTEM
Our simpliﬁed model starts with a heliocentric coordinate
system: The Sun is located at the origin of the orbital plane
(OP) coordinate system, in which a spherical Earth circles
the Sun in the x
OP-yOPplane. One hemisphere of the Earth is
illuminated by sunlight, represented by a unit vector Sthat is
parallel to the line joining the centers of the Sun and Earth;
the other hemisphere is in darkness. Most of the calculations
in this paper will use the latitude of the author’s home, which
is 46.3/C14N.
Rather than using this heliocentric system, it is easier to
proceed using the geocentric coordinate system shown inFig. 2with the Earth at its origin and the Sun revolving
around it in a circular path in the OP plane. The vector S,
when directed toward the Earth’s center, makes an angle j
with the negative x
OPaxis, where jranges from 0/C14to 360/C14
during one year. The asterisks in Fig. 2indicate the circular
boundary between the light and dark hemispheres, called the
light-dark circle (LDC). As Schanges the direction each
day, the plane of the LDC changes its orientation, causing
the number of daylight hours at a particular location on
Earth to change as well.
Instead of using the calendar date, we shall specify the
day number (DN) or the angle j. For December 21 (winter
solstice), j¼0/C14and DN ¼1. While the angle jcontinually
increases, the simpliﬁed model assumes that it remains con-
stant during each day and increases abruptly by 360/C14=365
¼0:986/C14at the beginning of each new day

On December 21, j¼0;Slies along the xOPaxis, and the
LDC lies in the yOP–zOPplane. Points on the LDC (asterisks
in Fig. 2) are given in terms of OP coordinates by

where granges from 0/C14to 360/C14relative to the þyOPaxis.
When j6¼0, it is helpful to construct the vector Fthat points
from the Earth’s center to a speciﬁc location on the LDC. It hasa horizontal component F
h¼REcosgand a vertical component
Fv¼REsingthat lie in the plane of the LDC. Let us imagine
that the LDC is rotated from its initial orientation j¼0t ot h e
orientation shown in Fig. 2. In that case, the vertical component
Fvremains unchanged but the horizontal component Fhnow has
components along the – xOPaxis and the yOPaxis. The equations
for the LDC in the OP-coordinate system are now given by
xOP¼/C0REcosgsinj; (5a)
yOP¼REcosgcosj; (5b)
zOP¼REsing: (5c)
III. THE E-COORDINATE SYSTEM
A. Equation of the LDC in E-coordinates
We now introduce the E-coordinate system shown in Fig.
3, where the zEandxEaxes are rotated by 23.5/C14relative to
the OP-coordinate axes, and zEis aligned with the Earth’s N-
S axis. The xEandyEaxes lie in the planet’s equatorial plane.
Note that the Earth rotates with respect to this coordinate
system; we will later introduce a coordinate system (called
Q) that is ﬁxed with respect to points on the Earth’s surface.
The locations along the LDC that are visible in this ﬁgure
are all experiencing sunset at the moment shown, since an
observer rotating counter-clockwise with the Earth is travel-
ling from sunlight into darkness. On the opposite side of theplanet, hidden from view in Fig. 3, locations along the LDC
are experiencing sunrise since they are traveling from dark-
ness into sunlight. To ﬁnd the number of hours of daylightand to understand the apparent shift in location and direction
of sunrise shown in Fig. 1, we need to determine the x
Eand
yEcoordinates of the sunrise and sunset points for any day of
the year and for any latitude L.
The E-coordinates of the LDC can be found from the OP-
coordinates using the rotation matrices discussed in the
Appendix . For a rotation of h¼23.5/C14about the yOPaxis, Eq.
(A4) implies

The Appendix also discusses the appropriate matrices for
rotations about the x(Eq. (A6)) and zaxes (Eq. (A8)).
B. Transformation of S from the OP- to the E-coordinate
system
In Fig. 2, the sunlight vector Salways lies in the xOP–yOP
plane and has OP coordinates given by cos j;sinj;0 ðÞ . Using
Eq.(6)withh¼23:5/C14(the Earth’s tilt relative to its orbital
plane), the components of Scan be transformed from the
OP- to the E-coordinate system, with the following result:

The ﬁgure shows a top view of the Earth obtained by looking down the þzOP
axis, which is perpendicular to the plane of the paper pointing outward. The
Earth’s north pole is indicated by a solid black dot, and the south pole, on the
under-side of the Earth, by a prominent x. The LDC is marked by asterisks.Note that the LDC plane is always perpendicular to the sunlight vector S.

nates one hemisphere of Earth while the other is in darkness. On December21, the north pole is pointed away from the Sun and is in complete darkness,
while the south pole has 24 h of daylight, and points on the equator (EQ) have
12 h of daylight. Over the course of the year, the vector Srotates out of the
plane of the page as the Sun circles the Earth in the x
OP–yOPplane.

IV. SUNRISE AND SUNSET IN E-COORDINATES
In Fig. 4, the 46.3/C14N latitude circle and the LDC are plot-
ted in E-coordinates for February 20 (DN ¼62,j¼60/C14).
The intersections between the LDC and the latitude circle
correspond to sunrise and sunset locations. For j¼60/C14, the
OP coordinates of the LDC are found from Eqs. (5):
xOP;yOP;zOP ðÞ ¼REð/C0ﬃﬃﬃ

then substituted into Eq. (6)to ﬁnd their E components

(9c)
Intersections with the 46.3/C14N latitude circle are easily
found, because for that circle zE/RE¼sin(46.3/C14)¼0.7230. A
simple way to proceed is to search for solutions to Eqs. (9)
using a spreadsheet. For j¼60/C14, the results are shown in
Table I. Clearly, zE=REﬃ0:7230 when gﬃ68/C14and 153/C14.I f
more accuracy is desired, these two angles can be used as
initial estimates to locate the roots of Eq. (9c) numerically,
with the results g¼68.2/C14and 153.1/C14. Evaluating Eqs. (9a)
and (9b), the E-components are found to be (–0.6652,
0.1857, 0.7230) REand (0.5278,–0.4463, 0.7230) REfor sun-
rise and sunset, respectively. The sunrise and sunsetlocations for any other latitude Land angle jcan be found in
the same way. A second method using algebra to ﬁnd the E
coordinates of sunrise and sunset is described in the supple-
mentary material.9
Using the information above, the hours of daylight can be
easily calculated. Let vector SR/C131!(SS/C131!) be the location of the
sunrise (sunset) point relative to the center of the 46.3/C14
latitude circle, i.e., SR/C131!¼/C0 0:6652 ;0:1857 ðÞ REand SS/C131!

vectors is found using the dot product

yielding b¼155:4/C14. The number of hours of daylight is then
found from
hours of daylight ¼24b

Figures 5(a)–5(h) show the distribution of sunlight and
darkness in the northern hemisphere for eight dates spacedthroughout the year. In each ﬁgure, the x
E;yEðÞ coordinates
of the LDC (asterisks) are plotted for 0 /C20g/C20180/C14, i.e.,
points in the northern hemisphere, using Eqs. (6). In the
upper left corner for each ﬁgure, the angle jis given, fol-
lowed by the date and the day number (DN). In the upper
right corner, the angle u(deﬁned above) and the number of
daylight hours are shown. The vector Sxy, deﬁned in Eq. (8),
is drawn for each ﬁgure as the perpendicular bisector of theline connecting the sunrise and sunset points.
Many seasonal features can be understood using Fig. 5,
such as: (1) the equator always has 12 h of daylight and 12 h
of darkness; (2) for the Arctic Circle ( L¼90
/C14–23:5/C14
¼66:5/C14), there is total darkness on December 21 and total
sunlight on June 21; (3) there are 12 h of daylight every-
where on Earth on the equinoxes (March 21 and September
21); (4) in the northern hemisphere, the hours of daylightincrease from December 21 (winter solstice) to June 21(summer solstice), and then decrease until December 21; (5)
for any date, as you travel to lower latitudes, the hours of
daylight increase. Notice (6)also that from December 21 to
January 19, the hours of daylight increase only 0.6 h, whilefrom February 20 to March 21 they increase by 1.6 h. Thus,
to an observer on Earth, the Sun appears to travel slowly at
the solstices and faster at the equinoxes.
Figure 5 of Ref. 2displays the number of hours of day-
light, calculated as above, vs. the date (or day number), andcompares them to information obtained from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) web-
site.
10The precise NOAA values are about 0.2 h longer than
those calculated here, a difference of 2.4% on December 21and 1.3% on June 21. The discrepancy is due to small effects
that are not considered here, such as the refraction of sun-
light in the Earth’s atmosphere.
V. THE OBSERVER AND THE Q-COORDINATE
SYSTEM
In what direction does an observer on Earth look to view
the Sun? To answer this question, we introduce a new coor-
dinate system Q that rotates with the observer about the plan-
et’s N–S axis. As shown in Fig. 6, theþy
Qaxis points north,

Using Eqs. (5)and(9), the components of the LDC for each value of gon

theþxQaxis points east, while the þzQaxis is in the observ-
er’s vertical direction. At noon on December 21, the sunlight
vector Slies in the plane of the paper, and a straightforward
analysis using plane geometry is possible. For other locationsof the observer or other times and days of the year, rotationmatrices show what an observer sees while watching thepath of the Sun. However, keep Fig. 6in mind, as it illus-
trates the essential mathematics for determining the compo-
nents of Sin the observer’s reference frame.
On December 21, sunlight strikes the Earth at an angle of
23.5
/C14with respect to the þxEaxis, so
SE¼cos 23 :5/C14^xEþsin 23 :5/C14^zE; (12)
which agrees with Eq. (7)forj¼0. The observer views the
Sun in the direction of SOQ, which is antiparallel to S, i.e.,SOQ¼–S. The dashed line in Fig. 6is the (local) horizontal
axis – yQ, which points due south. In the ﬁgure, we see that
the sum 46.3/C14þ23.5/C14þE¼90/C14, so the elevation angle E of
the Sun is equal to 20.2/C14andSOQis given by
SOQ¼/C0cos 20 :2^yQþsin 20 :2^zQ: (13)
Equation (13) tells us what to expect (for December 21 at
noon) when rotation matrices are used.
In Fig. 6, the observer’s Q-coordinate system (called the
“upper” Q system) has its origin at the location of theobserver. However, when using a rotation matrix to trans-
form from one coordinate system to another, the origins of
the two systems must coincide. Therefore, we deﬁne anotherQ-coordinate system (called the “lower” Q system) whose

resent the Equator, 46.3/C14N latitude, and the Arctic Circle (66.5/C14N latitude). Asterisks denote the LDC, which is the boundary between sunlight and darkness.
Sxy, deﬁned in Eq. (8), points to the location of noon on the latitude circle. The upper left of each ﬁgure lists the angle j, the date, and the day number (DN).
Angle uand the hours of daylight are shown in the upper right of each ﬁgure.

axes are parallel to the upper Q system but whose origin is
located at the Earth’s center. The components of Sareidenti-
calin the upper and lower Q systems. Similarly, the xQand
yQvalues of the LDC are identical in the two systems, but
thezQvalues differ by the radius of the Earth RE. While we
visualize events in the upper Q-coordinate system, we
employ the rotation matrices using the lower Q system.
VI. USING THE Q-COORDINATE SYSTEM
TO DESCRIBE THE SUN’S PATH
A. Vectors S and SO in the Q-system
Two rotations are required to transform from the E-system
to the Q-system. Recall that all coordinate systems havetheir origin at the center of the Earth. The ﬁrst is shown inFig.7(a)for December 21: The – y
Eaxis is rotated by angle h
about the zEaxis so that it passes directly BELOW the loca-
tion of the observer. This rotation yields an intermediatecoordinate system, which we will call the M-coordinate sys-tem and label the rotation matrix R
ME. To obtain the value
ofh, we use Fig. 5(a), noting that angle b¼125:9/C14and also
that the sunlight is symmetrical about the xEaxis. The
positions of sunrise and sunset are then 180/C147b=2
¼ð117:05/C14;242:95/C14Þ. To rotate the /C0yEaxis to the sunrise
point, h¼117:05/C0270/C14¼/C0152:95/C14;where the negative
angle denotes a CW rotation. The rotation matrix RMEis
obtained by substituting h¼/C0152.95/C14in Eq. (A8) of the
Appendix .
The second rotation is shown in Fig. 7(b), where the plane
contains the zMaxis, the rotated axis yM, and the sunrise
point. After rotating by þ43:7/C14about the xMaxis, the zMaxis
passes through the sunrise point. The rotation matrix RQMis
obtained by substituting þ43.7/C14for angle hin Eq. (A6) of
theAppendix . This yields the Q-coordinate system shown in
Fig. 7(b), where the þxQ(andþxM) axes are perpendicular
to the plane of the paper, pointing outward. The “upper”
Q-system can then be constructed at the location of the
observer, with the desired arrangement of axes shown inFig. 6. For a different latitude L, the rotation angle used in
R
QMis 90/C14–L. Of course, the locations of sunrise and sunset
would need to be determined to ﬁnd angle h. The transforma-
tion from E- to Q-coordinates may, thus, be written in matrixnotation as SQ¼RQMRMESE, and the generalized equation
for the direction to the Sun, according to the observer, is
SOQ¼/C0 1ðÞ10 0

B. Sunrise and Noon on December 21
We can now use Eq. (14) to ﬁnd SOQwhen the observer
views the Sun at sunrise on December 21 ( j¼0). Evaluating

striking the Earth, while the oppositely directed vector SOQshows the direc-
tion of the Sun seen by the observer at local noon. The local north–south
direction is tangent to a longitude circle, while the east–west direction is tan-
gent to the latitude circle. The þxQaxis is perpendicular to the paper point-
ing outward.

locations between sunrise and sunset. (b) Side view of the Earth showing the
second rotation ( RQM) in which the þzMaxis is rotated by þ43.7/C14(the com-

rise location. The rotated axes are called the Q-coordinate system. The þxM
andþxQaxes are perpendicular to the plane of the paper, pointing outward.
The “upper” Q-coordinate system is drawn at the surface of the Earth and
has the arrangement of axes shown in Fig. 6.

expected, the zQcomponent is zero at sunrise.
At noon on December 21, the observer is midway between
sunrise and sunset, or on the – xEaxis, as shown in Fig. 7(a).
Therefore, the – yEaxis must be rotated CW by h¼/C090/C14

C. Path of the Sun on December 21, March 21,
and June 21
1. Path of the Sun on December 21
The apparent path of the Sun on December 21 is obtained
by evaluating Eq. (14) throughout the day, as the observer
moves from sunrise to sunset. Since h¼/C0152:95/C14at sun-
rise, and h¼/C027:05/C14at sunset (Fig. 7(a)), the value of hat
equally spaced intervals during the day is easily found. A
three-dimensional plot of (SO Qx,S O Qy,S O Qz) for 17 times
(shown as þsigns) between sunrise and sunset is displayed
in Fig. 8(a).
2. Path of the Sun on March 21 and June 21
The calculations of SO Qfor March 21 and June 21
(Figs. 8(b) and8(c))a r es i m i l a rt ot h o s ef o rD e c e m b e r2 1 ,
but since the sunrise and sunset locations are different for
each date, the value of hin Eq. (14) also changes. In Figs.
8(b) and8(c), the path of the Sun is shown for these dates.
Table IIsummarizes the calculations for the vector SO Q
on the three dates shown in Fig. 8. Elevations obtained
from the NOAA website10for the three dates are as fol-
lows: 20.31/C14,4 4 . 1 7/C14, and 67.15/C14. The values obtained here
are, thus, in excellent agreement with those computed by
NOAA.
VII. COMPARISON BETWEEN CALCULATIONS
AND PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA
In this section, we shall compare sunrise photographs
taken by the author, several of which are shown in Fig. 1,t o
the theory developed above. A simpliﬁed bird’s eye view of
the area near the author’s home is shown in Fig. 9. Distances
along the horizon were obtained by comparing features onGoogle Maps to the same features visible in the photographs,
as discussed in Ref. 1. Figure 9depicts seven sunrises chosen
about one month apart. The asterisks show where the Sunappears at dawn along the bluff of the river. The dotted lines
are drawn using the calculated values of /for these dates.
They converge at point C, which is /C251320 m west of line
AB and is taken to be the origin of the Q-coordinate system.
The distance of each sunrise from that on the equinox
(March 22) at point D is given by D
photo¼DC tan /.
To explore this further, we analyzed 55 sunrise photos
taken between June 22 and December 21, measuring thedistance of sunrise in each photo from that on the equinox
(point D, March 22).
Using the calculated value of /for each date, a linear
least-squares ﬁt11to the data (Fig. 10) yields
Dphoto¼130965 ðÞ tan/þ3462 ðÞ m: (15)
When the intercept is forced to be zero, the best ﬁt straight
line is given as follows:
Dphoto¼1302612 ðÞ tan/m: (16)
The slope of either line is very close to DC, demonstrating
that the photographic data are self-consistent and in goodagreement with the mathematical analysis. Ideally, point Gin Fig. 9(the camera location) would be coincident with
Fig. 8. The observer, located at the origin, sees these three-dimensional paths
of the Sun, which are obtained by plotting the vector SOQfor (a) December
21, (b) March 21, and (c) June 21, where the noon elevation angles E are
20.2/C14,4 3 . 7/C14,a n d6 7 . 2/C14, respectively. The bearing angle /is deﬁned in (b). At
sunrise, /is (a) – 35.2/C14(southeast), (b) 0/C14(due east), and (c) þ35.2/C14(north-
east). The time between each asterisk is approximately 30 min, so the largestnumber of asterisks appears for June 21 (summer solstice).
Table II. Results of calculations for the vector SOQ. The second column is
calculated from Eq. (14). The third column lists the sunrise angle /or the
elevation angle at noon. The term “south-east” indicates the vector SOQhas
components in the south and east directions, and so on.

point C. The fact that it is not suggests that the geometry of
Fig.9is oversimpliﬁed.
VIII. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS
When I began this project, my ﬁrst calculations predicted
8.4 h of daylight for December 21, while the local newspaper
reported a time of 8.63 h. This suggested that the simpliﬁed
model of the Earth-Sun system presented here, and the intro-duction of the light-dark circle (LDC), could provide a
straightforward explanation of the seasonal variations of sun-
light. Using rotation matrices rather than vector analysis, dia-grams such as Fig. 5were generated to explain the duration
of daylight in the northern hemisphere throughout the year. I
have not seen diagrams similar to Fig. 5in any textbook, so
perhaps they introduce a new way to visualize seasonal phe-
nomena. Further analysis using rotation matrices allows one
to explain the observed path of the Sun from any location onEarth, and the results are in good agreement with sunrise
photographs taken throughout the year.

APPENDIX A: ROTATION MATRICES
Figure 11shows two coordinate systems: System B, repre-
sented by axes with solid lines, in which vector rhas known
components ( x
B,yB,zB); and system C, with dashed lines, in
which rhasunknown components ( xC,yC,zC). In Fig. 11(a) ,
system C is obtained by rotating the X Band Z Baxes counter-
clockwise by a (positive) angle h. Because the Y Band Y C
axes are parallel, yB¼yC. The components of zBalong the
XCand Z Caxes, shown with thick dashed lines, are xC
¼/C0sinhzBandzC¼coshzB. The components of xBalong
the X Cand Z Caxes, shown with prominent dotted lines, are
xC¼coshxBandzC¼sinhxB. Summing the components on
the X Cand Z Caxes, we ﬁnd the following:
xC¼coshxB/C0sinhzB; (A1)
yC¼yB; (A2)
zC¼sinhxBþcoshzB: (A3)

River, drawn to scale. The distance AB ¼1860 m, AD ¼DB¼930 m, DE
¼110 m, EF ¼855 m, and DC ¼1320 m. Point G, indicated by the
x-symbol, is the location of the author’s home, where the photographs were
taken. It is 45 m from the bank of the Columbia River and 74 m north of
point C. The number in parentheses, below each date, indicates the DN and
the calculated angle /at sunrise.
Fig. 10. Distance between the sunrise location on a given date and that at
the equinox on March 21 is plotted on the vertical axis. For each date, angle
/is calculated and tan ( /) plotted on the horizontal axis. The solid line and
the dashed line are the least squares ﬁts to Eqs. (15) and(16). Negative val-
ues on the vertical axis were obtained from December 21 to March 21, while
positive values were obtained from March 21 to June 21.
