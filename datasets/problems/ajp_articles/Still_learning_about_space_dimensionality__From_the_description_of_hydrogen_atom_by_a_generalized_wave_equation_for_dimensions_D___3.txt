A hydrogen atom is supposed to be described by a generalization of the Schr €odinger equation, in
which the Hamiltonian depends on an iterated Laplacian and a Coulomb-like potential r/C0b.
Starting from previously obtained solutions for this equation using the 1 =Nexpansion method, it is
shown that new light can be shed on the problem of understanding the dimensionality of the world
as proposed by Paul Ehrenfest. A surprising new result is obtained. Indeed, for the ﬁrst time, we
can understand that not only the sign of the energy but also the value of the ground state energy of
hydrogen atoms is related to the threefold nature of space. #2023 Published under an exclusive license by

I. INTRODUCTION
The possibility that extra spatial dimensions can play
important role in Physics is not new. It can be traced back tothe pioneering works of Kaluza1and Klein.2Following the
general uniﬁcation idea of Kaluza–Klein,3several higher-
dimensional theories were developed, like string theory andsupersymmetry,4,5based on theoretical ideas that go beyond
the standard model of particle physics and show promise for
unifying all forces.
Indeed, the introduction of extra dimensions in the physics
of fundamental interactions has enabled a remarkable pro-
gress in two major contemporary programs: the quantizationof gravity and the uniﬁcation of the force ﬁelds of nature, for
which the mechanisms of reduction and dimensional com-
pactiﬁcation are of utmost importance.6
Around 1980, string theory was proposed to enlarge the
number of space dimensions, in this instance, as a require-
ment for describing a consistent theory of quantum gravity.
The extra dimensions were supposed to be compactiﬁed at ascale close to the Planck scale and, thus, not testable experi-
mentally in the near future.7
However, in 1998, a new approach was proposed,8where
it was shown that the weakness of gravity could be explained
by postulating two or more extra dimensions in which only
gravity could propagate. In particular, it was argued that thehierarchy problem of the standard model of elementary par-
ticles could be solved within this postulate. It is important to
stress that, in this case, the size of these extra dimensionsshould vary on a scale accessible to experimentation (rang-
ing between roughly 0.001 and 1 :97/C210
/C013m), leading,
therefore, to observable consequences in current and futureexperiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC/CERN).9,10
So, for the ﬁrst time, it was realized that extra dimensions
could also have an important impact on an open problem in
particle physics at energies ’1 TeV. Other applications are
reviewed in Refs. 9and11.
In summary , all these developments emphasize the idea
that the existence of extra dimensions could be one of the
most attractive possibilities for physics beyond the standardmodel, and such an idea may be experimentally tested.
In Sec. II, some works, aimed at understanding space
dimensionality, are brieﬂy reviewed, and their epistemologi-
cal limitations are pointed out. In Sec. III, the 1 =Nexpansion
method to a form that will be used in Sec. IVto compute the
energy levels of the hydrogen atom ground states for a gener-
alized equation in a D-dimensional ﬂat space is revised. In
this Sec. IV, a more general way of describing the hydrogen
atom is presented in Ddimensions, which, to a certain
extent, avoid the epistemological criticisms of Sec. II.
Results are presented and discussed in Sec. V, and conclud-
ing remarks are made in Sec. VI.
II. EPISTEMOLOGICAL CHALLENGE
All that was said in the Introduction brings back an old
question: How are the fundamental laws of physics andspace-time dimensionality entangled? The genesis of this
kind of investigation can be traced back to the doctoral thesis
of Immanuel Kant.
12The role played by space dimensional-
ity in determining the form of various physical laws and con-
stants of nature was reviewed in Ref. 13. For more insight on
the subject, see also Ref. 14.

A systematic scientiﬁc investigation of this general ques-
tion begins with the seminal contributions of Ehrenfest.15,16
His idea was to identify particular aspects of a physical sys-
tem or phenomenon, called by him “singular aspects,” whichcould be used to distinguish the physics in three-dimensionalspace from that in D-dimensions. To carry out this project,
he started from postulating that the form of a differentialequation—which usually describes a physical phenomenonin a three-dimensional space—is still valid for an arbitrarynumber of dimensions. As an example, Ehrenfest assumedthe motion of a planet under a central force associated withthe Newtonian gravitational potential to be still described bythe Laplace–Poisson equation, keeping the same power ofthe Laplacian operator Dand altering the number of spatial
coordinates from 3 to D. Based on the general mathematical
solution of such an equation, he imposed that they should
satisfy the postulate of the stability of orbital motion under
central forces to get at the proper number of dimensions. It isclear that, in this case, one cannot claim to have demon-strated that D¼3 for an obvious reason: The Poisson equa-
tion for the Newtonian potential is, by construction, anequation that effectively describes stable orbits in threedimensions. Thus, Ehrenfest’s result was already expectedand, actually, it has to be seen almost as a consistency checkof the theoretical description of stable planetary motion. Foran epistemological critique of Ehrenfest’s work, see Ref. 17.
Using a semi-classical approach, Ehrenfest, basing his
argument on the Niels Bohr quantization of circular atomicorbits generated by a Coulomb-like potential—formallyanalogous to the Newtonian one—and also showed that thereis no bound state for the hydrogen atom when D/C215.
In 1963, Tangherlini was the ﬁrst to formally treat the
problem of the hydrogen atom from the point of view of theSchr €odinger equation.
18This article inspired several others
that will be cited throughout the text. However, it is impor-tant to mention that even here the operator of the kinetic partof the generalized Schr €odinger’s Hamiltonian is assumed to
be still DinD-dimensions.
The postulate that the form of a given equation—obtained
without questioning space dimensionality, as has alwaysbeen the case—is still valid for arbitrary D(up to the poten-
tial energy term that can change with dimensionality, as it isthe case for Newtonian and Coulomb-like potentials) is theAchilles’ heel of any scientiﬁc discussion of space dimen-sionality. This is quite unavoidable. The only thing we cando is to change perspective and ask ourselves, as Bollini andGiambiagi did:
19Are some physical theories related to a spe-
ciﬁc number of dimensions? This means, in a certain sense,that we must go further, so far as the generalization of a
mathematical law is concerned, in order to bypass the afore-
mentioned epistemological critique. The original equationhas to be generalized into a class of plausible hypotheticalequations (for which it is just a particular case) that coulddescribe our physical system in Ddimensions, instead of
simply by enlarging the number of dimensions, while keep-ing the same original operator structure of the original law.
Inspired by this alternative point of view and with this
strategy in mind, the generalization of a particular equationmust foresee the appearance of extra integer powers ( n)i n
Hamiltonian operators (for example, D!D
n), as well as the
substitution of the potential by the generalized one and,ﬁnally, this new equation will be assumed to depend on D
coordinates. Doing so, and supposing we are able to analyti-cally solve this new equation, we can try to identify somespecial features associated with the set of parameters ( D,n)
and not only to the dimensionality D. In particular, we can
investigate whether what could be called a “singular aspect”
of Physics in D¼3 would not be a unique feature of a partic-
ular combination of both parameters Dand n. Following
these ideas, let us try to construct here one example based on
the hydrogen atom.
III. 1 =NEXPANSION METHOD IN ATOMIC
PHYSICS
Initially proposed by Gerard ’t Hooft in 1974
20,21and
developed by several authors,22–28the 1 =Nexpansion
method is also known as large Nexpansion. Originally, it
had the purpose of overcoming certain mathematical difﬁcul-
ties found in QCD but were soon applied to Atomic Physics.To better understand the motivation behind this expansion,
let’s starting start by looking at the usual Hamiltonian of the
hydrogen atom in D¼3
H¼p2
2m/C0e2
r: (1)
We could treat the potential energy as a perturbation, if we
chose to take e2as a very small value. However, this choice
would not make sense physically, as the constant ehas a spe-
ciﬁc dimension and cannot be simply changed; the value of e
depends only on the chosen units.
When we make the change of variables r¼q=me2and
p¼Pme2, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian as
H¼me4P2
2/C01
q !
: (2)
Choosing a convenient set of units ( /C22h¼m¼e¼1), the
above Hamiltonian can be reduced to the form
^H¼P2
2/C01
q !
: (3)
We observe that now this Hamiltonian does not have any
free parameters, and therefore, we cannot do a perturbative
expansion. Of course, we know that this kind of system can
be easily solved, but, suppose that wasn’t the case, and thateven a numerical solution was impractical. What could be
done?
We need to choose a parameter, which is usually given as
ﬁxed and known, and treat it as a free variable parameter.
According to ’t Hooft, such a parameter is the dimensionality
of space. Once we deﬁne space as no longer having a ﬁxed
number of dimensions, we can observe that atomic physics
becomes simpler when we take N!1 and that it can be
solved for large Nby an expansion in 1 =N.
In Sec. IV, we will undertake the step-by-step expansion
for the case of a wave equation that describes the hydrogenatom.
IV. GENERALIZED HYDROGEN ATOM
IN AD-DIMENSIONAL FLAT SPACE
No one doubts that if space has a total number of dimen-
sions D, this number should be greater than 3. This is why
we were not concerned with either the case D¼1o rD¼2.
154 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 Caruso, Oguri, and Silveira 154 04 October 2023 22:49:49
We start from the hypothesis that a hydrogen atom is
described by the wave equation
ð/C01ÞnDnw/C0a
rbw¼Ew; (4)
where Dis the D-dimensional Laplacian operator, nis an
integer, aandbare parameters, and Eis an eigenvalue.
Since the Coulomb-like potential /C24r/C0bcorresponds to a long
range force such that VðrÞ!0 when r!1 , we must have
b/C210, where the particular case b¼0 is associated with a
lnðrÞdependence. For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves
to spherically symmetric solutions for the s-wave state. The
Laplacian operator can be written as

The derivation of Eq. (4)can be found in Refs. 23,24,a n d

case n¼1. In this case, we have

In this case, the particle is at the minimum of the effective

Here, atomic units ( /C22h¼m¼e¼k¼1) are adopted in
which energies are expressed in hartree. With this convenient
choice, the above formula for E0depends only on three

independent integer parameters D,n, and b, as considered in
Ref.31.
However, bshould depend on D. In general, it is well known
that the potential should behave as 1 =rD/C02,15,16,18,33–37for
D/C213, and as ln r,f o r D¼2, if it is the solution of the D-
dimensional equation DuðrÞ¼/C0 4pdðrÞ. This choice ensures,
at least at a classical level, the electric charge ( e) conserva-
tion,34which follows from the integral form of the Gauss law.
However, this is not the most general choice for the potential,as we will see. Indeed, if we consider, as in Eq. (4), that the
operator Ds h o u l da l s ob er e p l a c e db y Dk, with kb e i n ga ni n t e -
ger, another relation among b,D,a n d kwill result. The most
general Poisson equation, in this case ( e¼1), is of the form
ðDÞkGðrÞ¼/C0 4pdðrÞ: (13)
So,bcan still depend on k.
Before we proceed to get numerical values for E0,w e
must ﬁx the dependence of both aandbparameters of the
generalized Coulomb potential, V(r), on space dimensional-
ityDand on the power ( k) of the iterated Laplacian which
appears in the radial part of the generalized Poisson equation(13)having the potential /C0ar
/C0bas a solution.
Equation (13) was studied in detail in Ref. 38, where the
Green function G(r)—which is exactly the Coulomb-like
potential for a point-like unit charge ( e¼1Þ—was calcu-
lated, resulting in the following expression for the general-
ized potential V(r) to be used in Eq. (4)
VðrÞ¼ð/C01Þkþ1CðD=2/C0kÞ
4k/C01pD=2/C01CðkÞ1
rD/C02k/C17aðD;kÞ
rD/C02k/C17a
rb:(14)
It is important to stress that, in order to have a power law
of the type r/C0bfor the potential, the parameter bshould sat-
isfy the condition b¼D/C02k/C210. Thus, in principle, the
ground state energy depends on just two parameters, i.e.,E
0¼E0ðD;kÞ.
Fork¼1 and arbitrary D, we get from Eq. (14) the well-
known result34,36
VðrÞ¼2CðD=2Þ
pðD=2/C01Þ1
ðD/C02ÞrD/C02/C17aðD;1Þ
rD/C02; (15)
and, for k¼1 and D¼3, there follows the usual three-
dimensional potential:
VðrÞ¼1
r: (16)
From a simple inspection of Eq. (14), we conclude that
whenever kis an even integer ( k¼2‘; ‘¼1;2;3;…), the
nature of the potential changes from attractive to repulsive.
Therefore, there is no bound states for even values of k.
Nonetheless, the above relation among b,D,a n d kis not
unique choice. In Ref. 39, for example, the authors made one
more assumption by ﬁxing k¼ðD/C01Þ=2 in order to assure
that the potential has always the form r/C01, a result demon-
strated in Ref. 19. The price to pay is very high, since the
Gauss law is no longer valid, leading to the necessity of modi-fying Maxwell equations in higher dimensions. In any case,we should be aware of Hermann Weyl’s classical result,
40–42
which tell us that the Maxwell equations lose scale invarianceif space-time dimension is different from 3 þ1.ForD¼3, we know that k¼1 and n¼1. Inspired by
what happens in three dimensions, we will assume through-out the paper the validity of the Gauss law for any D. The
simplest choice consistent with these facts is k¼n. So, the
ground state energy, associated with Eq. (4)for a potential
given in Eq. (14), is obtained by substituting b¼D/C02nin
Eq.(12), yielding

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Thus, in principle, E0<0i f4 n/C0D>0)D<4n.
(For D¼4n,E0diverges.) In such cases, the potential has a
ground state, and it is said to be non-singular. Whenever
D>4n, the extremum of the potential is a maximum. In this
case, the effective potential has no minimum, and it is said tobe singular. Therefore, the existence or not of a negativeenergy state as a solution of Eq. (4)depends on two integer
numbers: the power of the Laplacian ( n) and space dimen-
sionality ( D). However, in the case k¼n, we must also take
into account the constraint b¼D/C02n>0 (due to the long
range nature of the potential), which means that
2n<D<4n: (18)
So, for each power nof the Laplacian, there is a minimum
value of space dimensionality, given by D
min¼2nþ1, for
which a bound state does exist. Only for n¼1, does there
exist just one value of space dimensionality, namely,D¼D
min¼3, for which E0<0. Another conclusion we
can infer from the constraint given in Eq. (18)is that there is
no bound state for a hydrogen atoms in space with D¼3
whatever is the value of n6¼1.
Forn¼3, for example, different bound states are found
forD¼7;8;9;10, and 11. Curiously, Eq. (18) excludes the
possibility of having E0<0 for D¼4, 5, and 6, indepen-
dently of the value of n. Finally, we can see that the usual
solution of the Schr €odinger equation
/C0Dw/C0a
rw¼Ew (19)
corresponding to D¼3 and n¼1 represents the most bound
and stable solutions (see Table I) for a hydrogen atom
described in Eq. (4). The speciﬁc value E0¼/C00:11 Ha is
the same found in Ref. 28and should be compared to the
well known result –0.5 Ha. The discrepancy found here is
due to the quite modest accuracy obtained by the 1 =Nexpan-
sion when in the sequel one puts N¼3. However, this fact
does not invalidate the analysis made in this paper since theaccuracy of the method is much better for high Nvalues.
This is the only case where the ground state has a signiﬁcantbinding energy and does not show the expected features of aRydberg-like atom, even for the ﬁrst principal quantum num-ber. For example, from Table I, we see that the value of the
ground state energy found for D¼7 and n¼3 is equivalent
to the energy of the same atom in D¼3 and n¼1 having a
principal quantum number of 35. A ﬁnal comment that
156 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 91, No. 2, February 2023 Caruso, Oguri, and Silveira 156 04 October 2023 22:49:49
follows from the numbers reported in the table is that, for a
ﬁxed value of the Laplacian operator power n, the ground
state energy substantially decreases when the dimensionalityDincreases.
For completeness, although we do not believe it is the best
choice, let us discuss what kind of constraint would result
from another possibility: the case where, instead of makingk¼n, we ﬁx for any arbitrary n,k¼1. This is a more
restrictive hypothesis, which is frequently made in the litera-
ture. It means that in passing from D¼3 to a space with arbi-
trary D, the potential is recognized as still being determined
by the same Green equation as in D¼3, Eq. (13)withk¼1,
by just increasing the number of components of the D-
dimensional position vector. In such a case, the potentialshould be given in Eq. (15) and, to be compatible, Eq. (17)
must be replaced by
E
0ðD;nÞ¼/C0nðD=2Þ2n
ðD=2/C0nÞ"#D=2/C0n ðÞ =D=2/C0n/C01 ðÞ
/C2aðD;1Þ/C0n=ðD=2/C0n/C01Þ/C22n/C0D=2
n: (20)
Therefore, a less restrictive relationship between nandDis
found, namely, E0<0i f2 nþ2/C0D>0)D<2ðnþ1Þ.
However, on the other hand, the constraint b¼D/C02k/C210
reduces now to D/C212. Combining the two constraints in this
case, we must have, instead of Eq. (18), that space dimensional-
ity should be bound by the inequa lity 2/C20D<2ðnþ1Þ.S o ,
forn¼2, the following dimensions are allowed: D¼3, 4, and
5; for n¼3, for instance, E0<0 implies that space dimension-
ality s hould be D¼3;4;5;6, and 7. These results (correspond-
i n gt ot h ec h o i c e k¼1) are quite different from the case where
n¼k,f o rw h i c h7 /C20D/C2011. Therefore, we can conclude
that, for k¼1, different negative values for E0can be found
for different possible values of D.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In summary, assuming that a hydrogen atom is described
in Eqs. (4)and(14), with the choice n¼k, we have learned
that:
(1) the only possibility of having a bound state in D¼3i s
with n¼1;(2) any other combination of Dand nwill give rise to a
ground state energy which, in magnitude, will be at least
103less than the measured value 0.5 Ha;
(3) nature seems to favor three-dimensional space and the
description of the hydrogen atoms in terms of the usual
Schr €odinger equation with the kinetic term of the
Hamiltonian proportional to D.
Finally, it is important to stress that we were able to shed
a new light on Ehrenfest’s approach trying to explain space
dimensionality from a physical point of view.15,16In fact, we
have not only found the possible combinations of the param-
eters Dandn, which correspond to a stable bound state solu-
tion of hydrogen atoms but have gone further. Indeed, to the
best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time one has a theoreti-
cal framework in which it is possible to understand, in addi-
tion to the query of atomic stability, that the measured value
for the energy of the hydrogen atom ground state, –0.5 Ha, is
a consequence of the very particular combination: D¼3 and
n¼1.
