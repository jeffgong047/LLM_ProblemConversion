The paper focuses on the Mpemba effect, which is a phenomenon where, under certain conditions, hot water can freeze faster than cold water. This effect seems counterintuitive, and despite being observed many times throughout history, a universally accepted explanation has not been established.

Problem: In a subfreezing environment, it has been observed that initially hot water can freeze before initially cold water, even when both are placed in identical conditions. The naive assumption is that the hot water should cool down to the temperature of the cold water and then both should freeze at the same rate. However, this is not the case.
