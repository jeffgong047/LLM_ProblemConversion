The paper aims to address the challenge of measuring the displacement of vibrating mechanical structures, specifically the in-plane lateral displacements of objects. Characterizing these displacements is crucial for understanding the material properties or the eigenmodes of an object. Standard methods either lack subpixel accuracy or are cost-prohibitive.
