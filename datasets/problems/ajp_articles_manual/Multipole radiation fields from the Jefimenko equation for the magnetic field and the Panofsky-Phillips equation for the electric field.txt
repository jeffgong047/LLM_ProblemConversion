Problem Description:

Objective: The aim is to derive the first multipole contributions, such as the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole, to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by any arbitrary localized source. The derivation should come directly from the Jefimenko equation for the magnetic field and the Panofsky-Phillips equation for the electric field.
Background: Typically, the derivation of electromagnetic fields from arbitrary sources in a vacuum starts by determining the electromagnetic potentials. From these potentials, the electromagnetic fields are computed using relations like Jefimenko's equations. However, these equations aren't frequently derived directly from Maxwell's equations. The challenge here is to derive the radiation fields from these foundational equations without the intermediate step.
Significance: The direct derivation could provide a more streamlined method to address a classical problem in electromagnetic theory, bypassing the potentially redundant step of determining electromagnetic potentials first.
Context: There are multiple references that shed light on Jefimenkoâ€™s original work, derivations from Maxwell's equations, and alternative versions of the equations more suited for studying radiation.
Scope: The focus of the problem is on deriving the electric and magnetic fields for a point charge in any given motion, then expanding these equations to account for other situations, like particles with both electric and magnetic charges in motion.
