Problem Description:
A wide range of atomic physics experiments are conducted in external static electric fields. For these experiments, it's essential to calculate the electric field generated by specific arrangements of electrical conductors. This is particularly crucial for collision experiments involving Rydberg atoms in a unique atomic state. These atoms undergo laser excitation into a Rydberg state within the ion-atom chamber. This excitation requires a very homogeneous electric field; otherwise, the atomic energy levels misalign with the laser, preventing excitation. As these atoms travel, the electric field changes in magnitude, and the atoms shift into a coherent elliptical state. Later, they enter another chamber section where the field is weaker but uniform, undergoing charge-transfer collisions. The ion-atom chamber comprises a grounded cylindrical shell with multiple conducting rings. Adjusting the potential of these rings can manipulate the field strength and homogeneity within different chamber regions.

For predicting the chamber's electric potential, one must solve Laplaceâ€™s equation with the proper boundary conditions. While the equation can be solved directly for simpler setups, realistic chambers require numerical solutions. Using commercial software often does not give a thorough understanding of the underlying physics, making it difficult to adapt them to specific experimental details.
