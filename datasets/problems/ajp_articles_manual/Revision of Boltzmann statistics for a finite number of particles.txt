The paper aims to revisit the traditional use of the Stirling approximation in the derivation of the exponential Boltzmann distribution.
This approximation describes the populations of non-degenerate energy states for non-interacting particles in an isolated system.
 A key equation in this context is Stirling's approximation, which is given by:
ln(n!)≈nln(n)−n
However, for small values of n, this approximation does not provide accurate results.
The Stirling formula and the Stirling series provide more exact representations of the factorial functionln(n!).
The problem here is to see if the use of a more precise version of the Stirling's approximation could lead to a more accurate formulation of the Boltzmann distribution,
 especially for a finite number of particles.
