A quadratic polynomial p(x) with real coefficients and leading coefficient 1 is called disrespectful if the equation p(p(x)) = 0 is satisfied by exactly three real numbers. Among all the disrespectful quadratic polynomials, there is a unique such polynomial p̃(x) for which the sum of the roots is maximized. What is p̃(1)?
