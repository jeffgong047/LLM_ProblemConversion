Let c be a real number, and let z_1, z_2 be the two complex numbers satisfying the quadratic z^2 - cz + 10 = 0. Points z_1, z_2, 1/z_1, and 1/z_2 are the vertices of a (convex) quadrilateral Q in the complex plane. When the area of Q obtains its maximum value, c is the closest to which of the following?
