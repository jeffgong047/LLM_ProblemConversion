A collection of circles in the upper half-plane, all tangent to the x-axis, is constructed in layers as follows. Layer L_0 consists of two circles of radii 70^2 and 73^2 that are externally tangent. For k≥ 1, the circles in ⋃_j=0^k-1 L_j are ordered according to their points of tangency with the x-axis. For every pair of consecutive circles in this order, a new circle is constructed externally tangent to each of the two circles in the pair. Layer L_k consists of the 2^k-1 circles constructed in this way. Let S=⋃_j=0^6 L_j, and for every circle C denote by r(C) its radius. What is
    ∑_C∈ S1√(r(C))?
