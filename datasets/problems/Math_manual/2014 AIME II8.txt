Circle C with radius 2 has diameter AB. Circle D is internally tangent to circle C at A. Circle E is internally tangent to circle C, externally tangent to circle D, and tangent to AB. The radius of circle D is three times the radius of circle E and can be written in the form √(m) - n, where m and n are positive integers. Find m+n.
