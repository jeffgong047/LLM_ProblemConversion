Circles ω_1 and ω_2 intersect at points X and Y. Line ℓ is tangent to ω_1 and ω_2 at A and B, respectively, with line AB closer to point X than to Y. Circle ω passes through A and B intersecting ω_1 again at D ≠ A and intersecting ω_2 again at C ≠ B. The three points C, Y, D are collinear, XC = 67, XY = 47, and XD = 37. Find AB^2.
