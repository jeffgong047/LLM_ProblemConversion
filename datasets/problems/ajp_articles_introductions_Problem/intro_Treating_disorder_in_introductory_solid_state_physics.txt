However, disordered solids and amorphous materials are
beyond the scope of introductory courses, because their con-
stituent atoms are not arranged in a periodic manner, so
Bloch’s theory is not applicable. In his celebrated paper“Absence of diffusion in certain random lattices,” Anderson
tackled the problem of an electron in a three-dimensional
random lattice.
