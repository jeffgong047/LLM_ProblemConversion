Thermal diffusivity controls the heat transfer process via the equation $2T¼a/C01ð@T=@tÞ, where Tis the temperature andais the thermal diffusivity. This equation describes one of the most important physical phenomena governing theworld-heat transfer and exchange. Thermal diffusivity is expressed mathematically as a¼k/qc, where ais the thermal diffusivity in m2/s,qis the density (kg/m3), and cis the specific heat (J/(kg K)).
