{
Circles with centers P, Q and R, having radii 1, 2 and 3, respectively, lie on the same side of line l and are tangent to l at P', Q' and R', respectively, with Q' between P' and R'. The circle with center Q is externally tangent to each of the other two circles. What is the area of triangle PQR?
