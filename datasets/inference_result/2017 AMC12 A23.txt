Please provide response that are separated by , only. 
{
For certain real numbers a, b, and c, the polynomial
    g(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + x + 10
has three distinct roots, and each root of g(x) is also a root of the polynomial
    f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c.
What is f(1)?
}

Answer:

Based on the given problem, the three best theorems applicable for solving the question are:

1. Descartes' Theorem: This theorem states that if a polynomial of degree n has three distinct roots, then the remaining n-3 roots are symmetric about the middle root. In this case, we can use Descartes' TheoremVICEs theorem to find the remaining roots of the polynomial f(x).
2. Bezout's Theorem: This theorem states that if two polynomials g(x) and h(x) have a common root, then there exists a polynomial k(x) such that g(x)k(x) = h(x). In this case, we can use Bezout Rose theorem to find the roots of the polynomial f(x).
3. Pythagorean Theorem: This theorem states that for any real numbers a, b, and c, the following equation holds: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. In this case, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of f(1).

Therefore, the three best theorems applicable for solving the given problem are Descartes' Theorem, Bezout's Theorem, and Pythagorean Theorem.
