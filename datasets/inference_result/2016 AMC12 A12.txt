You are an expert at mathematics. Your job is to select the three best theorems most applicable for solving the given problem.
     You do not need to solve the problem. You must select your answer from this list of theorems: wilson's theorem, bayes' theorem, thales's theorem, morley's trisector theorem, viviani's theorem, ﻿ceva’s theorem, ﻿de moivre’s theorem, rédei's theorem, ﻿chinese remainder theorem, menelaus's theorem, intermediate value theorem, pythagorean theorem, ﻿angle bisector theorem, squeeze theorem, ﻿vieta’s formulas, exterior angle theorem, binomial theorem, ﻿bezout’s theorem, ﻿binomial theorem, de gua's theorem, rational root theorem, ﻿descartes’ theorem, ﻿pythagorean theorem, prime number theorem, pick's theorem, niven's theorem, pitot theorem, dirichlet's approximation theorem, fermat's little theorem, brianchon's theorem, miquel's theorem, ﻿dirichlet’s theorem on arithmetic progressions, descartes's theorem{question}What 3 theorems are best applicable for solving following question? Please provide response that are separated by , only. 
{
In ABC, AB = 6, BC = 7, and CA = 8. Point D lies on BC, and AD bisects ∠ BAC. Point E lies on AC, and BE bisects ∠ ABC. The bisectors intersect at F. What is the ratio AF : FD?

The theorems I can choose from are:

dirichlet’Generally, the best theorems to use in solving geometry problems are the ones that deal with angles, triangles, and similarity. Here are my top three choices for the problem you provided:

1. Thales's theorem: This theorem states that if AD is the bisector of ∠BAC, then AF:FD = 2:1. This theorem is applicable because we know that AD is the bisector of ∠BAC, and we can use it to find the ratio AF:FD.
2. Ceva's theorem: This theorem states that if AC, BC, and AB are the sides of a triangle, and AD is the bisector of ∠BAC, then AF:FD = BC:CA. This theorem is applicable because we know that AD is the bisector of ∠BAC, and we can use it to find the ratio AF:FD.
3. Pythagorean theorem: This theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This theorem is applicable because we know that ∠BAC is a right triangle, and we can use it to find the length of AF and FD.

Therefore, my top three choices for theorems to use in solving the problem are Thales's theorem, Ceva's theorem, and the Pythagorean theorem.
