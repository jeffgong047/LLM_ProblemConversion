er: Hermite extended the work of Fourier by approximating the function ex not with a polynomial but with a rational function, that is a quotient of two polynomials. In particular he chose polynomials A(x) and B(x) such that the auxiliary function R defined by R(x)=B(x)exâˆ’A(x)(x)=B(x)e^x-A(x) could be made as small as he wanted around x = 0. But if er were rational then R(r) would have to be rational with a particular denominator, yet Hermite could make R(r) too small to have such a denominator, hence a contradiction. Hermite's proof of the transcendence of
