determinants: After the myriad of successes gleaned from using existent but not explicit auxiliary functions, in the 1990s Michel Laurent introduced the idea of interpolation determinants.[9] These are alternants – determinants of matrices of the form M=(φi(ζj))1≤i,j≤Nℳ=(φ_i(ζ_j))_1,j where φi are a set of functions interpolated at a set of points ζj. Since a determinant is just a polynomial in the entries of a matrix, these auxiliary functions succumb to study by analytic means. A problem with the method was the need to choose a basis before the matrix could be worked with. A development by Jean-Benoît Bost removed this problem with the use of Arakelov theory,[10] and research in this area is ongoing. The example below gives an idea of the flavour of this approach.
