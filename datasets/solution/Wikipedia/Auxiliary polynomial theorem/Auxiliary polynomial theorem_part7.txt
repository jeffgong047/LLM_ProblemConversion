e: To prove that e was in fact transcendental, Hermite took his work one step further by approximating not just the function ex, but also the functions ekx for integers k = 1,...,m, where he assumed e was algebraic with degree m. By approximating ekx by rational functions with integer coefficients and with the same denominator, say Ak(x) / B(x), he could define auxiliary functions Rk(x) by Rk(x)=B(x)ekx−Ak(x)._k(x)=B(x)e^kx-A_k(x). For his contradiction Hermite supposed that e satisfied the polynomial equation with integer coefficients a0 + a1e + ... + amem = 0. Multiplying this expression through by B(1) he noticed that it implied R=a0+a1R1(1)+⋯+amRm(1)=a1A1(1)+⋯+amAm(1).=a_0+a_1R_1(1)+⋯+a_mR_m(1)=a_1A_1(1)+⋯+a_mA_m(1). The right hand side is an integer and so, by estimating the auxiliary functions and proving that 0 < |R| < 1 he derived the necessary contradiction. Auxiliary functions from the pigeonhole
