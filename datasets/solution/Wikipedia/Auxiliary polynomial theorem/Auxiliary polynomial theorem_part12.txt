theorem: One of the simpler applications of this method is a proof of the real version of the Hermite–Lindemann theorem. That is, if α is a non-zero, real algebraic number, then eα is transcendental. First we let k be some natural number and n be a large multiple of k. The interpolation determinant considered is the determinant Δ of the n4×n4 matrix (exp⁡(j2x)xj1−1(i1−1)|x=(i2−1)α).({exp(j_2x)x^j_1-1}^(i_1-1)|_x=(i_2-1)α). The rows of this matrix are indexed by 1 ≤ i1 ≤ n4/k and 1 ≤ i2 ≤ k, while the columns are indexed by 1 ≤ j1 ≤ n3 and 1 ≤ j2 ≤ n. So the functions in our matrix are monomials in x and ex and their derivatives, and we are interpolating at the k points 0,α,2α,...,(k − 1)α. Assuming that eα is algebraic we can form the number field Q(α,eα) of degree m over Q, and then multiply Δ by a suitable denominator as well as all its images under the embeddings of the field Q(α,eα) into C. For algebraic reasons this product is necessarily an integer, and using arguments relating to Wronskians it can be shown that it is non-zero, so its absolute value is an integer Ω ≥ 1. Using a version of the mean value theorem for matrices it is possible to get an analytic bound on Ω as well, and in fact using big-O notation we have Ω=O(exp⁡((m+1k−32)n8log⁡n)).Ω=O(exp((m+1/k-3/2)n^8)). The number m is fixed by the degree of the field Q(α,eα), but k is the number of points we are interpolating at, and so we can increase it at will. And once k > 2(m + 1)/3 we will have Ω → 0, eventually contradicting the established condition Ω ≥ 1. Thus eα cannot be algebraic after all.[11]
