e: Another simple, early occurrence is in Fourier's proof of the irrationality of e,[3] though the notation used usually disguises this fact. Fourier's proof used the power series of the exponential function: ex=∑n=0∞xnn!.^x=∑_n=0^∞x^n/n!. By truncating this power series after, say, N + 1 terms we get a polynomial with rational coefficients of degree N which is in some sense "close" to the function ex. Specifically if we look at the auxiliary function defined by the remainder: R(x)=ex−∑n=0Nxnn!(x)=e^x-∑_n=0^Nx^n/n! then this function—an exponential polynomial—should take small values for x close to zero. If e is a rational number then by letting x = 1 in the above formula we see that R(1) is also a rational number. However, Fourier proved that R(1) could not be rational by eliminating every possible denominator. Thus e cannot be rational. Hermite's proof of the irrationality of
