Medicine: Copulæ have many applications in the area of medicine, for example, Copulæ have been used in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for example, to segment images,[46] to fill a vacancy of graphical models in imaging genetics in a study on schizophrenia,[47] and to distinguish between normal and Alzheimer patients.[48] Copulæ have been in the area of brain research based on EEG signals, for example, to detect drowsiness during daytime nap,[49] to track changes in instantaneous equivalent bandwidths (IEBWs),[50] to derive synchrony for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,[51] to characterize dependence in oscillatory activity between EEG channels,[52] and to assess the reliability of using methods to capture dependence between pairs of EEG channels using their time-varying envelopes.[53] Copula functions have been successfully applied to the analysis of neuronal dependencies[54] and spike counts in neuroscience .[55] A copula model has been developed in the field of oncology, for example, to jointly model genotypes, phenotypes, and pathways to reconstruct a cellular network to identify interactions between specific phenotype and multiple molecular features (e.g. mutations and gene expression change). Bao et al.[56] used NCI60 cancer cell line data to identify several subsets of molecular features that jointly perform as the predictors of clinical phenotypes. The proposed copula may have an impact on biomedical research, ranging from cancer treatment to disease prevention. Copula has also been used to predict the histological diagnosis of colorectal lesions from colonoscopy images,[57] and to classify cancer subtypes.[58] A Copula-based analysis model has been developed in the field of heart and cardiovascular disease, for example, to predict heart rate (HR) variation. Heart rate (HR) is one of the most critical health indicators for monitoring exercise intensity and load degree because it is closely related to heart rate. Therefore, an accurate short-term HR prediction technique can deliver efficient early warning for human health and decrease harmful events. Namazi (2022)[59] used a novel hybrid algorithm to predict HR.
