bounds: Graphs of the bivariate Fréchet–Hoeffding copula limits and of the independence copula (in the middle). The Fréchet–Hoeffding theorem (after Maurice René Fréchet and Wassily Hoeffding[10]) states that for any Copula C:[0,1]d→[0,1]:[0,1]^d→[0,1] and any (u1,…,ud)∈[0,1]d(u_1,…,u_d)∈[0,1]^d the following bounds hold: W(u1,…,ud)≤C(u1,…,ud)≤M(u1,…,ud).(u_1,…,u_d)(u_1,…,u_d)(u_1,…,u_d). The function W is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as W(u1,…,ud)=max1−d+∑i=1dui,0.(u_1,…,u_d)=max{1-d+∑_i=1^du_i, 0}. The function M is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as M(u1,…,ud)=minu1,…,ud.(u_1,…,u_d)=min{u_1,…,u_d}. The upper bound is sharp: M is always a copula, it corresponds to comonotone random variables. The lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed u, there is a copula C C̃ such that C (u)=W(u)C̃(u)=W(u). However, W is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables. In two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding theorem states maxu+v−1,0≤C(u,v)≤minu,vmax{u+v-1, 0}(u,v)≤min{u,v}. Families of
