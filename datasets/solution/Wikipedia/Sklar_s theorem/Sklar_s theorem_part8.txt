copula: Cumulative and density distribution of Gaussian copula with ρ = 0.4 The Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit hypercube [0,1]d[0,1]^d. It is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over Rdℝ^d by using the probability integral transform. For a given correlation matrix R∈[−1,1]d×d∈[-1,1]^d, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix R can be written as CRGauss(u)=ΦR(Φ−1(u1),…,Φ−1(ud)),_R^Gauss(u)=Φ_R(Φ^-1(u_1),…,Φ^-1(u_d)), where Φ−1Φ^-1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and ΦRΦ_R is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix R. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, CRGauss(u)_R^Gauss(u), it can be upper or lower bounded, and approximated using numerical integration.[11][12] The density can be written as[13] cRGauss(u)=1detRexp⁡(−12(Φ−1(u1)⋮Φ−1(ud))T⋅(R−1−I)⋅(Φ−1(u1)⋮Φ−1(ud))),_R^Gauss(u)=1/√(R)exp(-1/2[ Φ^-1(u_1); ⋮; Φ^-1(u_d) ]^T·(R^-1-I)·[ Φ^-1(u_1); ⋮; Φ^-1(u_d) ]), where I𝐈 is the identity matrix.
