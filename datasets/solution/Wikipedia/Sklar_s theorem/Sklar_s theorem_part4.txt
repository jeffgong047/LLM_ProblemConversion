theorem: Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula Sklar's theorem, named after Abe Sklar, provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.[5][6] Sklar's theorem states that every multivariate cumulative distribution function H(x1,…,xd)=Pr[X1≤x1,…,Xd≤xd](x_1,…,x_d)=[X_1_1,…,X_d_d] of a random vector (X1,X2,…,Xd)(X_1,X_2,…,X_d) can be expressed in terms of its marginals Fi(xi)=Pr[Xi≤xi]_i(x_i)=[X_i_i] and a copula C. Indeed: H(x1,…,xd)=C(F1(x1),…,Fd(xd)).(x_1,…,x_d)=C(F_1(x_1),…,F_d(x_d)). If the multivariate distribution has a density h, and if this density is available, it also holds that h(x1,…,xd)=c(F1(x1),…,Fd(xd))⋅f1(x1)⋅⋯⋅fd(xd),(x_1,…,x_d)=c(F_1(x_1),…,F_d(x_d))_1(x_1)·…_d(x_d), where c is the density of the copula. The theorem also states that, given H, the copula is unique on Ran⁡(F1)×⋯×Ran⁡(Fd)Ran(F_1)×⋯×Ran(F_d), which is the cartesian product of the ranges of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals Fi_i are continuous. The converse is also true: given a copula C:[0,1]d→[0,1]:[0,1]^d→[0,1] and marginals Fi(x)_i(x) then C(F1(x1),…,Fd(xd))(F_1(x_1),…,F_d(x_d)) defines a d-dimensional cumulative distribution function with marginal distributions Fi(x)_i(x).
