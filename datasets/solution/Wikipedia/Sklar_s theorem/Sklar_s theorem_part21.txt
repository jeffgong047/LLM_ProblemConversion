research: Copulas have been used in both theoretical and applied analyses of hydroclimatic data. Theoretical studies adopted the copula-based methodology for instance to gain a better understanding of the dependence structures of temperature and precipitation, in different parts of the world.[9][62][63] Applied studies adopted the copula-based methodology to examine e.g., agricultural droughts[64] or joint effects of temperature and precipitation extremes on vegetation growth.[65] Climate and weather
