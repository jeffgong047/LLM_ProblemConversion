condition: Copulas mainly work when time series are stationary[7] and continuous.[8] Thus, a very important pre-processing step is to check for the auto-correlation, trend and seasonality within time series. When time series are auto-correlated, they may generate a non existing dependence between sets of variables and result in incorrect Copula dependence structure.[9] Fréchet–Hoeffding copula
