copulas: Archimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula. In practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence. A copula C is called Archimedean if it admits the representation[14] C(u1,…,ud;θ)=ψ[−1](ψ(u1;θ)+⋯+ψ(ud;θ);θ)(u_1,…,u_d;θ)=ψ^[-1](ψ(u_1;θ)+⋯+ψ(u_d;θ);θ) where ψ:[0,1]×Θ→[0,∞)ψ:[0,1]×Θ→[0,∞) is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that ψ(1;θ)=0ψ(1;θ)=0, θθ is a parameter within some parameter space ΘΘ, and ψψ is the so-called generator function and ψ[−1]ψ^[-1] is its pseudo-inverse defined by ψ[−1](t;θ)=ψ−1(t;θ)if0≤t≤ψ(0;θ)0ifψ(0;θ)≤t≤∞.ψ^[-1](t;θ)={[ ψ^-1(t;θ) 0≤ψ(0;θ); 0 ψ(0;θ)≤∞. ]. Moreover, the above formula for C yields a copula for ψ−1ψ^-1 if and only if ψ−1ψ^-1 is d-monotone on [0,∞)[0,∞).[15] That is, if it is d−2-2 times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy (−1)kψ−1,(k)(t;θ)≥0(-1)^kψ^-1,(k)(t;θ)≥0 for all t≥0≥0 and k=0,1,…,d−2=0,1,…,d-2 and (−1)d−2ψ−1,(d−2)(t;θ)(-1)^d-2ψ^-1,(d-2)(t;θ) is nonincreasing and convex.
