function: For any two random variables X and Y, the continuous joint probability distribution function can be written as FXY(x,y)=PrX≤x,Y≤y,_XY(x,y)=X≤x,Y≤y, where FX(x)=PrX≤x_X(x)=X≤x and FY(y)=PrY≤y_Y(y)=Y≤y are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of the random variables X and Y, respectively. then the copula distribution function C(u,v)(u,v) can be defined using Sklar's theorem[74][75] as: FXY(x,y)=C(FX(x),FY(y))≜C(u,v)_XY(x,y)=C(F_X(x),F_Y(y))(u,v), where u=FX(x)=F_X(x) and v=FY(y)=F_Y(y) are marginal distribution functions, FXY(x,y)_XY(x,y) joint and u,v∈(0,1),v∈(0,1). Assuming FXY(⋅,⋅)_XY(·,·) is a.e. twice differentiable, we start by using the relationship between joint probability density function (PDF) and joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its partial derivatives. fXY(x,y)=∂2FXY(x,y)∂x∂y⋮fXY(x,y)=∂2C(FX(x),FY(y))∂x∂y⋮fXY(x,y)=∂2C(u,v)∂u∂v⋅∂FX(x)∂x⋅∂FY(y)∂y⋮fXY(x,y)=c(u,v)fX(x)fY(y)⋮fXY(x,y)fX(x)fY(y)=c(u,v)6f_XY(x,y)= ∂^2F_XY(x,y) ⋮ f_XY(x,y)= ∂^2C(F_X(x),F_Y(y)) ⋮ f_XY(x,y)= ∂^2C(u,v) ·_X(x)·_Y(y) ⋮ f_XY(x,y)= c(u,v)f_X(x)f_Y(y) ⋮ f_XY(x,y)/f_X(x)f_Y(y)= c(u,v) where c(u,v)(u,v) is the copula density function, fX(x)_X(x) and fY(y)_Y(y) are the marginal probability density functions of X and Y, respectively. It is important to understand that there are four elements in this equation, and if any three elements are known, the fourth element can be calculated. For example, it may be used, when joint probability density function between two random variables is known, the copula density function is known, and one of the two marginal functions are known, then, the other marginal function can be calculated, or when the two marginal functions and the copula density function are known, then the joint probability density function between the two random variables can be calculated, or when the two marginal functions and the joint probability density function between the two random variables are known, then the copula density function can be calculated.
