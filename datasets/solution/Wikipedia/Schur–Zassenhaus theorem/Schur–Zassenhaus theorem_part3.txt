Examples: If we do not impose the coprime condition, the theorem is not true: consider for example the cyclic group C4_4 and its normal subgroup C2_2. Then if C4_4 were a semidirect product of C2_2 and C4/C2≅C2_4/C_2_2 then C4_4 would have to contain two elements of order 2, but it only contains one. Another way to explain this impossibility of splitting C4_4 (i.e. expressing it as a semidirect product) is to observe that the automorphisms of C2_2 are the trivial group, so the only possible [semi]direct product of C2_2 with itself is a direct product (which gives rise to the Klein four-group, a group that is non-isomorphic with C4_4). An example where the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem does apply is the symmetric group on 3 symbols, S3_3, which has a normal subgroup of order 3 (isomorphic with C3_3) which in turn has index 2 in S3_3 (in agreement with the theorem of Lagrange), so S3/C3≅C2_3/C_3_2. Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem applies and S3≅C3⋊C2_3_3_2. Note that the automorphism group of C3_3 is C2_2 and the automorphism of C3_3 used in the semidirect product that gives rise to S3_3 is the non-trivial automorphism that permutes the two non-identity elements of C3_3. Furthermore, the three subgroups of order 2 in S3_3 (any of which can serve as a complement to C3_3 in S3_3) are conjugate to each other. The non-triviality of the (additional) conjugacy conclusion can be illustrated with the Klein four-group V as the non-example. Any of the three proper subgroups of V (all of which have order 2) is normal in V; fixing one of these subgroups, any of the other two remaining (proper) subgroups complements it in V, but none of these three subgroups of V is a conjugate of any other one, because V is abelian. The quaternion group has normal subgroups of order 4 and 2 but is not a [semi]direct product. Schur's papers at the beginning of the 20th century introduced the notion of central extension to address examples such as C4_4 and the quaternions.
