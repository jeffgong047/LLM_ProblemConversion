Generalization of John von Neumann's minimax theorem
In mathematics, and in particular game theory, Sion's minimax theorem is a generalization of John von Neumann's minimax theorem, named after Maurice Sion.
It states:
Let X be a compact convex subset of a linear topological space and Y a convex subset of a linear topological space.  If f is a real-valued function on X×Y with

f(x,⋅)(x,·) upper semicontinuous  and quasi-concave on Y, ∀x∈X, and
f(⋅,y)(·,y) lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on X, ∀y∈Y
then,

minx∈Xsupy∈Yf(x,y)=supy∈Yminx∈Xf(x,y).min_xsup_yf(x,y)=sup_ymin_xf(x,y).
