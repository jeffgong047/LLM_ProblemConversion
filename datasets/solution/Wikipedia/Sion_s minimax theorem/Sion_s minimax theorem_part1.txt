Generalization of John von Neumann's minimax theorem In mathematics, and in particular game theory, Sion's minimax theorem is a generalization of John von Neumann's minimax theorem, named after Maurice Sion. It states: Let X be a compact convex subset of a linear topological space and Y a convex subset of a linear topological space. If f is a real-valued function on X×Y with f(x,⋅)(x,·) upper semicontinuous and quasi-concave on Y, ∀x∈X, and f(⋅,y)(·,y) lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on X, ∀y∈Y then, minx∈Xsupy∈Yf(x,y)=supy∈Yminx∈Xf(x,y).min_xsup_yf(x,y)=sup_ymin_xf(x,y).
