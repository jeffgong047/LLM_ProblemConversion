mappings: Koebe's uniformization theorem for normal families also generalizes to yield uniformizers f for multiply-connected domains to finite parallel slit domains, where the slits have angle θθ to the x-axis. Thus if G is a domain in C∪∞ℂ∪{∞} containing ∞∞ and bounded by finitely many Jordan contours, there is a unique univalent function f on G with f(z)=z−1+a1z+a2z2+⋯(z)=z^-1+a_1z+a_2z^2+⋯ near ∞∞, maximizing Re(e−2iθa1)Re(e^-2iθa_1) and having image f(G)(G) a parallel slit domain with angle θθ to the x-axis.[22][23][24] The first proof that parallel slit domains were canonical domains for in the multiply connected case was given by David Hilbert in 1909. Jenkins (1958), on his book on univalent functions and conformal mappings, gave a treatment based on the work of Herbert Grötzsch and René de Possel from the early 1930s; it was the precursor of quasiconformal mappings and quadratic differentials, later developed as the technique of extremal metric due to Oswald Teichmüller.[25] Menahem Schiffer gave a treatment based on very general variational principles, summarised in addresses he gave to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950 and 1958. In a theorem on "boundary variation" (to distinguish it from "interior variation"), he derived a differential equation and inequality, that relied on a measure-theoretic characterisation of straight-line segments due to Ughtred Shuttleworth Haslam-Jones from 1936. Haslam-Jones' proof was regarded as difficult and was only given a satisfactory proof in the mid-1970s by Schober and Campbell–Lamoureux.[26][27][28] Schiff (1993) gave a proof of uniformization for parallel slit domains which was similar to the Riemann mapping theorem. To simplify notation, horizontal slits will be taken. Firstly, by Bieberbach's inequality, any univalent function g(z)=z+cz2+⋯(z)=z+cz^2+⋯ with z in the open unit disk must satisfy |c|≤2|c|≤2. As a consequence, if f(z)=z+a0+a1z−1+⋯(z)=z+a_0+a_1z^-1+⋯ is univalent in |z|>R|z|>R, then |f(z)−a0|≤2|z||f(z)-a_0|≤2|z|. To see this, take S>R>R and set g(z)=S(f(S/z)−b)−1(z)=S(f(S/z)-b)^-1 for z in the unit disk, choosing b so the denominator is nowhere-vanishing, and apply the Schwarz lemma. Next the function fR(z)=z+R2/z_R(z)=z+R^2/z is characterized by an "extremal condition" as the unique univalent function in z>R>R of the form z+a1z−1+⋯+a_1z^-1+⋯ that maximises Re(a1)Re(a_1): this is an immediate consequence of Grönwall's area theorem, applied to the family of univalent functions f(zR)/R(zR)/R in z>1>1.[29][30] To prove now that the multiply connected domain G⊂C∪∞⊂ℂ∪{∞} can be uniformized by a horizontal parallel slit conformal mapping f(z)=z+a1z−1+⋯(z)=z+a_1z^-1+⋯, take R large enough that ∂G lies in the open disk |z|<R|z|<R. For S>R>R, univalency and the estimate |f(z)|≤2|z||f(z)|≤2|z| imply that, if z lies in G with |z|≤S|z|, then |f(z)|≤2S|f(z)|≤2S. Since the family of univalent f are locally bounded in G∖∞∖{∞}, by Montel's theorem they form a normal family. Furthermore if fn_n is in the family and tends to f uniformly on compacta, then f is also in the family and each coefficient of the Laurent expansion at ∞∞ of the fn_n tends to the corresponding coefficient of f. This applies in particular to the coefficient: so by compactness there is a univalent f which maximizes Re(a1)Re(a_1). To check that f(z)=z+a1+⋯(z)=z+a_1+⋯ is the required parallel slit transformation, suppose reductio ad absurdum that f(G)=G1(G)=G_1 has a compact and connected component K of its boundary which is not a horizontal slit. Then the complement G2_2 of K in C∪∞ℂ∪{∞} is simply connected with G2⊃G1_2_1. By the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping h(w)=w+b1w−1+⋯,(w)=w+b_1w^-1+⋯, such that h(G2)(G_2) is Cℂ with a horizontal slit removed. So we have that h(f(z))=z+(a1+b1)z−1+⋯,(f(z))=z+(a_1+b_1)z^-1+⋯, and thus Re(a1+b1)≤Re(a1)Re(a_1+b_1)≤Re(a_1) by the extremality of f. Therefore, Re(b1)≤0Re(b_1)≤0. On the other hand by the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping k(w)=w+c0+c1w−1+⋯,(w)=w+c_0+c_1w^-1+⋯, mapping from |w|>S|w|>S onto G2_2. Then f(k(w))−c0=w+(a1+c1)w−1+⋯.(k(w))-c_0=w+(a_1+c_1)w^-1+⋯. By the strict maximality for the slit mapping in the previous paragraph, we can see that Re(c1)<Re(b1+c1)Re(c_1)<Re(b_1+c_1), so that Re(b1)>0Re(b_1)>0. The two inequalities for Re(b1)Re(b_1) are contradictory.[31][32][33] The proof of the uniqueness of the conformal parallel slit transformation is given in Goluzin (1969) and Grunsky (1978). Applying the inverse of the Joukowsky transform h to the horizontal slit domain, it can be assumed that G is a domain bounded by the unit circle C0_0 and contains analytic arcs Ci_i and isolated points (the images of other the inverse of the Joukowsky transform under the other parallel horizontal slits). Thus, taking a fixed a∈G, there is a univalent mapping F0(w)=h∘f(w)=(w−a)−1+a1(w−a)+a2(w−a)2+⋯,_0(w)=h(w)=(w-a)^-1+a_1(w-a)+a_2(w-a)^2+⋯, with its image a horizontal slit domain. Suppose that F1(w)_1(w) is another uniformizer with F1(w)=(w−a)−1+b1(w−a)+b2(w−a)2+⋯._1(w)=(w-a)^-1+b_1(w-a)+b_2(w-a)^2+⋯. The images under F0_0 or F1_1 of each Ci_i have a fixed y-coordinate so are horizontal segments. On the other hand, F2(w)=F0(w)−F1(w)_2(w)=F_0(w)-F_1(w) is holomorphic in G. If it is constant, then it must be identically zero since F2(a)=0_2(a)=0. Suppose F2_2 is non-constant, then by assumption F2(Ci)_2(C_i) are all horizontal lines. If t is not in one of these lines, Cauchy's argument principle shows that the number of solutions of F2(w)=t_2(w)=t in G is zero (any t will eventually be encircled by contours in G close to the Ci_i's). This contradicts the fact that the non-constant holomorphic function F2_2 is an open mapping.[34] Sketch proof via Dirichlet
