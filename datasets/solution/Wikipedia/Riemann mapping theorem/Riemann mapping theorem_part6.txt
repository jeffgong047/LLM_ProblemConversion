theorem: Weierstrass' convergence theorem. The uniform limit on compacta of a sequence of holomorphic functions is holomorphic; similarly for derivatives. This is an immediate consequence of Morera's theorem for the first statement. Cauchy's integral formula gives a formula for the derivatives which can be used to check that the derivatives also converge uniformly on compacta.[12] Hurwitz's theorem. If a sequence of nowhere-vanishing holomorphic functions on an open domain has a uniform limit on compacta, then either the limit is identically zero or the limit is nowhere-vanishing. If a sequence of univalent holomorphic functions on an open domain has a uniform limit on compacta, then either the limit is constant or the limit is univalent. If the limit function is non-zero, then its zeros have to be isolated. Zeros with multiplicities can be counted by the winding number 12πi∫Cg−1(z)g′(z)dz1/2∫_Cg^-1(z)g'(z)dz for a holomorphic function g. Hence winding numbers are continuous under uniform limits, so that if each function in the sequence has no zeros nor can the limit. For the second statement suppose that f(a)=f(b)(a)=f(b) and set gn(z)=fn(z)−fn(a)_n(z)=f_n(z)-f_n(a). These are nowhere-vanishing on a disk but g(z)=f(z)−f(a)(z)=f(z)-f(a) vanishes at b, so g must vanish identically.[13] Definitions. A family FF of holomorphic functions on an open domain is said to be normal if any sequence of functions in FF has a subsequence that converges to a holomorphic function uniformly on compacta. A family FF is compact if whenever a sequence fn_n lies in FF and converges uniformly to f on compacta, then f also lies in FF. A family FF is said to be locally bounded if their functions are uniformly bounded on each compact disk. Differentiating the Cauchy integral formula, it follows that the derivatives of a locally bounded family are also locally bounded.[14][15] Montel's theorem. Every locally bounded family of holomorphic functions in a domain G is normal. Let fn_n be a totally bounded sequence and chose a countable dense subset wm_m of G. By locally boundedness and a "diagonal argument", a subsequence can be chosen so that gn_n is convergent at each point wm_m. It must be verified that this sequence of holomorphic functions converges on G uniformly on each compactum K. Take E open with K⊂E such that the closure of E is compact and contains G. Since the sequence gn′{g_n'} is locally bounded, |gn′|≤M|g_n'| on E. By compactness, if δ>0δ>0 is taken small enough, finitely many open disks Dk_k of radius δ>0δ>0 are required to cover K while remaining in E. Since gn(b)−gn(a)=∫abgn′(z)dz_n(b)-g_n(a)=∫_a^bg_n^'(z) dz, we have that |gn(a)−gn(b)|≤M|a−b|≤2δM|g_n(a)-g_n(b)||a-b|≤2. Now for each k choose some wi_i in Dk_k where gn(wi)_n(w_i) converges, take n and m so large to be within δδ of its limit. Then for z∈Dk_k, |gn(z)−gm(z)|≤|gn(z)−gn(wi)|+|gn(wi)−gm(wi)|+|gm(w1)−gm(z)|≤4Mδ+2δ.|g_n(z)-g_m(z)|≤|g_n(z)-g_n(w_i)|+|g_n(w_i)-g_m(w_i)|+|g_m(w_1)-g_m(z)|≤4Mδ+2δ. Hence the sequence gn{g_n} forms a Cauchy sequence in the uniform norm on K as required.[16][17] Riemann mapping theorem. If G≠C≠ℂ is a simply connected domain and a∈G, there is a unique conformal mapping f of G onto the unit disk D normalized such that f(a)=0(a)=0 and f′(a)>0'(a)>0. Uniqueness follows because if f and g satisfied the same conditions, h=f∘g−1=f^-1 would be a univalent holomorphic map of the unit disk with h(0)=0(0)=0 and h′(0)>0'(0)>0. But by the Schwarz lemma, the univalent holomorphic maps of the unit disk onto itself are given by the Möbius transformations k(z)=eiθ(z−α)/(1−α¯z)(z)=e^iθ(z-α)/(1-αz) with |α|<1|α|<1. So h must be the identity map and f=g=g. To prove existence, take FF to be the family of holomorphic univalent mappings f of G into the open unit disk D with f(a)=0(a)=0 and f′(a)>0'(a)>0. It is a normal family by Montel's theorem. By the characterization of simple-connectivity, for b∈C∖G∈ℂ there is a holomorphic branch of the square root h(z)=z−b(z)=√(z-b) in G. It is univalent and h(z1)≠−h(z2)(z_1)≠-h(z_2) for z1,z2∈G_1,z_2. Since h(G)(G) must contain a closed disk ΔΔ with centre h(a)(a) and radius r>0>0, no points of −Δ-Δ can lie in h(G)(G). Let F be the unique Möbius transformation taking C∖−Δℂ∖-Δ onto D with the normalization F(h(a))=0(h(a))=0 and F′(h(a))>0'(h(a))>0. By construction F∘h is in FF, so that FF is non-empty. The method of Koebe is to use an extremal function to produce a conformal mapping solving the problem: in this situation it is often called the Ahlfors function of G, after Ahlfors.[18] Let 0<M≤∞0<M≤∞ be the supremum of f′(a)'(a) for f∈F∈F. Pick fn∈F_n∈F with fn′(a)_n'(a) tending to M. By Montel's theorem, passing to a subsequence if necessary, fn_n tends to a holomorphic function f uniformly on compacta. By Hurwitz's theorem, f is either univalent or constant. But f has f(a)=0(a)=0 and f′(a)>0'(a)>0. So M is finite, equal to f′(a)>0'(a)>0 and f∈Ff∈F. It remains to check that the conformal mapping f takes G onto D. If not, take c≠0≠0 in D∖f(G)(G) and let H be a holomorphic square root of (f(z)−c)/(1−c¯f(z))(f(z)-c)/(1-cf(z)) on G. The function H is univalent and maps G into D. Let F(z)=eiθ(H(z)−H(a))1−H(a)¯H(z),(z)=e^iθ(H(z)-H(a))/1-H(a)H(z), where H′(a)/|H′(a)|=e−iθ'(a)/|H'(a)|=e^-iθ. Then F∈F∈F and a routine computation shows that F′(a)=H′(a)/(1−|H(a)|2)=f′(a)(|c|+|c|−1)/2>f′(a)=M.'(a)=H'(a)/(1-|H(a)|^2)=f'(a)(√(|c|)+√(|c|^-1))/2>f'(a)=M. This contradicts the maximality of M, so that f must take all values in D.[19][20][21] Remark. As a consequence of the Riemann mapping theorem, every simply connected domain in the plane is homeomorphic to the unit disk. If points are omitted, this follows from the theorem. For the whole plane, the homeomorphism ϕ(x)=z/(1+|z|)ϕ(x)=z/(1+|z|) gives a homeomorphism of Cℂ onto D. Parallel slit
