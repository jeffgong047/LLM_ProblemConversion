problem: Given U and a point z0∈U_0, we want to construct a function f which maps U to the unit disk and z0_0 to 00. For this sketch, we will assume that U is bounded and its boundary is smooth, much like Riemann did. Write f(z)=(z−z0)eg(z),(z)=(z-z_0)e^g(z), where g=u+iv=u+iv is some (to be determined) holomorphic function with real part u and imaginary part v. It is then clear that z0_0 is the only zero of f. We require |f(z)|=1|f(z)|=1 for z∈∂U∈, so we need u(z)=−log⁡|z−z0|(z)=-log|z-z_0| on the boundary. Since u is the real part of a holomorphic function, we know that u is necessarily a harmonic function; i.e., it satisfies Laplace's equation. The question then becomes: does a real-valued harmonic function u exist that is defined on all of U and has the given boundary condition? The positive answer is provided by the Dirichlet principle. Once the existence of u has been established, the Cauchy–Riemann equations for the holomorphic function g allow us to find v (this argument depends on the assumption that U be simply connected). Once u and v have been constructed, one has to check that the resulting function f does indeed have all the required properties.[35] Uniformization
