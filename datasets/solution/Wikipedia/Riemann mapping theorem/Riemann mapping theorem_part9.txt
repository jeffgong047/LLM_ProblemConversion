theorem: The Riemann mapping theorem can be generalized to the context of Riemann surfaces: If U is a non-empty simply-connected open subset of a Riemann surface, then U is biholomorphic to one of the following: the Riemann sphere, the complex plane Câ„‚, or the unit disk D. This is known as the uniformization theorem. Smooth Riemann mapping
