Algorithms: Computational conformal mapping is prominently featured in problems of applied analysis and mathematical physics, as well as in engineering disciplines, such as image processing. In the early 1980s an elementary algorithm for computing conformal maps was discovered. Given points z0,…,zn_0,…,z_n in the plane, the algorithm computes an explicit conformal map of the unit disk onto a region bounded by a Jordan curve γγ with z0,…,zn∈γ._0,…,z_n∈γ. This algorithm converges for Jordan regions[37] in the sense of uniformly close boundaries. There are corresponding uniform estimates on the closed region and the closed disc for the mapping functions and their inverses. Improved estimates are obtained if the data points lie on a C1^1 curve or a K-quasicircle. The algorithm was discovered as an approximate method for conformal welding; however, it can also be viewed as a discretization of the Loewner differential equation.[38] The following is known about numerically approximating the conformal mapping between two planar domains.[39] Positive results: There is an algorithm A that computes the uniformizing map in the following sense. Let ΩΩ be a bounded simply-connected domain, and w0∈Ω_0∈Ω. ∂Ω∂Ω is provided to A by an oracle representing it in a pixelated sense (i.e., if the screen is divided to 2n×2n2^n×2^n pixels, the oracle can say whether each pixel belongs to the boundary or not). Then A computes the absolute values of the uniformizing map ϕ:(Ω,w0)→(D,0)ϕ:(Ω,w_0)→(D,0) with precision 2−n2^-n in space bounded by Cn2^2 and time 2O(n)2^O(n), where C depends only on the diameter of ΩΩ and d(w0,∂Ω).(w_0,∂Ω). Furthermore, the algorithm computes the value of ϕ(w)ϕ(w) with precision 2−n2^-n as long as |ϕ(w)|<1−2−n.|ϕ(w)|<1-2^-n. Moreover, A queries ∂Ω∂Ω with precision of at most 2−O(n).2^-O(n). In particular, if ∂Ω∂Ω is polynomial space computable in space na^a for some constant a≥1≥1 and time T(n)<2O(na),(n)<2^O(n^a), then A can be used to compute the uniformizing map in space C⋅nmax(a,2)^max(a,2) and time 2O(na).2^O(n^a). There is an algorithm A′ that computes the uniformizing map in the following sense. Let ΩΩ be a bounded simply-connected domain, and w0∈Ω._0∈Ω. Suppose that for some n=2k,=2^k, ∂Ω∂Ω is given to A′ with precision 1n1n by O(n2)(n^2) pixels. Then A′ computes the absolute values of the uniformizing map ϕ:(Ω,w0)→(D,0)ϕ:(Ω,w_0)→(D,0) within an error of O(1/n)(1/n) in randomized space bounded by O(k)(k) and time polynomial in n=2k=2^k (that is, by a BPL(n)-machine). Furthermore, the algorithm computes the value of ϕ(w)ϕ(w) with precision 1n1n as long as |ϕ(w)|<1−1n.|ϕ(w)|<1-1n. Negative results: Suppose there is an algorithm A that given a simply-connected domain ΩΩ with a linear-time computable boundary and an inner radius >1/2>1/2 and a number n computes the first 20n20n digits of the conformal radius r(Ω,0),(Ω,0), then we can use one call to A to solve any instance of a #SAT(n) with a linear time overhead. In other words, #P is poly-time reducible to computing the conformal radius of a set. Consider the problem of computing the conformal radius of a simply-connected domain Ω,Ω, where the boundary of ΩΩ is given with precision 1/n1/n by an explicit collection of O(n2)(n^2) pixels. Denote the problem of computing the conformal radius with precision 1/nc1/n^c by CONF(n,nc).(n,n^c). Then, MAJn_n is AC0 reducible to CONF(n,nc)(n,n^c) for any 0<c<12.0<c<12. See
