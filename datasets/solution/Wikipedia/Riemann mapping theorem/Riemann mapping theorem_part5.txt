connectivity: Theorem. For an open domain G⊂C⊂ℂ the following conditions are equivalent:[9] G is simply connected; the integral of every holomorphic function f around a closed piecewise smooth curve in G vanishes; every holomorphic function in G is the derivative of a holomorphic function; every nowhere-vanishing holomorphic function f on G has a holomorphic logarithm; every nowhere-vanishing holomorphic function g on G has a holomorphic square root; for any w∉G, the winding number of w for any piecewise smooth closed curve in G is 00; the complement of G in the extended complex plane C∪∞ℂ∪{∞} is connected. (1) ⇒ (2) because any continuous closed curve, with base point a∈G, can be continuously deformed to the constant curve a. So the line integral of fdz dz over the curve is 00. (2) ⇒ (3) because the integral over any piecewise smooth path γγ from a to z can be used to define a primitive. (3) ⇒ (4) by integrating f−1df/dz^-1 df/dz along γγ from a to x to give a branch of the logarithm. (4) ⇒ (5) by taking the square root as g(z)=exp⁡(f(x)/2)(z)=exp(f(x)/2) where f is a holomorphic choice of logarithm. (5) ⇒ (6) because if γγ is a piecewise closed curve and fn_n are successive square roots of z−w-w for w outside G, then the winding number of fn∘γ_n∘γ about w is 2n2^n times the winding number of γγ about 00. Hence the winding number of γγ about w must be divisible by 2n2^n for all n, so it must equal 00. (6) ⇒ (7) for otherwise the extended plane C∪∞∖Gℂ∪{∞} can be written as the disjoint union of two open and closed sets A and B with ∞∈B∞ and A bounded. Let δ>0δ>0 be the shortest Euclidean distance between A and B and build a square grid on Cℂ with length δ/4δ/4 with a point a of A at the centre of a square. Let C be the compact set of the union of all squares with distance ≤δ/4≤δ/4 from A. Then C∩B=∅=∅ and ∂C does not meet A or B: it consists of finitely many horizontal and vertical segments in G forming a finite number of closed rectangular paths γj∈Gγ_j. Taking Ci_i to be all the squares covering A, then 12π∫∂Cdarg(z−a)1/2π∫_darg(z-a) equals the sum of the winding numbers of Ci_i over a, thus giving 11. On the other hand the sum of the winding numbers of γjγ_j about a equals 11. Hence the winding number of at least one of the γjγ_j about a is non-zero. (7) ⇒ (1) This is a purely topological argument. Let γγ be a piecewise smooth closed curve based at z0∈G_0. By approximation γ is in the same homotopy class as a rectangular path on the square grid of length δ>0δ>0 based at z0_0; such a rectangular path is determined by a succession of N consecutive directed vertical and horizontal sides. By induction on N, such a path can be deformed to a constant path at a corner of the grid. If the path intersects at a point z1_1, then it breaks up into two rectangular paths of length <N<N, and thus can be deformed to the constant path at z1_1 by the induction hypothesis and elementary properties of the fundamental group. The reasoning follows a "northeast argument":[10][11] in the non self-intersecting path there will be a corner z0_0 with largest real part (easterly) and then amongst those one with largest imaginary part (northerly). Reversing direction if need be, the path go from z0−δ_0-δ to z0_0 and then to w0=z0−inδ_0=z_0-inδ for n≥1≥1 and then goes leftwards to w0−δ_0-δ. Let R be the open rectangle with these vertices. The winding number of the path is 00 for points to the right of the vertical segment from z0_0 to w0_0 and −1-1 for points to the right; and hence inside R. Since the winding number is 00 off G, R lies in G. If z is a point of the path, it must lie in G; if z is on ∂R but not on the path, by continuity the winding number of the path about z is −1-1, so z must also lie in G. Hence R∪∂R⊂G∪. But in this case the path can be deformed by replacing the three sides of the rectangle by the fourth, resulting in two less sides (with self-intersections permitted). Riemann mapping
