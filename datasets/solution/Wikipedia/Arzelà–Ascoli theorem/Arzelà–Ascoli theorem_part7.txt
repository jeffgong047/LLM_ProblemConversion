spaces: The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem holds, more generally, if the functions fn take values in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd, and the proof is very simple: just apply the R-valued version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem d times to extract a subsequence that converges uniformly in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence that converges uniformly in the first two coordinates, and so on. The above examples generalize easily to the case of functions with values in Euclidean space. Compact metric spaces and compact Hausdorff
