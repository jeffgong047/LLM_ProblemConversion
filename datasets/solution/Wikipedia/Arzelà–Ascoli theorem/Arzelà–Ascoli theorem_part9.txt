spaces: The Arzela-Ascoli theorem generalises to functions X→Y where X is not compact. Particularly important are cases where X is a topological vector space. Recall that if X is a topological space and Y is a uniform space (such as any metric space or any topological group, metrisable or not), there is the topology of compact convergence on the set F(X,Y)𝔉(X,Y) of functions X→Y; it is set up so that a sequence (or more generally a filter or net) of functions converges if and only if it converges uniformly on each compact subset of X. Let Cc(X,Y)𝒞_c(X,Y) be the subspace of F(X,Y)𝔉(X,Y) consisting of continuous functions, equipped with the topology of compact convergence. Then one form of the Arzèla-Ascoli theorem is the following: Let X be a topological space, Y a Hausdorff uniform space and H⊂Cc(X,Y)⊂𝒞_c(X,Y) an equicontinuous set of continuous functions such that H(x)(x) is relatively compact in Y for each x∈X. Then H is relatively compact in H⊂Cc(X,Y)⊂𝒞_c(X,Y). This theorem immediately gives the more specialised statements above in cases where X is compact and the uniform structure of Y is given by a metric. There are a few other variants in terms of the topology of precompact convergence or other related topologies on F(X,Y)𝔉(X,Y). It is also possible to extend the statement to functions that are only continuous when restricted to the sets of a covering of X by compact subsets.
