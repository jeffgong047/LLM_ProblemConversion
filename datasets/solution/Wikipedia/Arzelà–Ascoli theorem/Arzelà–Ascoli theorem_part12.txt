examples: To every function g that is p-integrable on [0, 1], with 1 < p ≤ ∞, associate the function G defined on [0, 1] by G(x)=∫0xg(t)dt.(x)=∫_0^xg(t) dt. Let F be the set of functions G corresponding to functions g in the unit ball of the space Lp([0, 1]). If q is the Hölder conjugate of p, defined by 1/p + 1/q = 1, then Hölder's inequality implies that all functions in F satisfy a Hölder condition with α = 1/q and constant M = 1. It follows that F is compact in C([0, 1]). This means that the correspondence g → G defines a compact linear operator T between the Banach spaces Lp([0, 1]) and C([0, 1]). Composing with the injection of C([0, 1]) into Lp([0, 1]), one sees that T acts compactly from Lp([0, 1]) to itself. The case p = 2 can be seen as a simple instance of the fact that the injection from the Sobolev space H01(Ω)_0^1(Ω) into L2(Ω), for Ω a bounded open set in Rd, is compact. When T is a compact linear operator from a Banach space X to a Banach space Y, its transpose T ∗ is compact from the (continuous) dual Y ∗ to X ∗. This can be checked by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. Indeed, the image T(B) of the closed unit ball B of X is contained in a compact subset K of Y. The unit ball B∗ of Y ∗ defines, by restricting from Y to K, a set F of (linear) continuous functions on K that is bounded and equicontinuous. By Arzelà–Ascoli, for every sequence {y∗n}, in B∗, there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on K, and this implies that the image T∗(ynk∗)^*(y_n_k^*) of that subsequence is Cauchy in X ∗. When f is holomorphic in an open disk D1 = B(z0, r), with modulus bounded by M, then (for example by Cauchy's formula) its derivative f ′ has modulus bounded by 2M/r in the smaller disk D2 = B(z0, r/2). If a family of holomorphic functions on D1 is bounded by M on D1, it follows that the family F of restrictions to D2 is equicontinuous on D2. Therefore, a sequence converging uniformly on D2 can be extracted. This is a first step in the direction of Montel's theorem. Let C([0,T],L1(RN))([0,T],L^1(ℝ^N)) be endowed with the uniform metric supt∈[0,T]‖v(⋅,t)−w(⋅,t)‖L1(RN).sup_t∈[0,T]v(·,t)-w(·,t)_L^1(ℝ^N). Assume that un=un(x,t)⊂C([0,T];L1(RN))_n=u_n(x,t)([0,T];L^1(ℝ^N)) is a sequence of solutions of a certain partial differential equation (PDE), where the PDE ensures the following a priori estimates: x↦un(x,t)_n(x,t) is equicontinuous for all t, x↦un(x,t)_n(x,t) is equitight for all t, and, for all (t,t′)∈[0,T]×[0,T](t,t')∈[0,T]×[0,T] and all n∈N∈ℕ, ‖un(⋅,t)−un(⋅,t′)‖L1(RN)u_n(·,t)-u_n(·,t')_L^1(ℝ^N) is small enough when |t−t′||t-t'| is small enough. Then by the Fréchet–Kolmogorov theorem, we can conclude that x↦un(x,t):n∈N{x_n(x,t):n∈ℕ} is relatively compact in L1(RN)^1(ℝ^N). Hence, we can, by (a generalization of) the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, conclude that un:n∈N{u_n:n∈ℕ} is relatively compact in C([0,T],L1(RN)).([0,T],L^1(ℝ^N)). See
