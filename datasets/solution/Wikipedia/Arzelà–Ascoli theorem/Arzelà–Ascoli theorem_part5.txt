functions: The argument given above proves slightly more, specifically If { fn } is a uniformly bounded sequence of real valued functions on [a, b] such that each f is Lipschitz continuous with the same Lipschitz constant K: |fn(x)−fn(y)|≤K|x−y||f_n(x)-f_n(y)||x-y| for all x, y ∈ [a, b] and all fn , then there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on [a, b]. The limit function is also Lipschitz continuous with the same value K for the Lipschitz constant. A slight refinement is A set F of functions f on [a, b] that is uniformly bounded and satisfies a Hölder condition of order α, 0 < α ≤ 1, with a fixed constant M, |f(x)−f(y)|≤M|x−y|α,x,y∈[a,b]|f(x)-f(y)| |x-y|^α,,y∈[a,b] is relatively compact in C([a, b]). In particular, the unit ball of the Hölder space C0,α([a, b]) is compact in C([a, b]). This holds more generally for scalar functions on a compact metric space X satisfying a Hölder condition with respect to the metric on X.
