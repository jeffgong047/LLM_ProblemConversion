consequences: By definition, a sequence fnn∈N{f_n}_n∈ℕ of continuous functions on an interval I = [a, b] is uniformly bounded if there is a number M such that |fn(x)|≤M|f_n(x)| for every function fn belonging to the sequence, and every x ∈ [a, b]. (Here, M must be independent of n and x.) The sequence is said to be uniformly equicontinuous if, for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that |fn(x)−fn(y)|<ε|f_n(x)-f_n(y)|<ε whenever |x − y| < δ for all functions fn in the sequence. (Here, δ may depend on ε, but not x, y or n.) One version of the theorem can be stated as follows: Consider a sequence of real-valued continuous functions { fn }n ∈ N defined on a closed and bounded interval [a, b] of the real line. If this sequence is uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous, then there exists a subsequence { fnk }k ∈ N that converges uniformly. The converse is also true, in the sense that if every subsequence of { fn } itself has a uniformly convergent subsequence, then { fn } is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. Proof The proof is essentially based on a diagonalization argument. The simplest case is of real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval: Let I = [a, b] ⊂ R be a closed and bounded interval. If F is an infinite set of functions f : I → R which is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, then there is a sequence fn of elements of F such that fn converges uniformly on I. Fix an enumeration {xi}i ∈N of rational numbers in I. Since F is uniformly bounded, the set of points {f(x1)}f∈F is bounded, and hence by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, there is a sequence {fn1} of distinct functions in F such that {fn1(x1)} converges. Repeating the same argument for the sequence of points {fn1(x2)}, there is a subsequence {fn2} of {fn1} such that {fn2(x2)} converges. By induction this process can be continued forever, and so there is a chain of subsequences fn1⊇fn2⊇⋯{f_n_1}⊇{f_n_2}⊇⋯ such that, for each k = 1, 2, 3, ..., the subsequence {fnk} converges at x1, ..., xk. Now form the diagonal subsequence {f} whose mth term fm is the mth term in the mth subsequence {fnm}. By construction, fm converges at every rational point of I. Therefore, given any ε > 0 and rational xk in I, there is an integer N = N(ε, xk) such that |fn(xk)−fm(xk)|<ε3,n,m≥N.|f_n(x_k)-f_m(x_k)|<ε3,,m. Since the family F is equicontinuous, for this fixed ε and for every x in I, there is an open interval Ux containing x such that |f(s)−f(t)|<ε3|f(s)-f(t)|<ε3 for all f ∈ F and all s, t in I such that s, t ∈ Ux. The collection of intervals Ux, x ∈ I, forms an open cover of I. Since I is closed and bounded, by the Heine–Borel theorem I is compact, implying that this covering admits a finite subcover U1, ..., UJ. There exists an integer K such that each open interval Uj, 1 ≤ j ≤ J, contains a rational xk with 1 ≤ k ≤ K. Finally, for any t ∈ I, there are j and k so that t and xk belong to the same interval Uj. For this choice of k, |fn(t)−fm(t)|≤|fn(t)−fn(xk)|+|fn(xk)−fm(xk)|+|fm(xk)−fm(t)|<ε3+ε3+ε3|f_n(t)-f_m(t)| ≤|f_n(t)-f_n(x_k)|+|f_n(x_k)-f_m(x_k)|+|f_m(x_k)-f_m(t)| <ε3+ε3+ε3 for all n, m > N = max{N(ε, x1), ..., N(ε, xK)}. Consequently, the sequence {fn} is uniformly Cauchy, and therefore converges to a continuous function, as claimed. This completes the proof. Immediate
