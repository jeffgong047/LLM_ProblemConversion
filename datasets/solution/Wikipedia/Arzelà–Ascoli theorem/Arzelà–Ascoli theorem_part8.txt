spaces: The definitions of boundedness and equicontinuity can be generalized to the setting of arbitrary compact metric spaces and, more generally still, compact Hausdorff spaces. Let X be a compact Hausdorff space, and let C(X) be the space of real-valued continuous functions on X. A subset F ⊂ C(X) is said to be equicontinuous if for every x ∈ X and every ε > 0, x has a neighborhood Ux such that ∀y∈Ux,∀f∈F:|f(y)−f(x)|<ε._x,∈𝐅: |f(y)-f(x)|<ε. A set F ⊂ C(X, R) is said to be pointwise bounded if for every x ∈ X, sup|f(x)|:f∈F<∞.sup{|f(x)|:f∈𝐅}<∞. A version of the Theorem holds also in the space C(X) of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X (Dunford & Schwartz 1958, §IV.6.7): Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Then a subset F of C(X) is relatively compact in the topology induced by the uniform norm if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded. The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is thus a fundamental result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. Various generalizations of the above quoted result are possible. For instance, the functions can assume values in a metric space or (Hausdorff) topological vector space with only minimal changes to the statement (see, for instance, Kelley & Namioka (1982, §8), Kelley (1991, Chapter 7)): Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and Y a metric space. Then F ⊂ C(X, Y) is compact in the compact-open topology if and only if it is equicontinuous, pointwise relatively compact and closed. Here pointwise relatively compact means that for each x ∈ X, the set Fx = { f (x) : f ∈ F} is relatively compact in Y. In the case that Y is complete, the proof given above can be generalized in a way that does not rely on the separability of the domain. On a compact Hausdorff space X, for instance, the equicontinuity is used to extract, for each ε = 1/n, a finite open covering of X such that the oscillation of any function in the family is less than ε on each open set in the cover. The role of the rationals can then be played by a set of points drawn from each open set in each of the countably many covers obtained in this way, and the main part of the proof proceeds exactly as above. A similar argument is used as a part of the proof for the general version which does not assume completeness of Y. Functions on non-compact
