functions: Solutions of numerical schemes for parabolic equations are usually piecewise constant, and therefore not continuous, in time. As their jumps nevertheless tend to become small as the time step goes to 00, it is possible to establish uniform-in-time convergence properties using a generalisation to non-continuous functions of the classical Arzelà–Ascoli theorem (see e.g. Droniou & Eymard (2016, Appendix)). Denote by S(X,Y)(X,Y) the space of functions from X to Y endowed with the uniform metric dS(v,w)=supt∈XdY(v(t),w(t))._S(v,w)=sup_td_Y(v(t),w(t)). Then we have the following: Let X be a compact metric space and Y a complete metric space. Let vnn∈N{v_n}_n∈ℕ be a sequence in S(X,Y)(X,Y) such that there exists a function ω:X×X→[0,∞]ω:X→[0,∞] and a sequence δnn∈N⊂[0,∞){δ_n}_n∈ℕ⊂[0,∞) satisfying limdX(t,t′)→0ω(t,t′)=0,limn→∞δn=0,lim_d_X(t,t')→0ω(t,t')=0, lim_n→∞δ_n=0, ∀(t,t′)∈X×X,∀n∈N,dY(vn(t),vn(t′))≤ω(t,t′)+δn.∀(t,t'), ∈ℕ,_Y(v_n(t),v_n(t'))≤ω(t,t')+δ_n. Assume also that, for all t∈X, vn(t):n∈N{v_n(t):n∈ℕ} is relatively compact in Y. Then vnn∈N{v_n}_n∈ℕ is relatively compact in S(X,Y)(X,Y), and any limit of vnn∈N{v_n}_n∈ℕ in this space is in C(X,Y)(X,Y).
