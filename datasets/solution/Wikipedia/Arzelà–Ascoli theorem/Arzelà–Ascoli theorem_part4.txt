functions: The hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied by a uniformly bounded sequence { fn } of differentiable functions with uniformly bounded derivatives. Indeed, uniform boundedness of the derivatives implies by the mean value theorem that for all x and y, |fn(x)−fn(y)|≤K|x−y|,|f_n(x)-f_n(y)||x-y|, where K is the supremum of the derivatives of functions in the sequence and is independent of n. So, given ε > 0, let δ = ε/2K to verify the definition of equicontinuity of the sequence. This proves the following corollary: Let {fn} be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued differentiable functions on [a, b] such that the derivatives {fn′} are uniformly bounded. Then there exists a subsequence {fnk} that converges uniformly on [a, b]. If, in addition, the sequence of second derivatives is also uniformly bounded, then the derivatives also converge uniformly (up to a subsequence), and so on. Another generalization holds for continuously differentiable functions. Suppose that the functions fn are continuously differentiable with derivatives f′n. Suppose that fn′ are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, and that the sequence { fn }, is pointwise bounded (or just bounded at a single point). Then there is a subsequence of the { fn } converging uniformly to a continuously differentiable function. The diagonalization argument can also be used to show that a family of infinitely differentiable functions, whose derivatives of each order are uniformly bounded, has a uniformly convergent subsequence, all of whose derivatives are also uniformly convergent. This is particularly important in the theory of distributions. Lipschitz and Hölder continuous
