flows: See also: Ricci flow ยง Relationship to uniformization and geometrization Richard S. Hamilton showed that the normalized Ricci flow on a closed surface uniformizes the metric (i.e., the flow converges to a constant curvature metric). However, his proof relied on the uniformization theorem. The missing step involved Ricci flow on the 2-sphere: a method for avoiding an appeal to the uniformization theorem (for genus 0) was provided by Chen, Lu & Tian (2006);[2] a short self-contained account of Ricci flow on the 2-sphere was given in Andrews & Bryan (2010).
