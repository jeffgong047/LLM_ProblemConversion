2-manifolds: On an oriented 2-manifold, a Riemannian metric induces a complex structure using the passage to isothermal coordinates. If the Riemannian metric is given locally as ds2=Edx2+2Fdxdy+Gdy2,^2=E dx^2+2F dx dy+G dy^2, then in the complex coordinate z = x + iy, it takes the form ds2=λ|dz+μdz¯|2,^2=λ|dz+μ dz|^2, where λ=14(E+G+2EG−F2),μ=14λ(E−G+2iF),λ=1/4(E+G+2√(EG-F^2)), μ=1/4λ(E-G+2iF), so that λ and μ are smooth with λ > 0 and |μ| < 1. In isothermal coordinates (u, v) the metric should take the form ds2=ρ(du2+dv2)^2=ρ(du^2+dv^2) with ρ > 0 smooth. The complex coordinate w = u + i v satisfies ρ|dw|2=ρ|wz|2|dz+wz¯wzdz¯|2,ρ |dw|^2=ρ|w_z|^2|dz+w_z_z dz|^2, so that the coordinates (u, v) will be isothermal locally provided the Beltrami equation ∂w∂z¯=μ∂w∂z∂z=μ has a locally diffeomorphic solution, i.e. a solution with non-vanishing Jacobian. These conditions can be phrased equivalently in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star operator ∗.[1] u and v will be isothermal coordinates if ∗du = dv, where ∗ is defined on differentials by ∗(p dx + q dy) = −q dx + p dy. Let ∆ = ∗d∗d be the Laplace–Beltrami operator. By standard elliptic theory, u can be chosen to be harmonic near a given point, i.e. Δ u = 0, with du non-vanishing. By the Poincaré lemma dv = ∗du has a local solution v exactly when d(∗du) = 0. This condition is equivalent to Δ u = 0, so can always be solved locally. Since du is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is −1 on 1-forms, du and dv must be linearly independent, so that u and v give local isothermal coordinates. The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved by other methods, for example using the general theory of the Beltrami equation, as in Ahlfors (2006), or by direct elementary methods, as in Chern (1955) and Jost (2006). From this correspondence with compact Riemann surfaces, a classification of closed orientable Riemannian 2-manifolds follows. Each such is conformally equivalent to a unique closed 2-manifold of constant curvature, so a quotient of one of the following by a free action of a discrete subgroup of an isometry group: the sphere (curvature +1) the Euclidean plane (curvature 0) the hyperbolic plane (curvature −1). genus 0 genus 1 genus 2 genus 3 The first case gives the 2-sphere, the unique 2-manifold with constant positive curvature and hence positive Euler characteristic (equal to 2). The second gives all flat 2-manifolds, i.e. the tori, which have Euler characteristic 0. The third case covers all 2-manifolds of constant negative curvature, i.e. the hyperbolic 2-manifolds all of which have negative Euler characteristic. The classification is consistent with the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, which implies that for a closed surface with constant curvature, the sign of that curvature must match the sign of the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic is equal to 2 – 2g, where g is the genus of the 2-manifold, i.e. the number of "holes". Methods of
