Proof: source and load impedance diagram In this diagram, AC power is being transferred from the source, with phasor magnitude of voltage |VS||V_S| (positive peak voltage) and fixed source impedance ZS_S (S for source), to a load with impedance ZL_L (L for load), resulting in a (positive) magnitude |I||I| of the current phasor I. This magnitude |I||I| results from dividing the magnitude of the source voltage by the magnitude of the total circuit impedance: |I|=|VS||ZS+ZL|.|I|=|V_S||Z_S+Z_L|. The average power PL_L dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistive portion (the real part) RL_L of the load impedance ZL_L: PL=Irms2RL=12|I|2RL=12(|VS||ZS+ZL|)2RL=12|VS|2RL(RS+RL)2+(XS+XL)2,P_L =I_rms^2R_L=12|I|^2R_L =12(|V_S||Z_S+Z_L|)^2R_L=12|V_S|^2R_L(R_S+R_L)^2+(X_S+X_L)^2, where RS_S and RL_L denote the resistances, that is the real parts, and XS_S and XL_L denote the reactances, that is the imaginary parts, of respectively the source and load impedances ZS_S and ZL_L. To determine, for a given source voltage VS_S and impedance ZS,_S, the value of the load impedance ZL,_L, for which this expression for the power yields a maximum, one first finds, for each fixed positive value of RL_L, the value of the reactive term XL_L for which the denominator: (RS+RL)2+(XS+XL)2(R_S+R_L)^2+(X_S+X_L)^2 is a minimum. Since reactances can be negative, this is achieved by adapting the load reactance to: XL=−XS._L=-X_S. This reduces the above equation to: PL=12|VS|2RL(RS+RL)2_L=1/2|V_S|^2R_L/(R_S+R_L)^2 and it remains to find the value of RL_L which maximizes this expression. This problem has the same form as in the purely resistive case, and the maximizing condition therefore is RL=RS._L=R_S. The two maximizing conditions: RL=RS_L=R_S XL=−XS_L=-X_S describe the complex conjugate of the source impedance, denoted by ∗,^*, and thus can be concisely combined to: ZL=ZS∗._L=Z_S^*. See
