matching: Main article: impedance matching A related concept is reflectionless impedance matching. In radio frequency transmission lines, and other electronics, there is often a requirement to match the source impedance (at the transmitter) to the load impedance (such as an antenna) to avoid reflections in the transmission line. Calculus-based proof for purely resistive
