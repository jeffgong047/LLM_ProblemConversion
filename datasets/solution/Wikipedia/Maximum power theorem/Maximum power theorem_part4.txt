circuits: In the simplified model of powering a load with resistance RL by a source with voltage VS and source resistance RS, then by Ohm's law the resulting current I is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance: I=VSRS+RL.=V_S/R_S+R_L. The power PL dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistance: PL=I2RL=(VSRS+RL)2RL=VS2RS2/RL+2RS+RL._L=I^2R_L=(V_S/R_S+R_L)^2R_L=V_S^2/R_S^2/R_L+2R_S+R_L. The value of RL for which this expression is a maximum could be calculated by differentiating it, but it is easier to calculate the value of RL for which the denominator: RS2/RL+2RS+RL_S^2/R_L+2R_S+R_L is a minimum. The result will be the same in either case. Differentiating the denominator with respect to RL: ddRL(RS2/RL+2RS+RL)=−RS2/RL2+1.d/dR_L(R_S^2/R_L+2R_S+R_L)=-R_S^2/R_L^2+1. For a maximum or minimum, the first derivative is zero, so RS2/RL2=1_S^2/R_L^2=1 or RL=±RS._L=_S. In practical resistive circuits, RS and RL are both positive, so the positive sign in the above is the correct solution. To find out whether this solution is a minimum or a maximum, the denominator expression is differentiated again: d2dRL2(RS2/RL+2RS+RL)=2RS2/RL3.d^2/dR_L^2(R_S^2/R_L+2R_S+R_L)=2R_S^2/R_L^3. This is always positive for positive values of RS_S and RL_L, showing that the denominator is a minimum, and the power is therefore a maximum, when: RS=RL._S=R_L. The above proof assumes fixed source resistance RS_S. When the source resistance can be varied, power transferred to the load can be increased by reducing RS_S. For example, a 100 Volt source with an RS_S of 10Ω10 Ω will deliver 250 watts of power to a 10Ω10 Ω load; reducing RS_S to 0Ω0 Ω increases the power delivered to 1000 watts. Note that this shows that maximum power transfer can also be interpreted as the load voltage being equal to one-half of the Thevenin voltage equivalent of the source.[5] In reactive
