Relationship between the rational roots of a polynomial and its extreme coefficients In algebra, the rational root theorem (or rational root test, rational zero theorem, rational zero test or p/q theorem) states a constraint on rational solutions of a polynomial equation anxn+an−1xn−1+⋯+a0=0_nx^n+a_n-1x^n-1+⋯+a_0=0 with integer coefficients ai∈Z_i∈ℤ and a0,an≠0_0,a_n≠0. Solutions of the equation are also called roots or zeros of the polynomial on the left side. The theorem states that each rational solution x = p⁄q, written in lowest terms so that p and q are relatively prime, satisfies: p is an integer factor of the constant term a0, and q is an integer factor of the leading coefficient an. The rational root theorem is a special case (for a single linear factor) of Gauss's lemma on the factorization of polynomials. The integral root theorem is the special case of the rational root theorem when the leading coefficient is an = 1.
