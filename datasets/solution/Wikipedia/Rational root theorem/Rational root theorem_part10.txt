Third: Every rational root of the polynomial 3x3−5x2+5x−23x^3-5x^2+5x-2 must be among the numbers ±1,21,3=±1,2,13,23.±1,21,3=±{1,2,13,23}. These 8 root candidates x = r can be tested by evaluating P(r), for example using Horner's method. It turns out there is exactly one with P(r) = 0. This process may be made more efficient: if P(r) ≠ 0, it can be used to shorten the list of remaining candidates.[2] For example, x = 1 does not work, as P(1) = 1. Substituting x = 1 + t yields a polynomial in t with constant term P(1) = 1, while the coefficient of t3 remains the same as the coefficient of x3. Applying the rational root theorem thus yields the possible roots t=±11,3=±11,3, so that x=1+t=2,0,43,23.=1+t=2,0,43,23. True roots must occur on both lists, so list of rational root candidates has shrunk to just x = 2 and x = 2/3. If k ≥ 1 rational roots are found, Horner's method will also yield a polynomial of degree n − k whose roots, together with the rational roots, are exactly the roots of the original polynomial. If none of the candidates is a solution, there can be no rational solution. See
