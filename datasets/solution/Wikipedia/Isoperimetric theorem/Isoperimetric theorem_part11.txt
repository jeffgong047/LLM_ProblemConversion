inequality: Harper's theorem[10] says that Hamming balls have the smallest vertex boundary among all sets of a given size. Hamming balls are sets that contain all points of Hamming weight at most r and no points of Hamming weight larger than r+1+1 for some integer r. This theorem implies that any set S⊆V with |S|≥∑i=0r(di)|S|≥∑_i=0^rd satisfies |S∪Γ(S)|≥∑i=0r+1(di).|S∪Γ(S)|≥∑_i=0^r+1d.[11] As a special case, consider set sizes k=|S|=|S| of the form k=(d0)+(d1)+⋯+(dr)=d0+d1+…+d for some integer r. Then the above implies that the exact vertex isoperimetric parameter is ΦV(Qd,k)=(dr+1).Φ_V(Q_d,k)=d+1.[12] Isoperimetric inequality for
