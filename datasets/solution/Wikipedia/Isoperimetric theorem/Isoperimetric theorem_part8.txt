graphs: Main article: Expander graph In graph theory, isoperimetric inequalities are at the heart of the study of expander graphs, which are sparse graphs that have strong connectivity properties. Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to complexity theory, design of robust computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.[7] Isoperimetric inequalities for graphs relate the size of vertex subsets to the size of their boundary, which is usually measured by the number of edges leaving the subset (edge expansion) or by the number of neighbouring vertices (vertex expansion). For a graph G and a number k, the following are two standard isoperimetric parameters for graphs.[8] The edge isoperimetric parameter: ΦE(G,k)=minS⊆V|E(S,S¯)|:|S|=kΦ_E(G,k)=min_S{|E(S,S)|:|S|=k} The vertex isoperimetric parameter: ΦV(G,k)=minS⊆V|Γ(S)∖S|:|S|=kΦ_V(G,k)=min_S{|Γ(S)|:|S|=k} Here E(S,S¯)(S,S) denotes the set of edges leaving S and Γ(S)Γ(S) denotes the set of vertices that have a neighbour in S. The isoperimetric problem consists of understanding how the parameters ΦEΦ_E and ΦVΦ_V behave for natural families of graphs. Example: Isoperimetric inequalities for
