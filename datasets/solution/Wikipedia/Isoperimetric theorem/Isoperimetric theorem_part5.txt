Rn: The isoperimetric inequality states that a sphere has the smallest surface area per given volume. Given a bounded set S⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n with surface area per⁡(S)per(S) and volume vol⁡(S)vol(S), the isoperimetric inequality states per⁡(S)≥nvol⁡(S)(n−1)/nvol⁡(B1)1/n,per(S)vol(S)^(n-1)/n vol(B_1)^1/n, where B1⊂Rn_1⊂ℝ^n is a unit ball. The equality holds when S is a ball in Rnℝ^n. Under additional restrictions on the set (such as convexity, regularity, smooth boundary), the equality holds for a ball only. But in full generality the situation is more complicated. The relevant result of Schmidt (1949, Sect. 20.7) (for a simpler proof see Baebler (1957)) is clarified in Hadwiger (1957, Sect. 5.2.5) as follows. An extremal set consists of a ball and a "corona" that contributes neither to the volume nor to the surface area. That is, the equality holds for a compact set S if and only if S contains a closed ball B such that vol⁡(B)=vol⁡(S)vol(B)=vol(S) and per⁡(B)=per⁡(S).per(B)=per(S). For example, the "corona" may be a curve. The proof of the inequality follows directly from Brunn–Minkowski inequality between a set S and a ball with radius ϵϵ, i.e. Bϵ=ϵB1_ϵ=_1. By taking Brunn–Minkowski inequality to the power n, subtracting vol⁡(S)vol(S) from both sides, dividing them by ϵϵ, and taking the limit as ϵ→0.ϵ→0. (Osserman (1978); Federer (1969, §3.2.43)). In full generality (Federer 1969, §3.2.43), the isoperimetric inequality states that for any set S⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n whose closure has finite Lebesgue measure nωn1/nLn(S¯)(n−1)/n≤M∗n−1(∂S) ω_n^1/nL^n(S̅)^(n-1)/n_*^n-1() where M∗n−1_*^n-1 is the (n-1)-dimensional Minkowski content, Ln is the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and ωn is the volume of the unit ball in Rnℝ^n. If the boundary of S is rectifiable, then the Minkowski content is the (n-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The n-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is equivalent (for sufficiently smooth domains) to the Sobolev inequality on Rnℝ^n with optimal constant: (∫Rn|u|n/(n−1))(n−1)/n≤n−1ωn−1/n∫Rn|∇u|(∫_ℝ^n|u|^n/(n-1))^(n-1)/n^-1ω_n^-1/n∫_ℝ^n|| for all u∈W1,1(Rn)^1,1(ℝ^n).
