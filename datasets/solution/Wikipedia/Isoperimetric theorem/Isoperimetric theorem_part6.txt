manifolds: Hadamard manifolds are complete simply connected manifolds with nonpositive curvature. Thus they generalize the Euclidean space Rnℝ^n, which is a Hadamard manifold with curvature zero. In 1970's and early 80's, Thierry Aubin, Misha Gromov, Yuri Burago, and Viktor Zalgaller conjectured that the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality per⁡(S)≥nvol⁡(S)(n−1)/nvol⁡(B1)1/nper(S)vol(S)^(n-1)/nvol(B_1)^1/n holds for bounded sets S in Hadamard manifolds, which has become known as the Cartan–Hadamard conjecture. In dimension 2 this had already been established in 1926 by André Weil, who was a student of Hadamard at the time. In dimensions 3 and 4 the conjecture was proved by Bruce Kleiner in 1992, and Chris Croke in 1984 respectively. In a metric measure
