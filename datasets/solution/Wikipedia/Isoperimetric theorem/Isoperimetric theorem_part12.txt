triangles: The isoperimetric inequality for triangles in terms of perimeter p and area T states that[13] p2≥123⋅T,^2≥12√(3), with equality for the equilateral triangle. This is implied, via the AM–GM inequality, by a stronger inequality which has also been called the isoperimetric inequality for triangles:[14] T≤34(abc)2/3.≤√(3)/4(abc)^2/3. See
