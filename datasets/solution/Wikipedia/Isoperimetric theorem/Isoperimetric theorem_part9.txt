hypercubes: The d-dimensional hypercube Qd_d is the graph whose vertices are all Boolean vectors of length d, that is, the set 0,1d{0,1}^d. Two such vectors are connected by an edge in Qd_d if they are equal up to a single bit flip, that is, their Hamming distance is exactly one. The following are the isoperimetric inequalities for the Boolean hypercube.[9] Edge isoperimetric
