sphere: Let C be a simple closed curve on a sphere of radius 1. Denote by L the length of C and by A the area enclosed by C. The spherical isoperimetric inequality states that L2≥A(4π−A),^2(4π-A), and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. There are, in fact, two ways to measure the spherical area enclosed by a simple closed curve, but the inequality is symmetric with the respect to taking the complement. This inequality was discovered by Paul Lévy (1919) who also extended it to higher dimensions and general surfaces.[5] In the more general case of arbitrary radius R, it is known[6] that L2≥4πA−A2R2.^2≥4-A^2/R^2.
