statement: Condition 1. The group decision function sends each set of preferences to a unique winner. (resolute, unrestricted domain) Condition 2. The group decision function treats each voter identically. (anonymity) Condition 3. The group decision function treats both outcomes the same, in that reversing each set of preferences reverses the group preference. (neutrality) Condition 4. If the group decision was 0 or 1 and a voter raises a vote from âˆ’1 to 0 or 1, or from 0 to 1, the group decision is 1. (positive responsiveness) Theorem: A group decision function with an odd number of voters meets conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 if and only if it is the simple majority method.
