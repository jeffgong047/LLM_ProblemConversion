Examples: In the following examples, the natural numbers refer to the set of positive integers. The equation x=(y1+1)(y2+1)=(y_1+1)(y_2+1) is an example of a Diophantine equation with a parameter x and unknowns y1 and y2. The equation has a solution in y1 and y2 precisely when x can be expressed as a product of two integers greater than 1, in other words x is a composite number. Namely, this equation provides a Diophantine definition of the set {4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, ...} consisting of the composite numbers. Other examples of Diophantine definitions are as follows: The equation x=y12+y22=y_1^2+y_2^2 with parameter x and unknowns y1, y2 only has solutions in Nℕ when x is a sum of two perfect squares. The Diophantine set of the equation is {2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, ...}. The equation y12−xy22=1_1^2-xy_2^2=1 with parameter x and unknowns y1, y2. This is a Pell equation, meaning it only has solutions in Nℕ when x is not a perfect square. The Diophantine set is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...}. The equation x1+y=x2_1+y=x_2 is a Diophantine equation with two parameters x1, x2 and an unknown y, which defines the set of pairs (x1, x2) such that x1 < x2. Matiyasevich's
