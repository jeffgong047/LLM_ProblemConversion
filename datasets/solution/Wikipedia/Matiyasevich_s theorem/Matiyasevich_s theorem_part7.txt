applications: Matiyasevich's theorem has since been used to prove that many problems from calculus and differential equations are unsolvable. One can also derive the following stronger form of GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem from Matiyasevich's result: Corresponding to any given consistent axiomatization of number theory,[4] one can explicitly construct a Diophantine equation that has no solutions, but such that this fact cannot be proved within the given axiomatization. According to the incompleteness theorems, a powerful-enough consistent axiomatic theory is incomplete, meaning the truth of some of its propositions cannot be established within its formalism. The statement above says that this incompleteness must include the solvability of a diophantine equation, assuming that the theory in question is a number theory.
