Notes: ^ "Diophantine set". Encyclopedia of Mathematics. Retrieved 11 March 2022. ^ The theorem was established in 1970 by Matiyasevich and is thus also known as Matiyasevich's theorem. However, the proof given by Matiyasevich relied extensively on previous work on the problem and the mathematical community has moved to calling the equivalence result the MRDP theorem or the Matiyasevich–Robinson–Davis–Putnam theorem, a name that credits all the mathematicians that made significant contributions to this theorem. ^ David Hilbert posed the problem in his celebrated list, from his 1900 address to the International Congress of Mathematicians. ^ More precisely, given a Σ10Σ_1^0-formula representing the set of Gödel numbers of sentences that recursively axiomatize a consistent theory extending Robinson arithmetic.
