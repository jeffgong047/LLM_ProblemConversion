statement: Formally, the invariant subspace problem for a complex Banach space H of dimension > 1 is the question whether every bounded linear operator T:H→H:H has a non-trivial closed T-invariant subspace: a closed linear subspace W of H, which is different from 0{0} and from H, such that T(W)⊂W(W). A negative answer to the problem is closely related to properties of the orbits T. If x is an element of the Banach space H, the orbit of x under the action of T, denoted by [x][x], is the subspace generated by the sequence Tn(x):n≥0{T^n(x) : n≥0}. This is also called the T-cyclic subspace generated by x. From the definition it follows that [x][x] is a T-invariant subspace. Moreover, it is the minimal T-invariant subspace containing x: if W is another invariant subspace containing x, then necessarily Tn(x)∈W^n(x) for all n≥0≥0 (since W is T-invariant), and so [x]⊂W[x]. If x is non-zero, then [x][x] is not equal to 0{0}, so its closure is either the whole space H (in which case x is said to be a cyclic vector for T) or it is a non-trivial T-invariant subspace. Therefore, a counterexample to the invariant subspace problem would be a Banach space H and a bounded operator T:H→H:H for which every non-zero vector x∈H is a cyclic vector for T. (Where a "cyclic vector" x for an operator T on a Banach space H means one for which the orbit [x][x] of x is dense in H.) Known special
