History: The problem seems to have been stated in the mid-1900s after work by Beurling and von Neumann,[1] who found (but never published) a positive solution for the case of compact operators. It was then posed by Paul Halmos for the case of operators T such that T2^2 is compact. This was resolved affirmatively, for the more general class of polynomially compact operators (operators T such that p(T)(T) is a compact operator for a suitably chosen non-zero polynomial p), by Allen R. Bernstein and Abraham Robinson in 1966 (see Non-standard analysis ยง Invariant subspace problem for a summary of the proof). For Banach spaces, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Per Enflo. He proposed a counterexample to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article's complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987[2] Enflo's long "manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians"[1] and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976).[3] Enflo's works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo's ideas.[2] In the 1990s, Enflo developed a "constructive" approach to the invariant subspace problem on Hilbert spaces.[4] In May 2023, a preprint of Enflo appeared on arXiv,[5] which, if correct, solves the problem for Hilbert spaces and completes the picture.
