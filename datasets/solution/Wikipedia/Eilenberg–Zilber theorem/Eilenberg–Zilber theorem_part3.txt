maps: The original theorem was proven in terms of acyclic models but more mileage was gotten in a phrasing by Eilenberg and Mac Lane using explicit maps. The standard map F they produce is traditionally referred to as the Alexander–Whitney map and G the Eilenberg–Zilber map. The maps are natural in both X and Y and inverse up to homotopy: one has FG=idC∗(X)⊗C∗(Y),GF−idC∗(X×Y)=∂C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)H+H∂C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)=id_C_*(X)_*(Y),-id_C_*(X)=∂_C_*(X)_*(Y)H+H∂_C_*(X)_*(Y) for a homotopy H natural in both X and Y such that further, each of HH, FH, and HG is zero. This is what would come to be known as a contraction or a homotopy retract datum. The
