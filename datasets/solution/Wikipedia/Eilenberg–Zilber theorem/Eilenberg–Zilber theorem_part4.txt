coproduct: The diagonal map Δ:X→X×XΔ induces a map of cochain complexes C∗(X)→C∗(X×X)_*(X)_*(X) which, followed by the Alexander–Whitney F yields a coproduct C∗(X)→C∗(X)⊗C∗(X)_*(X)_*(X)_*(X) inducing the standard coproduct on H∗(X)_*(X). With respect to these coproducts on X and Y, the map H∗(X)⊗H∗(Y)→H∗(C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y))→∼H∗(X×Y)_*(X)_*(Y)_*(C_*(X)_*(Y)){∼→_̋*(X), also called the Eilenberg–Zilber map, becomes a map of differential graded coalgebras. The composite C∗(X)→C∗(X)⊗C∗(X)_*(X)_*(X)_*(X) itself is not a map of coalgebras. Statement in
