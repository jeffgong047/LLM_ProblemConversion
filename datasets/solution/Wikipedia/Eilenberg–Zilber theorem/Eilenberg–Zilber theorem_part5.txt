cohomology: The Alexander–Whitney and Eilenberg–Zilber maps dualize (over any choice of commutative coefficient ring k with unity) to a pair of maps G∗:C∗(X×Y)→(C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y))∗,F∗:(C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y))∗→C∗(X×Y)^*^*(X)→(C_*(X)_*(Y))^*,^*(C_*(X)_*(Y))^*^*(X) which are also homotopy equivalences, as witnessed by the duals of the preceding equations, using the dual homotopy H∗^*. The coproduct does not dualize straightforwardly, because dualization does not distribute over tensor products of infinitely-generated modules, but there is a natural injection of differential graded algebras i:C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)→(C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y))∗^*(X)^*(Y)→(C_*(X)_*(Y))^* given by α⊗β↦(σ⊗τ↦α(σ)β(τ))α⊗β↦(σ⊗τ↦α(σ)β(τ)), the product being taken in the coefficient ring k. This i induces an isomorphism in cohomology, so one does have the zig-zag of differential graded algebra maps C∗(X)⊗C∗(X)→i(C∗(X)⊗C∗(X))∗←G∗C∗(X×X)→C∗(Δ)C∗(X)^*(X)^*(X){i→{(C_*(X)_*(X))^*{G^*←^*(X)C^*(Δ)→C^*(X) inducing a product ⌣:H∗(X)⊗H∗(X)→H∗(X)⌣^*(X)^*(X)^*(X) in cohomology, known as the cup product, because H∗(i)^*(i) and H∗(G)^*(G) are isomorphisms. Replacing G∗^* with F∗^* so the maps all go the same way, one gets the standard cup product on cochains, given explicitly by α⊗β↦(σ↦(α⊗β)(F∗Δ∗σ)=∑p=0dim⁡σα(σ|Δ[0,p])⋅β(σ|Δ[p,dim⁡σ]))α⊗β↦(σ↦(α⊗β)(F^*Δ^*σ)=∑_p=0^σα(σ|_Δ^[0,p])·β(σ|_Δ^[p,σ])), which, since cochain evaluation Cp(X)⊗Cq(X)→k^p(X)_q(X) vanishes unless p=q=q, reduces to the more familiar expression. Note that if this direct map C∗(X)⊗C∗(X)→C∗(X)^*(X)^*(X)^*(X) of cochain complexes were in fact a map of differential graded algebras, then the cup product would make C∗(X)^*(X) a commutative graded algebra, which it is not. This failure of the Alexander–Whitney map to be a coalgebra map is an example the unavailability of commutative cochain-level models for cohomology over fields of nonzero characteristic, and thus is in a way responsible for much of the subtlety and complication in stable homotopy theory.
