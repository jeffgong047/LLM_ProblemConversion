Consequences: The Eilenberg–Zilber theorem is a key ingredient in establishing the Künneth theorem, which expresses the homology groups H∗(X×Y)_*(X) in terms of H∗(X)_*(X) and H∗(Y)_*(Y). In light of the Eilenberg–Zilber theorem, the content of the Künneth theorem consists in analysing how the homology of the tensor product complex relates to the homologies of the factors. See
