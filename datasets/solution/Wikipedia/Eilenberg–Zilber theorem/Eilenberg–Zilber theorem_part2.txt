theorem: The theorem can be formulated as follows. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces, Then we have the three chain complexes C∗(X)_*(X), C∗(Y)_*(Y), and C∗(X×Y)_*(X). (The argument applies equally to the simplicial or singular chain complexes.) We also have the tensor product complex C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)_*(X)_*(Y), whose differential is, by definition, ∂C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)(σ⊗τ)=∂Xσ⊗τ+(−1)pσ⊗∂Yτ∂_C_*(X)_*(Y)(σ⊗τ)=∂_Xσ⊗τ+(-1)^pσ⊗∂_Yτ for σ∈Cp(X)σ_p(X) and ∂X∂_X, ∂Y∂_Y the differentials on C∗(X)_*(X),C∗(Y)_*(Y). Then the theorem says that we have chain maps F:C∗(X×Y)→C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y),G:C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)→C∗(X×Y)_*(X)_*(X)_*(Y),_*(X)_*(Y)_*(X) such that FG is the identity and GF is chain-homotopic to the identity. Moreover, the maps are natural in X and Y. Consequently the two complexes must have the same homology: H∗(C∗(X×Y))≅H∗(C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y))._*(C_*(X))_*(C_*(X)_*(Y)). Statement in terms of composite
