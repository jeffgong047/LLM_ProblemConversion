Proof: Illustration for a proof of the Erdős–Anning theorem. Given three non-collinear points A, B, C with integer distances from each other (here, the vertices of a 3–4–5 right triangle), the points whose distances to A and B differ by an integer lie on a system of hyperbolas and degenerate hyperbolas (blue), and symmetrically the points whose distances to B and C differ by an integer lie on another system of hyperbolas (red). Any point with integer distance to all three of A, B, C lies on a crossing of a blue and a red curve. There are finitely many crossings, so finitely many additional points in the set. Each branch of a hyperbola is labeled by the integer difference of distances that is invariant for the points on that branch. Shortly after the original publication of the Erdős–Anning theorem, Erdős provided the following proof.[4] It is simpler than the original proof. Additionally, it relates the maximum size of an integer-distance set to the maximum distance between the points (the diameter of the set).[5] More specifically, if a set of three non-collinear points have integer distances, all at most some number δδ, then at most 4(δ+1)24(δ+1)^2 points (including the three given points) have integer distances from all three. Therefore, any set of non-collinear points, all at integer distances at most δδ from each other, can have at most 4(δ+1)24(δ+1)^2 points in total.[4] The proof involves finding a system of curves so that each point of the set lies on a crossing of two of the curves, and bounding the number of crossings. Let A, B and C be any three non-collinear members of a set S of points with integer distances, and let d denote the Euclidean distance function. Let X be any other member of S. From the triangle inequality it follows that |d(A,X)−d(B,X)||d(A,X)-d(B,X)| is a non-negative integer and is at most d(A,B)≤δ(A,B)≤δ. For each of the d(A,B)+1(A,B)+1 integer values i in this range, the points satisfying the equation |d(A,X)−d(B,X)|=i|d(A,X)-d(B,X)|=i lie on a hyperbola with A and B as its foci, and X must lie on one of these d(A,B)+1(A,B)+1 hyperbolae. By a symmetric argument, X must also lie on one of a family of d(B,C)+1(B,C)+1 hyperbolae having B and C as foci. Each pair of distinct hyperbolae, one defined by A and B and the second defined by B and C, can intersect in at most four points, by Bézout's theorem. Every point of S (including A, B and C) lies on one of these intersection points. There are at most 4(δ+1)24(δ+1)^2 intersection points of pairs of hyperbolae, and therefore at most 4(δ+1)24(δ+1)^2 points in S.[4] The quadratic dependence of this bound on δδ can be improved: every non-collinear point set with integer distances and diameter δδ has size O(δ)(δ). However, it is not possible to replace δδ by the minimum distance between the points: there exist arbitrarily large non-collinear point sets with integer distances and with minimum distance two.[5] Maximal point sets with integral
