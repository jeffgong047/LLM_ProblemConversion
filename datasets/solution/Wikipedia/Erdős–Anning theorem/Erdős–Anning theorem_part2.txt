integrality: Main article: Erdős–Ulam problem Dense points on a unit circle generated by rotations of a 3–4–5 right triangle. All pairwise distances among these points are rational numbers. Scaling any finite subset of these points by the least common denominator of their distances produces an arbitrarily large finite set of points at integer distances from each other. Although there can be no infinite non-collinear set of points with integer distances, there are infinite non-collinear sets of points whose distances are rational numbers.[1] For instance, the subset of points on a unit circle obtained by repeatedly rotating by the sharp angle in a 3–4–5 right triangle has this property. It forms a dense set in the circle.[2] The (still unsolved) Erdős–Ulam problem asks whether there can exist a set of points at rational distances from each other that forms a dense set for the whole Euclidean plane.[3] For any finite set S of points at rational distances from each other, it is possible to find a similar set of points at integer distances from each other, by expanding S by a factor of the least common denominator of the distances in S. By expanding in this way a finite subset of the unit circle construction, one can construct arbitrarily large finite sets of non-collinear points with integer distances from each other.[2] However, including more points into S may cause the expansion factor to increase, so this construction does not allow infinite sets of points at rational distances to be transformed into infinite sets of points at integer distances.[1]
