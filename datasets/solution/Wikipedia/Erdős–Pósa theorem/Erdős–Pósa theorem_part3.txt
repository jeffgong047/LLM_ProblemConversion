function: In addition to proving that the function f(k) exists, Erdős & Pósa (1965) obtained the bounds c1k log k < f(k) < c2k log k for some constants c1 and c2. In Big O notation, f(k) = Θ(k log k). A previous unpublished result of Béla Bollobás stated f(2) = 3: in simpler terms, any graph which does not contain two vertex-disjoint cycles has a feedback vertex set of at most three vertices. One example showing that f(2) ≥ 3 is K5, the complete graph on 5 vertices. Here, because any cycle must contain at least three vertices, and there are only 5 vertices total, any two cycles must overlap in at least one vertex. On the other hand, a set of only two vertices cannot be a feedback vertex set because the other three vertices will form a cycle: a feedback vertex set must contain at least three vertices. The result that f(2) = 3 was first published by Lovász (1965), who also gave a complete characterization of the case k = 2: that is, he described the graphs which, like the example of K5 given above, do not contain two vertex-disjoint cycles. Later, Voss (1969) proved f(3) = 6 and 9 ≤ f(4) ≤ 12. Erdős–Pósa
