property: A family F of graphs or hypergraphs is defined to have the Erdős–Pósa property if there exists a function f:N→N:ℕ→ℕ such that for every (hyper-)graph G and every integer k one of the following is true: G contains k vertex-disjoint subgraphs each isomorphic to a graph in F; or G contains a vertex set C of size at most f(k) such that G − C has no subgraph isomorphic to a graph in F. The definition is often phrased as follows. If one denotes by ν(G) the maximum number of vertex disjoint subgraphs of G isomorphic to a graph in F and by τ(G) the minimum number of vertices whose deletion from G leaves a graph without a subgraph isomorphic to a graph in F, then τ(G) ≤ f(ν(G)), for some function f:N→N:ℕ→ℕ not depending on G. Rephrased in this terminology, the Erdős–Pósa theorem states that the family F consisting of all cycles has the Erdős–Pósa property, with bounding function f(k) = Θ(k log k). Robertson and Seymour (1986) generalized this considerably. Given a graph H, let F(H) denote the family of all graphs that contain H as a minor. As a corollary of their grid minor theorem, Robertson and Seymour proved that F(H) has the Erdős–Pósa property if and only if H is a planar graph. Moreover, it is now known that the corresponding bounding function is f(k) = Θ(k) if H is a forest (Fiorini, Joret & Wood 2013), while f(k) = Θ(k log k) for every other planar graph H (Cames van Batenburg et al. 2019). When we take H to be a triangle, the family F(H) consists of all graphs that contain at least one cycle, and a vertex set C such that G − C has no subgraph isomorphic to a graph in F(H) is exactly a feedback vertex set. Thus, the special case where H is a triangle is equivalent to the Erdős–Pósa theorem.
