In nonstandard analysis, a field of mathematics, the increment theorem states the following: Suppose a function y = f(x) is differentiable at x and that Δx is infinitesimal. Then Δy=f′(x)Δx+εΔx=f'(x) +ε for some infinitesimal ε, where Δy=f(x+Δx)−f(x).=f(x+)-f(x). If Δx≠0≠0 then we may write ΔyΔx=f′(x)+ε,/=f'(x)+ε, which implies that ΔyΔx≈f′(x)/'(x), or in other words that ΔyΔx/ is infinitely close to f′(x)'(x), or f′(x)'(x) is the standard part of ΔyΔx/. A similar theorem exists in standard Calculus. Again assume that y = f(x) is differentiable, but now let Δx be a nonzero standard real number. Then the same equation Δy=f′(x)Δx+εΔx=f'(x) +ε holds with the same definition of Δy, but instead of ε being infinitesimal, we have limΔx→0ε=0lim_→0ε=0 (treating x and f as given so that ε is a function of Δx alone).
