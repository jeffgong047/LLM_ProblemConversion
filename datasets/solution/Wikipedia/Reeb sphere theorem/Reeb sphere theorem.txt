On when a manifold that admits a singular foliation is homeomorphic to the sphere
In mathematics, Reeb sphere theorem, named after Georges Reeb, states that

A closed oriented connected manifold M n that admits a singular foliation having only centers  is homeomorphic to the sphere Sn and the foliation has exactly two singularities.

Morse foliation[edit]
A singularity of a foliation F is of Morse type if in its small neighborhood all leaves of the foliation are level sets of a Morse function, being the singularity a critical point of the function.  The singularity is a center if it is a local extremum of the function; otherwise, the singularity is a saddle.
The number of centers c and the number of saddles s, specifically c−s-s, is tightly connected with the manifold topology.
We denote ind⁡p=min(k,n−k)indp=min(k,n-k), the index of a singularity p, where k is the index of the corresponding critical point of a Morse function. In particular, a center has index 0, index of a saddle is at least 1.
A Morse foliation F on a manifold M is a singular transversely oriented codimension one foliation of class C2^2 with isolated singularities such that:

each singularity of F is of Morse type,
each singular leaf L contains a unique singularity p; in addition, if ind⁡p=1indp=1 then L∖p is not connected.
Reeb sphere theorem[edit]
This is the case c>s=0>s=0, the case without saddles.
Theorem:[1] Let Mn^n be a closed oriented connected manifold of dimension n≥2≥2. Assume that Mn^n admits a C1^1-transversely oriented codimension one foliation F with a non empty set of singularities all of them centers. Then the singular set of F consists of two points and Mn^n is homeomorphic to the sphere Sn^n.
It is a consequence of the Reeb stability theorem.

Generalization[edit]
More general case is c>s≥0.>s≥0.
In 1978, Edward Wagneur generalized the Reeb sphere theorem to Morse foliations with saddles. He showed that the number of centers cannot be too much as compared with the number of saddles, notably, c≤s+2+2. So there are exactly two cases when c>s>s:

(1)   c=s+2,=s+2,
(2)   c=s+1.=s+1.
He obtained a description of the manifold admitting a foliation with singularities that satisfy (1).
Theorem:[2] Let Mn^n be a compact connected manifold admitting  a Morse foliation F with c centers and s saddles. Then c≤s+2+2.
In case c=s+2=s+2,

M is homeomorphic to Sn^n,
all saddles have index 1,
each regular leaf is diffeomorphic to Sn−1^n-1.
Finally, in 2008, César Camacho and Bruno Scardua considered the case (2), c=s+1=s+1. This is possible in a small number of low dimensions.
Theorem:[3] Let Mn^n be a compact connected manifold and F a Morse foliation on M. If s=c+1=c+1, then

n=2,4,8=2,4,8 or 1616,
Mn^n is an Eells–Kuiper manifold.
