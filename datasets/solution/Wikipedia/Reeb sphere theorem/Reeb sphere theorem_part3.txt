theorem: This is the case c>s=0>s=0, the case without saddles. Theorem:[1] Let Mn^n be a closed oriented connected manifold of dimension n≥2≥2. Assume that Mn^n admits a C1^1-transversely oriented codimension one foliation F with a non empty set of singularities all of them centers. Then the singular set of F consists of two points and Mn^n is homeomorphic to the sphere Sn^n. It is a consequence of the Reeb stability theorem.
