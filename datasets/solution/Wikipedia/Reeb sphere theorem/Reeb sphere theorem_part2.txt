foliation: A singularity of a foliation F is of Morse type if in its small neighborhood all leaves of the foliation are level sets of a Morse function, being the singularity a critical point of the function. The singularity is a center if it is a local extremum of the function; otherwise, the singularity is a saddle. The number of centers c and the number of saddles s, specifically c−s-s, is tightly connected with the manifold topology. We denote ind⁡p=min(k,n−k)indp=min(k,n-k), the index of a singularity p, where k is the index of the corresponding critical point of a Morse function. In particular, a center has index 0, index of a saddle is at least 1. A Morse foliation F on a manifold M is a singular transversely oriented codimension one foliation of class C2^2 with isolated singularities such that: each singularity of F is of Morse type, each singular leaf L contains a unique singularity p; in addition, if ind⁡p=1indp=1 then L∖p is not connected.
