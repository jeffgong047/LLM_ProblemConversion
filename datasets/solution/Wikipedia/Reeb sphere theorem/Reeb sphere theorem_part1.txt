On when a manifold that admits a singular foliation is homeomorphic to the sphere In mathematics, Reeb sphere theorem, named after Georges Reeb, states that A closed oriented connected manifold M n that admits a singular foliation having only centers is homeomorphic to the sphere Sn and the foliation has exactly two singularities.
