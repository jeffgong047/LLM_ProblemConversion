Generalization: More general case is c>s≥0.>s≥0. In 1978, Edward Wagneur generalized the Reeb sphere theorem to Morse foliations with saddles. He showed that the number of centers cannot be too much as compared with the number of saddles, notably, c≤s+2+2. So there are exactly two cases when c>s>s: (1) c=s+2,=s+2, (2) c=s+1.=s+1. He obtained a description of the manifold admitting a foliation with singularities that satisfy (1). Theorem:[2] Let Mn^n be a compact connected manifold admitting a Morse foliation F with c centers and s saddles. Then c≤s+2+2. In case c=s+2=s+2, M is homeomorphic to Sn^n, all saddles have index 1, each regular leaf is diffeomorphic to Sn−1^n-1. Finally, in 2008, César Camacho and Bruno Scardua considered the case (2), c=s+1=s+1. This is possible in a small number of low dimensions. Theorem:[3] Let Mn^n be a compact connected manifold and F a Morse foliation on M. If s=c+1=c+1, then n=2,4,8=2,4,8 or 1616, Mn^n is an Eells–Kuiper manifold.
