Examples: The exponential shift theorem can be used to speed the calculation of higher derivatives of functions that is given by the product of an exponential and another function. For instance, if f(x)=sin⁡(x)ex(x)=sin(x)e^x, one has that D3f=D3(exsin⁡(x))=ex(D+1)3sin⁡(x)=ex(D3+3D2+3D+1)sin⁡(x)=ex(−cos⁡(x)−3sin⁡(x)+3cos⁡(x)+sin⁡(x))D^3f =D^3(e^xsin(x))=e^x(D+1)^3sin(x) =e^x(D^3+3D^2+3D+1)sin(x) =e^x(-cos(x)-3sin(x)+3cos(x)+sin(x)) Another application of the exponential shift theorem is to solve linear differential equations whose characteristic polynomial has repeated roots.[1]
