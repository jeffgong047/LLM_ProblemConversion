Statement: The theorem states that, if P(D) is a polynomial D-operator, then, for any sufficiently differentiable function y, P(D)(eaxy)≡eaxP(D+a)y.(D)(e^axy)^axP(D+a)y. To prove the result, proceed by induction. Note that only the special case P(D)=Dn(D)=D^n needs to be proved, since the general result then follows by linearity of D-operators. The result is clearly true for n = 1 since D(eaxy)=eax(D+a)y.(e^axy)=e^ax(D+a)y. Now suppose the result true for n = k, that is, Dk(eaxy)=eax(D+a)ky.^k(e^axy)=e^ax(D+a)^ky. Then, Dk+1(eaxy)≡ddxeax(D+a)ky=eaxddx(D+a)ky+aeax(D+a)ky=eax(ddx+a)(D+a)ky=eax(D+a)k+1y.D^k+1(e^axy) ≡d/dx{e^ax(D+a)^ky} =e^axd/dx{(D+a)^ky}+ae^ax{(D+a)^ky} =e^ax{(d/dx+a)(D+a)^ky} =e^ax(D+a)^k+1y. This completes the proof. The shift theorem can be applied equally well to inverse operators: 1P(D)(eaxy)=eax1P(D+a)y.1/P(D)(e^axy)=e^ax1/P(D+a)y.
