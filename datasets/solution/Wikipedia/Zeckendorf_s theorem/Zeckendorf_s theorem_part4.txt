multiplication: One can define the following operation a∘b on natural numbers a, b: given the Zeckendorf representations a=∑i=0kFci(ci≥2)=∑_i=0^kF_c_i (c_i≥2) and b=∑j=0lFdj(dj≥2)=∑_j=0^lF_d_j (d_j≥2) we define the Fibonacci product a∘b=∑i=0k∑j=0lFci+dj.=∑_i=0^k∑_j=0^lF_c_i+d_j. For example, the Zeckendorf representation of 2 is F3_3, and the Zeckendorf representation of 4 is F4+F2_4+F_2 (F1_1 is disallowed from representations), so 2∘4=F3+4+F3+2=13+5=18.2∘4=F_3+4+F_3+2=13+5=18. (The product is not always in Zeckendorf form. For example, 4∘4=(F4+F2)∘(F4+F2)=F4+4+2F4+2+F2+2=21+2⋅8+3=40=F9+F5+F2.4∘4=(F_4+F_2)∘(F_4+F_2)=F_4+4+2F_4+2+F_2+2=21+2·8+3=40=F_9+F_5+F_2.) A simple rearrangement of sums shows that this is a commutative operation; however, Donald Knuth proved the surprising fact that this operation is also associative.[2] Representation with negafibonacci
