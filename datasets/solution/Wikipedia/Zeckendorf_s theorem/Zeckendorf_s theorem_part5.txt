numbers: The Fibonacci sequence can be extended to negative index n using the rearranged recurrence relation Fn−2=Fn−Fn−1,_n-2=F_n-F_n-1, which yields the sequence of "negafibonacci" numbers satisfying F−n=(−1)n+1Fn._-n=(-1)^n+1F_n. Any integer can be uniquely represented[3] as a sum of negafibonacci numbers in which no two consecutive negafibonacci numbers are used. For example: −11 = F−4 + F−6 = (−3) + (−8) 12 = F−2 + F−7 = (−1) + 13 24 = F−1 + F−4 + F−6 + F−9 = 1 + (−3) + (−8) + 34 −43 = F−2 + F−7 + F−10 = (−1) + 13 + (−55) 0 is represented by the empty sum. 0 = F−1 + F−2 , for example, so the uniqueness of the representation does depend on the condition that no two consecutive negafibonacci numbers are used. This gives a system of coding integers, similar to the representation of Zeckendorf's theorem. In the string representing the integer x, the nth digit is 1 if F−n appears in the sum that represents x; that digit is 0 otherwise. For example, 24 may be represented by the string 100101001, which has the digit 1 in places 9, 6, 4, and 1, because 24 = F−1 + F−4 + F−6 + F−9 . The integer x is represented by a string of odd length if and only if x > 0. See
