(September 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Zeckendorf's theorem has two parts: Existence: every positive integer n has a Zeckendorf representation. Uniqueness: no positive integer n has two different Zeckendorf representations. The first part of Zeckendorf's theorem (existence) can be proven by induction. For n = 1, 2, 3 it is clearly true (as these are Fibonacci numbers), for n = 4 we have 4 = 3 + 1. If n is a Fibonacci number then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise there exists j such that Fj < n < Fj + 1 . Now suppose each positive integer a < n has a Zeckendorf representation (induction hypothesis) and consider b = n − Fj . Since b < n, b has a Zeckendorf representation by the induction hypothesis. At the same time, b = n − Fj < Fj + 1 − Fj = Fj − 1 (we apply the definition of Fibonacci number in the last equality), so the Zeckendorf representation of b does not contain Fj − 1 , and hence also does not contain Fj . As a result, n can be represented as the sum of Fj and the Zeckendorf representation of b, such that the Fibonacci numbers involved in the sum are distinct. The second part of Zeckendorf's theorem (uniqueness) requires the following lemma: Lemma: The sum of any non-empty set of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers whose largest member is Fj is strictly less than the next larger Fibonacci number Fj + 1 . The lemma can be proven by induction on j. Now take two non-empty sets S and T of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers which have the same sum, ∑x∈Sx=∑x∈Tx∑_xx=∑_xx. Consider sets S′' and T′' which are equal to S and T from which the common elements have been removed (i. e. S′=S∖T'=S and T′=T∖S'=T). Since S and T had equal sum, and we have removed exactly the elements from S∩T from both sets, S′' and T′' must have the same sum as well, ∑x∈S′x=∑x∈T′x∑_x'x=∑_x'x. Now we will show by contradiction that at least one of S′' and T′' is empty. Assume the contrary, i. e. that S′' and T′' are both non-empty and let the largest member of S′' be Fs and the largest member of T′' be Ft. Because S′' and T′' contain no common elements, Fs ≠ Ft. Without loss of generality, suppose Fs < Ft. Then by the lemma, ∑x∈S′x<Fs+1∑_x'x<F_s+1, and, by the fact that Fs<Fs+1≤Ft_s<F_s+1_t, ∑x∈S′x<Ft∑_x'x<F_t, whereas clearly ∑x∈T′x≥Ft∑_x'x_t. This contradicts the fact that S′' and T′' have the same sum, and we can conclude that either S′' or T′' must be empty. Now assume (again without loss of generality) that S′' is empty. Then S′' has sum 0, and so must T′'. But since T′' can only contain positive integers, it must be empty too. To conclude: S′=T′=∅'=T'=∅ which implies S=T=T, proving that each Zeckendorf representation is unique. Fibonacci
