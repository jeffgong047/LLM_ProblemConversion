Modification: The derivation of the statement is dependent on the assumption that the materials the equation models can be described by a set of susceptibility properties that are linear, isotropic, homogenous and independent of frequency.[8] The assumption that the materials have no absorption must also be made. A modification to Poynting's theorem to account for variations includes a term for the rate of non-Ohmic absorption in a material, which can be calculated by a simplified approximation based on the Drude model.[8] ∂∂tU+∇⋅S+E⋅Jfree+R⊣∫=0∂/𝒰+∇·𝐒+𝐄·𝐉_free+ℛ_⊣∫=0 Complex Poynting vector
