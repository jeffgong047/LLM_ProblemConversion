Derivation: For an individual charge in an electromagnetic field, the rate of work done by the field on the charge is given by the Lorentz Force Law as: dWdt=qv⋅EdW/dt=q𝐯·𝐄 Extending this to a continuous distribution of charges, moving with current density J, gives: dWdt=∫VJ⋅Ed3xdW/dt=∫_V𝐉·𝐄 d^3x By Ampère's circuital law: J=∇×H−∂D∂t𝐉=∇×𝐇-∂𝐃/ (Note that the H and D forms of the magnetic and electric fields are used here. The B and E forms could also be used in an equivalent derivation.)[3] Substituting this into the expression for rate of work gives: ∫VJ⋅Ed3x=∫V[E⋅(∇×H)−E⋅∂D∂t]d3x∫_V𝐉·𝐄 d^3x=∫_V[𝐄·(∇×𝐇)-𝐄·∂𝐃/] d^3x Using the vector identity ∇⋅(E×H)=(∇×E)⋅H−E⋅(∇×H)∇·(𝐄×𝐇)=∇×𝐄)·𝐇 - 𝐄·(∇×𝐇): ∫VJ⋅Ed3x=−∫V[∇⋅(E×H)−H⋅(∇×E)+E⋅∂D∂t]d3x∫_V𝐉·𝐄 d^3x=-∫_V[∇·(𝐄×𝐇)-𝐇·(∇×𝐄)+𝐄·∂𝐃/] d^3x By Faraday's Law: ∇×E=−∂B∂t∇×𝐄=-∂𝐁/ giving: ∫VJ⋅Ed3x=−∫V[∇⋅(E×H)+E⋅∂D∂t+H⋅∂B∂t]d3x∫_V𝐉·𝐄 d^3x=-∫_V[∇·(𝐄×𝐇)+𝐄·∂𝐃/+𝐇·∂𝐁/] d^3x Continuing the derivation requires the following assumptions:[2] the charges are moving in a medium which is not dispersive. the total electromagnetic energy density, even for time-varying fields, is given by u=12(E⋅D+B⋅H)=1/2(𝐄·𝐃+𝐁·𝐇) It can be shown[4] that: ∂∂t(E⋅D)=2E⋅∂∂tD∂/(𝐄·𝐃)=2𝐄·∂/𝐃 and ∂∂t(H⋅B)=2H⋅∂∂tB∂/(𝐇·𝐁)=2𝐇·∂/𝐁 and so: ∂u∂t=E⋅∂D∂t+H⋅∂B∂t/=𝐄·∂𝐃/+𝐇·∂𝐁/ Returning to the equation for rate of work, ∫VJ⋅Ed3x=−∫V[∂u∂t+∇⋅(E×H)]d3x∫_V𝐉·𝐄 d^3x=-∫_V[/+∇·(𝐄×𝐇)] d^3x Since the volume is arbitrary, this can be cast in differential form as: −∂u∂t=∇⋅S+J⋅E-/=∇·𝐒+𝐉·𝐄 where S=E×H𝐒=𝐄×𝐇 is the Poynting vector.
