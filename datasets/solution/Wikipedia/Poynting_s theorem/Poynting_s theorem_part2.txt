Definition: Poynting's theorem states that the rate of energy transfer per unit volume from a region of space equals the rate of work done on the charge distribution in the region, plus the energy flux leaving that region. Mathematically: −∂u∂t=∇⋅S+J⋅E-/=∇·𝐒+𝐉·𝐄 where: −∂u∂t-/ is the rate of change of the energy density in the volume. ∇•S is the energy flow out of the volume, given by the divergence of the Poynting vector S. J•E is the rate at which the fields do work on charges in the volume (J is the current density corresponding to the motion of charge, E is the electric field, and • is the dot product). Integral
