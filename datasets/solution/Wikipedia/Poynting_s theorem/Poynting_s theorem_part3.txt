Form: Using the divergence theorem, Poynting's theorem can also be written in integral form: −ddt∫VudV=-d/dt∫_Vu dV= ∂V S⋅dA+∫VJ⋅EdV𝐒·d𝐀+∫_V𝐉·𝐄 dV where S is the energy flow, given by the Poynting Vector. u is the energy density in the volume. ∂V is the boundary of the volume. The shape of the volume is arbitrary but fixed for the calculation. Continuity Equation
