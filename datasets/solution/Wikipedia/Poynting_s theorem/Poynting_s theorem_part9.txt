theorem: This form of the theorem is useful in Antenna theory, where one has often to consider harmonic fields propagating in the space. In this case, using phasor notation, E(t)=Eejωt(t)=Ee^j and H(t)=Hejωt(t)=He^j. Then the following mathematical identity holds: 12∫∂ΩE×H∗⋅da=jω2∫Ω(εEE∗−μHH∗)dv−12∫ΩEJ∗dv,12∫_∂ΩE^*𝐚=jω2∫_Ω(^*-^*)dv-12∫_ΩEJ^*dv, where J is the current density. Note that in free space, εε and μμ are real, thus, taking the real part of the above formula, it expresses the fact that the averaged radiated power flowing through ∂Ω∂Ω is equal to the work on the charges.
