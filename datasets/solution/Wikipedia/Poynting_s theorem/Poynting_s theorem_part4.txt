Analog: In an electrical engineering context the theorem is sometimes written with the energy density term u expanded as shown.[citation needed] This form resembles the continuity equation: ∇⋅S+ϵ0E⋅∂E∂t+Bμ0⋅∂B∂t+J⋅E=0∇·𝐒+ϵ_0𝐄·∂𝐄/+𝐁/μ_0·∂𝐁/+𝐉·𝐄=0, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and μ0 is the vacuum permeability. ϵ0E⋅∂E∂tϵ_0𝐄·∂𝐄/ is the density of reactive power driving the build-up of electric field, Bμ0⋅∂B∂t𝐁/μ_0·∂𝐁/ is the density of reactive power driving the build-up of magnetic field, and J⋅E𝐉·𝐄 is the density of electric power dissipated by the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers.
