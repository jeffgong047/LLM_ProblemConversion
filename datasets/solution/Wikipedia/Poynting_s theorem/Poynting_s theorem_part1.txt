Theorem in physics showing the conservation of energy for the electromagnetic field In electrodynamics, Poynting's theorem is a statement of conservation of energy for electromagnetic fields developed by British physicist John Henry Poynting.[1] It states that in a given volume, the stored energy changes at a rate given by the work done on the charges within the volume, minus the rate at which energy leaves the volume. It is only strictly true in media which is not dispersive, but can be extended for the dispersive case.[2] The theorem is analogous to the work-energy theorem in classical mechanics, and mathematically similar to the continuity equation.
