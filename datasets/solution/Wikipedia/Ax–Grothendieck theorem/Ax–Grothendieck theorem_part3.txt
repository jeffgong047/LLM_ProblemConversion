proofs: There are other proofs of the theorem. Armand Borel gave a proof using topology.[4] The case of n = 1 and field C follows since C is algebraically closed and can also be thought of as a special case of the result that for any analytic function f on C, injectivity of f implies surjectivity of f. This is a corollary of Picard's theorem. Related
