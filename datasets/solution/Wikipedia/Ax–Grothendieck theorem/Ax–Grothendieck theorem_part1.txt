Injective polynomial functions are bijective In mathematics, the Axâ€“Grothendieck theorem is a result about injectivity and surjectivity of polynomials that was proved independently by James Ax and Alexander Grothendieck.[1][2][3][4] The theorem is often given as this special case: If P is an injective polynomial function from an n-dimensional complex vector space to itself then P is bijective. That is, if P always maps distinct arguments to distinct values, then the values of P cover all of Cn.[3][4] The full theorem generalizes to any algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field.[5] Proof via finite
