fields: Grothendieck's proof of the theorem[3][4] is based on proving the analogous theorem for finite fields and their algebraic closures. That is, for any field F that is itself finite or that is the closure of a finite field, if a polynomial P from Fn to itself is injective then it is bijective. If F is a finite field, then Fn is finite. In this case the theorem is true for trivial reasons having nothing to do with the representation of the function as a polynomial: any injection of a finite set to itself is a bijection. When F is the algebraic closure of a finite field, the result follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. The Axâ€“Grothendieck theorem for complex numbers can therefore be proven by showing that a counterexample over C would translate into a counterexample in some algebraic extension of a finite field. This method of proof is noteworthy in that it is an example of the idea that finitistic algebraic relations in fields of characteristic 0 translate into algebraic relations over finite fields with large characteristic.[3] Thus, one can use the arithmetic of finite fields to prove a statement about C even though there is no homomorphism from any finite field to C. The proof thus uses model-theoretic principles such as the compactness theorem to prove an elementary statement about polynomials. The proof for the general case uses a similar method. Other
