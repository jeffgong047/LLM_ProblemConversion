results: Another example of reducing theorems about morphisms of finite type to finite fields can be found in EGA IV: There, it is proved that a radicial S-endomorphism of a scheme X of finite type over S is bijective (10.4.11), and that if X/S is of finite presentation, and the endomorphism is a monomorphism, then it is an automorphism (17.9.6). Therefore, a scheme of finite presentation over a base S is a cohopfian object in the category of S-schemes. The Ax–Grothendieck theorem may also be used to prove the Garden of Eden theorem, a result that like the Ax–Grothendieck theorem relates injectivity with surjectivity but in cellular automata rather than in algebraic fields. Although direct proofs of this theorem are known, the proof via the Ax–Grothendieck theorem extends more broadly, to automata acting on amenable groups.[6] Some partial converses to the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem: A generically surjective polynomial map of n-dimensional affine space over a finitely generated extension of Z or Z/pZ[t] is bijective with a polynomial inverse rational over the same ring (and therefore bijective on affine space of the algebraic closure). A generically surjective rational map of n-dimensional affine space over a Hilbertian field is generically bijective with a rational inverse defined over the same field. ("Hilbertian field" being defined here as a field for which Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem holds, such as the rational numbers and function fields.)[7]
