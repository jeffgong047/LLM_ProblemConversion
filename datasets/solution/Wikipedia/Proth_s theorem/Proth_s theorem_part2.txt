examples: Examples of the theorem include: for p = 3 = 1(21) + 1, we have that 2(3-1)/2 + 1 = 3 is divisible by 3, so 3 is prime. for p = 5 = 1(22) + 1, we have that 3(5-1)/2 + 1 = 10 is divisible by 5, so 5 is prime. for p = 13 = 3(22) + 1, we have that 5(13-1)/2 + 1 = 15626 is divisible by 13, so 13 is prime. for p = 9, which is not prime, there is no a such that a(9-1)/2 + 1 is divisible by 9. The first Proth primes are (sequence A080076 in the OEIS): 3, 5, 13, 17, 41, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, 353, 449, 577, 641, 673, 769, 929, 1153 …. The largest known Proth prime as of 2016[update] is 10223⋅231172165+110223·2^31172165+1, and is 9,383,761 digits long.[3] It was found by Peter Szabolcs in the PrimeGrid volunteer computing project which announced it on 6 November 2016.[4] It is also the largest known non-Mersenne prime and largest Colbert number.[5] The second largest known Proth prime is 202705⋅221320516+1202705·2^21320516+1, found by PrimeGrid.[6]
