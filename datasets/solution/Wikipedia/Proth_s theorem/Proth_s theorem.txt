In number theory, Proth's theorem is a primality test for Proth numbers.
It states[1][2] that if p is a Proth number, of the form k2n + 1 with k odd and k < 2n, and if there exists an integer a for which

ap−12≡−1(modp),^p-1/2≡-1p,
then p is prime. In this case p is called a Proth prime. This is a practical test because if p is prime, any chosen a has about a 50 percent chance of working, furthermore, since the calculation is mod p, only values of a smaller than p have to be taken into consideration.
In practice, however, a quadratic nonresidue of p is found via a modified Euclid's algorithm and taken as the value of a, since if a is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p then the converse is also true, and the test is conclusive. For such an a the Legendre symbol is

(ap)=−1.(a/p)=-1.
Thus, in contrast to many Monte Carlo primality tests (randomized algorithms that can return a false positive), the primality testing algorithm based on Proth's theorem is a Las Vegas algorithm, always returning the correct answer but with a running time that varies randomly. Note that if a is chosen to be a quadratic nonresidue as described above, the runtime is constant, safe for the time spent on finding such a quadratic nonresidue. Finding such a value is very fast compared to the actual test. 


Numerical examples[edit]
Examples of the theorem include:

for p = 3 = 1(21) + 1, we have that 2(3-1)/2 + 1 = 3 is divisible by 3, so 3 is prime.
for p = 5 = 1(22) + 1, we have that 3(5-1)/2 + 1 = 10 is divisible by 5, so 5 is prime.
for p = 13 = 3(22) + 1, we have that 5(13-1)/2 + 1 = 15626  is divisible by 13, so 13 is prime.
for p = 9, which is not prime, there is no a such that a(9-1)/2 + 1 is divisible by 9.
The first Proth primes are (sequence A080076 in the OEIS):

3, 5, 13, 17, 41, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, 353, 449, 577, 641, 673, 769, 929, 1153 ….
The largest known Proth prime as of 2016[update] is 10223⋅231172165+110223·2^31172165+1, and is 9,383,761 digits long.[3] It was found by Peter Szabolcs in the PrimeGrid volunteer computing project which announced it on 6 November 2016.[4] It is also the largest known non-Mersenne prime and largest Colbert number.[5] The second largest known Proth prime is 202705⋅221320516+1202705·2^21320516+1, found by PrimeGrid.[6]

Proof[edit]
The proof for this theorem uses the Pocklington-Lehmer primality test, and closely resembles the proof of Pépin's test. The proof can be found on page 52 of the book by Ribenboim in the references.

History[edit]
François Proth (1852–1879) published the theorem in 1878.[7][8]
