theorem: 
Let (M,gab)(M,g_ab) be a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Then (M,gab)(M,g_ab) is strongly causal and there exists a global "time function" on the manifold, i.e. a continuous, surjective map f:M→R:M→ℝ such that:

For all t∈R∈ℝ, f−1(t)^-1(t) is a Cauchy surface, and
f is strictly increasing on any causal curve.
Moreover, all Cauchy surfaces are homeomorphic, and M is homeomorphic to S×R×ℝ where S is any Cauchy surface of M.
