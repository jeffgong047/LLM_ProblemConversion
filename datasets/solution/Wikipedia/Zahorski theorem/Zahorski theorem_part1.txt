In mathematics, Zahorski's theorem is a theorem of real analysis. It states that a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of the real line to be the set of points of non-differentiability of a continuous real-valued function, is that it be the union of a Gδ set and a GδσG_δ_σ set of zero measure. This result was proved by Zygmunt Zahorski [pl] in 1939 and first published in 1941.
