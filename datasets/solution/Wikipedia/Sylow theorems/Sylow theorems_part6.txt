groups: There is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups. One defines a Sylow p-subgroup in an infinite group to be a p-subgroup (that is, every element in it has p-power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all p-subgroups in the group. Let Cl⁡(K)Cl(K) denote the set of conjugates of a subgroup K⊂G. Theorem — If K is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and np=|Cl⁡(K)|_p=|Cl(K)| is finite, then every Sylow p-subgroup is conjugate to K, and np≡1modp_p≡1p.
