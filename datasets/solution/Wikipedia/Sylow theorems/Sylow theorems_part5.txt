Consequences: The Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number p every Sylow p-subgroup is of the same order, pn^n. Conversely, if a subgroup has order pn^n, then it is a Sylow p-subgroup, and so is conjugate to every other Sylow p-subgroup. Due to the maximality condition, if H is any p-subgroup of G, then H is a subgroup of a p-subgroup of order pn^n. A very important consequence of Theorem 2 is that the condition np=1_p=1 is equivalent to saying that the Sylow p-subgroup of G is a normal subgroup. However, there are groups that have normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as S4_4. Sylow theorems for infinite
