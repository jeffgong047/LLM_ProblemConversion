applications: Since Sylow's theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, it's worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylow's theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not simple. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a normal subgroup. Example-1 Groups of order pq, p and q primes with p < q. Example-2 Group of order 30, groups of order 20, groups of order p2q, p and q distinct primes are some of the applications. Example-3 (Groups of order 60): If the order |G| = 60 and G has more than one Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is simple. Cyclic group
