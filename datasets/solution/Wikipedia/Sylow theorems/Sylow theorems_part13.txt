theorems: The Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves is the subject of many papers, including Waterhouse,[4] Scharlau,[5] Casadio and Zappa,[6] Gow,[7] and to some extent Meo.[8] One proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of group action in various creative ways. The group G acts on itself or on the set of its p-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems. The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of Wielandt.[9] In the following, we use a∣b as notation for "a divides b" and a∤b for the negation of this statement. Theorem (1) — A finite group G whose order |G||G| is divisible by a prime power pk has a subgroup of order pk. Proof Let |G| = pkm = pk+ru such that p∤u, and let Ω denote the set of subsets of G of size pk. G acts on Ω by left multiplication: for g ∈ G and ω ∈ Ω, g⋅ω = { gx | x ∈ ω }. For a given set ω ∈ Ω, write Gω for its stabilizer subgroup { g ∈ G | g⋅ω = ω } and Gω for its orbit { g⋅ω | g ∈ G } in Ω. The proof will show the existence of some ω ∈ Ω for which Gω has pk elements, providing the desired subgroup. This is the maximal possible size of a stabilizer subgroup Gω, since for any fixed element α ∈ ω ⊆ G, the right coset Gωα is contained in ω; therefore, |Gω| = |Gωα| ≤ |ω| = pk. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem we have |Gω| |Gω| = |G| for each ω ∈ Ω, and therefore using the additive p-adic valuation νp, which counts the number of factors p, one has νp(|Gω|) + νp(|Gω|) = νp(|G|) = k + r. This means that for those ω with |Gω| = pk, the ones we are looking for, one has νp(|Gω|) = r, while for any other ω one has νp(|Gω|) > r (as 0 < |Gω| < pk implies νp(|Gω|) < k). Since |Ω| is the sum of |Gω| over all distinct orbits Gω, one can show the existence of ω of the former type by showing that νp(|Ω|) = r (if none existed, that valuation would exceed r). This is an instance of Kummer's theorem (since in base p notation the number |G| ends with precisely k + r digits zero, subtracting pk from it involves a carry in r places), and can also be shown by a simple computation: |Ω|=(pkmpk)=∏j=0pk−1pkm−jpk−j=m∏j=1pk−1pk−νp(j)m−j/pνp(j)pk−νp(j)−j/pνp(j)|Ω|=p^km^k=∏_j=0^p^k-1p^km-j/p^k-j=m∏_j=1^p^k-1p^k-ν_p(j)m-j/p^ν_p(j)/p^k-ν_p(j)-j/p^ν_p(j) and no power of p remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right. Hence νp(|Ω|) = νp(m) = r, completing the proof. It may be noted that conversely every subgroup H of order pk gives rise to sets ω ∈ Ω for which Gω = H, namely any one of the m distinct cosets Hg. Lemma — Let H be a finite p-group, let Ω be a finite set acted on by H, and let Ω0 denote the set of points of Ω that are fixed under the action of H. Then |Ω| ≡ |Ω0| (mod p). Proof Any element x ∈ Ω not fixed by H will lie in an orbit of order |H|/|Hx| (where Hx denotes the stabilizer), which is a multiple of p by assumption. The result follows immediately by writing |Ω| as the sum of |Hx| over all distinct orbits Hx and reducing mod p. Theorem (2) — If H is a p-subgroup of G and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then there exists an element g in G such that g−1Hg ≤ P. In particular, all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other (and therefore isomorphic), that is, if H and K are Sylow p-subgroups of G, then there exists an element g in G with g−1Hg = K. Proof Let Ω be the set of left cosets of P in G and let H act on Ω by left multiplication. Applying the Lemma to H on Ω, we see that |Ω0| ≡ |Ω| = [G : P] (mod p). Now p∤[G:P]∤[G:P] by definition so p∤|Ω0|∤|Ω_0|, hence in particular |Ω0| ≠ 0 so there exists some gP ∈ Ω0. With this gP, we have hgP = gP for all h ∈ H, so g−1HgP = P and therefore g−1Hg ≤ P. Furthermore, if H is a Sylow p-subgroup, then |g−1Hg| = |H| = |P| so that g−1Hg = P. Theorem (3) — Let q denote the order of any Sylow p-subgroup P of a finite group G. Let np denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then (a) np = [G : NG(P)] (where NG(P) is the normalizer of P), (b) np divides |G|/q, and (c) np ≡ 1 (mod p). Proof Let Ω be the set of all Sylow p-subgroups of G and let G act on Ω by conjugation. Let P ∈ Ω be a Sylow p-subgroup. By Theorem 2, the orbit of P has size np, so by the orbit-stabilizer theorem np = [G : GP]. For this group action, the stabilizer GP is given by {g ∈ G | gPg−1 = P} = NG(P), the normalizer of P in G. Thus, np = [G : NG(P)], and it follows that this number is a divisor of [G : P] = |G|/q. Now let P act on Ω by conjugation, and again let Ω0 denote the set of fixed points of this action. Let Q ∈ Ω0 and observe that then Q = xQx−1 for all x ∈ P so that P ≤ NG(Q). By Theorem 2, P and Q are conjugate in NG(Q) in particular, and Q is normal in NG(Q), so then P = Q. It follows that Ω0 = {P} so that, by the Lemma, |Ω| ≡ |Ω0| = 1 (mod p).
