theorem: Part of Wilson's theorem states that (p−1)!≡−1(modp)(p-1)!≡-1p for every prime p. One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow's third theorem. Indeed, observe that the number np of Sylow's p-subgroups in the symmetric group Sp is (p − 2)!. On the other hand, np ≡ 1 (mod p). Hence, (p − 2)! ≡ 1 (mod p). So, (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). Fusion
