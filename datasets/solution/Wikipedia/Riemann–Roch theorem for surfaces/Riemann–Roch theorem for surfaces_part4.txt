theorem: For surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces combined with the Noether formula. To see this, recall that for each divisor D on a surface there is an invertible sheaf L = O(D) such that the linear system of D is more or less the space of sections of L. For surfaces the Todd class is 1+c1(X)/2+(c1(X)2+c2(X))/121+c_1(X)/2+(c_1(X)^2+c_2(X))/12, and the Chern character of the sheaf L is just 1+c1(L)+c1(L)2/21+c_1(L)+c_1(L)^2/2, so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that χ(D)=h0(L)−h1(L)+h2(L)=12c1(L)2+12c1(L)c1(X)+112(c1(X)2+c2(X))χ(D) =h^0(L)-h^1(L)+h^2(L) =1/2c_1(L)^2+1/2c_1(L) c_1(X)+1/12(c_1(X)^2+c_2(X)) Fortunately this can be written in a clearer form as follows. First putting D = 0 shows that χ(0)=112(c1(X)2+c2(X))χ(0)=1/12(c_1(X)^2+c_2(X)) (Noether's formula) For invertible sheaves (line bundles) the second Chern class vanishes. The products of second cohomology classes can be identified with intersection numbers in the Picard group, and we get a more classical version of Riemann Roch for surfaces: χ(D)=χ(0)+12(D.D−D.K)χ(D)=χ(0)+1/2(D.D-D.K) If we want, we can use Serre duality to express h2(O(D)) as h0(O(K − D)), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the h1(O(D)) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).
