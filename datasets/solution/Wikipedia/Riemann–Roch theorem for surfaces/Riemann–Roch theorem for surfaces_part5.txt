versions: The earliest forms of the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces were often stated as an inequality rather than an equality, because there was no direct geometric description of first cohomology groups. A typical example is given by Zariski (1995, p. 78), which states that r≥n−π+pa+1−i-π+p_a+1-i where r is the dimension of the complete linear system |D| of a divisor D (so r = h0(O(D)) −1) n is the virtual degree of D, given by the self-intersection number (D.D) π is the virtual genus of D, equal to 1 + (D.D + K.D)/2 pa is the arithmetic genus χ(OF) − 1 of the surface i is the index of speciality of D, equal to dim H0(O(K − D)) (which by Serre duality is the same as dim H2(O(D))). The difference between the two sides of this inequality was called the superabundance s of the divisor D. Comparing this inequality with the sheaf-theoretic version of the Riemann–Roch theorem shows that the superabundance of D is given by s = dim H1(O(D)). The divisor D was called regular if i = s = 0 (or in other words if all higher cohomology groups of O(D) vanish) and superabundant if s > 0.
