Riemann–Roch theorem for surfacesFieldAlgebraic geometryFirst proof byGuido Castelnuovo, Max Noether, Federigo EnriquesFirst proof in1886, 1894, 1896, 1897GeneralizationsAtiyah–Singer index theoremGrothendieck–Riemann–Roch theoremHirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theoremConsequencesRiemann–Roch theorem In mathematics, the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces describes the dimension of linear systems on an algebraic surface. The classical form of it was first given by Castelnuovo (1896, 1897), after preliminary versions of it were found by Max Noether (1886) and Enriques (1894). The sheaf-theoretic version is due to Hirzebruch.
