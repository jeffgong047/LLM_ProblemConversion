Statement: One form of the Riemann–Roch theorem states that if D is a divisor on a non-singular projective surface then χ(D)=χ(0)+12D.(D−K)χ(D)=χ(0)+12D.(D-K) where χ is the holomorphic Euler characteristic, the dot . is the intersection number, and K is the canonical divisor. The constant χ(0) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle, and is equal to 1 + pa, where pa is the arithmetic genus of the surface. For comparison, the Riemann–Roch theorem for a curve states that χ(D) = χ(0) + deg(D). Noether's
