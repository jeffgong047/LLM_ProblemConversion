formula: Noether's formula states that χ=c12+c212=(K.K)+e12χ=c_1^2+c_2/12=(K.K)+e/12 where χ=χ(0) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic, c12 = (K.K) is a Chern number and the self-intersection number of the canonical class K, and e = c2 is the topological Euler characteristic. It can be used to replace the term χ(0) in the Riemann–Roch theorem with topological terms; this gives the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces. Relation to the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch
