In mathematics, Krener's theorem is a result attributed to Arthur J. Krener in geometric control theory about the topological properties of attainable sets of finite-dimensional control systems.  It states that any attainable set of a bracket-generating system has nonempty interior or, equivalently, that any attainable set has nonempty interior in the topology of the corresponding orbit. Heuristically, Krener's theorem prohibits attainable sets from being hairy.

Theorem[edit]
Let 
q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) 
be a smooth control system, where 
q 
belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold M and u belongs to a control set U. Consider the family  of vector fields F=f(⋅,u)∣u∈Uℱ={f(·,u)}.
Let LieF
mathrmLie ℱ be the Lie algebra generated by Fℱ with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields. 
Given q∈M, if the vector space LieqF=g(q)∣g∈LieF
mathrmLie_q ℱ={g(q)∈Lie ℱ} is equal to TqM_qM,
then q belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q.

Remarks and consequences[edit]
Even if LieqFLie_q ℱ is different from TqM_qM,
the attainable set from q has nonempty interior in the orbit topology,
as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through q.
When all the vector fields in F{ℱ are analytic,  LieqF=TqM
mathrmLie_q ℱ=T_qM if and only if q belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q. This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the orbit theorem.
As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from q∈M is dense in M, then the attainable set from q
is actually equal to M.
