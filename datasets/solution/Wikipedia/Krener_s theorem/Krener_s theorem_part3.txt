consequences: Even if LieqFLie_q ℱ is different from TqM_qM, the attainable set from q has nonempty interior in the orbit topology, as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through q. When all the vector fields in F{ℱ are analytic, LieqF=TqM mathrmLie_q ℱ=T_qM if and only if q belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q. This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the orbit theorem. As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from q∈M is dense in M, then the attainable set from q is actually equal to M.
