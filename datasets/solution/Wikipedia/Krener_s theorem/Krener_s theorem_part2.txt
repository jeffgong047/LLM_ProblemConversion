Theorem: Let q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) be a smooth control system, where q belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold M and u belongs to a control set U. Consider the family of vector fields F=f(⋅,u)∣u∈Uℱ={f(·,u)}. Let LieF mathrmLie ℱ be the Lie algebra generated by Fℱ with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields. Given q∈M, if the vector space LieqF=g(q)∣g∈LieF mathrmLie_q ℱ={g(q)∈Lie ℱ} is equal to TqM_qM, then q belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q. Remarks and
