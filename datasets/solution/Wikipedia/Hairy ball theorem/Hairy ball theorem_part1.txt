Theorem in differential topology A failed attempt to comb a hairy 3-ball (2-sphere), leaving a tuft at each pole A hairy doughnut (2-torus), on the other hand, is quite easily combable. A continuous tangent vector field on a 2-sphere with only one pole, in this case a dipole field with index 2. See also an animated version of this graphic. A hair whorl The hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology (sometimes called the hedgehog theorem in Europe)[1] states that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres.[2][3] For the ordinary sphere, or 2‑sphere, if f is a continuous function that assigns a vector in R3 to every point p on a sphere such that f(p) is always tangent to the sphere at p, then there is at least one pole, a point where the field vanishes (a p such that f(p) = 0). The theorem was first proved by Henri Poincaré for the 2-sphere in 1885,[4] and extended to higher even dimensions in 1912 by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer.[5] The theorem has been expressed colloquially as "you can't comb a hairy ball flat without creating a cowlick" or "you can't comb the hair on a coconut".[6] Counting
