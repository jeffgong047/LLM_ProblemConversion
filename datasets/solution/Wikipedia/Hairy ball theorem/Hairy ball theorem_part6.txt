dimensions: The connection with the Euler characteristic χ suggests the correct generalisation: the 2n-sphere has no non-vanishing vector field for n ≥ 1. The difference between even and odd dimensions is that, because the only nonzero Betti numbers of the m-sphere are b0 and bm, their alternating sum χ is 2 for m even, and 0 for m odd. Indeed it is easy to see that an odd-dimensional sphere admits a non-vanishing tangent vector field through a simple process of considering coordinates of the ambient even-dimensional Euclidean space R2nℝ^2n in pairs. Namely, one may define a tangent vector field to S2n−1^2n-1 by specifying a vector field v:R2n→R2n:ℝ^2n→ℝ^2n given by v(x1,…,x2n)=(x2,−x1,…,x2n,−x2n−1).(x_1,…,x_2n)=(x_2,-x_1,…,x_2n,-x_2n-1). In order for this vector field to restrict to a tangent vector field to the unit sphere S2n−1⊂R2n^2n-1⊂ℝ^2n it is enough to verify that the dot product with a unit vector of the form x=(x1,…,x2n)=(x_1,…,x_2n) satisfying ‖x‖=1x=1 vanishes. Due to the pairing of coordinates, one sees v(x1,…,x2n)∙(x1,…,x2n)=(x2x1−x1x2)+⋯+(x2nx2n−1−x2n−1x2n)=0.(x_1,…,x_2n)∙(x_1,…,x_2n)=(x_2x_1-x_1x_2)+⋯+(x_2nx_2n-1-x_2n-1x_2n)=0. For a 2n-sphere, the ambient Euclidean space is R2n+1ℝ^2n+1 which is odd-dimensional, and so this simple process of pairing coordinates is not possible. Whilst this does not preclude the possibility that there may still exist a tangent vector field to the even-dimensional sphere which does not vanish, the hairy ball theorem demonstrates that in fact there is no way of constructing such a vector field.
