Comments: On the one hand, the Banach–Mazur theorem seems to tell us that the seemingly vast collection of all separable Banach spaces is not that vast or difficult to work with, since a separable Banach space is "only" a collection of continuous paths. On the other hand, the theorem tells us that C0([0, 1], R) is a "really big" space, big enough to contain every possible separable Banach space. Non-separable Banach spaces cannot embed isometrically in the separable space C0([0, 1], R), but for every Banach space X, one can find a compact Hausdorff space K and an isometric linear embedding j of X into the space C(K) of scalar continuous functions on K. The simplest choice is to let K be the unit ball of the continuous dual X ′, equipped with the w*-topology. This unit ball K is then compact by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. The embedding j is introduced by saying that for every x ∈ X, the continuous function j(x) on K is defined by ∀x′∈K:j(x)(x′)=x′(x).':(x)(x')=x'(x). The mapping j is linear, and it is isometric by the Hahn–Banach theorem. Another generalization was given by Kleiber and Pervin (1969): a metric space of density equal to an infinite cardinal α is isometric to a subspace of C0([0,1]α, R), the space of real continuous functions on the product of α copies of the unit interval.
