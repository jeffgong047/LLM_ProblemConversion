theorem: Let us write Ck[0, 1] for Ck([0, 1], R). In 1995, Luis Rodríguez-Piazza proved that the isometry i : X → C0[0, 1] can be chosen so that every non-zero function in the image i(X) is nowhere differentiable. Put another way, if D ⊂ C0[0, 1] consists of functions that are differentiable at at least one point of [0, 1], then i can be chosen so that i(X) ∩ D = {0}. This conclusion applies to the space C0[0, 1] itself, hence there exists a linear map i : C0[0, 1] → C0[0, 1] that is an isometry onto its image, such that image under i of C0[0, 1] (the subspace consisting of functions that are everywhere differentiable with continuous derivative) intersects D only at 0: thus the space of smooth functions (with respect to the uniform distance) is isometrically isomorphic to a space of nowhere-differentiable functions. Note that the (metrically incomplete) space of smooth functions is dense in C0[0, 1].
