statement: If X is a compact topological space, and (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is a monotonically increasing sequence (meaning fn(x)≤fn+1(x)_n(x)_n+1(x) for all n∈N∈ℕ and x∈X) of continuous real-valued functions on X which converges pointwise to a continuous function f:X→R→ℝ, then the convergence is uniform. The same conclusion holds if (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically decreasing instead of increasing. The theorem is named after Ulisse Dini.[2] This is one of the few situations in mathematics where pointwise convergence implies uniform convergence; the key is the greater control implied by the monotonicity. The limit function must be continuous, since a uniform limit of continuous functions is necessarily continuous. The continuity of the limit function cannot be inferred from the other hypothesis (consider xn^n in [0,1][0,1].)
