Proof: Let ε>0ε>0 be given. For each n∈N∈ℕ, let gn=f−fn_n=f-f_n, and let En_n be the set of those x∈X such that gn(x)<ε_n(x)<ε. Each gn_n is continuous, and so each En_n is open (because each En_n is the preimage of the open set (−∞,ε)(-∞,ε) under gn_n, a continuous function). Since (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically increasing, (gn)n∈N(g_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically decreasing, it follows that the sequence En_n is ascending (i.e. En⊂En+1_n_n+1 for all n∈N∈ℕ). Since (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ converges pointwise to f, it follows that the collection (En)n∈N(E_n)_n∈ℕ is an open cover of X. By compactness, there is a finite subcover, and since En_n are ascending the largest of these is a cover too. Thus we obtain that there is some positive integer N such that EN=X_N=X. That is, if n>N>N and x is a point in X, then |f(x)−fn(x)|<ε|f(x)-f_n(x)|<ε, as desired.
