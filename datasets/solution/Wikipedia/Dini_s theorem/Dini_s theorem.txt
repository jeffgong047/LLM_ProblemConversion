In the mathematical field of analysis, Dini's theorem says that if a monotone sequence of continuous functions converges pointwise on a compact space and if the limit function is also continuous, then the convergence is uniform.[1]


Formal statement[edit]
If X is a compact topological space, and (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is a monotonically increasing sequence (meaning fn(x)≤fn+1(x)_n(x)_n+1(x) for all n∈N∈ℕ and x∈X) of continuous real-valued functions on X which converges pointwise to a continuous function f:X→R→ℝ, then the convergence is uniform. The same conclusion holds if (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically decreasing instead of increasing. The theorem is named after Ulisse Dini.[2]
This is one of the few situations in mathematics where pointwise convergence implies uniform convergence; the key is the greater control implied by the monotonicity. The limit function must be continuous, since a uniform limit of continuous functions is necessarily continuous. The continuity of the limit function cannot be inferred from the other hypothesis (consider xn^n in [0,1][0,1].)

Proof[edit]
Let ε>0ε>0 be given.  For each n∈N∈ℕ, let gn=f−fn_n=f-f_n, and let En_n be the set of those x∈X such that gn(x)<ε_n(x)<ε. Each gn_n is continuous, and so each En_n is open (because each En_n is the preimage of the open set (−∞,ε)(-∞,ε) under gn_n, a continuous function).  Since (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically increasing, (gn)n∈N(g_n)_n∈ℕ is monotonically decreasing, it follows that the sequence En_n is ascending (i.e. En⊂En+1_n_n+1 for all n∈N∈ℕ).  Since (fn)n∈N(f_n)_n∈ℕ converges pointwise to f, it follows that the collection (En)n∈N(E_n)_n∈ℕ is an open cover of X.  By compactness, there is a finite subcover, and since En_n are ascending the largest of these is a cover too. Thus we obtain that there is some positive integer N such that  EN=X_N=X.  That is, if n>N>N and x is a point in X, then |f(x)−fn(x)|<ε|f(x)-f_n(x)|<ε, as desired.

^ According to Edwards 1994, p. 165, "[This theorem] is called Dini's theorem because Ulisse Dini (1845–1918) presented the original version of it in his book on the theory of functions of a real variable, published in Pisa in 1878.".
