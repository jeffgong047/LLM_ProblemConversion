Theorem: Let the Taylor series G(x)=∑k=0∞akxk(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k be a power series with real coefficients ak_k with radius of convergence 1.1. Suppose that the series ∑k=0∞ak∑_k=0^∞a_k converges. Then G(x)(x) is continuous from the left at x=1,=1, that is, limx→1−G(x)=∑k=0∞ak.lim_x→1^-G(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_k. The same theorem holds for complex power series G(z)=∑k=0∞akzk,(z)=∑_k=0^∞a_kz^k, provided that z→1→1 entirely within a single Stolz sector, that is, a region of the open unit disk where |1−z|≤M(1−|z|)|1-z|(1-|z|) for some fixed finite M>1>1. Without this restriction, the limit may fail to exist: for example, the power series ∑n>0z3n−z2⋅3nn∑_n>0z^3^n-z^2·3^n/n converges to 00 at z=1,=1, but is unbounded near any point of the form eπi/3n,^/3^n, so the value at z=1=1 is not the limit as z tends to 1 in the whole open disk. Note that G(z)(z) is continuous on the real closed interval [0,t][0,t] for t<1,<1, by virtue of the uniform convergence of the series on compact subsets of the disk of convergence. Abel's theorem allows us to say more, namely that G(z)(z) is continuous on [0,1].[0,1]. Stolz
