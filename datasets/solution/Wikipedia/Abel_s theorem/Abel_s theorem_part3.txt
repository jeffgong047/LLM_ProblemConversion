sector: 20 Stolz sectors, for M ranging from 1.01 to 10. The red lines are the tangents to the cone at the right end. The Stolz sector |1−z|≤M(1−|z|)|1-z|(1-|z|) has explicit formulay2=−M4(x2−1)−2M2((x−1)x+1)+2M4(−2M2(x−1)+2x−1)+(x−1)2(M2−1)2^2=-M^4(x^2-1)-2M^2((x-1)x+1)+2√(M^4(-2M^2(x-1)+2x-1))+(x-1)^2/(M^2-1)^2and is plotted on the right for various values. The left end of the sector is x=1−M1+M=1-M/1+M, and the right end is x=1=1. On the right end, it becomes a cone with angle 2θ2θ, where cos⁡θ=1Mcosθ=1/M.
