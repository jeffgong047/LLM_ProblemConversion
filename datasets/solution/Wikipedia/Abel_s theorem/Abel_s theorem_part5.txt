Applications: The utility of Abel's theorem is that it allows us to find the limit of a power series as its argument (that is, z) approaches 11 from below, even in cases where the radius of convergence, R,, of the power series is equal to 11 and we cannot be sure whether the limit should be finite or not. See for example, the binomial series. Abel's theorem allows us to evaluate many series in closed form. For example, when ak=(−1)kk+1,_k=(-1)^k/k+1, we obtain Ga(z)=ln⁡(1+z)z,0<z<1,_a(z)=ln(1+z)/z, 0<z<1, by integrating the uniformly convergent geometric power series term by term on [−z,0][-z,0]; thus the series ∑k=0∞(−1)kk+1∑_k=0^∞(-1)^k/k+1 converges to ln⁡(2)ln(2) by Abel's theorem. Similarly, ∑k=0∞(−1)k2k+1∑_k=0^∞(-1)^k/2k+1 converges to arctan⁡(1)=π4.arctan(1)=π4. Ga(z)_a(z) is called the generating function of the sequence a.. Abel's theorem is frequently useful in dealing with generating functions of real-valued and non-negative sequences, such as probability-generating functions. In particular, it is useful in the theory of Galton–Watson processes. Outline of
