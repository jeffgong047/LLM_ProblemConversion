Remarks: As an immediate consequence of this theorem, if z is any nonzero complex number for which the series ∑k=0∞akzk∑_k=0^∞a_kz^k converges, then it follows that limt→1−G(tz)=∑k=0∞akzklim_t→1^-G(tz)=∑_k=0^∞a_kz^k in which the limit is taken from below. The theorem can also be generalized to account for sums which diverge to infinity.[citation needed] If ∑k=0∞ak=∞∑_k=0^∞a_k=∞ then limz→1−G(z)→∞.lim_z→1^-G(z)→∞. However, if the series is only known to be divergent, but for reasons other than diverging to infinity, then the claim of the theorem may fail: take, for example, the power series for 11+z.1/1+z. At z=1=1 the series is equal to 1−1+1−1+⋯,1-1+1-1+⋯, but 11+1=12.11+1=12. We also remark the theorem holds for radii of convergence other than R=1=1: let G(x)=∑k=0∞akxk(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k be a power series with radius of convergence R,, and suppose the series converges at x=R.=R. Then G(x)(x) is continuous from the left at x=R,=R, that is, limx→R−G(x)=G(R).lim_x^-G(x)=G(R).
