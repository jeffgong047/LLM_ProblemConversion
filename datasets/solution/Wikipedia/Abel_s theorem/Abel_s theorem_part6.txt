proof: After subtracting a constant from a0,_0, we may assume that ∑k=0∞ak=0.∑_k=0^∞a_k=0. Let sn=∑k=0nak._n=∑_k=0^na_k. Then substituting ak=sk−sk−1_k=s_k-s_k-1 and performing a simple manipulation of the series (summation by parts) results in Ga(z)=(1−z)∑k=0∞skzk._a(z)=(1-z)∑_k=0^∞s_kz^k. Given ε>0,ε>0, pick n large enough so that |sk|<ε|s_k|<ε for all k≥n and note that |(1−z)∑k=n∞skzk|≤ε|1−z|∑k=n∞|z|k=ε|1−z||z|n1−|z|<εM|(1-z)∑_k=n^∞s_kz^k|≤ε|1-z|∑_k=n^∞|z|^k=ε|1-z||z|^n/1-|z|< when z lies within the given Stolz angle. Whenever z is sufficiently close to 11 we have |(1−z)∑k=0n−1skzk|<ε,|(1-z)∑_k=0^n-1s_kz^k|<ε, so that |Ga(z)|<(M+1)ε|G_a(z)|<(M+1)ε when z is both sufficiently close to 11 and within the Stolz angle.
