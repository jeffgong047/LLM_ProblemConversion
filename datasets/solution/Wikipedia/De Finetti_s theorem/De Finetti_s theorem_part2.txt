Background: A Bayesian statistician often seeks the conditional probability distribution of a random quantity given the data. The concept of exchangeability was introduced by de Finetti. De Finetti's theorem explains a mathematical relationship between independence and exchangeability.[1] An infinite sequence X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… of random variables is said to be exchangeable if for any natural number n and any finite sequence i1, ..., in and any permutation of the sequence π:{i1, ..., in } → {i1, ..., in }, (Xi1,…,Xin)and(Xπ(i1),…,Xπ(in))(X_i_1,…,X_i_n)and(X_π(i_1),…,X_π(i_n)) both have the same joint probability distribution. If an identically distributed sequence is independent, then the sequence is exchangeable; however, the converse is false—there exist exchangeable random variables that are not statistically independent, for example the Pólya urn model.
