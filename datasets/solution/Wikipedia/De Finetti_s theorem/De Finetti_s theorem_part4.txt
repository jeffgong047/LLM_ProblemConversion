theorem: Suppose X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… is an infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables. Then X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… are conditionally independent and identically distributed given the exchangeable sigma-algebra (i.e., the sigma-algebra consisting of events that are measurable with respect to X1,X2,…_1,X_2,… and invariant under finite permutations of the indices).
