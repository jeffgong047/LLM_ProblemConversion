Derivation: We may assume, without loss of generality, that in a Cartesian coordinate system the perpendicular distance between the axes lies along the x-axis and that the center of mass lies at the origin. The moment of inertia relative to the z-axis is then Icm=∫(x2+y2)dm._cm=∫(x^2+y^2) dm. The moment of inertia relative to the axis z′, which is at a distance D from the center of mass along the x-axis, is I=∫[(x−D)2+y2]dm.=∫[(x-D)^2+y^2] dm. Expanding the brackets yields I=∫(x2+y2)dm+D2∫dm−2D∫xdm.=∫(x^2+y^2) dm+D^2-2D dm. The first term is Icm and the second term becomes MD2. The integral in the final term is a multiple of the x-coordinate of the center of mass – which is zero since the center of mass lies at the origin. So, the equation becomes: I=Icm+MD2.=I_cm+MD^2.
