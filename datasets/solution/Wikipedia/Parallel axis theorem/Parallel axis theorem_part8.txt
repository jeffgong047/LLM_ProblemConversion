matrix: In order to compare formulations of the parallel axis theorem using skew-symmetric matrices and the tensor formulation, the following identities are useful. Let [R] be the skew symmetric matrix associated with the position vector R = (x, y, z), then the product in the inertia matrix becomes −[R][R]=−[0−zyz0−x−yx0]2=[y2+z2−xy−xz−yxx2+z2−yz−zx−zyx2+y2].-[R][R]=-[ 0 -z y; z 0 -x; -y x 0 ]^2=[ y^2+z^2 -xy -xz; -yx x^2+z^2 -yz; -zx -zy x^2+y^2 ]. This product can be computed using the matrix formed by the outer product [R RT] using the identify −[R]2=|R|2[E3]−[RRT]=[x2+y2+z2000x2+y2+z2000x2+y2+z2]−[x2xyxzyxy2yzzxzyz2],-[R]^2=|𝐑|^2[E_3]-[𝐑𝐑^T]=[ x^2+y^2+z^2 0 0; 0 x^2+y^2+z^2 0; 0 0 x^2+y^2+z^2 ]-[ x^2 xy xz; yx y^2 yz; zx zy z^2 ], where [E3] is the 3 × 3 identity matrix. Also notice, that |R|2=R⋅R=tr⁡[RRT],|𝐑|^2=𝐑·𝐑=tr[𝐑𝐑^T], where tr denotes the sum of the diagonal elements of the outer product matrix, known as its trace. See
