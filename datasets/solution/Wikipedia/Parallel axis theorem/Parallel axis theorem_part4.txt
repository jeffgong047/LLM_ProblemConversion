generalization: The parallel axis theorem can be generalized to calculations involving the inertia tensor.[2] Let Iij denote the inertia tensor of a body as calculated at the center of mass. Then the inertia tensor Jij as calculated relative to a new point is Jij=Iij+m(|R|2δij−RiRj),_ij=I_ij+m(|𝐑|^2δ_ij-R_iR_j), where R=R1x^+R2y^+R3z^𝐑=R_1𝐱̂+R_2ŷ+R_3ẑ is the displacement vector from the center of mass to the new point, and δij is the Kronecker delta. For diagonal elements (when i = j), displacements perpendicular to the axis of rotation results in the above simplified version of the parallel axis theorem. The generalized version of the parallel axis theorem can be expressed in the form of coordinate-free notation as J=I+m[(R⋅R)E3−R⊗R],𝐉=𝐈+m[(𝐑·𝐑)𝐄_3-𝐑⊗𝐑], where E3 is the 3 × 3 identity matrix and ⊗⊗ is the outer product. Further generalization of the parallel axis theorem gives the inertia tensor about any set of orthogonal axes parallel to the reference set of axes x, y and z, associated with the reference inertia tensor, whether or not they pass through the center of mass.[2] Second moment of
