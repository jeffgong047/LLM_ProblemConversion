inertia: The mass moment of inertia of a body around an axis can be determined from the mass moment of inertia around a parallel axis through the center of mass. Suppose a body of mass m is rotated about an axis z passing through the body's center of mass. The body has a moment of inertia Icm with respect to this axis. The parallel axis theorem states that if the body is made to rotate instead about a new axis z′, which is parallel to the first axis and displaced from it by a distance d, then the moment of inertia I with respect to the new axis is related to Icm by I=Icm+md2.=I_cm+md^2. Explicitly, d is the perpendicular distance between the axes z and z′. The parallel axis theorem can be applied with the stretch rule and perpendicular axis theorem to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes. Parallel axes rule for area moment of inertia
