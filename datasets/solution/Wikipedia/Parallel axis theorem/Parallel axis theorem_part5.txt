area: The parallel axes rule also applies to the second moment of area (area moment of inertia) for a plane region D: Iz=Ix+Ar2,_z=I_x+Ar^2, where Iz is the area moment of inertia of D relative to the parallel axis, Ix is the area moment of inertia of D relative to its centroid, A is the area of the plane region D, and r is the distance from the new axis z to the centroid of the plane region D. The centroid of D coincides with the centre of gravity of a physical plate with the same shape that has uniform density. Polar moment of inertia for planar
