matrix: The inertia matrix of a rigid system of particles depends on the choice of the reference point.[4] There is a useful relationship between the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass R and the inertia matrix relative to another point S. This relationship is called the parallel axis theorem. Consider the inertia matrix [IS] obtained for a rigid system of particles measured relative to a reference point S, given by [IS]=−∑i=1nmi[ri−S][ri−S],[I_S]=-∑_i=1^nm_i[r_i-S][r_i-S], where ri defines the position of particle Pi, i = 1, ..., n. Recall that [ri − S] is the skew-symmetric matrix that performs the cross product, [ri−S]y=(ri−S)×y,[r_i-S]𝐲=(𝐫_i-𝐒)×𝐲, for an arbitrary vector y. Let R be the center of mass of the rigid system, then R=(R−S)+S=d+S,𝐑=(𝐑-𝐒)+𝐒=𝐝+𝐒, where d is the vector from the reference point S to the center of mass R. Use this equation to compute the inertia matrix, [IS]=−∑i=1nmi[ri−R+d][ri−R+d].[I_S]=-∑_i=1^nm_i[r_i-R+d][r_i-R+d]. Expand this equation to obtain [IS]=(−∑i=1nmi[ri−R][ri−R])+(−∑i=1nmi[ri−R])[d]+[d](−∑i=1nmi[ri−R])+(−∑i=1nmi)[d][d].[I_S]=(-∑_i=1^nm_i[r_i-R][r_i-R])+(-∑_i=1^nm_i[r_i-R])[d]+[d](-∑_i=1^nm_i[r_i-R])+(-∑_i=1^nm_i)[d][d]. The first term is the inertia matrix [IR] relative to the center of mass. The second and third terms are zero by definition of the center of mass R, ∑i=1nmi(ri−R)=0.∑_i=1^nm_i(𝐫_i-𝐑)=0. And the last term is the total mass of the system multiplied by the square of the skew-symmetric matrix [d] constructed from d. The result is the parallel axis theorem, [IS]=[IR]−M[d]2,[I_S]=[I_R]-M[d]^2, where d is the vector from the reference point S to the center of mass R.[4] Identities for a skew-symmetric
