Statement: If U⊆A⊆X are as above, we say that U can be excised if the inclusion map of the pair (X∖U,A∖U)(X,A) into (X,A)(X,A) induces an isomorphism on the relative homologies: Hn(X∖U,A∖U)≅Hn(X,A)_n(X,A)_n(X,A) The theorem states that if the closure of U is contained in the interior of A, then U can be excised. Often, subspaces that do not satisfy this containment criterion still can be excised—it suffices to be able to find a deformation retract of the subspaces onto subspaces that do satisfy it. Proof
