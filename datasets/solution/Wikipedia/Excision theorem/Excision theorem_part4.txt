Sketch: The proof of the excision theorem is quite intuitive, though the details are rather involved. The idea is to subdivide the simplices in a relative cycle in (X,A)(X,A) to get another chain consisting of "smaller" simplices, and continuing the process until each simplex in the chain lies entirely in the interior of A or the interior of Xâˆ–U. Since these form an open cover for X and simplices are compact, we can eventually do this in a finite number of steps. This process leaves the original homology class of the chain unchanged (this says the subdivision operator is chain homotopic to the identity map on homology). In the relative homology Hn(X,A)_n(X,A), then, this says all the terms contained entirely in the interior of U can be dropped without affecting the homology class of the cycle. This allows us to show that the inclusion map is an isomorphism, as each relative cycle is equivalent to one that avoids U entirely.
