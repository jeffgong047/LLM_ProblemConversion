Dimension: If nonempty open sets U⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n and V⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m are homeomorphic, then m = n. This follows from the excision theorem, the long exact sequence for the pair (Rn,Rn−x)(ℝ^n,ℝ^n-x), and the fact that Rn−xℝ^n-x deformation retracts onto a sphere. In particular, Rnℝ^n is not homeomorphic to Rmℝ^m if m≠n.[3] See
