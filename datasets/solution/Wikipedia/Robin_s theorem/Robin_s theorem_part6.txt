powers: For a prime number p, σ0(p)=2σ0(pn)=n+1σ1(p)=p+1σ_0(p) =2 σ_0(p^n) =n+1 σ_1(p) =p+1 because by definition, the factors of a prime number are 1 and itself. Also, where pn# denotes the primorial, σ0(pn#)=2nσ_0(p_n#)=2^n since n prime factors allow a sequence of binary selection (pi_i or 1) from n terms for each proper divisor formed. However, these are not in general the smallest numbers whose number of divisors is a power of two; instead, the smallest such number may be obtained by multiplying together the first n Fermi–Dirac primes, prime powers whose exponent is a power of two.[4] Clearly, 1<σ0(n)<n1<σ_0(n)<n for all n>2>2, and σx(n)>nσ_x(n)>n for all n>1>1, x>0>0 . The divisor function is multiplicative (since each divisor c of the product mn with gcd(m,n)=1(m,n)=1 distinctively correspond to a divisor a of m and a divisor b of n), but not completely multiplicative: gcd(a,b)=1⟹σx(ab)=σx(a)σx(b).(a,b)=1⟹σ_x(ab)=σ_x(a)σ_x(b). The consequence of this is that, if we write n=∏i=1rpiai=∏_i=1^rp_i^a_i where r = ω(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n, pi is the ith prime factor, and ai is the maximum power of pi by which n is divisible, then we have: [5] σx(n)=∏i=1r∑j=0aipijx=∏i=1r(1+pix+pi2x+⋯+piaix).σ_x(n)=∏_i=1^r∑_j=0^a_ip_i^jx=∏_i=1^r(1+p_i^x+p_i^2x+⋯+p_i^a_ix). which, when x ≠ 0, is equivalent to the useful formula: [5] σx(n)=∏i=1rpi(ai+1)x−1pix−1.σ_x(n)=∏_i=1^rp_i^(a_i+1)x-1/p_i^x-1. When x = 0, σ0(n)σ_0(n) is: [5] σ0(n)=∏i=1r(ai+1).σ_0(n)=∏_i=1^r(a_i+1). This result can be directly deduced from the fact that all divisors of n are uniquely determined by the distinct tuples (x1,x2,...,xi,...,xr)(x_1,x_2,...,x_i,...,x_r) of integers with 0≤xi≤ai0_i_i (i.e. ai+1_i+1 independent choices for each xi_i). For example, if n is 24, there are two prime factors (p1 is 2; p2 is 3); noting that 24 is the product of 23×31, a1 is 3 and a2 is 1. Thus we can calculate σ0(24)σ_0(24) as so: σ0(24)=∏i=12(ai+1)=(3+1)(1+1)=4⋅2=8.σ_0(24)=∏_i=1^2(a_i+1)=(3+1)(1+1)=4·2=8. The eight divisors counted by this formula are 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, and 24.
