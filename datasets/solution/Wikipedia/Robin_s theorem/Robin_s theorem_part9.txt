rate: In little-o notation, the divisor function satisfies the inequality:[14][15] forallε>0,d(n)=o(nε).ε>0,(n)=o(n^ε). More precisely, Severin Wigert showed that:[15] limsupn→∞log⁡d(n)log⁡n/log⁡log⁡n=log⁡2.lim sup_n→∞(n)//log=log2. On the other hand, since there are infinitely many prime numbers,[15] liminfn→∞d(n)=2.lim inf_n→∞d(n)=2. In Big-O notation, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet showed that the average order of the divisor function satisfies the following inequality:[16][17] forallx≥1,∑n≤xd(n)=xlog⁡x+(2γ−1)x+O(x),x≥1,∑_nd(n)=x+(2γ-1)x+O(√(x)), where γγ is Euler's gamma constant. Improving the bound O(x)(√(x)) in this formula is known as Dirichlet's divisor problem. The behaviour of the sigma function is irregular. The asymptotic growth rate of the sigma function can be expressed by: [18] limsupn→∞σ(n)nlog⁡log⁡n=eγ,lim sup_n→∞σ(n)/n log=e^γ, where lim sup is the limit superior. This result is Grönwall's theorem, published in 1913 (Grönwall 1913). His proof uses Mertens' third theorem, which says that: limn→∞1log⁡n∏p≤npp−1=eγ,lim_n→∞1/∏_pp/p-1=e^γ, where p denotes a prime. In 1915, Ramanujan proved that under the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, Robin's inequality σ(n)<eγnlog⁡log⁡n sigma(n)<e^γnlog (where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant) holds for all sufficiently large n (Ramanujan 1997). The largest known value that violates the inequality is n=5040. In 1984, Guy Robin proved that the inequality is true for all n > 5040 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true (Robin 1984). This is Robin's theorem and the inequality became known after him. Robin furthermore showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is false then there are an infinite number of values of n that violate the inequality, and it is known that the smallest such n > 5040 must be superabundant (Akbary & Friggstad 2009). It has been shown that the inequality holds for large odd and square-free integers, and that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality just for n divisible by the fifth power of a prime (Choie et al. 2007). Robin also proved, unconditionally, that the inequality: σ(n)<eγnlog⁡log⁡n+0.6483nlog⁡log⁡n sigma(n)<e^γnlog+0.6483/log holds for all n ≥ 3. A related bound was given by Jeffrey Lagarias in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that: σ(n)<Hn+eHnlog⁡(Hn)σ(n)<H_n+e^H_nlog(H_n) for every natural number n > 1, where Hn_n is the nth harmonic number, (Lagarias 2002).
