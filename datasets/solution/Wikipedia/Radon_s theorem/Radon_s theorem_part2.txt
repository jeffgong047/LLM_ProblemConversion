construction: Consider any set X=x1,x2,…,xd+2⊂Rd={x_1,x_2,…,x_d+2}⊂𝐑^d of d + 2 points in d-dimensional space. Then there exists a set of multipliers a1, ..., ad + 2, not all of which are zero, solving the system of linear equations ∑i=1d+2aixi=0,∑i=1d+2ai=0,∑_i=1^d+2a_ix_i=0, ∑_i=1^d+2a_i=0, because there are d + 2 unknowns (the multipliers) but only d + 1 equations that they must satisfy (one for each coordinate of the points, together with a final equation requiring the sum of the multipliers to be zero). Fix some particular nonzero solution a1, ..., ad + 2. Let I⊆X be the set of points with positive multipliers, and let J=X∖I=X be the set of points with multipliers that are negative or zero. Then I and J form the required partition of the points into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls. The convex hulls of I and J must intersect, because they both contain the point p=∑xi∈IaiAxi=∑xj∈J−ajAxj,=∑_x_ia_i/Ax_i=∑_x_j-a_j/Ax_j, where A=∑xi∈Iai=−∑xj∈Jaj.=∑_x_ia_i=-∑_x_ja_j. The left hand side of the formula for p expresses this point as a convex combination of the points in I, and the right hand side expresses it as a convex combination of the points in J. Therefore, p belongs to both convex hulls, completing the proof. This proof method allows for the efficient construction of a Radon point, in an amount of time that is polynomial in the dimension, by using Gaussian elimination or other efficient algorithms to solve the system of equations for the multipliers.[1] Topological Radon
