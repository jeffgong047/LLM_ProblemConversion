theorem: An equivalent formulation of Radon's theorem is:If ƒ is any affine function from a (d + 1)-dimensional simplex Δd+1 to Rd, then there are two disjoint faces of Δd+1 whose images under ƒ intersect.They are equivalent because any affine function on a simplex is uniquely determined by the images of its vertices. Formally, let ƒ be an affine function from Δd+1 to Rd. Let v1,v2,…,vd+2_1,v_2,…,v_d+2 be the vertices of Δd+1, and let x1,x2,…,xd+2_1,x_2,…,x_d+2 be their images under ƒ. By the original formulation, the x1,x2,…,xd+2_1,x_2,…,x_d+2 can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets, e.g. (xi)i in I and (xj)j in J, with overlapping convex hull. Because f is affine, the convex hull of (xi)i in I is the image of the face spanned by the vertices (vi)i in I, and similarly the convex hull of (xj)j in J is the image of the face spanned by the vertices (vj)j in j. These two faces are disjoint, and their images under f intersect - as claimed by the new formulation. The topological Radon theorem generalizes this formluation. It allows f to be any continuous function - not necessarily affine:[2]If ƒ is any continuous function from a (d + 1)-dimensional simplex Δd+1 to Rd, then there are two disjoint faces of Δd+1 whose images under ƒ intersect.More generally, if K is any (d + 1)-dimensional compact convex set, and ƒ is any continuous function from K to d-dimensional space, then there exists a linear function g such that some point where g achieves its maximum value and some other point where g achieves its minimum value are mapped by ƒ to the same point. In the case where K is a simplex, the two simplex faces formed by the maximum and minimum points of g must then be two disjoint faces whose images have a nonempty intersection. This same general statement, when applied to a hypersphere instead of a simplex, gives the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, that ƒ must map two opposite points of the sphere to the same point.[2]
