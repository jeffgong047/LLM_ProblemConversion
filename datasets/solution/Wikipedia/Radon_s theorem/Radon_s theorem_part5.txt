Applications: The Radon point of any four points in the plane is their geometric median, the point that minimizes the sum of distances to the other points.[5][6] Radon's theorem forms a key step of a standard proof of Helly's theorem on intersections of convex sets;[7] this proof was the motivation for Radon's original discovery of Radon's theorem. Radon's theorem can also be used to calculate the VC dimension of d-dimensional points with respect to linear separations. There exist sets of d + 1 points (for instance, the points of a regular simplex) such that every two nonempty subsets can be separated from each other by a hyperplane. However, no matter which set of d + 2 points is given, the two subsets of a Radon partition cannot be linearly separated. Therefore, the VC dimension of this system is exactly d + 1.[8] A randomized algorithm that repeatedly replaces sets of d + 2 points by their Radon point can be used to compute an approximation to a centerpoint of any point set, in an amount of time that is polynomial in both the number of points and the dimension.[1] Related
