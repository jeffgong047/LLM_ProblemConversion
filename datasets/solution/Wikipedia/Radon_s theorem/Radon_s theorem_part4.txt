Proofs: The topological Radon theorem was originally proved by Bajmoczy and Barany[2] in the following way: Construct a continuous map g from Sd (the d-dimensional sphere) to Δd+1, such that for every point x on the sphere, g(x) and g(-x) are on two disjoint faces of Δd+1. Apply the Borsuk–Ulam theorem to the function f∘g, which is a continuous function from Sd to Rd. The theorem says that, for any such function, there exists some point y on Sd, such that f(g(y)) = f(g(-y)). The points g(y) and g(-y) are on two disjoint faces of Δd+1, and they are mapped by f to the same point of Rd. This implies that the images of these two disjoint faces intersect. Another proof was given by Lovasz and Schrijver.[3] A third proof is given by Matousek:[4]: 115 Let K be the simplex Δd+1, and let KΔ∗2_Δ^*2 be the deleted join of K with itself. The geometric realization of KΔ∗2_Δ^*2 is homeomorphic to the sphere Sd+1. Therefore, the Z2-index of KΔ∗2_Δ^*2 equals d+1. The topological Radon theorem follows from the following more general theorem. For any simplicial complex K, if the Z2-index of KΔ∗2_Δ^*2 is larger than d, then for every continuous mapping from ||K|| to Rd, the images of two disjoint faces of K intersect.
