theorem: Let G=A∗B=A*B be the free product of groups A and B and let H≤G be a subgroup of G. Then there exist a family (Ai)i∈I(A_i)_i of subgroups Ai≤A_i, a family (Bj)j∈J(B_j)_j of subgroups Bj≤B_j, families gi,i∈I_i,i and fj,j∈J_j,j of elements of G, and a subset X⊆G such that H=F(X)∗(∗i∈IgiAigi−1)∗(∗j∈JfjBjfj−1).=F(X)*(*_ig_iA_ig_i^-1)*(*_jf_jB_jf_j^-1). This means that X freely generates a subgroup of G isomorphic to the free group F(X) with free basis X and that, moreover, giAigi−1, fjBjfj−1 and X generate H in G as a free product of the above form. There is a generalization of this to the case of free products with arbitrarily many factors.[9] Its formulation is: If H is a subgroup of ∗i∈IGi = G, then H=F(X)∗(∗j∈JgjHjgj−1),=F(X)*(*_jg_jH_jg_j^-1), where X ⊆ G and J is some index set and gj ∈ G and each Hj is a subgroup of some Gi.
