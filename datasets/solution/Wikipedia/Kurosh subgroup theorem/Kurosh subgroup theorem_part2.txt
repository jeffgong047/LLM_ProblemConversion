generalizations: After the original 1934 proof of Kurosh, there were many subsequent proofs of the Kurosh subgroup theorem, including proofs of Harold W. Kuhn (1952),[2] Saunders Mac Lane (1958)[3] and others. The theorem was also generalized for describing subgroups of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions.[4][5] Other generalizations include considering subgroups of free pro-finite products[6] and a version of the Kurosh subgroup theorem for topological groups.[7] In modern terms, the Kurosh subgroup theorem is a straightforward corollary of the basic structural results of Bassâ€“Serre theory about groups acting on trees.[8] Statement of the
