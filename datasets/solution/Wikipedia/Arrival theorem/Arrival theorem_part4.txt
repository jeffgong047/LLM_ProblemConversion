networks: In a closed Gordon–Newell network with m queues, write n=(n1,n2,…,nm)𝐧=(n_1,n_2,…,n_m) for the state of the network. For a customer in transit to state i, let αi(n−ei)α_i(𝐧-𝐞_i) denote the probability that immediately before arrival the customer 'sees' the state of the system to be n−ei=(n1,n2,…,ni−1,…,nm).𝐧-𝐞_i=(n_1,n_2,…,n_i-1,…,n_m). This probability, αi(n−ei)α_i(𝐧-𝐞_i), is the same as the steady state probability for state n−ei𝐧-𝐞_i for a network of the same type with one customer less.[11] It was published independently by Sevcik and Mitrani,[10] and Reiser and Lavenberg,[12] where the result was used to develop mean value analysis.
