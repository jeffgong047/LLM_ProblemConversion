process: For Poisson processes the property is often referred to as the PASTA property (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) and states that the probability of the state as seen by an outside random observer is the same as the probability of the state seen by an arriving customer.[7] The property also holds for the case of a doubly stochastic Poisson process where the rate parameter is allowed to vary depending on the state.[8] Theorem for Jackson
