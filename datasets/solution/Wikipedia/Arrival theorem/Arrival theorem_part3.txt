networks: In an open Jackson network with m queues, write n=(n1,n2,…,nm)𝐧=(n_1,n_2,…,n_m) for the state of the network. Suppose π(n)π(𝐧) is the equilibrium probability that the network is in state n𝐧. Then the probability that the network is in state n𝐧 immediately before an arrival to any node is also π(n)π(𝐧). Note that this theorem does not follow from Jackson's theorem, where the steady state in continuous time is considered. Here we are concerned with particular points in time, namely arrival times.[9] This theorem first published by Sevcik and Mitrani in 1981.[10] Theorem for Gordon–Newell
