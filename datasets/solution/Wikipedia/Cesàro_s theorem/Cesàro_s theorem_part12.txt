series: Let n∈N∈ℕ such that n≥2≥2 (actually the following is also true for n=1=1 but the statement becomes trivial in that case) and let ∑k1=0∞a1,k1,…,∑kn=0∞an,kn∑_k_1=0^∞a_1,k_1,…,∑_k_n=0^∞a_n,k_n be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the nth one converge absolutely, and the nth one converges. Then the limit limN→∞∑k1+…+kn≤Na1,k1⋯an,knlim_N→∞∑_k_1+…+k_na_1,k_1_n,k_n exists and we have: ∏j=1n(∑kj=0∞aj,kj)=limN→∞∑k1+…+kn≤Na1,k1⋯an,kn∏_j=1^n(∑_k_j=0^∞a_j,k_j)=lim_N→∞∑_k_1+…+k_na_1,k_1_n,k_n
