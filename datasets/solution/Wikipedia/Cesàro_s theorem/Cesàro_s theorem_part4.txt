series: Consider the following two power series ∑i=0∞aixi∑_i=0^∞a_ix^i and ∑j=0∞bjxj∑_j=0^∞b_jx^j with complex coefficients ai{a_i} and bj{b_j}. The Cauchy product of these two power series is defined by a discrete convolution as follows: (∑i=0∞aixi)⋅(∑j=0∞bjxj)=∑k=0∞ckxk(∑_i=0^∞a_ix^i)·(∑_j=0^∞b_jx^j)=∑_k=0^∞c_kx^k where ck=∑l=0kalbk−l_k=∑_l=0^ka_lb_k-l.
