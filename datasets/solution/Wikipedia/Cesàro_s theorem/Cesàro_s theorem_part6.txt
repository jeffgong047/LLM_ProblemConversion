Example: Consider the two alternating series with an=bn=(−1)nn+1,_n=b_n=(-1)^n/√(n+1) , which are only conditionally convergent (the divergence of the series of the absolute values follows from the direct comparison test and the divergence of the harmonic series). The terms of their Cauchy product are given by cn=∑k=0n(−1)kk+1⋅(−1)n−kn−k+1=(−1)n∑k=0n1(k+1)(n−k+1)_n=∑_k=0^n(-1)^k/√(k+1)·(-1)^n-k/√(n-k+1)=(-1)^n∑_k=0^n1/√((k+1)(n-k+1)) for every integer n ≥ 0. Since for every k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} we have the inequalities k + 1 ≤ n + 1 and n – k + 1 ≤ n + 1, it follows for the square root in the denominator that √(k + 1)(n − k + 1) ≤ n +1, hence, because there are n + 1 summands, |cn|≥∑k=0n1n+1=1|c_n|≥∑_k=0^n1/n+1=1 for every integer n ≥ 0. Therefore, cn does not converge to zero as n → ∞, hence the series of the (cn)n≥0 diverges by the term test. Proof of Mertens'
