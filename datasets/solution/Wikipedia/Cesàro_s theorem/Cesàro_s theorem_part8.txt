(December 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In cases where the two sequences are convergent but not absolutely convergent, the Cauchy product is still Cesàro summable. Specifically: If (an)n≥0(a_n)_n≥0, (bn)n≥0(b_n)_n≥0 are real sequences with ∑an→A_n and ∑bn→B_n then 1N(∑n=1N∑i=1n∑k=0iakbi−k)→AB.1/N(∑_n=1^N∑_i=1^n∑_k=0^ia_kb_i-k). This can be generalised to the case where the two sequences are not convergent but just Cesàro summable:
