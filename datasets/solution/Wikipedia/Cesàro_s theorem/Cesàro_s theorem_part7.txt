theorem: For simplicity, we will prove it for complex numbers. However, the proof we are about to give is formally identical for an arbitrary Banach algebra (not even commutativity or associativity is required). Assume without loss of generality that the series ∑n=0∞an∑_n=0^∞a_n converges absolutely. Define the partial sums An=∑i=0nai,Bn=∑i=0nbiandCn=∑i=0nci_n=∑_i=0^na_i,_n=∑_i=0^nb_i and_n=∑_i=0^nc_i with ci=∑k=0iakbi−k._i=∑_k=0^ia_kb_i-k . Then Cn=∑i=0nan−iBi_n=∑_i=0^na_n-iB_i by rearrangement, hence Cn=∑i=0nan−i(Bi−B)+AnB._n=∑_i=0^na_n-i(B_i-B)+A_nB . (1) Fix ε > 0. Since ∑k∈N|ak|<∞∑_k∈ℕ|a_k|<∞ by absolute convergence, and since Bn converges to B as n → ∞, there exists an integer N such that, for all integers n ≥ N, |Bn−B|≤ε/3∑k∈N|ak|+1|B_n-B|≤ε/3/∑_k∈ℕ|a_k|+1 (2) (this is the only place where the absolute convergence is used). Since the series of the (an)n≥0 converges, the individual an must converge to 0 by the term test. Hence there exists an integer M such that, for all integers n ≥ M, |an|≤ε3N(maxi∈0,…,N−1|Bi−B|+1).|a_n|≤ε/3N(max_i∈{0,…,N-1}|B_i-B|+1) . (3) Also, since An converges to A as n → ∞, there exists an integer L such that, for all integers n ≥ L, |An−A|≤ε/3|B|+1.|A_n-A|≤ε/3/|B|+1 . (4) Then, for all integers n ≥ max{L, M + N}, use the representation (1) for Cn, split the sum in two parts, use the triangle inequality for the absolute value, and finally use the three estimates (2), (3) and (4) to show that |Cn−AB|=|∑i=0nan−i(Bi−B)+(An−A)B|≤∑i=0N−1|an−i⏟≥M||Bi−B|⏟≤ε/(3N)by(3)+∑i=Nn|an−i||Bi−B|⏟≤ε/3by(2)+|An−A||B|⏟≤ε/3by(4)≤ε.|C_n-AB| =|∑_i=0^na_n-i(B_i-B)+(A_n-A)B| ≤∑_i=0^N-1|a_-i_| |B_i-B|_≤ ε/(3N)by(3)+∑_i=N^n|a_n-i| |B_i-B|_≤ ε/3by(2)+|A_n-A| |B|_≤ ε/3by(4)≤ε . By the definition of convergence of a series, Cn → AB as required. Cesàro's
