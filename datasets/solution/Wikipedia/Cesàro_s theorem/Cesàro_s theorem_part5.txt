theorem: Not to be confused with Mertens' theorems concerning distribution of prime numbers. Let (an)n≥0 and (bn)n≥0 be real or complex sequences. It was proved by Franz Mertens that, if the series ∑n=0∞an∑_n=0^∞a_n converges to A and ∑n=0∞bn∑_n=0^∞b_n converges to B, and at least one of them converges absolutely, then their Cauchy product converges to AB.[15] The theorem is still valid in a Banach algebra (see first line of the following proof). It is not sufficient for both series to be convergent; if both sequences are conditionally convergent, the Cauchy product does not have to converge towards the product of the two series, as the following example shows:
