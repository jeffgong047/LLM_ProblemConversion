Generalizations: All of the foregoing applies to sequences in Cℂ (complex numbers). The Cauchy product can be defined for series in the Rnℝ^n spaces (Euclidean spaces) where multiplication is the inner product. In this case, we have the result that if two series converge absolutely then their Cauchy product converges absolutely to the inner product of the limits. Products of finitely many infinite
