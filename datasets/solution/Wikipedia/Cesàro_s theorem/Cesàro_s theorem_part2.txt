Definitions: The Cauchy product may apply to infinite series[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][excessive citations] or power series.[12][13] When people apply it to finite sequences[14] or finite series, that can be seen merely as a particular case of a product of series with a finite number of non-zero coefficients (see discrete convolution). Convergence issues are discussed in the next section. Cauchy product of two infinite
