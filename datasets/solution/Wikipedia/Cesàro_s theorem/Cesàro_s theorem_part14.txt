functions: A finite sequence can be viewed as an infinite sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms, or in other words as a function f:N→C:ℕ→ℂ with finite support. For any complex-valued functions f, g on Nℕ with finite support, one can take their convolution: (f∗g)(n)=∑i+j=nf(i)g(j).(f*g)(n)=∑_i+j=nf(i)g(j). Then ∑(f∗g)(n)∑(f*g)(n) is the same thing as the Cauchy product of ∑f(n)(n) and ∑g(n)(n). More generally, given a monoid S, one can form the semigroup algebra C[S]ℂ[S] of S, with the multiplication given by convolution. If one takes, for example, S=Nd=ℕ^d, then the multiplication on C[S]ℂ[S] is a generalization of the Cauchy product to higher dimension.
