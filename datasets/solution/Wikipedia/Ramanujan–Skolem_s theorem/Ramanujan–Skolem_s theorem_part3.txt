numbers: The problem of finding all numbers of the form 2b − 1 (Mersenne numbers) which are triangular is equivalent: 2b−1=y(y+1)2⟺8(2b−1)=4y(y+1)⟺2b+3−8=4y2+4y⟺2b+3−7=4y2+4y+1⟺2b+3−7=(2y+1)2 ^b-1=y(y+1)/2 ⟺ (2^b-1)=4y(y+1) ⟺ ^b+3-8=4y^2+4y ⟺ ^b+3-7=4y^2+4y+1 ⟺ ^b+3-7=(2y+1)^2 The values of b are just those of n − 3, and the corresponding triangular Mersenne numbers (also known as Ramanujan–Nagell numbers) are: y(y+1)2=(x−1)(x+1)8y(y+1)/2=(x-1)(x+1)/8 for x = 1, 3, 5, 11 and 181, giving 0, 1, 3, 15, 4095 and no more (sequence A076046 in the OEIS).
