solution: The equation is 2nâˆ’7=x22^n-7=x^2 and solutions in natural numbers n and x exist just when n = 3, 4, 5, 7 and 15 (sequence A060728 in the OEIS). This was conjectured in 1913 by Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, proposed independently in 1943 by the Norwegian mathematician Wilhelm Ljunggren, and proved in 1948 by the Norwegian mathematician Trygve Nagell. The values of n correspond to the values of x as:- x = 1, 3, 5, 11 and 181 (sequence A038198 in the OEIS).[1] Triangular Mersenne
