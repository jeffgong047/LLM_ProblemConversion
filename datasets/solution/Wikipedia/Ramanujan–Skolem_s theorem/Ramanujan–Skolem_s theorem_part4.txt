type: An equation of the form x2+D=ABn^2+D=AB^n for fixed D, A , B and variable x, n is said to be of Ramanujan–Nagell type. The result of Siegel[2] implies that the number of solutions in each case is finite.[3] By representing n=3m+r=3m+r with r∈0,1,2∈{0,1,2} and Bn=Bry3^n=B^ry^3 with y=Bm=B^m, the equation of Ramanujan–Nagell type is reduced to three Mordell curves (indexed by r), each of which has a finite number of integer solutions: r=0:(Ax)2=(Ay)3−A2D=0: (Ax)^2=(Ay)^3-A^2D, r=1:(ABx)2=(ABy)3−A2B2D=1: (ABx)^2=(ABy)^3-A^2B^2D, r=2:(AB2x)2=(AB2y)3−A2B4D=2: (AB^2x)^2=(AB^2y)^3-A^2B^4D. The equation with A=1,B=2=1,=2 has at most two solutions, except in the case D=7=7 corresponding to the Ramanujan–Nagell equation. There are infinitely many values of D for which there are two solutions, including D=2m−1=2^m-1.[1] Equations of Lebesgue–Nagell
