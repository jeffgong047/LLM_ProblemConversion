In mathematics, in the field of number theory, the Ramanujanâ€“Nagell equation is an equation between a square number and a number that is seven less than a power of two. It is an example of an exponential Diophantine equation, an equation to be solved in integers where one of the variables appears as an exponent. The equation is named after Srinivasa Ramanujan, who conjectured that it has only five integer solutions, and after Trygve Nagell, who proved the conjecture. It implies non-existence of perfect binary codes with the minimum Hamming distance 5 or 6. Equation and
