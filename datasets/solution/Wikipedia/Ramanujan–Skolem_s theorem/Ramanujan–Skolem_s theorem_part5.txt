type: An equation of the form x2+D=Ayn^2+D=Ay^n for fixed D, A and variable x, y, n is said to be of Lebesgue–Nagell type. This is named after Victor-Amédée Lebesgue, who proved that the equation x2+1=yn^2+1=y^n has no nontrivial solutions.[4] Results of Shorey and Tijdeman[5] imply that the number of solutions in each case is finite.[6] Bugeaud, Mignotte and Siksek[7] solved equations of this type with A = 1 and 1 ≤ D ≤ 100. In particular, the following generalization of the Ramanujan-Nagell equation: yn−7=x2^n-7=x^2 has positive integer solutions only when x = 1, 3, 5, 11, or 181. See
