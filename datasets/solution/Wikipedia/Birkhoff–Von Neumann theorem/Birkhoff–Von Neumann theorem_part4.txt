properties: The product of two doubly stochastic matrices is doubly stochastic. However, the inverse of a nonsingular doubly stochastic matrix need not be doubly stochastic (indeed, the inverse is doubly stochastic iff it has nonnegative entries). The stationary distribution of an irreducible aperiodic finite Markov chain is uniform if and only if its transition matrix is doubly stochastic. Sinkhorn's theorem states that any matrix with strictly positive entries can be made doubly stochastic by pre- and post-multiplication by diagonal matrices. For n=2=2, all bistochastic matrices are unistochastic and orthostochastic, but for larger n this is not the case. Van der Waerden's conjecture that the minimum permanent among all n × n doubly stochastic matrices is n!/nn!/n^n, achieved by the matrix for which all entries are equal to 1/n1/n.[6] Proofs of this conjecture were published in 1980 by B. Gyires[7] and in 1981 by G. P. Egorychev[8] and D. I. Falikman;[9] for this work, Egorychev and Falikman won the Fulkerson Prize in 1982.[10] Proof of the Birkhoff–von Neumann
