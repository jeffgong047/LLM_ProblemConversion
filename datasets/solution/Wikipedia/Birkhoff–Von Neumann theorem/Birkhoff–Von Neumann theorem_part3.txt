theorem: The Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem (often known simply as Birkhoff's theorem[3][4][5]) states that the polytope Bn_n is the convex hull of the set of n×n permutation matrices, and furthermore that the vertices of Bn_n are precisely the permutation matrices. In other words, if X is a doubly stochastic matrix, then there exist θ1,…,θk≥0,∑i=1kθi=1θ_1,…,θ_k≥0,∑_i=1^kθ_i=1 and permutation matrices P1,…,Pk_1,…,P_k such that X=θ1P1+⋯+θkPk.=θ_1P_1+⋯+θ_kP_k. (Such a decomposition of X is known as a 'convex combination'.) A proof of the theorem based on Hall's marriage theorem is given below. This representation is known as the Birkhoff–von Neumann decomposition, and may not be unique. It is often described as a real-valued generalization of Kőnig's theorem, where the correspondence is established through adjacency matrices of graphs. Other
