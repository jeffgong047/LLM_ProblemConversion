theorem: Let X be a doubly stochastic matrix. Then we will show that there exists a permutation matrix P such that xij ≠ 0 whenever pij ≠ 0. Thus if we let λ be the smallest xij corresponding to a non-zero pij, the difference X – λP will be a scalar multiple of a doubly stochastic matrix and will have at least one more zero cell than X. Accordingly we may successively reduce the number of non-zero cells in X by removing scalar multiples of permutation matrices until we arrive at the zero matrix, at which point we will have constructed a convex combination of permutation matrices equal to the original X.[3] For instance if X=112(705264363)=1/12[ 7 0 5; 2 6 4; 3 6 3 ] then P=(001100010)=[ 0 0 1; 1 0 0; 0 1 0 ], λ=212λ=2/12, and X−λP=112(703064343)-=1/12[ 7 0 3; 0 6 4; 3 4 3 ]. Proof: Construct a bipartite graph in which the rows of X are listed in one part and the columns in the other, and in which row i is connected to column j iff xij ≠ 0. Let A be any set of rows, and define A' as the set of columns joined to rows in A in the graph. We want to express the sizes |A| and |A'| of the two sets in terms of the xij. For every i in A, the sum over j in A' of xij is 1, since all columns j for which xij ≠ 0 are included in A', and X is doubly stochastic; hence |A| is the sum over all i ∈ A, j ∈ A' of xij. Meanwhile |A'| is the sum over all i (whether or not in A) and all j in A' of xij ; and this is ≥ the corresponding sum in which the i are limited to rows in A. Hence |A'| ≥ |A|. It follows that the conditions of Hall's marriage theorem are satisfied, and that we can therefore find a set of edges in the graph which join each row in X to exactly one (distinct) column. These edges define a permutation matrix whose non-zero cells correspond to non-zero cells in X. ∎
