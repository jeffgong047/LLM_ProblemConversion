Generalisations: There is a simple generalisation to matrices with more columns and rows such that the i th row sum is equal to ri (a positive integer), the column sums are equal to 1, and all cells are non-negative (the sum of the row sums being equal to the number of columns). Any matrix in this form can be expressed as a convex combination of matrices in the same form made up of 0s and 1s. The proof is to replace the i th row of the original matrix by ri separate rows, each equal to the original row divided by ri ; to apply Birkhoff's theorem to the resulting square matrix; and at the end to additively recombine the ri rows into a single i th row. In the same way it is possible to replicate columns as well as rows, but the result of recombination is not necessarily limited to 0s and 1s. A different generalisation (with a significantly harder proof) has been put forward by R. M. Caron et al.[4] See
