polytope: Main article: Birkhoff polytope The class of n×n doubly stochastic matrices is a convex polytope known as the Birkhoff polytope Bn_n. Using the matrix entries as Cartesian coordinates, it lies in an (n−1)2(n-1)^2-dimensional affine subspace of n2^2-dimensional Euclidean space defined by 2n−12n-1 independent linear constraints specifying that the row and column sums all equal 1. (There are 2n−12n-1 constraints rather than 2n2n because one of these constraints is dependent, as the sum of the row sums must equal the sum of the column sums.) Moreover, the entries are all constrained to be non-negative and less than or equal to 1. Birkhoff–von Neumann
