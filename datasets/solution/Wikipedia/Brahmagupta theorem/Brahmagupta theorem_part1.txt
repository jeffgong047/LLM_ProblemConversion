BM¯⊥AC¯,EF¯⊥BC¯BM⊥AC,EF⊥BC ⇒|AF¯|=|FD¯|⇒|AF|=|FD| In geometry, Brahmagupta's theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.[1] It is named after the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (598-668).[2] More specifically, let A, B, C and D be four points on a circle such that the lines AC and BD are perpendicular. Denote the intersection of AC and BD by M. Drop the perpendicular from M to the line BC, calling the intersection E. Let F be the intersection of the line EM and the edge AD. Then, the theorem states that F is the midpoint AD.
