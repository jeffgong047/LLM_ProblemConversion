partitions: Using a related result on clique partition numbers, Alon, Mellinger, Mubayi and Verstraëte [17] proved a tight lower bound on z(m,n;2,t)(m,n;2,t) for arbitrary t: if m=(1+o(1))nt/2=(1+o(1))n^t/2, then we have z(m,n;2,t)=(1+o(1))mn1/2(m,n;2,t)=(1+o(1))mn^1/2. For 2≤t≤n2, we say that a collection of subsets A1,…,Aℓ⊂[n]_1,…,A_ℓ⊂[n] is a clique partition of H⊂([n]t)⊂[n] if ⋃i=1ℓ(Ait)⋃_i=1^ℓA_i form a partition of H. Observe that for any k, if there exists some H⊂([n]t)⊂[n] of size (1−o(1))(nt)(1-o(1))n and m=(1+o(1))(nt)/(kt)=(1+o(1))n/k, such that there is a partition of H into m cliques of size k, then we have z(m,n;2,t)=km(m,n;2,t)=km. Indeed, supposing A1,…,Am⊂[n]_1,…,A_m⊂[n] is a partition of H into m cliques of size k, we can let G be the m×n bipartite graph with V1=A1,…,Am_1={A_1,…,A_m} and V2=[n]_2=[n], such that Ai∼v_i in G if and only if v∈Ai_i. Since the Ai_i form a clique partition, G cannot contain a copy of K2,t_2,t. It remains to show that such a clique partition exists for any m=(1+o(1))nt/2=(1+o(1))n^t/2. To show this, let Fq𝔽_q be the finite field of size q and V=Fq×Fq=𝔽_q×𝔽_q. For every polynomial p(⋅)(·) of degree at most t−1-1 over Fq𝔽_q, define Cp=(x,p(x)):x∈Fq⊂V_p={(x,p(x)):x∈𝔽_q}. Let C𝒞 be the collection of all Cp_p, so that |C|=qt=nt/2|𝒞|=q^t=n^t/2 and every Cp_p has size q=n=√(n). Clearly no two members of C𝒞 can share t members. Since the only t-sets in V that do not belong to H are those that have at least two points sharing the same first coordinate, we know that almost all t-subsets of V are contained in some Cp_p.
