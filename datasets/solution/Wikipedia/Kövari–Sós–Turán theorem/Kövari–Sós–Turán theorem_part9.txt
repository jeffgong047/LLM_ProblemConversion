constructions: Alternative proofs of ex(n,Ks,t)=Ω(n2−1/s)ex(n,K_s,t)=Ω(n^2-1/s) for t sufficiently larger than s were also given by Blagojević, Bukh and Karasev [18] and by Bukh [19] using the method of random algebraic constructions. The basic idea is to take a random polynomial f:Fqs×Fqs→Fq:𝔽_q^s×𝔽_q^s→𝔽_q and consider the graph G between two copies of Fqs𝔽_q^s whose edges are all those pairs (x,y)(x,y) such that f(x,y)=0(x,y)=0. To start with, let q be a prime power and n=q2=q^2. Let f∈Fq[x1,…,xs,y1,…,ts]≤s2∈𝔽_q[x_1,…,x_s,y_1,…,t_s]_^2 be a random polynomial with degree at most s2^2 in X=(x1,…,xs)=(x_1,…,x_s), degree at most s2^2 in Y=(y1,…,ys)=(y_1,…,y_s), and furthermore satisfying f(X,Y)=f(Y,X)(X,Y)=f(Y,X) for all X,Y,Y. Let G be the associated random graph on vertex set Fqs𝔽_q^s, such that two vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if f(x,y)=0(x,y)=0. To prove the asymptotic lower bound, it suffices to show that the expected number of edges in G is Ω(q2s−1)Ω(q^2s-1). For every s-subset U⊂Fqs⊂𝔽_q^s, we let ZU_U denote the vertex subset of Fqs∖U𝔽_q^s that "vanishes on f(⋅,U)(·,U)": ZU=x∈Fqs∖U:f(x,u)=0forallu∈U_U={x∈𝔽_q^s:f(x,u)=0forallu}. Using the Lang-Weil bound for polynomials f(⋅,u)(·,u) in Fqs𝔽_q^s, we can deduce that one always has ZU≤C_U or ZU>q/2_U>q/2 for some large constant C, which implies P(|ZU|>C)=P(|ZU|>q/2)ℙ(|Z_U|>C)=ℙ(|Z_U|>q/2). Since f is chosen randomly over Fq𝔽_q, it is not hard to show that the right-hand side probability is small, so the expected number of s-subsets U with |ZU|>C|Z_U|>C also turned out to be small. If we remove a vertex from every such U, then the resulting graph is Ks,C+1_s,C+1 free, and the expected number of remaining edges is still large. This finishes the proof that ex(n,Ks,t)=Ω(n2−1/s)ex(n,K_s,t)=Ω(n^2-1/s) for all t sufficiently large with respect to s. More recently, there have been a number of results verifying the conjecture z(m,n;s,t)=Ω(n2−1/s)(m,n;s,t)=Ω(n^2-1/s) for different values of s,t,t, using similar ideas but with more tools from algebraic geometry.[8][20]
