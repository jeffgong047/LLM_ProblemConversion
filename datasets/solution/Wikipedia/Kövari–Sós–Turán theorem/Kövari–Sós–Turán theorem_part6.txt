geometry: The Levi graph of the Fano plane gives rise to the Heawood graph, a bipartite graph with seven vertices on each side, 21 edges, and no 4-cycles. For s=t=2=t=2, a bipartite graph with n vertices on each side, Ω(n3/2)Ω(n^3/2) edges, and no K2,2_2,2 may be obtained as the Levi graph, or point-line incidence graph, of a projective plane of order q, a system of q2+q+1^2+q+1 points and q2+q+1^2+q+1 lines in which each two points determine a unique line, and each two lines intersect at a unique point. We construct a bipartite graph associated to this projective plane that has one vertex part as its points, the other vertex part as its lines, such that a point and a line is connected if and only if they are incident in the projective plane. This leads to a K2,2_2,2-free graph with q2+q+1^2+q+1 vertices and (q2+q+1)(q+1)(q^2+q+1)(q+1) edges. Since this lower bound matches the upper bound given by I. Reiman,[11] we have the asymptotic [12] z(n;2)=(1/2+o(1))n3/2.(n;2)=(1/2+o(1))n^3/2. For s=t=3=t=3, bipartite graphs with n vertices on each side, Ω(n5/3)Ω(n^5/3) edges, and no K3,3_3,3 may again be constructed from finite geometry, by letting the vertices represent points and spheres (of a carefully chosen fixed radius) in a three-dimensional finite affine space, and letting the edges represent point-sphere incidences.[13] More generally, consider s=2=2 and any t. Let Fq𝔽_q be the q-element finite field, and h be an element of multiplicative order t, in the sense that H=1,h,…,ht−1={1,h,…,h^t-1} form a t-element subgroup of the multiplicative group Fq∗𝔽_q^*. We say that two nonzero elements (a,b),(a′,b′)∈Fq×Fq(a,b),(a',b')∈𝔽_q×𝔽_q are equivalent if we have a′=hda'=h^da and b′=hdb'=h^db for some d. Consider a graph G on the set of all equivalence classes ⟨a,b⟩,b⟩, such that ⟨a,b⟩,b⟩ and ⟨x,y⟩,y⟩ are connected if and only if ax+by∈H+by. One can verify that G is well-defined and free of K2,t+1_2,t+1, and every vertex in G has degree q or q−1-1. Hence we have the upper bound [14] z(n,n;2,t+1)=(t1/2+o(1))n3/2.(n,n;2,t+1)=(t^1/2+o(1))n^3/2. Norm graphs and projective norm
