graphs: For t sufficiently larger than s, the above conjecture z(n,n;s,t)=Θ(n2−1/s)(n,n;s,t)=Θ(n^2-1/s) was verified by Kollár, Rónyai, and Szabó [15] and Alon, Rónyai, and Szabó [16] using the construction of norm graphs and projective norm graphs over finite fields. For t>s!>s!, consider the norm graph NormGraphp,s with vertex set Fps𝔽_p^s, such that every two vertices a,b∈Fps,b∈𝔽_p^s are connected if and only if N(a+b)=1(a+b)=1, where N:Fps→Fp𝔽_p^s→𝔽_p is the norm map N(x)=x⋅xp⋅xp2⋯xps−1=x(ps−1)/(p−1).(x)=x^p^p^2^p^s-1=x^(p^s-1)/(p-1). It is not hard to verify that the graph has ps^s vertices and at least p2s−1/2^2s-1/2 edges. To see that this graph is Ks,s!+1_s,s!+1-free, observe that any common neighbor x of s vertices y1,…,ys∈Fps_1,…,y_s∈𝔽_p^s must satisfy 1=N(x+yi)=(x+yi)⋅(x+yi)p⋯(x+yi)ps−1=(x+yi)⋅(xp+yip)⋯(xps−1+yips−1)1=N(x+y_i)=(x+y_i)·(x+y_i)^p⋯(x+y_i)^p^s-1=(x+y_i)·(x^p+y_i^p)⋯(x^p^s-1+y_i^p^s-1) for all i=1,…,s=1,…,s, which a system of equations that has at most s!! solutions. The same result can be proved for all t>(s−1)!>(s-1)! using the projective norm graph, a construction slightly stronger than the above. The projective norm graph ProjNormGraphp,s is the graph on vertex set Fps−1×Fp×𝔽_p^s-1×𝔽_p^×, such that two vertices (X,x),(Y,y)(X,x),(Y,y) are adjacent if and only if N(X+Y)=xy(X+Y)=xy, where N:Fps→Fp𝔽_p^s→𝔽_p is the norm map defined by N(x)=x(ps−1)/(p−1)(x)=x^(p^s-1)/(p-1). By a similar argument to the above, one can verify that it is a Ks,t_s,t -free graph with Ω(n2−1/s)Ω(n^2-1/s) edges. The above norm graph approach also gives tight lower bounds on z(m,n;s,t)(m,n;s,t) for certain choices of m,n,n.[16] In particular, for s≥2≥2, t>s!>s!, and n1/t≤m≤n1+1/t^1/t^1+1/t, we have z(m,n;s,t)=Θ(mn1−1/s).(m,n;s,t)=Θ(mn^1-1/s). In the case m=(1+o(1))n1+1/s=(1+o(1))n^1+1/s, consider the bipartite graph G with bipartition V=V1∪V2=V_1_2, such that V1=Fpt×Fp×_1=𝔽_p^t×𝔽_p^× and V2=Fpt_2=𝔽_p^t. For A∈V1_1 and (B,b)∈V2(B,b)_2, let A∼(B,b)∼(B,b) in G if and only if N(A+B)=b(A+B)=b, where N(⋅)(·) is the norm map defined above. To see that G is Ks,t_s,t -free, consider s tuples (B1,b1),…,(Bs,bs)∈V1(B_1,b_1),…,(B_s,b_s)_1. Observe that if the s tuples have a common neighbor, then the Bi_i must be distinct. Using the same upper bound on he number of solutions to the system of equations, we know that these s tuples have at most s!<t!<t common neighbors. Clique
