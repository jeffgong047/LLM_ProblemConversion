statement: A bipartite graph G=(U∪V,E)=(U,E) consists of two disjoint sets of vertices U and V, and a set of edges each of which connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V. No two edges can both connect the same pair of vertices. A complete bipartite graph is a bipartite graph in which every pair of a vertex from U and a vertex from V is connected to each other. A complete bipartite graph in which U has s vertices and V has t vertices is denoted Ks,t_s,t. If G=(U∪V,E)=(U,E) is a bipartite graph, and there exists a set of s vertices of U and t vertices of V that are all connected to each other, then these vertices induce a subgraph of the form Ks,t_s,t. (In this formulation, the ordering of s and t is significant: the set of s vertices must be from U and the set of t vertices must be from V, not vice versa.) The Zarankiewicz function z(m,n;s,t)(m,n;s,t) denotes the maximum possible number of edges in a bipartite graph G=(U∪V,E)=(U,E) for which |U|=m|U|=m and |V|=n|V|=n, but which does not contain a subgraph of the form Ks,t_s,t. As a shorthand for an important special case, z(n;t)(n;t) is the same as z(n,n;t,t)(n,n;t,t). The Zarankiewicz problem asks for a formula for the Zarankiewicz function, or (failing that) for tight asymptotic bounds on the growth rate of z(n;t)(n;t) assuming that t is a fixed constant, in the limit as n goes to infinity. For s=t=2=t=2 this problem is the same as determining cages with girth six. The Zarankiewicz problem, cages and finite geometry are strongly interrelated.[3] The same problem can also be formulated in terms of digital geometry. The possible edges of a bipartite graph G=(U∪V,E)=(U,E) can be visualized as the points of a |U|×|V||U|×|V| rectangle in the integer lattice, and a complete subgraph is a set of rows and columns in this rectangle in which all points are present. Thus, z(m,n;s,t)(m,n;s,t) denotes the maximum number of points that can be placed within an m×n grid in such a way that no subset of rows and columns forms a complete s×t grid.[4] An alternative and equivalent definition is that z(m,n;s,t)(m,n;s,t) is the smallest integer k such that every (0,1)-matrix of size m×n with k+1+1 ones must have a set of s rows and t columns such that the corresponding s×t submatrix is made up only of 1s.
