Examples: A bipartite graph with 4 vertices on each side, 13 edges, and no K3,3_3,3 subgraph, and an equivalent set of 13 points in a 4 × 4 grid, showing that z(4;3)≥13(4;3)≥13. The number z(n;2)(n;2) asks for the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with n vertices on each side that has no 4-cycle (its girth is six or more). Thus, z(2;2)=3(2;2)=3 (achieved by a three-edge path), and z(3;2)=6(3;2)=6 (a hexagon). In his original formulation of the problem, Zarankiewicz asked for the values of z(n;3)(n;3) for n=4,5,6=4,5,6. The answers were supplied soon afterwards by Wacław Sierpiński: z(4;3)=13(4;3)=13, z(5;3)=20(5;3)=20, and z(6;3)=26(6;3)=26.[4] The case of z(4;3)(4;3) is relatively simple: a 13-edge bipartite graph with four vertices on each side of the bipartition, and no K3,3_3,3 subgraph, may be obtained by adding one of the long diagonals to the graph of a cube. In the other direction, if a bipartite graph with 14 edges has four vertices on each side, then two vertices on each side must have degree four. Removing these four vertices and their 12 incident edges leaves a nonempty set of edges, any of which together with the four removed vertices forms a K3,3_3,3 subgraph. Upper
