bounds: The Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem provides an upper bound on the solution to the Zarankiewicz problem. It was established by Tamás Kővári, Vera T. Sós and Pál Turán shortly after the problem had been posed: z(m,n;s,t)<(s−1)1/t(n−t+1)m1−1/t+(t−1)m.(m,n;s,t)<(s-1)^1/t(n-t+1)m^1-1/t+(t-1)m. Kővári, Sós, and Turán originally proved this inequality for z(n;t)(n;t).[5] Shortly afterwards, Hyltén-Cavallius observed that essentially the same argument can be used to prove the above inequality.[6] An improvement on the second term of the upper bound on z(n;t)(n;t) was given by Štefan Znám:[7] z(n;t)<(t−1)1/tn2−1/t+12(t−1)n.(n;t)<(t-1)^1/tn^2-1/t+1/2(t-1)n. If s and t are assumed to be constant, then asymptotically, using the big O notation, these formulae can be expressed as z(m,n;s,t)=O(mn1−1/s+n)(m,n;s,t)=O(mn^1-1/s+n); z(m,n;s,t)=O(nm1−1/t+m)(m,n;s,t)=O(nm^1-1/t+m). In the particular case m=n=n, assuming without loss of generality that s≤t, we have the asymptotic upper bound z(n,n;s,t)=O(n2−1/s).(n,n;s,t)=O(n^2-1/s). Lower
