bounds: One can verify that among the two asymptotic upper bounds of z(m,n;s,t)(m,n;s,t) in the previous section, the first bound is better when m=o(ns/t)=o(n^s/t), and the second bound becomes better when m=ω(ns/t)=ω(n^s/t). Therefore, if one can show a lower bound for z(ns/t,n;s,t)(n^s/t,n;s,t) that matches the upper bound up to a constant, then by a simple sampling argument (on either an nt/s×t^t/s bipartite graph or an m×ms/t^s/t bipartite graph that achieves the maximum edge number), we can show that for all m,n,n, one of the above two upper bounds is tight up to a constant. This leads to the following question: is it the case that for any fixed s≤t and m≤ns/t^s/t, we have z(m,n;s,t)=Ω(mn1−1/s)(m,n;s,t)=Ω(mn^1-1/s)? [8] In the special case m=n=n, up to constant factors, z(n,n;s,t)(n,n;s,t) has the same order as ex(n,Ks,t)ex(n,K_s,t), the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex (not necessarily bipartite) graph that has no Ks,t_s,t as a subgraph. In one direction, a bipartite graph with n vertices on each side and z(n,n;s,t)(n,n;s,t) edges must have a subgraph with n vertices and at least z(n,n;s,t)/4(n,n;s,t)/4 edges; this can be seen from choosing n/2/2 vertices uniformly at random from each side, and taking the expectation. In the other direction, we can transform a graph with n vertices and no copy of Ks,t_s,t into a bipartite graph with n vertices on each side of its bipartition, twice as many edges and still no copy of Ks,t_s,t, by taking its bipartite double cover.[9] Same as above, with the convention that s≤t, it has been conjectured that z(n,n;s,t)=Θ(n2−1/s)(n,n;s,t)=Θ(n^2-1/s) for all constant values of s,t,t.[10] For some specific values of s,t,t (e.g., for t sufficiently larger than s, or for s=2=2), the above statements have been proved using various algebraic and random algebraic constructions. At the same time, the answer to the general question is still unknown to us. Incidence graphs in finite
