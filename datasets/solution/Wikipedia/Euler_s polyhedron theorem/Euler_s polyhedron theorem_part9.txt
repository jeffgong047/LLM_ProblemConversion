principle: If M and N are any two topological spaces, then the Euler characteristic of their disjoint union is the sum of their Euler characteristics, since homology is additive under disjoint union: χ(M⊔N)=χ(M)+χ(N).χ(M)=χ(M)+χ(N). More generally, if M and N are subspaces of a larger space X, then so are their union and intersection. In some cases, the Euler characteristic obeys a version of the inclusion–exclusion principle: χ(M∪N)=χ(M)+χ(N)−χ(M∩N).χ(M)=χ(M)+χ(N)-χ(M). This is true in the following cases: if M and N are an excisive couple. In particular, if the interiors of M and N inside the union still cover the union.[6] if X is a locally compact space, and one uses Euler characteristics with compact supports, no assumptions on M or N are needed. if X is a stratified space all of whose strata are even-dimensional, the inclusion–exclusion principle holds if M and N are unions of strata. This applies in particular if M and N are subvarieties of a complex algebraic variety.[7] In general, the inclusion–exclusion principle is false. A counterexample is given by taking X to be the real line, M a subset consisting of one point and N the complement of M. Connected
