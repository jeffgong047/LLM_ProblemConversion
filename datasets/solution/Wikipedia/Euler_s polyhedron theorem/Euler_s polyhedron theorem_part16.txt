ball: It is common to construct soccer balls by stitching together pentagonal and hexagonal pieces, with three pieces meeting at each vertex (see for example the Adidas Telstar). If P pentagons and H hexagons are used, then there are F=P+H=P+H} faces, V=13(5P+6H)=13(P+6H right)} vertices, and E=12(5P+6H)=12(P+6H right)} edges. The Euler characteristic is thus V−E+F=13(5P+6H)−12(5P+6H)+P+H=16P.-E+F=13(P+6H right)-12(P+6H right)+P+H=16P . Because the sphere has Euler characteristic 2, it follows that P=12.=12 . That is, a soccer ball constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. The number of hexagons can be any nonnegative integer except 1.[11] This result is applicable to fullerenes and Goldberg polyhedra. Arbitrary
