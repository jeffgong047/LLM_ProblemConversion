Its Euler characteristic is then χ = 1 + (−1) n ; that is, either 0 if n is odd, or 2 if n is even. The n dimensional real projective space is the quotient of the n sphere by the antipodal map. It follows that its Euler characteristic is exactly half that of the corresponding sphere – either 0 or 1. The n dimensional torus is the product space of n circles. Its Euler characteristic is 0, by the product property. More generally, any compact parallelizable manifold, including any compact Lie group, has Euler characteristic 0.[12] The Euler characteristic of any closed odd-dimensional manifold is also 0.[13] The case for orientable examples is a corollary of Poincaré duality. This property applies more generally to any compact stratified space all of whose strata have odd dimension. It also applies to closed odd-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, via the two-to-one orientable double cover. Relations to other
