property: The product property holds much more generally, for fibrations with certain conditions. If p:E→B is a fibration with fiber F, with the base B path-connected, and the fibration is orientable over a field K, then the Euler characteristic with coefficients in the field K satisfies the product property:[9] χ(E)=χ(F)⋅χ(B).χ(E)=χ(F)·χ(B). This includes product spaces and covering spaces as special cases, and can be proven by the Serre spectral sequence on homology of a fibration. For fiber bundles, this can also be understood in terms of a transfer map τ:H∗(B)→H∗(E)τ_*(B)_*(E) – note that this is a lifting and goes "the wrong way" – whose composition with the projection map p∗:H∗(E)→H∗(B)_*_*(E)_*(B) is multiplication by the Euler class of the fiber:[10] p∗∘τ=χ(F)⋅1._*∘τ=χ(F)·1.
