spaces: Further information: Riemann–Hurwitz formula Similarly, for a k-sheeted covering space M →M,M̃, one has χ(M )=k⋅χ(M).χ(M̃)=k·χ(M). More generally, for a ramified covering space, the Euler characteristic of the cover can be computed from the above, with a correction factor for the ramification points, which yields the Riemann–Hurwitz formula.
