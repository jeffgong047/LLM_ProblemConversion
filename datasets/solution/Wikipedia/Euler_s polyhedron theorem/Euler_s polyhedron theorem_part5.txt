definition: The polyhedral surfaces discussed above are, in modern language, two-dimensional finite CW-complexes. (When only triangular faces are used, they are two-dimensional finite simplicial complexes.) In general, for any finite CW-complex, the Euler characteristic can be defined as the alternating sum χ=k0−k1+k2−k3+⋯,χ=k_0-k_1+k_2-k_3+⋯, where kn denotes the number of cells of dimension n in the complex. Similarly, for a simplicial complex, the Euler characteristic equals the alternating sum χ=k0−k1+k2−k3+⋯,χ=k_0-k_1+k_2-k_3+⋯, where kn denotes the number of n-simplexes in the complex. Betti number
