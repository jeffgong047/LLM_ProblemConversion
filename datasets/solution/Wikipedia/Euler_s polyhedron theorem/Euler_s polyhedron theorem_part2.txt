Polyhedra: Vertex, edge and face of a cube The Euler characteristic χ was classically defined for the surfaces of polyhedra, according to the formula χ=V−E+Fχ=V-E+F where V, E, and F are respectively the numbers of vertices (corners), edges and faces in the given polyhedron. Any convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic χ=V−E+F=2. chi=V-E+F=2 . This equation, stated by Euler in 1758,[2] is known as Euler's polyhedron formula.[3] It corresponds to the Euler characteristic of the sphere (i.e. χ=2 chi=2}), and applies identically to spherical polyhedra. An illustration of the formula on all Platonic polyhedra is given below.

This version holds both for convex polyhedra (where the densities are all 1) and the non-convex Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. Projective polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 1, like the real projective plane, while the surfaces of toroidal polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 0, like the torus. Plane
