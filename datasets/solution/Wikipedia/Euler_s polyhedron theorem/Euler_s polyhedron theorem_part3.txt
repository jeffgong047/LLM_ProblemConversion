graphs: See also: Planar graph § Euler's formula The Euler characteristic can be defined for connected plane graphs by the same V−E+F-E+F} formula as for polyhedral surfaces, where F is the number of faces in the graph, including the exterior face. The Euler characteristic of any plane connected graph G is 2. This is easily proved by induction on the number of faces determined by G, starting with a tree as the base case. For trees, E=V−1=V-1} and F=1.=1 . If G has C components (disconnected graphs), the same argument by induction on F shows that V−E+F−C=1.-E+F-C=1 . One of the few graph theory papers of Cauchy also proves this result. Via stereographic projection the plane maps to the 2-sphere, such that a connected graph maps to a polygonal decomposition of the sphere, which has Euler characteristic 2. This viewpoint is implicit in Cauchy's proof of Euler's formula given below. Proof of Euler's
