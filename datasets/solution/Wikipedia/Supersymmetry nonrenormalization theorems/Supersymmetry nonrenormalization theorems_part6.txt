condition: In supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories, the nonrenormalization of a quantity subject to the Dirac quantization condition is often a consequence of the fact that possible renormalizations would be inconsistent with the quantization condition, for example the quantization of the level of a Chernâ€“Simons theory implies that it may only be renormalized at one-loop. In the 1994 article Nonrenormalization Theorem for Gauge Coupling in 2+1D the authors find the renormalization of the level can only be a finite shift, independent of the energy scale, and extended this result to topologically massive theories in which one includes a kinetic term for the gluons. In Notes on Superconformal Chern-Simons-Matter Theories the authors then showed that this shift needs to occur at one loop, because any renormalization at higher loops would introduce inverse powers of the level, which are nonintegral and so would be in conflict with the quantization condition.
