theories: In 3 dimensions the number N𝒩 counts the number of 2-component Majorana spinors of supercharges. When N=1𝒩=1 there is no holomorphicity and few exact results are known. When N=2𝒩=2 the superpotential cannot depend on the linear multiplets and in particular is independent of the Fayet–Iliopoulos terms (FI) and Majorana mass terms. On the other hand the central charge is independent of the chiral multiplets, and so is a linear combination of the FI and Majorana mass terms. These two theorems were stated and proven in Aspects of N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories in Three Dimensions. When N=3𝒩=3, unlike N=2𝒩=2, the R-symmetry is the nonabelian group SU(2) and so the representation of each field is not renormalized. In a super conformal field theory the conformal dimension of a chiral multiplet is entirely determined by its R-charge, and so these conformal dimensions are not renormalized. Therefore matter fields have no wave function renormalization in N=3𝒩=3 superconformal field theories, as was shown in On Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Abelian Gauge Theories. These theories consist of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets. The hypermultiplet metric is hyperkähler and may not be lifted by quantum corrections, but its metric may be modified. No renormalizable interaction between hyper and abelian vector multiplets is possible except for Chern–Simons terms. When N=4𝒩=4, unlike N=3𝒩=3 the hypermultiplet metric may no longer be modified by quantum corrections. Examples in 2-dimensional
