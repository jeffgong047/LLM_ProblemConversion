In theoretical physics a nonrenormalization theorem is a limitation on how a certain quantity in the classical description of a quantum field theory may be modified by renormalization in the full quantum theory. Renormalization theorems are common in theories with a sufficient amount of supersymmetry, usually at least 4 supercharges. Perhaps the first nonrenormalization theorem was introduced by Marcus T. Grisaru, Martin Rocek and Warren Siegel in their 1979 paper Improved methods for supergraphs. Nonrenormalization in supersymmetric theories and
