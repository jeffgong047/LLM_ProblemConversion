theories: In N=(2,2)ùí©=(2,2)[clarification needed] linear sigma models, which are superrenormalizable abelian gauge theories with matter in chiral supermultiplets, Edward Witten has argued in Phases of N=2 theories in two-dimensions that the only divergent quantum correction is the logarithmic one-loop correction to the FI term.
