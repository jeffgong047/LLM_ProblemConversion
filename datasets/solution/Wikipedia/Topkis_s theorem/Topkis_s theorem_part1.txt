The theorem allows researchers to understand how the optimal value for a choice variable changes when a feature of the environment changes. The result states that if f is supermodular in (x,θ), and D is a lattice, then x∗(θ)=arg⁡maxx∈Df(x,θ)^*(θ)=max_xf(x,θ) is nondecreasing in θ. The result is especially helpful for establishing comparative static results when the objective function is not differentiable. The result is named after Donald M. Topkis. An
