coefficients): Consider P-periodic functions gP__P and hP,__P, which can be expressed as periodic summations: gP(x)≜∑m=−∞∞g(x−mP)__P(x) triangleq∑_m=-∞^∞g(x-mP) and hP(x)≜∑m=−∞∞h(x−mP).__P(x) triangleq∑_m=-∞^∞h(x-mP). In practice the non-zero portion of components g and h are often limited to duration P,, but nothing in the theorem requires that. The Fourier series coefficients are: G[k]≜FgP[k]=1P∫PgP(x)e−i2πkx/Pdx,k∈Z;integrationoveranyintervaloflengthPH[k]≜FhP[k]=1P∫PhP(x)e−i2πkx/Pdx,k∈ZG[k] ≜ℱ{g__P}[k]=1/P∫_Pg__P(x)e^-i2/P dx,∈ℤ; integrationoveranyintervaloflengthP H[k] ≜ℱ{h__P}[k]=1/P∫_Ph__P(x)e^-i2/P dx,∈ℤ where Fℱ denotes the Fourier series integral. The pointwise product: gP(x)⋅hP(x)__P(x)__P(x) is also P-periodic, and its Fourier series coefficients are given by the discrete convolution of the G and H sequences: FgP⋅hP[k]=G∗H[k].ℱ{g__P__P}[k]={G*H}[k]. The convolution: gP∗h(x)≜∫−∞∞gP(x−τ)⋅h(τ)dτ≡∫PgP(x−τ)⋅hP(τ)dτ;integrationoveranyintervaloflengthP{g__P*h}(x)&≜∫_-∞^∞g__P(x-τ)(τ)τ̣ ≡∫_Pg__P(x-τ)__P(τ)τ̣; integrationoveranyintervaloflengthPis also P-periodic,[A] and is called a periodic convolution. The corresponding convolution theorem is: FgP∗h[k]=P⋅G[k]H[k].ℱ{g__P*h}[k]=[k][̋k].
