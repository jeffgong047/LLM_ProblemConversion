(sequences): By a derivation similar to Eq.1, there is an analogous theorem for sequences, such as samples of two continuous functions, where now Fℱ denotes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) operator. Consider two sequences g[n][n] and h[n][n] with transforms G and H: G(s)≜Fg(s)=∑n=−∞∞g[n]⋅e−i2πsn,s∈R,H(s)≜Fh(s)=∑n=−∞∞h[n]⋅e−i2πsn,s∈R.G(s) ≜ℱ{g}(s)=∑_n=-∞^∞g[n]^-i2 ,∈ℝ, H(s) ≜ℱ{h}(s)=∑_n=-∞^∞h[n]^-i2 ,∈ℝ. The § Discrete convolution of g and h is defined by: r[n]≜(g∗h)[n]=∑m=−∞∞g[m]⋅h[n−m]=∑m=−∞∞g[n−m]⋅h[m].[n]≜(g*h)[n]=∑_m=-∞^∞g[m][n-m]=∑_m=-∞^∞g[n-m][m]. The convolution theorem for discrete sequences is:[3][4]: p. 60 (2.169) R(s)=Fg∗h(s)=G(s)H(s).(s)=ℱ{g*h}(s)=(s)H(s). (Eq.3) Periodic
