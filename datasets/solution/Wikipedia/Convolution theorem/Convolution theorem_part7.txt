distributions: The convolution theorem extends to tempered distributions. Here, g is an arbitrary tempered distribution Ff∗g=Ff⋅Fgℱ{f*g}=ℱ{f}·ℱ{g} Fα⋅g=Fα∗Fgℱ{α}=ℱ{α}*ℱ{g} but f=Fα=F{α} must be "rapidly decreasing" towards −∞-∞ and +∞+∞ in order to guarantee the existence of both, convolution and multiplication product. Equivalently, if α=F−1fα=F^-1{f} is a smooth "slowly growing" ordinary function, it guarantees the existence of both, multiplication and convolution product.[7][8][9] In particular, every compactly supported tempered distribution, such as the Dirac delta, is "rapidly decreasing". Equivalently, bandlimited functions, such as the function that is constantly 11 are smooth "slowly growing" ordinary functions. If, for example, g≡Ш≡Ш is the Dirac comb both equations yield the Poisson summation formula and if, furthermore, f≡δ≡δ is the Dirac delta then α≡1α≡1 is constantly one and these equations yield the Dirac comb identity.
