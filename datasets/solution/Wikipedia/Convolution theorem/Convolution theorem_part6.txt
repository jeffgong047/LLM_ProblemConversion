transform: Note that in the example below "⋅·" represents the Hadamard product, and "∗*" represents a convolution between the two matrices. There is also a convolution theorem for the inverse Fourier transform Fg∗h=Fg⋅Fhℱ{g*h}=ℱ{g}·ℱ{h} Fg⋅h=Fg∗Fhℱ{g}=ℱ{g}*ℱ{h} so that g∗h=F−1Fg⋅Fh*h=ℱ^-1{ℱ{g}·ℱ{h}} g⋅h=F−1Fg∗Fh=ℱ^-1{ℱ{g}*ℱ{h}} Convolution theorem for tempered
