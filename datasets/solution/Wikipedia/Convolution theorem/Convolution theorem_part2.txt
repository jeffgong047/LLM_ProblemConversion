variable: Consider two functions g(x)(x) and h(x)(x) with Fourier transforms G and H: G(s)≜Fg(s)=∫−∞∞g(x)e−i2πsxdx,s∈RH(s)≜Fh(s)=∫−∞∞h(x)e−i2πsxdx,s∈RG(s) ≜ℱ{g}(s)=∫_-∞^∞g(x)e^-i2 dx,∈ℝ H(s) ≜ℱ{h}(s)=∫_-∞^∞h(x)e^-i2 dx,∈ℝ where Fℱ denotes the Fourier transform operator. The transform may be normalized in other ways, in which case constant scaling factors (typically 2π2π or 2π√(2π)) will appear in the convolution theorem below. The convolution of g and h is defined by: r(x)=g∗h(x)≜∫−∞∞g(τ)h(x−τ)dτ=∫−∞∞g(x−τ)h(τ)dτ.(x)={g*h}(x)≜∫_-∞^∞g(τ)h(x-τ) dτ=∫_-∞^∞g(x-τ)h(τ) dτ. In this context the asterisk denotes convolution, instead of standard multiplication. The tensor product symbol ⊗⊗ is sometimes used instead. The convolution theorem states that:[1][2]: eq.8 R(s)≜Fr(s)=G(s)H(s).s∈R(s)≜ℱ{r}(s)=G(s)H(s).∈ℝ (Eq.1a) Applying the inverse Fourier transform F−1ℱ^-1, produces the corollary:[2]: eqs.7, 10 r(s)=g∗h(s)=F−1G⋅H,(s)={g*h}(s)=ℱ^-1{G}, (Eq.1b) where ⋅· denotes point-wise multiplication The theorem also generally applies to multi-dimensional functions. Proof Consider functions g,h,h in Lp-space L1(Rn)^1(ℝ^n), with Fourier transforms G,H,H: G(s)≜Fg(s)=∫Rng(x)e−i2πs⋅xdx,s∈RnH(s)≜Fh(s)=∫Rnh(x)e−i2πs⋅xdx,G(s) ≜ℱ{g}(s)=∫_ℝ^ng(x)e^-i2 dx,∈ℝ^n H(s) ≜ℱ{h}(s)=∫_ℝ^nh(x)e^-i2 dx, where s⋅x indicates the inner product of Rnℝ^n: s⋅x=∑j=1nsjxj,=∑_j=1^ns_jx_j, and dx=∏j=1ndxj.=∏_j=1^ndx_j. The convolution of g and h is defined by: r(x)≜∫Rng(τ)h(x−τ)dτ.(x)≜∫_ℝ^ng(τ)h(x-τ) dτ. Also: ∬|g(τ)h(x−τ)|dxdτ=∫(|g(τ)|∫|h(x−τ)|dx)dτ=∫|g(τ)|‖h‖1dτ=‖g‖1‖h‖1.∬|g(τ)h(x-τ)| dx dτ=∫(|g(τ)|∫|h(x-τ)| dx) dτ=∫|g(τ)| h_1 dτ=g_1h_1. Hence by Fubini's theorem we have that r∈L1(Rn)^1(ℝ^n) so its Fourier transform R is defined by the integral formula: R(s)≜Fr(s)=∫Rnr(x)e−i2πs⋅xdx=∫Rn(∫Rng(τ)h(x−τ)dτ)e−i2πs⋅xdx.R(s)≜ℱ{r}(s) =∫_ℝ^nr(x)e^-i2 dx =∫_ℝ^n(∫_ℝ^ng(τ)h(x-τ) dτ) e^-i2 dx. Note that |g(τ)h(x−τ)e−i2πs⋅x|=|g(τ)h(x−τ)||g(τ)h(x-τ)e^-i2|=|g(τ)h(x-τ)| and hence by the argument above we may apply Fubini's theorem again (i.e. interchange the order of integration): R(s)=∫Rng(τ)(∫Rnh(x−τ)e−i2πs⋅xdx)⏟H(s)e−i2πs⋅τdτ=(∫Rng(τ)e−i2πs⋅τdτ)⏟G(s)H(s).R(s) =∫_ℝ^ng(τ)(∫_ℝ^nh(x-τ)^-i2 dx)_H(s)^-i2·τ dτ =(∫_ℝ^ng(τ)^-i2·τ dτ)_G(s)(̋s). This theorem also holds for the Laplace transform, the two-sided Laplace transform and, when suitably modified, for the Mellin transform and Hartley transform (see Mellin inversion theorem). It can be extended to the Fourier transform of abstract harmonic analysis defined over locally compact abelian groups. Periodic convolution (Fourier series
