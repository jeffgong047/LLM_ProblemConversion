Variants: There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case m=1=1 was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939,[2] and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942.[1] A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale.[3] The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and some applications in Morse theory — in order to prove the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has at least one regular value”. In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if f:N→M:N is Ck^k for k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1} and if Ar⊆N_r is the set of points x∈N such that dfx_x has rank strictly less than r, then the r-dimensional Hausdorff measure of f(Ar)(A_r) is zero.[4] In particular the Hausdorff dimension of f(Ar)(A_r) is at most r. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of f(Ar)(A_r) can be arbitrarily close to r.[5] See
