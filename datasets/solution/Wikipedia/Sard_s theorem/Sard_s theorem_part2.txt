Statement: More explicitly,[1] let f:Rn→Rmℝ^n→ℝ^m be Ck^k, (that is, k times continuously differentiable), where k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1}. Let X⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n denote the critical set of f,, which is the set of points x∈Rn∈ℝ^n at which the Jacobian matrix of f has rank <m<m. Then the image f(X)(X) has Lebesgue measure 0 in Rmℝ^m. Intuitively speaking, this means that although X may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while f may have many critical points in the domain Rnℝ^n, it must have few critical values in the image Rmℝ^m. More generally, the result also holds for mappings between differentiable manifolds M and N of dimensions m and n, respectively. The critical set X of a Ck^k function f:N→M:N consists of those points at which the differential df:TN→TM:TN has rank less than m as a linear transformation. If k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1}, then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of X has measure zero as a subset of M. This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches. The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism.
