case: Similarly, when the SNR is small (if S/N≪1/N≪1), applying the approximation to the logarithm: log2⁡(1+SN)=1ln⁡2⋅ln⁡(1+SN)≈1ln⁡2⋅SN≈1.44⋅SN;log_2(1+S/N)=1/ln2·ln(1+S/N)≈1/ln2·S/N≈1.44·S; then the capacity is linear in power. This is called the power-limited regime. C≈1.44⋅B⋅SN.≈1.44·S. In this low-SNR approximation, capacity is independent of bandwidth if the noise is white, of spectral density N0_0 watts per hertz, in which case the total noise power is N=B⋅N0=B_0. C≈1.44⋅SN0≈1.44·S_0
