case: In the simple version above, the signal and noise are fully uncorrelated, in which case S+N+N is the total power of the received signal and noise together. A generalization of the above equation for the case where the additive noise is not white (or that the S/N/N is not constant with frequency over the bandwidth) is obtained by treating the channel as many narrow, independent Gaussian channels in parallel: C=∫0Blog2⁡(1+S(f)N(f))df=∫_0^Blog_2(1+S(f)/N(f))df where C is the channel capacity in bits per second; B is the bandwidth of the channel in Hz; S(f)(f) is the signal power spectrum N(f)(f) is the noise power spectrum f is frequency in Hz. Note: the theorem only applies to Gaussian stationary process noise. This formula's way of introducing frequency-dependent noise cannot describe all continuous-time noise processes. For example, consider a noise process consisting of adding a random wave whose amplitude is 1 or −1 at any point in time, and a channel that adds such a wave to the source signal. Such a wave's frequency components are highly dependent. Though such a noise may have a high power, it is fairly easy to transmit a continuous signal with much less power than one would need if the underlying noise was a sum of independent noises in each frequency band.
