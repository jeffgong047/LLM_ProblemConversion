rate: Main article: Nyquist rate In 1927, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the bandwidth of the channel. In symbolic notation, fp≤2B_p≤2B where fp_p is the pulse frequency (in pulses per second) and B is the bandwidth (in hertz). The quantity 2B2B later came to be called the Nyquist rate, and transmitting at the limiting pulse rate of 2B2B pulses per second as signalling at the Nyquist rate. Nyquist published his results in 1928 as part of his paper "Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory".[1] Hartley's
