case: When the SNR is large (S/N ≫ 1), the logarithm is approximated by log2⁡(1+SN)≈log2⁡SN=ln⁡10ln⁡2⋅log10⁡SN≈3.32⋅log10⁡SN,log_2(1+S/N)≈log_2S/N=ln10/ln2·log_10S/N≈3.32·log_10S/N, in which case the capacity is logarithmic in power and approximately linear in bandwidth (not quite linear, since N increases with bandwidth, imparting a logarithmic effect). This is called the bandwidth-limited regime. C≈0.332⋅B⋅SNR(indB)≈0.332·SNRin) where SNR(indB)=10log10⁡SN.SNRin)=10log_10S. Power-limited
