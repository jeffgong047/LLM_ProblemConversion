law: Comparing the channel capacity to the information rate from Hartley's law, we can find the effective number of distinguishable levels M:[8] 2Blog2⁡(M)=Blog2⁡(1+SN)2Blog_2(M)=Blog_2(1+S/N) M=1+SN.=√(1+S/N). The square root effectively converts the power ratio back to a voltage ratio, so the number of levels is approximately proportional to the ratio of signal RMS amplitude to noise standard deviation. This similarity in form between Shannon's capacity and Hartley's law should not be interpreted to mean that M pulse levels can be literally sent without any confusion. More levels are needed to allow for redundant coding and error correction, but the net data rate that can be approached with coding is equivalent to using that M in Hartley's law.
