Statement: If R is a ring, let R[X][X] denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate X over R. Hilbert proved that if R is "not too large", in the sense that if R is Noetherian, the same must be true for R[X][X]. Formally, Hilbert's Basis Theorem. If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[X][X] is a Noetherian ring.[1] Corollary. If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[X1,…,Xn][X_1,…,X_n] is a Noetherian ring. This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. Hilbert proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.[2] Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases.
