proof: Suppose a⊆R[X]𝔞[X] is a non-finitely generated left ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence of polynomials f0,f1,…{f_0,f_1,…} such that if bn𝔟_n is the left ideal generated by f0,…,fn−1_0,…,f_n-1 then fn∈a∖bn_n∈𝔞∖𝔟_n is of minimal degree. By construction, deg⁡(f0),deg⁡(f1),…{(f_0),(f_1),…} is a non-decreasing sequence of natural numbers. Let an_n be the leading coefficient of fn_n and let b𝔟 be the left ideal in R generated by a0,a1,…_0,a_1,…. Since R is Noetherian the chain of ideals (a0)⊂(a0,a1)⊂(a0,a1,a2)⊂⋯(a_0)⊂(a_0,a_1)⊂(a_0,a_1,a_2)⊂⋯ must terminate. Thus b=(a0,…,aN−1)𝔟=(a_0,…,a_N-1) for some integer N. So in particular, aN=∑i<Nuiai,ui∈R._N=∑_i<Nu_ia_i,_i. Now consider g=∑i<NuiXdeg⁡(fN)−deg⁡(fi)fi,=∑_i<Nu_iX^(f_N)-(f_i)f_i, whose leading term is equal to that of fN_N; moreover, g∈bN∈𝔟_N. However, fN∉bN_N∉𝔟_N, which means that fN−g∈a∖bN_N-g∈𝔞∖𝔟_N has degree less than fN_N, contradicting the minimality. Second
