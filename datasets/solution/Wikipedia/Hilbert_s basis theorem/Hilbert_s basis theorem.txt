Polynomial rings are Noetherian rings

In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, Hilbert's basis theorem says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.


Statement[edit]
If R is a ring, let R[X][X] denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate X over R. Hilbert proved that if R is "not too large", in the sense that if R is Noetherian, the same must be true for R[X][X]. Formally,

Hilbert's Basis Theorem. If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[X][X] is a Noetherian ring.[1]
Corollary. If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[X1,…,Xn][X_1,…,X_n] is a Noetherian ring.
This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. Hilbert proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.[2]
Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases.

Proof[edit]
Theorem. If R is a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring R[X][X] is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.

Remark. We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered; the proof for the right case is similar.
First proof[edit]
Suppose a⊆R[X]𝔞[X] is a non-finitely generated left ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence of polynomials f0,f1,…{f_0,f_1,…} such that if bn𝔟_n is the left ideal generated by f0,…,fn−1_0,…,f_n-1 then fn∈a∖bn_n∈𝔞∖𝔟_n is of minimal degree. By construction,  deg⁡(f0),deg⁡(f1),…{(f_0),(f_1),…} is a non-decreasing sequence of natural numbers. Let an_n be the leading coefficient of fn_n and let b𝔟 be the left ideal in R generated by a0,a1,…_0,a_1,…. Since R is Noetherian the chain of ideals

(a0)⊂(a0,a1)⊂(a0,a1,a2)⊂⋯(a_0)⊂(a_0,a_1)⊂(a_0,a_1,a_2)⊂⋯
must terminate. Thus b=(a0,…,aN−1)𝔟=(a_0,…,a_N-1) for some integer N. So in particular,

aN=∑i<Nuiai,ui∈R._N=∑_i<Nu_ia_i,_i.
Now consider

g=∑i<NuiXdeg⁡(fN)−deg⁡(fi)fi,=∑_i<Nu_iX^(f_N)-(f_i)f_i,
whose leading term is equal to that of fN_N; moreover, g∈bN∈𝔟_N. However, fN∉bN_N∉𝔟_N, which means that fN−g∈a∖bN_N-g∈𝔞∖𝔟_N has degree less than fN_N, contradicting the minimality.

Second proof[edit]
Let a⊆R[X]𝔞[X] be a left ideal. Let b𝔟 be the set of leading coefficients of members of a𝔞. This is obviously a left ideal over R, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of a𝔞; say f0,…,fN−1_0,…,f_N-1. Let d be the maximum of the set deg⁡(f0),…,deg⁡(fN−1){(f_0),…,(f_N-1)}, and let bk𝔟_k be the set of leading coefficients of members of a𝔞, whose degree is ≤k. As before, the bk𝔟_k are left ideals over R, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of a𝔞, say

f0(k),…,fN(k)−1(k)_0^(k),…,f_N^(k)-1^(k)
with degrees ≤k. Now let a∗⊆R[X]𝔞^*[X] be the left ideal generated by:

fi,fj(k):i<N,j<N(k),k<d.{f_i,f_j^(k) :ı<N, j<N^(k), k<d} .
We have a∗⊆a𝔞^*⊆𝔞 and claim also a⊆a∗𝔞⊆𝔞^*. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let h∈a∖a∗∈𝔞∖𝔞^* be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by a.

Case 1: deg⁡(h)≥d(h). Regardless of this condition, we have a∈b∈𝔟, so a is a left linear combination
a=∑jujaj=∑_ju_ja_j
of the coefficients of the fj_j. Consider
h0=∑jujXdeg⁡(h)−deg⁡(fj)fj,_0=∑_ju_jX^(h)-(f_j)f_j,
which has the same leading term as h; moreover h0∈a∗_0∈𝔞^* while h∉a∗∉𝔞^*. Therefore h−h0∈a∖a∗-h_0∈𝔞∖𝔞^* and deg⁡(h−h0)<deg⁡(h)(h-h_0)<(h), which contradicts minimality.
Case 2: deg⁡(h)=k<d(h)=k<d. Then a∈bk∈𝔟_k so a is a left linear combination
a=∑jujaj(k)=∑_ju_ja_j^(k)
of the leading coefficients of the fj(k)_j^(k). Considering
h0=∑jujXdeg⁡(h)−deg⁡(fj(k))fj(k),_0=∑_ju_jX^(h)-(f_j^(k))f_j^(k),
we yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1.
Thus our claim holds, and a=a∗𝔞=𝔞^* which is finitely generated.
Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of X multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.

Applications[edit]
Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.

By induction we see that R[X0,…,Xn−1][X_0,…,X_n-1] will also be Noetherian.
Since any affine variety over Rn^n (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal a⊂R[X0,…,Xn−1]𝔞[X_0,…,X_n-1] and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many hypersurfaces.
If A is a finitely-generated R-algebra, then we know that A≃R[X0,…,Xn−1]/a[X_0,…,X_n-1]/𝔞, where a𝔞 is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that a𝔞 must be finitely generated, say a=(p0,…,pN−1)𝔞=(p_0,…,p_N-1), i.e. A is finitely presented.
Formal proofs[edit]
Formal proofs of Hilbert's basis theorem have been verified through the Mizar project (see HILBASIS file) and  Lean (see ring_theory.polynomial).
