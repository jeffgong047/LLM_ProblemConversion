Applications: Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries. By induction we see that R[X0,…,Xn−1][X_0,…,X_n-1] will also be Noetherian. Since any affine variety over Rn^n (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal a⊂R[X0,…,Xn−1]𝔞[X_0,…,X_n-1] and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many hypersurfaces. If A is a finitely-generated R-algebra, then we know that A≃R[X0,…,Xn−1]/a[X_0,…,X_n-1]/𝔞, where a𝔞 is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that a𝔞 must be finitely generated, say a=(p0,…,pN−1)𝔞=(p_0,…,p_N-1), i.e. A is finitely presented. Formal
