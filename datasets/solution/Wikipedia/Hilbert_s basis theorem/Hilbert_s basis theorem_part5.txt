proof: Let a⊆R[X]𝔞[X] be a left ideal. Let b𝔟 be the set of leading coefficients of members of a𝔞. This is obviously a left ideal over R, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of a𝔞; say f0,…,fN−1_0,…,f_N-1. Let d be the maximum of the set deg⁡(f0),…,deg⁡(fN−1){(f_0),…,(f_N-1)}, and let bk𝔟_k be the set of leading coefficients of members of a𝔞, whose degree is ≤k. As before, the bk𝔟_k are left ideals over R, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of a𝔞, say f0(k),…,fN(k)−1(k)_0^(k),…,f_N^(k)-1^(k) with degrees ≤k. Now let a∗⊆R[X]𝔞^*[X] be the left ideal generated by: fi,fj(k):i<N,j<N(k),k<d.{f_i,f_j^(k) :ı<N, j<N^(k), k<d} . We have a∗⊆a𝔞^*⊆𝔞 and claim also a⊆a∗𝔞⊆𝔞^*. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let h∈a∖a∗∈𝔞∖𝔞^* be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by a. Case 1: deg⁡(h)≥d(h). Regardless of this condition, we have a∈b∈𝔟, so a is a left linear combination a=∑jujaj=∑_ju_ja_j of the coefficients of the fj_j. Consider h0=∑jujXdeg⁡(h)−deg⁡(fj)fj,_0=∑_ju_jX^(h)-(f_j)f_j, which has the same leading term as h; moreover h0∈a∗_0∈𝔞^* while h∉a∗∉𝔞^*. Therefore h−h0∈a∖a∗-h_0∈𝔞∖𝔞^* and deg⁡(h−h0)<deg⁡(h)(h-h_0)<(h), which contradicts minimality. Case 2: deg⁡(h)=k<d(h)=k<d. Then a∈bk∈𝔟_k so a is a left linear combination a=∑jujaj(k)=∑_ju_ja_j^(k) of the leading coefficients of the fj(k)_j^(k). Considering h0=∑jujXdeg⁡(h)−deg⁡(fj(k))fj(k),_0=∑_ju_jX^(h)-(f_j^(k))f_j^(k), we yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1. Thus our claim holds, and a=a∗𝔞=𝔞^* which is finitely generated. Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of X multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.
