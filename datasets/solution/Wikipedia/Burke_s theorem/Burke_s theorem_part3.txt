extensions: The theorem can be generalised for "only a few cases," but remains valid for M/M/c queues and Geom/Geom/1 queues.[7] It is thought that Burke's theorem does not extend to queues fed by a Markovian arrival processes (MAP) and is conjectured that the output process of an MAP/M/1 queue is an MAP only if the queue is an M/M/1 queue.[8] An analogous theorem for the Brownian queue was proven by J. Michael Harrison.[3][9]
