In mathematics, Milliken's tree theorem in combinatorics is a partition theorem generalizing Ramsey's theorem to infinite trees, objects with more structure than sets.
Let T be a finitely splitting rooted tree of height ω, n a positive integer, and STn𝕊_T^n the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if STn=C1∪...∪Cr𝕊_T^n=C_1∪..._r then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T, SRn⊂Ci𝕊_R^n_i for some i ≤ r.
This immediately implies Ramsey's theorem; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices. 
Define Sn=⋃TSTn𝕊^n=⋃_T𝕊_T^n where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is Sn𝕊^n partition regular for each n < ω, but that the homogeneous subtree R guaranteed by the theorem is strongly embedded in T.

Strong embedding[edit]
Call T an α-tree if each branch of T has cardinality α.  Define Succ(p, P)= q∈P:q≥p{q:q}, and IS(p,P)(p,P) to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is strongly embedded in T if:

S⊂T, and the partial order on S is induced from T,
if s∈S is nonmaximal in S and t∈IS(s,T)(s,T), then |Succ(t,T)∩IS(s,S)|=1|Succ(t,T)(s,S)|=1,
there exists a strictly increasing function from αα to ββ, such that S(n)⊂T(f(n)).(n)(f(n)).
Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T, 

S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order
S must preserve the branching structure of T; i.e., if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S
S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.
