embedding: Call T an α-tree if each branch of T has cardinality α. Define Succ(p, P)= q∈P:q≥p{q:q}, and IS(p,P)(p,P) to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is strongly embedded in T if: S⊂T, and the partial order on S is induced from T, if s∈S is nonmaximal in S and t∈IS(s,T)(s,T), then |Succ(t,T)∩IS(s,S)|=1|Succ(t,T)(s,S)|=1, there exists a strictly increasing function from αα to ββ, such that S(n)⊂T(f(n)).(n)(f(n)). Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T, S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order S must preserve the branching structure of T; i.e., if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.
