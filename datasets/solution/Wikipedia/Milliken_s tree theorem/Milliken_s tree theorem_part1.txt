Let T be a finitely splitting rooted tree of height ω, n a positive integer, and STn𝕊_T^n the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if STn=C1∪...∪Cr𝕊_T^n=C_1∪..._r then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T, SRn⊂Ci𝕊_R^n_i for some i ≤ r. This immediately implies Ramsey's theorem; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices. Define Sn=⋃TSTn𝕊^n=⋃_T𝕊_T^n where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is Sn𝕊^n partition regular for each n < ω, but that the homogeneous subtree R guaranteed by the theorem is strongly embedded in T. Strong
