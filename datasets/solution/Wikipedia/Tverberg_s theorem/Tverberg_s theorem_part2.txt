Examples: The case d = 1 states that any 2r-1 points on the real line can be partitioned into r subsets with intersecting convex hulls. Indeed, if the points are x1 < x2 < ... < x2r < x2r-1, then the partition into Ai = {xi, x2r-i} for i in 1,...,r satisfies this condition (and it is unique). For r = 2, Tverberg's theorem states that any d + 2 points may be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls. This is known as Radon's theorem. In this case, for points in general position, the partition is unique. The case r = 3 and d = 2 states that any seven points in the plane may be partitioned into three subsets with intersecting convex hulls. The illustration shows an example in which the seven points are the vertices of a regular heptagon. As the example shows, there may be many different Tverberg partitions of the same set of points; these seven points may be partitioned in seven different ways that differ by rotations of each other.
