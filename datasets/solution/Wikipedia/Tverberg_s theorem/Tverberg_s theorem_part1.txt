On partitioning finite point sets into subsets with intersecting convex hulls A Tverberg partition of the vertices of a regular heptagon into three subsets with intersecting convex hulls. In discrete geometry, Tverberg's theorem, first stated by Helge Tverberg in 1966,[1] is the result that sufficiently many points in d-dimensional Euclidean space can be partitioned into subsets with intersecting convex hulls. Specifically, for any positive integers d, r and any set of (d+1)(râˆ’1)+1(d+1)(r-1)+1} points there exists a point x (not necessarily one of the given points) and a partition of the given points into r subsets, such that x belongs to the convex hull of all of the subsets. The partition resulting from this theorem is known as a Tverberg partition. The special case r = 2 was proved earlier by Radon, and it is known as Radon's theorem.
