Theorem: An equivalent formulation of Tverberg's theorem is:Let d, r be positive integers, and let N := (d+1)(r-1). If ƒ is any affine function from an N-dimensional simplex ΔN to Rd, then there are r pairwise-disjoint faces of ΔN whose images under ƒ intersect. That is: there exist faces F1,...,Fr of ΔN such that ∀i,j∈[r]:Fi∩Fj=∅,j∈[r]:F_i_j=∅ and f(F1)∩⋯∩f(Fr)≠∅(F_1)∩⋯(F_r)≠∅.They are equivalent because any affine function on a simplex is uniquely determined by the images of its vertices. Formally, let ƒ be an affine function from ΔN to Rd. Let v1,v2,…,vN+1_1,v_2,…,v_N+1 be the vertices of ΔN, and let x1,x2,…,xN+1_1,x_2,…,x_N+1 be their images under ƒ. By the original formulation, the x1,x2,…,xN+1_1,x_2,…,x_N+1 can be partitioned into r disjoint subsets, e.g. ((xi)i in Aj)j in [r] with overlapping convex hull. Because f is affine, the convex hull of (xi)i in Aj is the image of the face spanned by the vertices (vi)i in Aj for all j in [r]. These faces are pairwise-disjoint, and their images under f intersect - as claimed by the new formulation. The topological Tverberg theorem generalizes this formluation. It allows f to be any continuous function - not necessarily affine. But, currently it is proved only for the case where r is a prime power:Let d be a positive integer, and let r be a power of a prime number. Let N := (d+1)(r-1). If ƒ is any continuous function from an N-dimensional simplex ΔN to Rd, then there are r pairwise-disjoint faces of ΔN whose images under ƒ intersect. That is: there exist faces F1,...,Fr of ΔN such that ∀i,j∈[r]:Fi∩Fj=∅,j∈[r]:F_i_j=∅ and f(F1)∩⋯∩f(Fr)≠∅(F_1)∩⋯(F_r)≠∅.
