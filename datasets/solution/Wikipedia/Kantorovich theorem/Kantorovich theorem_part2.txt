Assumptions: Let X⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n be an open subset and F:X⊂Rn→Rn:X⊂ℝ^n→ℝ^n a differentiable function with a Jacobian F′(x)^'(𝐱) that is locally Lipschitz continuous (for instance if F is twice differentiable). That is, it is assumed that for any x∈X there is an open subset U⊂X such that x∈U and there exists a constant L>0>0 such that for any x,y∈U𝐱,𝐲 ‖F′(x)−F′(y)‖≤L‖x−y‖F'(𝐱)-F'(𝐲) 𝐱-𝐲 holds. The norm on the left is some operator norm that is compatible with the vector norm on the right. This inequality can be rewritten to only use the vector norm. Then for any vector v∈Rn𝐯∈ℝ^n the inequality ‖F′(x)(v)−F′(y)(v)‖≤L‖x−y‖‖v‖F'(𝐱)(𝐯)-F'(𝐲)(𝐯) 𝐱-𝐲 𝐯 must hold. Now choose any initial point x0∈X𝐱_0. Assume that F′(x0)'(𝐱_0) is invertible and construct the Newton step h0=−F′(x0)−1F(x0).𝐡_0=-F'(𝐱_0)^-1F(𝐱_0). The next assumption is that not only the next point x1=x0+h0𝐱_1=𝐱_0+𝐡_0 but the entire ball B(x1,‖h0‖)(𝐱_1,𝐡_0) is contained inside the set X. Let M be the Lipschitz constant for the Jacobian over this ball (assuming it exists). As a last preparation, construct recursively, as long as it is possible, the sequences (xk)k(𝐱_k)_k, (hk)k(𝐡_k)_k, (αk)k(α_k)_k according to hk=−F′(xk)−1F(xk)αk=M‖F′(xk)−1‖‖hk‖xk+1=xk+hk.2𝐡_k =-F'(𝐱_k)^-1F(𝐱_k) α_k =M F'(𝐱_k)^-1 𝐡_k 𝐱_k+1 =𝐱_k+𝐡_k.
