About the convergence of Newton's method The Kantorovich theorem, or Newtonâ€“Kantorovich theorem, is a mathematical statement on the semi-local convergence of Newton's method. It was first stated by Leonid Kantorovich in 1948.[1][2] It is similar to the form of the Banach fixed-point theorem, although it states existence and uniqueness of a zero rather than a fixed point.[3] Newton's method constructs a sequence of points that under certain conditions will converge to a solution x of an equation f(x)=0(x)=0 or a vector solution of a system of equation F(x)=0(x)=0. The Kantorovich theorem gives conditions on the initial point of this sequence. If those conditions are satisfied then a solution exists close to the initial point and the sequence converges to that point.[1][2]
