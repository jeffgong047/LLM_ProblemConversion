Statement: Now if α0≤12α_0≤12 then a solution x∗𝐱^* of F(x∗)=0(𝐱^*)=0 exists inside the closed ball B¯(x1,‖h0‖)B̅(𝐱_1,𝐡_0) and the Newton iteration starting in x0𝐱_0 converges to x∗𝐱^* with at least linear order of convergence. A statement that is more precise but slightly more difficult to prove uses the roots t∗≤t∗∗^∗^** of the quadratic polynomial p(t)=(12L‖F′(x0)−1‖−1)t2−t+‖h0‖(t)=(12LF'(𝐱_0)^-1^-1)t^2-t+𝐡_0, t∗/∗∗=2‖h0‖1±1−2α0^∗/**=2𝐡_0/1±√(1-2α_0) and their ratio θ=t∗t∗∗=1−1−2α01+1−2α0.θ=t^*/t^**=1-√(1-2α_0)/1+√(1-2α_0). Then a solution x∗𝐱^* exists inside the closed ball B¯(x1,θ‖h0‖)⊂B¯(x0,t∗)B̅(𝐱_1,θ𝐡_0)⊂B̅(𝐱_0,t^*) it is unique inside the bigger ball B(x0,t∗∗)(𝐱_0,t^*∗) and the convergence to the solution of F is dominated by the convergence of the Newton iteration of the quadratic polynomial p(t)(t) towards its smallest root t∗^∗,[4] if t0=0,tk+1=tk−p(tk)p′(tk)_0=0, t_k+1=t_k-p(t_k)p'(t_k), then ‖xk+p−xk‖≤tk+p−tk.𝐱_k+p-𝐱_k_k+p-t_k. The quadratic convergence is obtained from the error estimate[5] ‖xn+1−x∗‖≤θ2n‖xn+1−xn‖≤θ2n2n‖h0‖.𝐱_n+1-𝐱^*≤θ^2^n𝐱_n+1-𝐱_n≤θ^2^n/2^n𝐡_0.
