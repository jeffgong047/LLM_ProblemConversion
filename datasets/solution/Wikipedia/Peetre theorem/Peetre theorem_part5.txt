Laplacian: Consider the following operator: (Lf)(x0)=limr→02dr21|Sr|∫Sr(f(x)−f(x0))dx(Lf)(x_0)=lim_r→02d/r^21/|S_r|∫_S_r(f(x)-f(x_0))dx where f∈C∞(Rd)^∞(ℝ^d) and Sr_r is the sphere centered at x0_0 with radius r. This is in fact the Laplacian. We show will show L is a differential operator by Peetre's theorem. The main idea is that since Lf(x0)(x_0) is defined only in terms of f's behavior near x0_0, it is local in nature; in particular, if f is locally zero, so is Lf, and hence the support cannot grow. The technical proof goes as follows. Let M=Rd=ℝ^d and E and F be the rank 11 trivial bundles. Then Γ∞(E)Γ^∞(E) and Γ∞(F)Γ^∞(F) are simply the space C∞(Rd)^∞(ℝ^d) of smooth functions on Rdℝ^d. As a sheaf, F(U)ℱ(U) is the set of smooth functions on the open set U and restriction is function restriction. To see L is indeed a morphism, we need to check (Lu)|V=L(u|V)(Lu)|V=L(u|V) for open sets U and V such that V⊆U and u∈C∞(U)^∞(U). This is clear because for x∈V, both [(Lu)|V](x)[(Lu)|V](x) and [L(u|V)](x)[L(u|V)](x) are simply limr→02dr21|Sr|∫Sr(u(y)−u(x))dylim_r→02d/r^21/|S_r|∫_S_r(u(y)-u(x))dy, as the Sr_r eventually sits inside both U and V anyway. It is easy to check that L is linear: L(f+g)=L(f)+L(g)(f+g)=L(f)+L(g) and L(af)=aL(f)(af)=aL(f) Finally, we check that L is local in the sense that suppLf⊆suppf. If x0∉supp(f)_0(f), then ∃r>0>0 such that f=0=0 in the ball of radius r centered at x0_0. Thus, for x∈B(x0,r)(x_0,r), ∫Sr′(f(y)−f(x))dy=0∫_S_r'(f(y)-f(x))dy=0 for r′<r−|x−x0|'<r-|x-x_0|, and hence (Lf)(x)=0(Lf)(x)=0. Therefore, x0∉suppLf_0. So by Peetre's theorem, L is a differential operator.
