application: Let M be a compact smooth manifold (possibly with boundary), and E and F be finite dimensional vector bundles on M. Let Γ∞(E)Γ^∞(E)be the collection of smooth sections of E. An operator D:Γ∞(E)→Γ∞(F):Γ^∞(E)→Γ^∞(F) is a smooth function (of Fréchet manifolds) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on M: π∘Dp=p.π_p=p. The Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator D, there exists an integer k such that D is a differential operator of order k. Specifically, we can decompose D=iD∘jk=i_D^k where iD_D is a mapping from the jets of sections of E to the bundle F. See also intrinsic differential operators. Example:
