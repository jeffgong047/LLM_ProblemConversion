Proof: The problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when M is an open set in Rn and E and F are trivial bundles. At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas: Lemma 1. If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every x∈M and C > 0, there exists a neighborhood V of x and a positive integer k such that for any y∈V\{x} and for any section s of E whose k-jet vanishes at y (jks(y)=0), we have |Ds(y)|<C. Lemma 2. The first lemma is sufficient to prove the theorem. We begin with the proof of Lemma 1. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there is a sequence xk tending to x, and a sequence of very disjoint balls Bk around the xk (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections sk of E over each Bk such that jksk(xk)=0 but |Dsk(xk)|≥C>0. Let ρ(x) denote a standard bump function for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on B1/2(0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball. Consider every other section s2k. At x2k, these satisfy j2ks2k(x2k)=0. Suppose that 2k is given. Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy j2k(s2k)(x2k)=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball B′δ(x2k) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate: ∑|α|≤ksupy∈Bδ′(x2k)|∇αsk(y)|≤1Mk(δ2)k∑_|α| sup_y'_δ(x_2k)|∇^αs_k(y)|≤1/M_k(δ/2)^k where Mk=∑|α|≤ksup|∇αρ|._k=∑_|α|sup|∇^αρ|. Now ρ2k(y):=ρ(y−x2kδ)ρ_2k(y):=ρ(y-x_2k/δ) is a standard bump function supported in B′δ(x2k), and the derivative of the product s2kρ2k is bounded in such a way that max|α|≤ksupy∈Bδ′(x2k)|∇α(ρ2ks2k)|≤2−k.max_|α| sup_y'_δ(x_2k)|∇^α(ρ_2ks_2k)|≤2^-k. As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly q(y)=∑k=1∞ρ2k(y)s2k(y),(y)=∑_k=1^∞ρ_2k(y)s_2k(y), q(y) is a smooth function on all of V. We now observe that since s2k and ρρ2ks2k are equal in a neighborhood of x2k, limk→∞|Dq(x2k)|≥Clim_k→∞|Dq(x_2k)| So by continuity |Dq(x)|≥ C>0. On the other hand, limk→∞Dq(x2k+1)=0lim_k→∞Dq(x_2k+1)=0 since Dq(x2k+1)=0 because q is identically zero in B2k+1 and D is support non-increasing. So Dq(x)=0. This is a contradiction. We now prove Lemma 2. First, let us dispense with the constant C from the first lemma. We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0. Pick a y in V\{x} so that jks(y)=0 but |Ds(y)|=g>0. Rescale s by a factor of 2C/g. Then if g is non-zero, by the linearity of D, |Ds(y)|=2C>C, which is impossible by Lemma 1. This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood V\{x}. Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point x in the punctured neighborhood. D is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients. Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at x as well. Thus the coefficients of D are also smooth at x. A specialized
