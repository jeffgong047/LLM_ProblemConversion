theorem: Let M be a smooth manifold and let E and F be two vector bundles on M. Let Γ∞(E),andΓ∞(F)Γ^∞(E),{and Gamma^∞(F) be the spaces of smooth sections of E and F. An operator D:Γ∞(E)→Γ∞(F):Γ^∞(E)→Γ^∞(F) is a morphism of sheaves which is linear on sections such that the support of D is non-increasing: supp Ds ⊆ supp s for every smooth section s of E. The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point p in M, there is a neighborhood U of p and an integer k (depending on U) such that D is a differential operator of order k over U. This means that D factors through a linear mapping iD from the k-jet of sections of E into the space of smooth sections of F: D=iD∘jk=i_D^k where jk:Γ∞E→JkE^k:Γ^∞E^kE is the k-jet operator and iD:JkE→F_D:J^kE is a linear mapping of vector bundles.
