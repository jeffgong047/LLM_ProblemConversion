theorem: Let C0([0, T]; R) (or simply C0 for short) be classical Wiener space with Wiener measure γ. Let F : C0 → R be a BC1 function, i.e. F is bounded and Fréchet differentiable with bounded derivative DF : C0 → Lin(C0; R). Then F(σ)=∫C0F(p)dγ(p)+∫0TE[∂∂t∇HF(−)|Σt](σ)dσt.(σ)=∫_C_0F(p) dγ(p)+∫_0^T𝐄[.∂/∇_HF(-)|Σ_t](σ) dσ_t. In the above F(σ) is the value of the function F on some specific path of interest, σ; the first integral, ∫C0F(p)dγ(p)=E[F]∫_C_0F(p) dγ(p)=𝐄[F] is the expected value of F over the whole of Wiener space C0; the second integral, ∫0T⋯dσ(t)∫_0^T⋯ dσ(t) is an Itô integral; Σ∗ is the natural filtration of Brownian motion B : [0, T] × Ω → R: Σt is the smallest σ-algebra containing all Bs−1(A) for times 0 ≤ s ≤ t and Borel sets A ⊆ R; E[·|Σt] denotes conditional expectation with respect to the sigma algebra Σt; ∂/∂t denotes differentiation with respect to time t; ∇H denotes the H-gradient; hence, ∂/∂t∇H is the Malliavin derivative. More generally, the conclusion holds for any F in L2(C0; R) that is differentiable in the sense of Malliavin. Integration by parts on Wiener
