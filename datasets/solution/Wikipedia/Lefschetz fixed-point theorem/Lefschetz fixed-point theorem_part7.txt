context: Lefschetz presented his fixed-point theorem in (Lefschetz 1926). Lefschetz's focus was not on fixed points of maps, but rather on what are now called coincidence points of maps. Given two maps f and g from an orientable manifold X to an orientable manifold Y of the same dimension, the Lefschetz coincidence number of f and g is defined as Λf,g=∑(−1)ktr(DX∘g∗∘DY−1∘f∗),Λ_f,g=∑(-1)^ktr(D_X^*_Y^-1_*), where f∗_* is as above, g∗_* is the homomorphism induced by g on the cohomology groups with rational coefficients, and DX_X and DY_Y are the Poincaré duality isomorphisms for X and Y, respectively. Lefschetz proved that if the coincidence number is nonzero, then f and g have a coincidence point. He noted in his paper that letting X=Y=Y and letting g be the identity map gives a simpler result, which we now know as the fixed-point theorem.
