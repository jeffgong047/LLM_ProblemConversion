theorem: The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, which states that every continuous map from the n-dimensional closed unit disk Dn^n to Dn^n must have at least one fixed point. This can be seen as follows: Dn^n is compact and triangulable, all its homology groups except H0_0 are zero, and every continuous map f:Dn→Dn^n^n induces the identity map f∗:H0(Dn,Q)→H0(Dn,Q)_*_0(D^n,ℚ)_0(D^n,ℚ), whose trace is one; all this together implies that ΛfΛ_f is non-zero for any continuous map f:Dn→Dn^n^n.
