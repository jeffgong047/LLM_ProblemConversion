Bound: A generalization of the Hasse bound to higher genus algebraic curves is the Hasse–Weil bound. This provides a bound on the number of points on a curve over a finite field. If the number of points on the curve C of genus g over the finite field Fq𝔽_q of order q is #C(Fq)#C(𝔽_q), then |#C(Fq)−(q+1)|≤2gq.|#C(𝔽_q)-(q+1)|≤2g√(q). This result is again equivalent to the determination of the absolute value of the roots of the local zeta-function of C, and is the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the function field associated with the curve. The Hasse–Weil bound reduces to the usual Hasse bound when applied to elliptic curves, which have genus g=1. The Hasse–Weil bound is a consequence of the Weil conjectures, originally proposed by André Weil in 1949 and proved by André Weil in the case of curves.[3] See
