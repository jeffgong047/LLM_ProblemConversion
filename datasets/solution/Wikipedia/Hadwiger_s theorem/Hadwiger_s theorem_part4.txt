Quermassintegrals: Main article: quermassintegral The quermassintegrals Wj:Kn→R_j:𝕂^n→ℝ are defined via Steiner's formula Voln(K+tB)=∑j=0n(nj)Wj(K)tj,Vol_n(K+tB)=∑_j=0^nnjW_j(K)t^j , where B is the Euclidean ball. For example, W0_0 is the volume, W1_1 is proportional to the surface measure, Wn−1_n-1 is proportional to the mean width, and Wn_n is the constant Voln⁡(B).Vol_n(B). Wj_j is a valuation which is homogeneous of degree n−j,-j, that is, Wj(tK)=tn−jWj(K),t≥0._j(tK)=t^n-jW_j(K) ,≥0 .
