In integral geometry (otherwise called geometric probability theory), Hadwiger's theorem characterises the valuations on convex bodies in Rn.ℝ^n. It was proved by Hugo Hadwiger.


Introduction[edit]
Valuations[edit]
Let Kn𝕂^n be the collection of all compact convex sets in Rn.ℝ^n. A valuation is a function v:Kn→R:𝕂^n→ℝ such that v(∅)=0(∅)=0 and for every S,T∈Kn,T∈𝕂^n that satisfy S∪T∈Kn,∈𝕂^n,
v(S)+v(T)=v(S∩T)+v(S∪T).(S)+v(T)=v(S)+v(S) .
A valuation is called continuous if it is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff metric. A valuation is called invariant under rigid motions if v(φ(S))=v(S)(φ(S))=v(S) whenever S∈Kn∈𝕂^n and φφ is either a translation or a rotation of Rn.ℝ^n.

Quermassintegrals[edit]
Main article: quermassintegral
The quermassintegrals Wj:Kn→R_j:𝕂^n→ℝ are defined via Steiner's formula
Voln(K+tB)=∑j=0n(nj)Wj(K)tj,Vol_n(K+tB)=∑_j=0^nnjW_j(K)t^j ,
where B is the Euclidean ball. For example, W0_0 is the volume, W1_1 is proportional to the surface measure, Wn−1_n-1 is proportional to the mean width, and Wn_n is the constant Voln⁡(B).Vol_n(B).
Wj_j is a valuation which is homogeneous of degree n−j,-j, that is,
Wj(tK)=tn−jWj(K),t≥0._j(tK)=t^n-jW_j(K) ,≥0 .

Statement[edit]
Any continuous valuation v on Kn𝕂^n that is invariant under rigid motions can be represented as
v(S)=∑j=0ncjWj(S).(S)=∑_j=0^nc_jW_j(S) .

Corollary[edit]
Any continuous valuation v on Kn𝕂^n that is invariant under rigid motions and homogeneous of degree j is a multiple of Wn−j._n-j.
