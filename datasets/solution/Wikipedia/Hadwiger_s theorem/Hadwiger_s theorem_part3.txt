Valuations: Let Kn𝕂^n be the collection of all compact convex sets in Rn.ℝ^n. A valuation is a function v:Kn→R:𝕂^n→ℝ such that v(∅)=0(∅)=0 and for every S,T∈Kn,T∈𝕂^n that satisfy S∪T∈Kn,∈𝕂^n, v(S)+v(T)=v(S∩T)+v(S∪T).(S)+v(T)=v(S)+v(S) . A valuation is called continuous if it is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff metric. A valuation is called invariant under rigid motions if v(φ(S))=v(S)(φ(S))=v(S) whenever S∈Kn∈𝕂^n and φφ is either a translation or a rotation of Rn.ℝ^n.
