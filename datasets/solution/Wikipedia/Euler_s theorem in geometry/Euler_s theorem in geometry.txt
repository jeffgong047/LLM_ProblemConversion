On distance between centers of a triangle
Euler's theorem:d=|IO|=R(R−2r)=|IO|=√(R(R-2r))
In geometry, Euler's theorem states that the distance d between the circumcenter and incenter of a triangle is given by[1][2]
d2=R(R−2r)^2=R(R-2r)
or equivalently
1R−d+1R+d=1r,1/R-d+1/R+d=1/r,
where R and r denote the circumradius and inradius respectively (the radii of the circumscribed circle and inscribed circle respectively). The theorem is named for  Leonhard Euler, who published it in 1765.[3] However, the same result was published earlier by William Chapple in 1746.[4]
From the theorem follows the Euler inequality:[5]
R≥2r,≥2r,
which holds with equality only in the equilateral case.[6]


Stronger version of the inequality[edit]
A stronger version[6] is
Rr≥abc+a3+b3+c32abc≥ab+bc+ca−1≥23(ab+bc+ca)≥2,R/r≥abc+a^3+b^3+c^3/2abc≥a/b+b/c+c/a-1≥2/3(a/b+b/c+c/a)≥2,
where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle.

Euler's theorem for the escribed circle[edit]
If ra_a and da_a denote respectively the radius of the escribed circle opposite to the vertex A and the distance between its center and the center of 
the circumscribed circle, then da2=R(R+2ra)_a^2=R(R+2r_a).

Euler's inequality in absolute geometry[edit]
Euler's inequality, in the form stating that, for all triangles inscribed in a given circle, the maximum of the radius of the inscribed circle is reached for the equilateral triangle and only for it, is valid in absolute geometry.[7]
