On distance between centers of a triangle Euler's theorem:d=|IO|=R(R−2r)=|IO|=√(R(R-2r)) In geometry, Euler's theorem states that the distance d between the circumcenter and incenter of a triangle is given by[1][2] d2=R(R−2r)^2=R(R-2r) or equivalently 1R−d+1R+d=1r,1/R-d+1/R+d=1/r, where R and r denote the circumradius and inradius respectively (the radii of the circumscribed circle and inscribed circle respectively). The theorem is named for Leonhard Euler, who published it in 1765.[3] However, the same result was published earlier by William Chapple in 1746.[4] From the theorem follows the Euler inequality:[5] R≥2r,≥2r, which holds with equality only in the equilateral case.[6] Stronger version of the
