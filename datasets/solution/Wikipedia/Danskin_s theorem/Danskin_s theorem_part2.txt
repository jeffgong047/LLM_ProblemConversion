Statement: The following version is proven in "Nonlinear programming" (1991).[2] Suppose ϕ(x,z)ϕ(x,z) is a continuous function of two arguments, ϕ:Rn×Z→Rϕ:ℝ^n→ℝ where Z⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m is a compact set. Under these conditions, Danskin's theorem provides conclusions regarding the convexity and differentiability of the function f(x)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z).(x)=max_zϕ(x,z). To state these results, we define the set of maximizing points Z0(x)_0(x) as Z0(x)=z¯:ϕ(x,z¯)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z)._0(x)={z:ϕ(x,z)=max_zϕ(x,z)}. Danskin's theorem then provides the following results. Convexity f(x)(x) is convex if ϕ(x,z)ϕ(x,z) is convex in x for every z∈Z. Directional semi-differential The semi-differential of f(x)(x) in the direction y, denoted ∂yf(x),∂_y(x), is given by ∂yf(x)=maxz∈Z0(x)ϕ′(x,z;y),∂_yf(x)=max_z_0(x)ϕ'(x,z;y), where ϕ′(x,z;y)ϕ'(x,z;y) is the directional derivative of the function ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) at x in the direction y.. Derivative f(x)(x) is differentiable at x if Z0(x)_0(x) consists of a single element z¯z. In this case, the derivative of f(x)(x) (or the gradient of f(x)(x) if x is a vector) is given by ∂f∂x=∂ϕ(x,z¯)∂x./=∂ϕ(x,z)/. Example of no directional
