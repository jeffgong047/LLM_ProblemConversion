Extension: The 1971 Ph.D. Thesis by Dimitri P. Bertsekas (Proposition A.22) [3] proves a more general result, which does not require that ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) is differentiable. Instead it assumes that ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) is an extended real-valued closed proper convex function for each z in the compact set Z,, that int⁡(dom⁡(f)),int(dom(f)), the interior of the effective domain of f,, is nonempty, and that ϕϕ is continuous on the set int⁡(dom⁡(f))×Z.int(dom(f)). Then for all x in int⁡(dom⁡(f)),int(dom(f)), the subdifferential of f at x is given by ∂f(x)=conv⁡∂ϕ(x,z):z∈Z0(x)(x)=conv{∂ϕ(x,z):z_0(x)} where ∂ϕ(x,z)∂ϕ(x,z) is the subdifferential of ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) at x for any z in Z..
