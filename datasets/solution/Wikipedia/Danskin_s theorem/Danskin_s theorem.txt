In convex analysis, Danskin's theorem is a theorem which provides information about the derivatives of a function of the form
f(x)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z).(x)=max_zϕ(x,z).
The theorem has applications in optimization, where it sometimes is used to solve minimax problems. The original theorem given by J. M. Danskin in his 1967 monograph [1] provides a formula for the directional derivative of the maximum of a (not necessarily convex) directionally differentiable function. 
An extension to more general conditions was proven 1971 by Dimitri Bertsekas.


Statement[edit]
The following version is proven in "Nonlinear programming" (1991).[2] Suppose ϕ(x,z)ϕ(x,z) is a continuous function of two arguments,
ϕ:Rn×Z→Rϕ:ℝ^n→ℝ
where Z⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m is a compact set. 
Under these conditions, Danskin's theorem provides conclusions regarding the convexity and differentiability of the function
f(x)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z).(x)=max_zϕ(x,z).
To state these results, we define the set of maximizing points Z0(x)_0(x) as
Z0(x)=z¯:ϕ(x,z¯)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z)._0(x)={z:ϕ(x,z)=max_zϕ(x,z)}.
Danskin's theorem then provides the following results.

Convexity
f(x)(x) is convex if ϕ(x,z)ϕ(x,z) is convex in x for every z∈Z.
Directional semi-differential
The  semi-differential  of f(x)(x) in the direction y, denoted ∂yf(x),∂_y(x), is given by ∂yf(x)=maxz∈Z0(x)ϕ′(x,z;y),∂_yf(x)=max_z_0(x)ϕ'(x,z;y), where ϕ′(x,z;y)ϕ'(x,z;y) is the directional derivative of the function ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) at x in the direction y..
Derivative
f(x)(x) is differentiable at x if Z0(x)_0(x) consists of a single element z¯z. In this case, the derivative of f(x)(x) (or the gradient of f(x)(x) if x is a vector) is given by ∂f∂x=∂ϕ(x,z¯)∂x./=∂ϕ(x,z)/.
Example of no directional derivative[edit]
In the statement of Danskin, it is important to conclude semi-differentiability of f and not directional-derivative as explains this simple example.
Set Z=−1,+1,ϕ(x,z)=zx={-1,+1},
phi(x,z)=zx, we get f(x)=|x|(x)=|x| which is semi-differentiable with ∂−f(0)=−1,∂+f(0)=+1∂_-f(0)=-1,∂_+f(0)=+1 but has not a directional derivative at x=0=0.

Subdifferential[edit]
If ϕ(x,z)ϕ(x,z) is differentiable with respect to x for all z∈Z,, and if ∂ϕ/∂x∂ϕ/ is continuous with respect to z for all x, then the subdifferential of f(x)(x) is given by ∂f(x)=conv∂ϕ(x,z)∂x:z∈Z0(x)(x)=conv{∂ϕ(x,z)/:z_0(x)} where convconv indicates the convex hull operation.
Extension[edit]
The 1971 Ph.D. Thesis by Dimitri P. Bertsekas (Proposition A.22) [3] proves a more general result, which does not require that ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) is differentiable. Instead it assumes that ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) is an extended real-valued closed proper convex function for each z in the compact set Z,, that int⁡(dom⁡(f)),int(dom(f)), the interior of the effective domain of f,, is nonempty, and that ϕϕ is continuous on the set int⁡(dom⁡(f))×Z.int(dom(f)). Then for all x in int⁡(dom⁡(f)),int(dom(f)), the subdifferential of f at x is given by
∂f(x)=conv⁡∂ϕ(x,z):z∈Z0(x)(x)=conv{∂ϕ(x,z):z_0(x)}
where ∂ϕ(x,z)∂ϕ(x,z) is the subdifferential of ϕ(⋅,z)ϕ(·,z) at x for any z in Z..
