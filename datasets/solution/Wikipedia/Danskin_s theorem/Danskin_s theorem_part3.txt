derivative: In the statement of Danskin, it is important to conclude semi-differentiability of f and not directional-derivative as explains this simple example. Set Z=−1,+1,ϕ(x,z)=zx={-1,+1}, phi(x,z)=zx, we get f(x)=|x|(x)=|x| which is semi-differentiable with ∂−f(0)=−1,∂+f(0)=+1∂_-f(0)=-1,∂_+f(0)=+1 but has not a directional derivative at x=0=0.
