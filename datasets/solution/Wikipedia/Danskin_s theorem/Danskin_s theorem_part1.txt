In convex analysis, Danskin's theorem is a theorem which provides information about the derivatives of a function of the form f(x)=maxz∈Zϕ(x,z).(x)=max_zϕ(x,z). The theorem has applications in optimization, where it sometimes is used to solve minimax problems. The original theorem given by J. M. Danskin in his 1967 monograph [1] provides a formula for the directional derivative of the maximum of a (not necessarily convex) directionally differentiable function. An extension to more general conditions was proven 1971 by Dimitri Bertsekas.
