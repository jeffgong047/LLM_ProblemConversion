Result on the topology of operators on an infinite-dimensional, complex Hilbert space In mathematics, Kuiper's theorem (after Nicolaas Kuiper) is a result on the topology of operators on an infinite-dimensional, complex Hilbert space H. It states that the space GL(H) of invertible bounded endomorphisms of H is such that all maps from any finite complex Y to GL(H) are homotopic to a constant, for the norm topology on operators. A significant corollary, also referred to as Kuiper's theorem, is that this group is weakly contractible, ie. all its homotopy groups are trivial. This result has important uses in topological K-theory. General topology of the general linear
