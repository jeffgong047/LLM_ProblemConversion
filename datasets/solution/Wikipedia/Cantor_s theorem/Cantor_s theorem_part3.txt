infinite: Let us examine the proof for the specific case when A is countably infinite. Without loss of generality, we may take A = N = {1, 2, 3, …}, the set of natural numbers. Suppose that N is equinumerous with its power set 𝒫(N). Let us see a sample of what 𝒫(N) looks like: P(N)=∅,1,2,1,2,3,4,1,5,3,4,6,2,4,6,…,….𝒫(ℕ)={∅,{1,2},{1,2,3},{4},{1,5},{3,4,6},{2,4,6,…},…}. 𝒫(N) contains infinite subsets of N, e.g. the set of all even numbers {2, 4, 6,...}, as well as the empty set. Now that we have an idea of what the elements of 𝒫(N) look like, let us attempt to pair off each element of N with each element of 𝒫(N) to show that these infinite sets are equinumerous. In other words, we will attempt to pair off each element of N with an element from the infinite set 𝒫(N), so that no element from either infinite set remains unpaired. Such an attempt to pair elements would look like this: N1⟷4,52⟷1,2,33⟷4,5,64⟷1,3,5⋮⋮⋮P(N).ℕ1 ⟷ {4,5} 2 ⟷ {1,2,3} 3 ⟷ {4,5,6} 4 ⟷ {1,3,5} ⋮ ⋮ ⋮𝒫(ℕ). Given such a pairing, some natural numbers are paired with subsets that contain the very same number. For instance, in our example the number 2 is paired with the subset {1, 2, 3}, which contains 2 as a member. Let us call such numbers selfish. Other natural numbers are paired with subsets that do not contain them. For instance, in our example the number 1 is paired with the subset {4, 5}, which does not contain the number 1. Call these numbers non-selfish. Likewise, 3 and 4 are non-selfish. Using this idea, let us build a special set of natural numbers. This set will provide the contradiction we seek. Let B be the set of all non-selfish natural numbers. By definition, the power set 𝒫(N) contains all sets of natural numbers, and so it contains this set B as an element. If the mapping is bijective, B must be paired off with some natural number, say b. However, this causes a problem. If b is in B, then b is selfish because it is in the corresponding set, which contradicts the definition of B. If b is not in B, then it is non-selfish and it should instead be a member of B. Therefore, no such element b which maps to B can exist. Since there is no natural number which can be paired with B, we have contradicted our original supposition, that there is a bijection between N and 𝒫(N). Note that the set B may be empty. This would mean that every natural number x maps to a subset of natural numbers that contains x. Then, every number maps to a nonempty set and no number maps to the empty set. But the empty set is a member of 𝒫(N), so the mapping still does not cover 𝒫(N). Through this proof by contradiction we have proven that the cardinality of N and 𝒫(N) cannot be equal. We also know that the cardinality of 𝒫(N) cannot be less than the cardinality of N because 𝒫(N) contains all singletons, by definition, and these singletons form a "copy" of N inside of 𝒫(N). Therefore, only one possibility remains, and that is that the cardinality of 𝒫(N) is strictly greater than the cardinality of N, proving Cantor's theorem. Related
