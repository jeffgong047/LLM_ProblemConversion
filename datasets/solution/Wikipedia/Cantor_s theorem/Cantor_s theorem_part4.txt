paradoxes: Cantor's theorem and its proof are closely related to two paradoxes of set theory. Cantor's paradox is the name given to a contradiction following from Cantor's theorem together with the assumption that there is a set containing all sets, the universal set V. In order to distinguish this paradox from the next one discussed below, it is important to note what this contradiction is. By Cantor's theorem |P(X)|>|X||𝒫(X)|>|X| for any set X. On the other hand, all elements of P(V)𝒫(V) are sets, and thus contained in V, therefore |P(V)|≤|V||𝒫(V)|≤|V|.[1] Another paradox can be derived from the proof of Cantor's theorem by instantiating the function f with the identity function; this turns Cantor's diagonal set into what is sometimes called the Russell set of a given set A:[1] RA=x∈A:x∉x._A={ x:x }. The proof of Cantor's theorem is straightforwardly adapted to show that assuming a set of all sets U exists, then considering its Russell set RU leads to the contradiction: RU∈RU⟺RU∉RU._U_U_U_U. This argument is known as Russell's paradox.[1] As a point of subtlety, the version of Russell's paradox we have presented here is actually a theorem of Zermelo;[4] we can conclude from the contradiction obtained that we must reject the hypothesis that RU∈U, thus disproving the existence of a set containing all sets. This was possible because we have used restricted comprehension (as featured in ZFC) in the definition of RA above, which in turn entailed that RU∈RU⟺(RU∈U∧RU∉RU)._U_U(R_U_U_U). Had we used unrestricted comprehension (as in Frege's system for instance) by defining the Russell set simply as R=x:x∉x={ x:x }, then the axiom system itself would have entailed the contradiction, with no further hypotheses needed.[4] Despite the syntactical similarities between the Russell set (in either variant) and the Cantor diagonal set, Alonzo Church emphasized that Russell's paradox is independent of considerations of cardinality and its underlying notions like one-to-one correspondence.[5]
