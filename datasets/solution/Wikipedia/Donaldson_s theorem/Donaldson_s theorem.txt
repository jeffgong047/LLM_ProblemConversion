On when a definite intersection form of a smooth 4-manifold is diagonalisable
In mathematics, and especially differential topology and gauge theory, Donaldson's theorem states that a definite intersection form of a compact, oriented, smooth manifold of dimension 4 is diagonalisable. If the intersection form is positive (negative) definite, it can be diagonalized to the identity matrix (negative identity matrix) over the integers. The original version[1] of the theorem required the manifold to be simply connected, but it was later improved to apply to 4-manifolds with any fundamental group.[2]


History[edit]
The theorem was proved by Simon Donaldson. This was a contribution cited for his Fields medal in 1986.

Idea of proof[edit]
Donaldson's proof utilizes the moduli space MPℳ_P of solutions to the anti-self-duality equations on a principal SU⁡(2)SU(2)-bundle P over the four-manifold X. By the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, the dimension of the moduli space is given by

dim⁡M=8k−3(1−b1(X)+b+(X)),ℳ=8k-3(1-b_1(X)+b_+(X)),
where c2(P)=k_2(P)=k, b1(X)_1(X) is the first Betti number of X and b+(X)_+(X) is the dimension of the positive-definite subspace of H2(X,R)_2(X,ℝ) with respect to the intersection form. When X is simply-connected with definite intersection form, possibly after changing orientation, one always has b1(X)=0_1(X)=0 and b+(X)=0_+(X)=0. Thus taking any principal SU⁡(2)SU(2)-bundle with k=1=1, one obtains a moduli space Mℳ of dimension five. 

Cobordism given by Yang–Mills moduli space in Donaldson's theorem
This moduli space is non-compact and generically smooth, with singularities occurring only at the points corresponding to reducible connections, of which there are exactly b2(X)_2(X) many.[3] Results of Clifford Taubes and Karen Uhlenbeck show that whilst Mℳ is non-compact, its structure at infinity can be readily described.[4][5][6] Namely, there is an open subset of Mℳ, say Mεℳ_ε, such that for sufficiently small choices of parameter εε, there is a diffeomorphism

Mε→≅X×(0,ε)ℳ_εX×(0,ε).
The work of Taubes and Uhlenbeck essentially concerns constructing sequences of ASD connections on the four-manifold X with curvature becoming infinitely concentrated at any given single point x∈X. For each such point, in the limit one obtains a unique singular ASD connection, which becomes a well-defined smooth ASD connection at that point using Uhlenbeck's removable singularity theorem.[6][3]
Donaldson observed that the singular points in the interior of Mℳ corresponding to reducible connections could also be described: they looked like cones over the complex projective plane CP2ℂℙ^2, with its orientation reversed.
It is thus possible to compactify the moduli space as follows: First, cut off each cone at a reducible singularity and glue in a copy of CP2ℂℙ^2. Secondly, glue in a copy of X itself at infinity. The resulting space is a cobordism between X and a disjoint union of b2(X)_2(X) copies of CP2ℂℙ^2 with its orientation reversed. The intersection form of a four-manifold is a cobordism invariant up to isomorphism of quadratic forms, from which one concludes the intersection form of X is diagonalisable.

Extensions[edit]
Michael Freedman had previously shown that any unimodular symmetric bilinear form is realized as the intersection form of some closed, oriented four-manifold. Combining this result with the Serre classification theorem and Donaldson's theorem, several interesting results can be seen:
1) Any non-diagonalizable intersection form gives rise to a four-dimensional topological manifold with no differentiable structure (so cannot be smoothed).
2) Two smooth simply-connected 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, if and only if, their intersection forms have the same rank, signature, and parity.
