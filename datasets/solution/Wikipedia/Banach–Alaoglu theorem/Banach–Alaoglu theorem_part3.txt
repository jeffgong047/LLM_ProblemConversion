Statement: See also: Topological vector space § Dual space, Dual system, and Polar set If X is a vector space over the field K𝕂 then X#^# will denote the algebraic dual space of X and these two spaces are henceforth associated with the bilinear evaluation map ⟨⋅,⋅⟩:X×X#→K⟨·,·⟩:X^#→𝕂 defined by ⟨x,f⟩=deff(x),f⟩ def= f(x) where the triple ⟨X,X#,⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟩,X^#,⟨·,·⟩⟩ forms a dual system called the canonical dual system. If X is a topological vector space (TVS) then its continuous dual space will be denoted by X′,^', where X′⊆X#^'^# always holds. Denote the weak-* topology on X#^# by σ(X#,X)σ(X^#,X) and denote the weak-* topology on X′^' by σ(X′,X).σ(X^',X). The weak-* topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because given a map f and a net of maps f∙=(fi)i∈I,_∙=(f_i)_i, the net f∙_∙ converges to f in this topology if and only if for every point x in the domain, the net of values (fi(x))i∈I(f_i(x))_i converges to the value f(x).(x). Alaoglu theorem[3] — For any topological vector space (TVS) X (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) with continuous dual space X′,^', the polar U∘=f∈X′:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1^∘={f^' : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} of any neighborhood U of origin in X is compact in the weak-* topology[note 1] σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X) on X′.^'. Moreover, U∘^∘ is equal to the polar of U with respect to the canonical system ⟨X,X#⟩,X^#⟩ and it is also a compact subset of (X#,σ(X#,X)).(X^#,σ(X^#,X)). Proof involving duality
