spaces: In a Hilbert space, every bounded and closed set is weakly relatively compact, hence every bounded net has a weakly convergent subnet (Hilbert spaces are reflexive). As norm-closed, convex sets are weakly closed (Hahn–Banach theorem), norm-closures of convex bounded sets in Hilbert spaces or reflexive Banach spaces are weakly compact. Closed and bounded sets in B(H)(H) are precompact with respect to the weak operator topology (the weak operator topology is weaker than the ultraweak topology which is in turn the weak-* topology with respect to the predual of B(H),(H), the trace class operators). Hence bounded sequences of operators have a weak accumulation point. As a consequence, B(H)(H) has the Heine–Borel property, if equipped with either the weak operator or the ultraweak topology.
