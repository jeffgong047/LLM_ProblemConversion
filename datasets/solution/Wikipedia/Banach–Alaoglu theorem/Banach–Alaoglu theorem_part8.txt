spaces: Assume that X is a normed space and endow its continuous dual space X′^' with the usual dual norm. The closed unit ball in X′^' is weak-* compact.[3] So if X′^' is infinite dimensional then its closed unit ball is necessarily not compact in the norm topology by F. Riesz's theorem (despite it being weak-* compact). A Banach space is reflexive if and only if its closed unit ball is σ(X,X′)σ(X,X^')-compact; this is known as James' theorem.[3] If X is a reflexive Banach space, then every bounded sequence in X has a weakly convergent subsequence. (This follows by applying the Banach–Alaoglu theorem to a weakly metrizable subspace of X; or, more succinctly, by applying the Eberlein–Šmulian theorem.) For example, suppose that X is the space Lp space Lp(μ)^p(μ) where 1<p<∞1<p<∞ and let q satisfy 1p+1q=1.1/p+1/q=1. Let f1,f2,…_1,f_2,… be a bounded sequence of functions in X.. Then there exists a subsequence (fnk)k=1∞(f_n_k)_k=1^∞ and an f∈X such that ∫fnkgdμ→∫fgdμforallg∈Lq(μ)=X′._n_kg dμ→ dμ forallg^q(μ)=X^'. The corresponding result for p=1=1 is not true, as L1(μ)^1(μ) is not reflexive. Consequences for Hilbert
