History: According to Lawrence Narici and Edward Beckenstein, the Alaoglu theorem is a “very important result—maybe the most important fact about the weak-* topology—[that] echos throughout functional analysis.”[2] In 1912, Helly proved that the unit ball of the continuous dual space of C([a,b])([a,b]) is countably weak-* compact.[3] In 1932, Stefan Banach proved that the closed unit ball in the continuous dual space of any separable normed space is sequentially weak-* compact (Banach only considered sequential compactness).[3] The proof for the general case was published in 1940 by the mathematician Leonidas Alaoglu. According to Pietsch [2007], there are at least twelve mathematicians who can lay claim to this theorem or an important predecessor to it.[2] The Bourbaki–Alaoglu theorem is a generalization[4][5] of the original theorem by Bourbaki to dual topologies on locally convex spaces. This theorem is also called the Banach–Alaoglu theorem or the weak-* compactness theorem and it is commonly called simply the Alaoglu theorem.[2]
