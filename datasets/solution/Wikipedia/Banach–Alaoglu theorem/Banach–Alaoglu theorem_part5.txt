proof: The following elementary proof does not utilize duality theory and requires only basic concepts from set theory, topology, and functional analysis. What is needed from topology is a working knowledge of net convergence in topological spaces and familiarity with the fact that a linear functional is continuous if and only if it is bounded on a neighborhood of the origin (see the articles on continuous linear functionals and sublinear functionals for details). Also required is a proper understanding of the technical details of how the space KX𝕂^X of all functions of the form X→K→𝕂 is identified as the Cartesian product ∏x∈XK,∏_x𝕂, and the relationship between pointwise convergence, the product topology, and subspace topologies they induce on subsets such as the algebraic dual space X#^# and products of subspaces such as ∏x∈XBrx.∏_xB_r_x. An explanation of these details is now given for readers who are interested. Premiere on product/function spaces, nets, and pointwise convergence For every real r,, Br=defc∈K:|c|≤r_r def= {c∈𝕂:|c|} will denote the closed ball of radius r centered at 00 and rU=defru:u∈U def= {ru:u} for any U⊆X,, Identification of functions with tuples The Cartesian product ∏x∈XK∏_x𝕂 is usually thought of as the set of all X-indexed tuples s∙=(sx)x∈X_∙=(s_x)_x but, since tuples are technically just functions from an indexing set, it can also be identified with the space KX𝕂^X of all functions having prototype X→K,→𝕂, as is now described: Function →→ Tuple: A function s:X→K:X→𝕂 belonging to KX𝕂^X is identified with its (X-indexed) "tuple of values" s∙=def(s(x))x∈X._∙ def= (s(x))_x. Tuple →→ Function: A tuple s∙=(sx)x∈X_∙=(s_x)_x in ∏x∈XK∏_x𝕂 is identified with the function s:X→K:X→𝕂 defined by s(x)=defsx(x) def= s_x; this function's "tuple of values" is the original tuple (sx)x∈X.(s_x)_x. This is the reason why many authors write, often without comment, the equality KX=∏x∈XK𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂 and why the Cartesian product ∏x∈XK∏_x𝕂 is sometimes taken as the definition of the set of maps KX𝕂^X (or conversely). However, the Cartesian product, being the (categorical) product in the category of sets (which is a type of inverse limit), also comes equipped with associated maps that are known as its (coordinate) projections. The canonical projection of the Cartesian product at a given point z∈X is the function Prz:∏x∈XK→Kdefinedbys∙=(sx)x∈X↦sz_z:∏_x𝕂→𝕂 definedby_∙=(s_x)_x_z where under the above identification, Prz_z sends a function s:X→K:X→𝕂 to Prz(s)=defs(z)._z(s) def= s(z). Stated in words, for a point z and function s,, "plugging z into s" is the same as "plugging s into Prz_z". In particular, suppose that (rx)x∈X(r_x)_x are non-negative real numbers. Then ∏x∈XBrx⊆∏x∈XK=KX,∏_xB_r_x⊆∏_x𝕂=𝕂^X, where under the above identification of tuples with functions, ∏x∈XBrx∏_xB_r_x is the set of all functions s∈KX∈𝕂^X such that s(x)∈Brx(x)_r_x for every x∈X.. If a subset U⊆X partitions X into X=U∪(X∖U)=U ∪ (X) then the linear bijection H:∏x∈XK→(∏u∈UK)×∏x∈X∖UK(fx)x∈X↦((fu)u∈U,(fx)x∈X∖U)4H: ∏_x𝕂 → (∏_u𝕂)×∏_x𝕂 (f_x)_x ↦ ((f_u)_u, (f_x)_x) canonically identifies these two Cartesian products; moreover, this map is a homeomorphism when these products are endowed with their product topologies. In terms of function spaces, this bijection could be expressed as H:KX→KU×KX∖Uf↦(f|U,f|X∖U).4H: 𝕂^X → 𝕂^U×𝕂^X f ↦ (f|_U, f|_X) . Notation for nets and function composition with nets A net x∙=(xi)i∈I_∙=(x_i)_i in X is by definition a function x∙:I→X_∙:I from a non-empty directed set (I,≤).(I,≤). Every sequence in X,, which by definition is just a function of the form N→X,ℕ, is also a net. As with sequences, the value of a net x∙_∙ at an index i∈I is denoted by xi_i; however, for this proof, this value xi_i may also be denoted by the usual function parentheses notation x∙(i)._∙(i). Similarly for function composition, if F:X→Y:X is any function then the net (or sequence) that results from "plugging x∙_∙ into F" is just the function F∘x∙:I→Y,_∙:I, although this is typically denoted by (F(xi))i∈I(F(x_i))_i (or by (F(xi))i=1∞(F(x_i))_i=1^∞ if x∙_∙ is a sequence). In the proofs below, this resulting net may be denoted by any of the following notations F(x∙)=(F(xi))i∈I=defF∘x∙,(x_∙)=(F(x_i))_i def= F_∙, depending on whichever notation is cleanest or most clearly communicates the intended information. In particular, if F:X→Y:X is continuous and x∙→x_∙ in X,, then the conclusion commonly written as (F(xi))i∈I→F(x)(F(x_i))_i(x) may instead be written as F(x∙)→F(x)(x_∙)(x) or F∘x∙→F(x)._∙(x). Topology The set KX=∏x∈XK𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂 is assumed to be endowed with the product topology. It is well known that the product topology is identical to the topology of pointwise convergence. This is because given f and a net (fi)i∈I,(f_i)_i, where f and every fi_i is an element of KX=∏x∈XK,𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂, then the net (fi)i∈I→f(f_i)_i converges in the product topology if and only if for every z∈X,, the net Prz((fi)i∈I)→Prz(f)_z((f_i)_i)→_z(f) converges in K,𝕂, where because Prz(f)=f(z) _z(f)=f(z) and Prz((fi)i∈I)=def(Prz(fi))i∈I=(fi(z))i∈I,_z((f_i)_i) def= (_z(f_i))_i=(f_i(z))_i, this happens if and only if for every z∈X,, the net (fi(z))i∈I→f(z)(f_i(z))_i(z) converges in K,𝕂, Thus (fi)i∈I(f_i)_i converges to f in the product topology if and only if it converges to f pointwise on X.. This proof will also use the fact that the topology of pointwise convergence is preserved when passing to topological subspaces. This means, for example, that if for every x∈X,, Sx⊆K_x⊆𝕂 is some (topological) subspace of K𝕂 then the topology of pointwise convergence (or equivalently, the product topology) on ∏x∈XSx∏_xS_x is equal to the subspace topology that the set ∏x∈XSx∏_xS_x inherits from ∏x∈XK.∏_x𝕂. And if Sx_x is closed in K𝕂 for every x∈X,, then ∏x∈XSx∏_xS_x is a closed subset of ∏x∈XK.∏_x𝕂. Characterization of supu∈U|f(u)|≤rsup_u|f(u)| An important fact used by the proof is that for any real r,, supu∈U|f(u)|≤rifandonlyiff(U)⊆Brsup_u|f(u)| ifandonlyif(U)_r where sup sup denotes the supremum and f(U)=deff(u):u∈U.(U) def= {f(u):u}. As a side note, this characterization does not hold if the closed ball Br_r is replaced with the open ball c∈K:|c|<r{c∈𝕂:|c|<r} (and replacing supu∈U|f(u)|≤r sup_u|f(u)| with the strict inequality supu∈U|f(u)|<r sup_u|f(u)|<r will not change this; for counter-examples, consider X=defK def= 𝕂 and the identity map f=defId def= Id on X). The essence of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem can be found in the next proposition, from which the Banach–Alaoglu theorem follows. Unlike the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, this proposition does not require the vector space X to endowed with any topology. Proposition[3] — Let U be a subset of a vector space X over the field K𝕂 (where K=RorK=C𝕂=ℝor𝕂=ℂ) and for every real number r,, endow the closed ball Br=defs∈K:|s|≤r_r def= {s∈𝕂:|s|} with its usual topology (X need not be endowed with any topology, but K𝕂 has its usual Euclidean topology). Define U#=deff∈X#:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1.^# def= {f^# : sup_u|f(u)|≤1}. If for every x∈X,, rx>0_x>0 is a real number such that x∈rxU,_xU, then U#^# is a closed and compact subspace of the product space ∏x∈XBrx∏_xB_r_x (where because this product topology is identical to the topology of pointwise convergence, which is also called the weak-* topology in functional analysis, this means that U#^# is compact in the weak-* topology or "weak-* compact" for short). Before proving the proposition above, it is first shown how the Banach–Alaoglu theorem follows from it (unlike the proposition, Banach–Alaoglu assumes that X is a topological vector space (TVS) and that U is a neighborhood of the origin). Proof that Banach–Alaoglu follows from the proposition above Assume that X is a topological vector space with continuous dual space X′^' and that U is a neighborhood of the origin. Because U is a neighborhood of the origin in X,, it is also an absorbing subset of X,, so for every x∈X,, there exists a real number rx>0_x>0 such that x∈rxU._xU. Thus the hypotheses of the above proposition are satisfied, and so the set U#^# is therefore compact in the weak-* topology. The proof of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem will be complete once it is shown that U#=U∘,^#=U^∘,[note 2] where recall that U∘^∘ was defined as U∘=deff∈X′:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1=U#∩X′.^∘ def= {f^' : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} = U^#^'. Proof that U∘=U#:^∘=U^#: Because U∘=U#∩X′,^∘=U^#^', the conclusion is equivalent to U#⊆X′.^#^'. If f∈U#^# then supu∈U|f(u)|≤1, sup_u|f(u)|≤1, which states exactly that the linear functional f is bounded on the neighborhood U;; thus f is a continuous linear functional (that is, f∈X′^'), as desired. ◼▪ Proof of Proposition The product space ∏x∈XBrx∏_xB_r_x is compact by Tychonoff's theorem (since each closed ball Brx=defs∈K:|s|≤rx_r_x def= {s∈𝕂:|s|_x} is a Hausdorff[note 3] compact space). Because a closed subset of a compact space is compact, the proof of the proposition will be complete once it is shown that U#=deff∈X#:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1=f∈X#:f(U)⊆B1^# def= {f^# : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} = {f^# : f(U)_1} is a closed subset of ∏x∈XBrx.∏_xB_r_x. The following statements guarantee this conclusion: U#⊆∏x∈XBrx.^#⊆∏_xB_r_x. U#^# is a closed subset of the product space ∏x∈XK=KX.∏_x𝕂=𝕂^X. Proof of (1): For any z∈X,, let Prz:∏x∈XK→K_z:∏_x𝕂→𝕂 denote the projection to the zth coordinate (as defined above). To prove that U#⊆∏x∈XBrx,^#⊆∏_xB_r_x, it is sufficient (and necessary) to show that Prx(U#)⊆Brx_x(U^#)_r_x for every x∈X.. So fix x∈X and let f∈U#.^#. Because Prx(f)=f(x),_x(f) = f(x), it remains to show that f(x)∈Brx.(x)_r_x. Recall that rx>0_x>0 was defined in the proposition's statement as being any positive real number that satisfies x∈rxU_xU (so for example, ru:=1_u:=1 would be a valid choice for each u∈U), which implies ux=def1rxx∈U. u_x def= 1/r_x x. Because f is a positive homogeneous function that satisfies supu∈U|f(u)|≤1, sup_u|f(u)|≤1, 1rx|f(x)|=|1rxf(x)|=|f(1rxx)|=|f(ux)|≤supu∈U|f(u)|≤1.1/r_x|f(x)|=|1/r_xf(x)|=|f(1/r_xx)|=|f(u_x)|≤sup_u|f(u)|≤1. Thus |f(x)|≤rx,|f(x)|_x, which shows that f(x)∈Brx,(x)_r_x, as desired. Proof of (2): The algebraic dual space X#^# is always a closed subset of KX=∏x∈XK𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂 (this is proved in the lemma below for readers who are not familiar with this result). The set UB1=deff∈KX:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1=f∈KX:f(u)∈B1forallu∈U=(fx)x∈X∈∏x∈XK:fu∈B1forallu∈U=∏x∈XCxwhereCx=defB1ifx∈UKifx∉U9U_B_1 def= { f in𝕂^X :sup_u|f(u)|≤1} ={ f ∈𝕂^X :f(u)_1forallu} ={(f_x)_x∈∏_x𝕂 : f_u _1forallu} =∏_xC_x where_x def= B_1 ifx 𝕂 ifx is closed in the product topology on ∏x∈XK=KX∏_x𝕂=𝕂^X since it is a product of closed subsets of K.𝕂. Thus UB1∩X#=U#_B_1^#=U^# is an intersection of two closed subsets of KX,𝕂^X, which proves (2).[note 4] ◼▪ The conclusion that the set UB1=f∈KX:f(U)⊆B1_B_1={f∈𝕂^X:f(U)_1} is closed can also be reached by applying the following more general result, this time proved using nets, to the special case Y:=K:=𝕂 and B:=B1.:=B_1. Observation: If U⊆X is any set and if B⊆Y is a closed subset of a topological space Y,, then UB=deff∈YX:f(U)⊆B_B def= {f^X:f(U)} is a closed subset of YX^X in the topology of pointwise convergence. Proof of observation: Let f∈YX^X and suppose that (fi)i∈I(f_i)_i is a net in UB_B that converges pointwise to f.. It remains to show that f∈UB,_B, which by definition means f(U)⊆B.(U). For any u∈U,, because (fi(u))i∈I→f(u)(f_i(u))_i(u) in Y and every value fi(u)∈fi(U)⊆B_i(u)inf_i(U) belongs to the closed (in Y) subset B,, so too must this net's limit belong to this closed set; thus f(u)∈B,(u), which completes the proof. ◼▪ Lemma (X#^# is closed in KX𝕂^X) — The algebraic dual space X#^# of any vector space X over a field K𝕂 (where K𝕂 is Rℝ or Cℂ) is a closed subset of KX=∏x∈XK𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂 in the topology of pointwise convergence. (The vector space X need not be endowed with any topology). Proof of lemma Let f∈KX∈𝕂^X and suppose that f∙=(fi)i∈I_∙=(f_i)_i is a net in X#^# the converges to f in KX.𝕂^X. To conclude that f∈X#,^#, it must be shown that f is a linear functional. So let s be a scalar and let x,y∈X.,y. For any z∈X,, let f∙(z):I→K_∙(z):I→𝕂 denote f∙_∙'s net of values at z f∙(z)=def(fi(z))i∈I._∙(z) def= (f_i(z))_i. Because f∙→f_∙ in KX,𝕂^X, which has the topology of pointwise convergence, f∙(z)→f(z)_∙(z)(z) in K𝕂 for every z∈X.. By using x,y,sx,andx+y,,y,sx,andx+y, in place of z,, it follows that each of the following nets of scalars converges in K:𝕂: f∙(x)→f(x),f∙(y)→f(y),f∙(x+y)→f(x+y),andf∙(sx)→f(sx)._∙(x)(x),_∙(y)(y),_∙(x+y)(x+y), and_∙(sx)(sx). Proof that f(sx)=sf(x):(sx)=sf(x): Let M:K→K:𝕂→𝕂 be the "multiplication by s" map defined by M(c)=defsc.(c) def= sc. Because M is continuous and f∙(x)→f(x)_∙(x)(x) in K,𝕂, it follows that M(f∙(x))→M(f(x))(f_∙(x))(f(x)) where the right hand side is M(f(x))=sf(x)(f(x))=sf(x) and the left hand side is M(f∙(x))=defM∘f∙(x)bydefinitionofnotation=(M(fi(x)))i∈Ibecausef∙(x)=(fi(x))i∈I:I→K=(sfi(x))i∈IM(fi(x))=defsfi(x)=(fi(sx))i∈Ibylinearityoffi=f∙(sx)notation4M(f_∙(x))def= M_∙(x) bydefinitionofnotation = (M(f_i(x)))_i becausef_∙(x)=(f_i(x))_i:I→𝕂 = (sf_i(x))_i M(f_i(x)) def= sf_i(x) = (f_i(sx))_i bylinearityoff_i = f_∙(sx) notation which proves that f∙(sx)→sf(x)._∙(sx)(x). Because also f∙(sx)→f(sx)_∙(sx)(sx) and limits in K𝕂 are unique, it follows that sf(x)=f(sx),(x)=f(sx), as desired. Proof that f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y):(x+y)=f(x)+f(y): Define a net z∙=(zi)i∈I:I→K×K_∙=(z_i)_i:I→𝕂×𝕂 by letting zi=def(fi(x),fi(y))_i def= (f_i(x),f_i(y)) for every i∈I.. Because f∙(x)=(fi(x))i∈I→f(x)_∙(x)=(f_i(x))_i(x) and f∙(y)=(fi(y))i∈I→f(y),_∙(y)=(f_i(y))_i(y), it follows that z∙→(f(x),f(y))_∙→(f(x),f(y)) in K×K.𝕂×𝕂. Let A:K×K→K:𝕂×𝕂→𝕂 be the addition map defined by A(x,y)=defx+y.(x,y) def= x+y. The continuity of A implies that A(z∙)→A(f(x),f(y))(z_∙)(f(x),f(y)) in K𝕂 where the right hand side is A(f(x),f(y))=f(x)+f(y)(f(x),f(y))=f(x)+f(y) and the left hand side is A(z∙)=defA∘z∙=(A(zi))i∈I=(A(fi(x),fi(y)))i∈I=(fi(x)+fi(y))i∈I=(fi(x+y))i∈I=f∙(x+y)(z_∙) def= A_∙=(A(z_i))_i=(A(f_i(x),f_i(y)))_i=(f_i(x)+f_i(y))_i=(f_i(x+y))_i=f_∙(x+y) which proves that f∙(x+y)→f(x)+f(y)._∙(x+y)(x)+f(y). Because also f∙(x+y)→f(x+y),_∙(x+y)(x+y), it follows that f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y),(x+y)=f(x)+f(y), as desired. ◼▪ The lemma above actually also follows from its corollary below since ∏x∈XK∏_x𝕂 is a Hausdorff complete uniform space and any subset of such a space (in particular X#^#) is closed if and only if it is complete. Corollary to lemma (X#^# is weak-* complete) — When the algebraic dual space X#^# of a vector space X is equipped with the topology σ(X#,X)σ(X^#,X) of pointwise convergence (also known as the weak-* topology) then the resulting topological space (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) is a complete Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space. Proof of corollary to lemma Because the underlying field K𝕂 is a complete Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space, the same is true of the product space KX=∏x∈XK.𝕂^X=∏_x𝕂. A closed subset of a complete space is complete, so by the lemma, the space (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) is complete. ◼▪ The above elementary proof of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem actually shows that if U⊆X is any subset that satisfies X=(0,∞)U=defru:r>0,u∈U=(0,∞)U def= {ru:r>0,u} (such as any absorbing subset of X), then U#=deff∈X#:f(U)⊆B1^# def= {f^#:f(U)_1} is a weak-* compact subset of X#.^#. As a side note, with the help of the above elementary proof, it may be shown (see this footnote)[proof 1] that there exist X-indexed non-negative real numbers m∙=(mx)x∈X_∙=(m_x)_x such that U∘=U#=X#∩∏x∈XBmx=X′∩∏x∈XBmx4U^∘ =U^# =X^# ∩∏_xB_m_x =X^' ∩∏_xB_m_x where these real numbers m∙_∙ can also be chosen to be "minimal" in the following sense: using P=defU∘ def= U^∘ (so P=U#=U^# as in the proof) and defining the notation ∏BR∙=def∏x∈XBRx_R_∙ def= ∏_xB_R_x for any R∙=(Rx)x∈X∈RX,_∙=(R_x)_x∈ℝ^X, if TP=defR∙∈RX:P⊆∏BR∙_P def= {R_∙∈ℝ^X : P⊆_R_∙} then m∙∈TP_∙_P and for every x∈X,, mx=infRx:R∙∈TP,_x=inf{R_x:R_∙_P}, which shows that these numbers m∙_∙ are unique; indeed, this infimum formula can be used to define them. In fact, if BoxPBox_P denotes the set of all such products of closed balls containing the polar set P,, BoxP⁡=def∏BR∙:R∙∈TP=∏BR∙:P⊆∏BR∙,Box_P def= {_R_∙ : R_∙_P} = {_R_∙ : P⊆_R_∙}, then ∏Bm∙=∩BoxP∈BoxP_m_∙=∩Box_P∈Box_P where ⋂BoxP⋂Box_P denotes the intersection of all sets belonging to BoxP.Box_P. This implies (among other things[note 5]) that ∏Bm∙=∏x∈XBmx_m_∙=∏_xB_m_x the unique least element of BoxPBox_P with respect to ⊆; ⊆; this may be used as an alternative definition of this (necessarily convex and balanced) set. The function m∙=def(mx)x∈X:X→[0,∞)_∙ def= (m_x)_x:X→[0,∞) is a seminorm and it is unchanged if U is replaced by the convex balanced hull of U (because U#=[cobal⁡U]#^#=[cobalU]^#). Similarly, because U∘=[clX⁡U]∘,^∘=[cl_XU]^∘, m∙_∙ is also unchanged if U is replaced by its closure in X.. Sequential Banach–Alaoglu
