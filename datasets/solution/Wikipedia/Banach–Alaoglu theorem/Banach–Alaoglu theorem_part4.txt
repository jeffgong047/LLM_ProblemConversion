theory: Proof Denote by the underlying field of X by K,𝕂, which is either the real numbers Rℝ or complex numbers C.ℂ. This proof will use some of the basic properties that are listed in the articles: polar set, dual system, and continuous linear operator. To start the proof, some definitions and readily verified results are recalled. When X#^# is endowed with the weak-* topology σ(X#,X),σ(X^#,X), then this Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space is denoted by (X#,σ(X#,X)).(X^#,σ(X^#,X)). The space (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) is always a complete TVS; however, (X′,σ(X′,X))(X^',σ(X^',X)) may fail to be a complete space, which is the reason why this proof involves the space (X#,σ(X#,X)).(X^#,σ(X^#,X)). Specifically, this proof will use the fact that a subset of a complete Hausdorff space is compact if (and only if) it is closed and totally bounded. Importantly, the subspace topology that X′^' inherits from (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) is equal to σ(X′,X).σ(X^',X). This can be readily verified by showing that given any f∈X′,^', a net in X′^' converges to f in one of these topologies if and only if it also converges to f in the other topology (the conclusion follows because two topologies are equal if and only if they have the exact same convergent nets). The triple ⟨X,X′⟩,X^'⟩ is a dual pairing although unlike ⟨X,X#⟩,,X^#⟩, it is in general not guaranteed to be a dual system. Throughout, unless stated otherwise, all polar sets will be taken with respect to the canonical pairing ⟨X,X′⟩.,X^'⟩. Let U be a neighborhood of the origin in X and let: U∘=f∈X′:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1^∘={f^' : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} be the polar of U with respect to the canonical pairing ⟨X,X′⟩,X^'⟩; U∘∘=x∈X:supf∈U∘|f(x)|≤1^∘∘={x : sup_f^∘|f(x)|≤1} be the bipolar of U with respect to ⟨X,X′⟩,X^'⟩; U#=f∈X#:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1^#={f^# : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} be the polar of U with respect to the canonical dual system ⟨X,X#⟩.,X^#⟩. Note that U∘=U#∩X′.^∘=U^#^'. A well known fact about polar sets is that U∘∘∘⊆U∘.^∘∘∘^∘. Show that U#^# is a σ(X#,X)σ(X^#,X)-closed subset of X#:^#: Let f∈X#^# and suppose that f∙=(fi)i∈I_∙=(f_i)_i is a net in U#^# that converges to f in (X#,σ(X#,X)).(X^#,σ(X^#,X)). To conclude that f∈U#,^#, it is sufficient (and necessary) to show that |f(u)|≤1|f(u)|≤1 for every u∈U.. Because fi(u)→f(u)_i(u)(u) in the scalar field K𝕂 and every value fi(u)_i(u) belongs to the closed (in K𝕂) subset s∈K:|s|≤1,{s∈𝕂:|s|≤1}, so too must this net's limit f(u)(u) belong to this set. Thus |f(u)|≤1.|f(u)|≤1. Show that U#=U∘^#=U^∘ and then conclude that U∘^∘ is a closed subset of both (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) and (X′,σ(X′,X)):(X^',σ(X^',X)): The inclusion U∘⊆U#^∘^# holds because every continuous linear functional is (in particular) a linear functional. For the reverse inclusion U#⊆U∘, U^#^∘, let f∈U#^# so that supu∈U|f(u)|≤1, sup_u|f(u)|≤1, which states exactly that the linear functional f is bounded on the neighborhood U; thus f is a continuous linear functional (that is, f∈X′^') and so f∈U∘,^∘, as desired. Using (1) and the fact that the intersection U#∩X′=U∘∩X′=U∘^#^'=U^∘^'=U^∘ is closed in the subspace topology on X′,^', the claim about U∘^∘ being closed follows. Show that U∘^∘ is a σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-totally bounded subset of X′:^': By the bipolar theorem, U⊆U∘∘^∘∘ where because the neighborhood U is an absorbing subset of X,, the same must be true of the set U∘∘;^∘∘; it is possible to prove that this implies that U∘^∘ is a σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-bounded subset of X′.^'. Because X distinguishes points of X′,^', a subset of X′^' is σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-bounded if and only if it is σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-totally bounded. So in particular, U∘^∘ is also σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-totally bounded. Conclude that U∘^∘ is also a σ(X#,X)σ(X^#,X)-totally bounded subset of X#:^#: Recall that the σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X) topology on X′^' is identical to the subspace topology that X′^' inherits from (X#,σ(X#,X)).(X^#,σ(X^#,X)). This fact, together with (3) and the definition of "totally bounded", implies that U∘^∘ is a σ(X#,X)σ(X^#,X)-totally bounded subset of X#.^#. Finally, deduce that U∘^∘ is a σ(X′,X)σ(X^',X)-compact subset of X′:^': Because (X#,σ(X#,X))(X^#,σ(X^#,X)) is a complete TVS and U∘^∘ is a closed (by (2)) and totally bounded (by (4)) subset of (X#,σ(X#,X)),(X^#,σ(X^#,X)), it follows that U∘^∘ is compact. ◼▪ If X is a normed vector space, then the polar of a neighborhood is closed and norm-bounded in the dual space. In particular, if U is the open (or closed) unit ball in X then the polar of U is the closed unit ball in the continuous dual space X′^' of X (with the usual dual norm). Consequently, this theorem can be specialized to: Banach–Alaoglu theorem — If X is a normed space then the closed unit ball in the continuous dual space X′^' (endowed with its usual operator norm) is compact with respect to the weak-* topology. When the continuous dual space X′^' of X is an infinite dimensional normed space then it is impossible for the closed unit ball in X′^' to be a compact subset when X′^' has its usual norm topology. This is because the unit ball in the norm topology is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional (cf. F. Riesz theorem). This theorem is one example of the utility of having different topologies on the same vector space. It should be cautioned that despite appearances, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem does not imply that the weak-* topology is locally compact. This is because the closed unit ball is only a neighborhood of the origin in the strong topology, but is usually not a neighborhood of the origin in the weak-* topology, as it has empty interior in the weak* topology, unless the space is finite-dimensional. In fact, it is a result of Weil that all locally compact Hausdorff topological vector spaces must be finite-dimensional. Elementary
