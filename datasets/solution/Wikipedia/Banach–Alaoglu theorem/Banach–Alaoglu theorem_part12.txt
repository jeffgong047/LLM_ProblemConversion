Notes: ^ Explicitly, a subset B′⊆X′^'^' is said to be "compact (resp. totally bounded, etc.) in the weak-* topology" if when X′^' is given the weak-* topology and the subset B′^' is given the subspace topology inherited from (X′,σ(X′,X)),(X^',σ(X^',X)), then B′^' is a compact (resp. totally bounded, etc.) space. ^ If ττ denotes the topology that X is (originally) endowed with, then the equality U∘=U#^∘=U^# shows that the polar U∘=f∈X′:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1^∘={f^' : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} of U is dependent only on U (and X#^#) and that the rest of the topology ττ can be ignored. To clarify what is meant, suppose σσ is any TVS topology on X such that the set U is (also) a neighborhood of the origin in (X,σ).(X,σ). Denote the continuous dual space of (X,σ)(X,σ) by (X,σ)′(X,σ)^' and denote the polar of U with respect to (X,σ)(X,σ) by U∘,σ=deff∈(X,σ)′:supu∈U|f(u)|≤1^∘,σ def= {f∈(X,σ)^' : sup_u|f(u)|≤1} so that U∘,τ^∘,τ is just the set U∘^∘ from above. Then U∘,τ=U∘,σ^∘,τ=U^∘,σ because both of these sets are equal to U#.^#. Said differently, the polar set U∘,σ^∘,σ's defining "requirement" that U∘,σ^∘,σ be a subset of the continuous dual space (X,σ)′(X,σ)^' is inconsequential and can be ignored because it does not have any effect on the resulting set of linear functionals. However, if νν is a TVS topology on X such that U is not a neighborhood of the origin in (X,ν)(X,ν) then the polar U∘,ν^∘,ν of U with respect to (X,ν)(X,ν) is not guaranteed to equal U#^# and so the topology νν can not be ignored. ^ Because every Brx_r_x is also a Hausdorff space, the conclusion that ∏x∈XBrx∏_xB_r_x is compact only requires the so-called "Tychonoff's theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces," which is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma and strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. ^ The conclusion UB1=∏x∈XCx_B_1=∏_xC_x can be written as UB1=(∏u∈UB1)×∏x∈X∖UK._B_1 = (∏_uB_1)×∏_x𝕂. The set U#^# may thus equivalently be defined by U#=defX#∩[(∏u∈UB1)×∏x∈X∖UK].^# def= X^#∩[(∏_uB_1)×∏_x𝕂]. Rewriting the definition in this way helps make it apparent that the set U#^# is closed in ∏x∈XK∏_x𝕂 because this is true of X#.^#. ^ This tuple m∙=def(mx)x∈X_∙ def= (m_x)_x is the least element of TP_P with respect to natural induced pointwise partial order defined by R∙≤S∙_∙_∙ if and only if Rx≤Sx_x_x for every x∈X.. Thus, every neighborhood U of the origin in X can be associated with this unique (minimum) function m∙:X→[0,∞)._∙:X→[0,∞). For any x∈X,, if r>0>0 is such that x∈rU then mx≤r_x so that in particular, m0=0_0=0 and mu≤1_u≤1 for every u∈U.. Proofs ^ For any non-empty subset A⊆[0,∞),⊆[0,∞), the equality ∩Ba:a∈A=BinfA∩{B_a:a}=B_inf_A holds (the intersection on the left is a closed, rather than open, disk − possibly of radius 00 − because it is an intersection of closed subsets of K𝕂 and so must itself be closed). For every x∈X,, let mx=infRx:R∙∈TP_x=inf_{R_x:R_∙_P} so that the previous set equality implies ∩BoxP=⋂R∙∈TP∏x∈XBRx=∏x∈X⋂R∙∈TPBRx=∏x∈XBmx.∩Box_P=⋂_R_∙_P∏_xB_R_x=∏_x⋂_R_∙_PB_R_x=∏_xB_m_x. From P⊆∩BoxP⊆∩Box_P it follows that m∙∈TP_∙_P and ∩BoxP∈BoxP,∩Box_P∈Box_P, thereby making ∩BoxP∩Box_P the least element of BoxPBox_P with respect to ⊆. ⊆. (In fact, the family BoxPBox_P is closed under (non-nullary) arbitrary intersections and also under finite unions of at least one set). The elementary proof showed that TP_P and BoxPBox_P are not empty and moreover, it also even showed that TP_P has an element (rx)x∈X(r_x)_x that satisfies ru=1_u=1 for every u∈U,, which implies that mu≤1_u≤1 for every u∈U.. The inclusion P⊆(∩BoxP)∩X′⊆(∩BoxP)∩X# ⊆ (∩Box_P)^' ⊆ (∩Box_P)^# is immediate; to prove the reverse inclusion, let f∈(∩BoxP)∩X#.∈(∩Box_P)^#. By definition, f∈P=defU# def= U^# if and only if supu∈U|f(u)|≤1,sup_u|f(u)|≤1, so let u∈U and it remains to show that |f(u)|≤1.|f(u)|≤1. From f∈∩BoxP=∏Bm∙,∈∩Box_P=_m_∙, it follows that f(u)=Pru(f)∈Pru(∏x∈XBmx)=Bmu,(u)=_u(f)∈_u(∏_xB_m_x)=B_m_u, which implies that |f(u)|≤mu≤1,|f(u)|_u≤1, as desired. ◼▪
