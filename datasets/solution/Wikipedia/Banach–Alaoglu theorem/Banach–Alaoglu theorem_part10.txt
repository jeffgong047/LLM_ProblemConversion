statements: See also: Krein–Milman theorem § Relation to other statements The Banach–Alaoglu may be proven by using Tychonoff's theorem, which under the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) axiomatic framework is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Most mainstream functional analysis relies on ZF + the axiom of choice, which is often denoted by ZFC. However, the theorem does not rely upon the axiom of choice in the separable case (see above): in this case there actually exists a constructive proof. In the general case of an arbitrary normed space, the ultrafilter Lemma, which is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice and equivalent to Tychonoff's theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces, suffices for the proof of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, and is in fact equivalent to it. The Banach–Alaoglu theorem is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma, which implies the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces (HB) but is not equivalent to it (said differently, Banach–Alaoglu is also strictly stronger than HB). However, the Hahn–Banach theorem is equivalent to the following weak version of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem for normed space[6] in which the conclusion of compactness (in the weak-* topology of the closed unit ball of the dual space) is replaced with the conclusion of quasicompactness (also sometimes called convex compactness); Weak version of Alaoglu theorem[6] — Let X be a normed space and let B denote the closed unit ball of its continuous dual space X′.^'. Then B has the following property, which is called (weak-*) quasicompactness or convex compactness: whenever C𝒞 is a cover of B by convex weak-* closed subsets of X′^' such that B∩C:C∈C{B:C∈𝒞} has the finite intersection property, then B∩⋂C∈CC∩⋂_C∈𝒞C is not empty. Compactness implies convex compactness because a topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property (FIP) has non-empty intersection. The definition of convex compactness is similar to this characterization of compact spaces in terms of the FIP, except that it only involves those closed subsets that are also convex (rather than all closed subsets).
