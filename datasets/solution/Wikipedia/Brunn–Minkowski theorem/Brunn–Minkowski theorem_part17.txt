cubes: It is instructive to consider the case where A an l×l square in the plane, and B a ball of radius ϵϵ. In this case, A+B+B is a rounded square, and its volume can be accounted for as the four rounded quarter circles of radius ϵϵ, the four rectangles of dimensions l×ϵ×ϵ along the sides, and the original square. Thus, μ(A+B)=l2+4ϵl+44πϵ2=μ(A)+4ϵl+μ(B)≥μ(A)+2πϵl+μ(B)=μ(A)+2μ(A)μ(B)+μ(B)=(μ(A)1/2+μ(B)1/2)2μ(A+B)=l^2+4+4/4πϵ^2=μ(A)+4+μ(B)≥μ(A)+2√(π)+μ(B)=μ(A)+2√(μ(A)μ(B))+μ(B)=(μ(A)^1/2+μ(B)^1/2)^2. This example also hints at the theory of mixed-volumes, since the terms that appear in the expansion of the volume of A+B+B correspond to the differently dimensional pieces of A. In particular, if we rewrite Brunn–Minkowski as μ(A+B)≥(μ(A)1/n+μ(B)1/n)nμ(A+B)≥(μ(A)^1/n+μ(B)^1/n)^n, we see that we can think of the cross terms of the binomial expansion of the latter as accounting, in some fashion, for the mixed volume representation of μ(A+B)=V(A,…,A)+nV(B,A,…,A)+…+(nj)V(B,…,B,A,…,A)+…nV(B,…,B,A)+μ(B)μ(A+B)=V(A,…,A)+nV(B,A,…,A)+…+nV(B,…,B,A,…,A)+(B,…,B,A)+μ(B). This same phenomenon can also be seen for the sum of an n-dimensional l×l box and a ball of radius ϵϵ, where the cross terms in (μ(A)1/n+μ(B)1/n)n(μ(A)^1/n+μ(B)^1/n)^n, up to constants, account for the mixed volumes. This is made precise for the first mixed volume in the section above on the applications to mixed volumes. Examples where the lower bound is
