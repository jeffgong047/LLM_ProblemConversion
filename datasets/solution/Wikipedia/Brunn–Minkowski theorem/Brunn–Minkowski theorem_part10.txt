body: Again consider a convex body K. Fix some line l and for each t∈l let Ht_t denote the affine hyperplane orthogonal to l that passes through t. Define, r(t)=Vol(K∩Ht)(t)=Vol(K_t); as discussed in the previous section, this function is concave. Now, let K′=⋃t∈l,K∩Ht≠∅B(t,r(t))∩Ht'=⋃_t,K_t≠∅B(t,r(t))_t. That is, K′' is obtained from K by replacing each slice Ht∩K_t with a disc of the same (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional volume centered l inside of Ht_t. The concavity of the radius function defined in the previous section implies that that K′' is convex. This construction is called the Brunn–Minkowski symmetrization. Grunbaum's
