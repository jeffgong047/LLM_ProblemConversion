Remarks: The proof of the Brunn–Minkowski theorem establishes that the function A↦[μ(A)]1/n↦[μ(A)]^1/n is concave in the sense that, for every pair of nonempty compact subsets A and B of Rn and every 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, [μ(tA+(1−t)B)]1/n≥t[μ(A)]1/n+(1−t)[μ(B)]1/n.[μ(tA+(1-t)B)]^1/n[μ(A)]^1/n+(1-t)[μ(B)]^1/n. For convex sets A and B of positive measure, the inequality in the theorem is strict for 0 < t < 1 unless A and B are positive homothetic, i.e. are equal up to translation and dilation by a positive factor.
