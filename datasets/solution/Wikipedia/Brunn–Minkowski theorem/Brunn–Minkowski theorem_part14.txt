surfaces: We prove the following theorem on concentration of measure, following notes by Barvinok and notes by Lap Chi Lau. See also Concentration of measure#Concentration on the sphere. Theorem: Let S be the unit sphere in Rnℝ^n. Let X⊆S. Define Xϵ=z∈S:d(z,X)≤ϵ_ϵ={z:d(z,X)≤ϵ}, where d refers to the Euclidean distance in Rnℝ^n. Let νν denote the surface area on the sphere. Then, for any ϵ∈(0,1]ϵ∈(0,1] we have that ν(Xϵ)ν(S)≥1−ν(S)ν(X)e−nϵ24ν(X_ϵ)/ν(S)≥1-ν(S)/ν(X)e^-nϵ^2/4. Proof Proof: Let δ=ϵ2/8δ=ϵ^2/8, and let Y=S∖Xϵ=S_ϵ. Then, for x∈X,y∈Y,y one can show, using 12||x+y||2=||x||2+||y||2−12||x−y||21/2||x+y||^2=||x||^2+||y||^2-1/2||x-y||^2 and 1−x≤1−x/2√(1-x)≤1-x/2 for x≤1≤1, that ||x+y2||≤1−δ||x+y/2||≤1-δ. In particular, x+y2∈(1−δ)B(0,1)x+y/2∈(1-δ)B(0,1). We let X¯=Conv(X,0),Y¯=Conv(Y,0)X=Conv(X,{0}),Y=Conv(Y,{0}), and aim to show that X¯+Y¯2⊆(1−δ)B(0,1)X+Y/2⊆(1-δ)B(0,1). Let x∈X,y∈Y,α,β∈[0,1],x¯=αx,y¯=αy,y,α,β∈[0,1],x̅=,y̅=. The argument below will be symmetric in x¯,y¯x̅,y̅, so we assume without loss of generality that α≥βα≥β and set γ=β/α≤1γ=β/α≤1. Then, x¯+y¯2=αx+βy2=αx+γy2=α(γx+y2+(1−γ)x2)=αγx+y2+α(1−γ)x2x̅+y̅/2=+/2=αx+/2=α(γx+y/2+(1-γ)x/2)=αγx+y/2+α(1-γ)x/2. This implies that x¯+y¯2∈αγ(1−δ)B+α(1−γ)(1−δ)B=α(1−δ)B⊆(1−δ)Bx̅+y̅/2∈αγ(1-δ)B+α(1-γ)(1-δ)B=α(1-δ)B⊆(1-δ)B. (Using that for any convex body K and γ∈[0,1]γ∈[0,1], γK+(1−γ)K=K+(1-γ)K=K.) Thus, we know that X¯+Y¯2⊆(1−δ)B(0,1)X+Y/2⊆(1-δ)B(0,1), so μ(X¯+Y¯2)≤(1−δ)nμ(B(0,1))μ(X+Y/2)≤(1-δ)^nμ(B(0,1)). We apply the multiplicative form of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality to lower bound the first term by μ(X¯)μ(Y¯)√(μ(X̅)μ(Y̅)), giving us (1−δ)nμ(B)≥μ(X¯)1/2μ(Y¯)1/2(1-δ)^nμ(B)≥μ(X̅)^1/2μ(Y̅)^1/2. 1−ν(Xϵ)ν(S)=ν(Y)ν(S)=μ(Y¯)μ(B)≤(1−δ)2nμ(B)μ(X¯)≤(1−δ)2nν(S)ν(X)≤e−2nδν(S)ν(X)=e−nϵ2/4ν(S)ν(X)1-ν(X_ϵ)/ν(S)=ν(Y)/ν(S)=μ(Y̅)/μ(B)≤(1-δ)^2nμ(B)/μ(X̅)≤(1-δ)^2nν(S)/ν(X)^-2nδν(S)/ν(X)=e^-nϵ^2/4ν(S)/ν(X). QED Version of this result hold also for so-called strictly convex surfaces, where the result depends on the modulus of convexity. However, the notion of surface area requires modification, see: the aforementioned notes on concentration of measure from Barvinok.
