Statement: Let n ≥ 1 and let μ denote the Lebesgue measure on Rn. Let A and B be two nonempty compact subsets of Rn. Then the following inequality holds: [μ(A+B)]1/n≥[μ(A)]1/n+[μ(B)]1/n,[μ(A+B)]^1/n≥[μ(A)]^1/n+[μ(B)]^1/n, where A + B denotes the Minkowski sum: A+B:=a+b∈Rn∣a∈A,b∈B.+B:={ a+b∈ℝ^n, }. The theorem is also true in the setting where A,B,A+B,B,A+B are only assumed to be measurable and non-empty.[1] Multiplicative
