theorem): Consider a convex body K⊆Rn⊆ℝ^n. Let K(x)=K∩x1=x(x)=K∩{x_1=x} be vertical slices of K. Define r(x)=μ(K(x))1n−1(x)=μ(K(x))^1/n-1 to be the radius function; if the slices of K are discs, then r(x) gives the radius of the disc K(x), up to a constant. For more general bodies this radius function does not appear to have a completely clear geometric interpretation beyond being the radius of the disc obtained by packing the volume of the slice as close to the origin as possible; in the case when K(x) is not a disc, the example of a hypercube shows that the average distance to the center of mass can be much larger than r(x). We note that sometimes in the context of a convex geometry, the radius function has a different meaning, here we follow the terminology of this lecture. By convexity of K, we have that K(λx+(1−λ)y)⊇λK(x)+(1−λ)K(y)(+(1-λ)y)⊇(x)+(1-λ)K(y). Applying the Brunn–Minkowski inequality gives r(K(λx+(1−λ)y))≥λr(K(x))+(1−λ)r(K(y))(K(+(1-λ)y))≥(K(x))+(1-λ)r(K(y)), provided K(x)≠∅,K(y)≠∅(x)≠∅,K(y)≠∅. This shows that the radius function is concave on its support, matching the intuition that a convex body does not dip into itself along any direction. This result is sometimes known as Brunn's theorem. Brunn–Minkowski symmetrization of a convex
