loose: The left-hand side of the BM inequality can in general be much larger than the right side. For instance, we can take X to be the x-axis, and Y the y-axis inside the plane; then each has measure zero but the sum has infinite measure. Another example is given by the Cantor set. If C denotes the middle third Cantor set, then it is an exercise in analysis to show that C+C=[0,2]+C=[0,2]. Connections to other parts of
