volumes: The Brunn–Minkowski inequality can be used to deduce the following inequality V(K,…,K,L)n≥V(K)n−1V(L)(K,…,K,L)^n(K)^n-1V(L), where the V(K,…,K,L)(K,…,K,L) term is a mixed-volume. Equality holds iff K,L are homothetic. (See theorem 3.4.3 in Hug and Weil's course on convex geometry.) Proof We recall the following facts about mixed volumes : μ(λ1K1+λ2K2)=∑j1,…,jn=1rV(Kj1,…,V(Kjn)λj1…λjnμ(λ_1K_1+λ_2K_2)=∑_j_1,…,j_n=1^rV(K_j_1,…,V(K_j_n)λ_j_1…λ_j_n, so that in particular if g(t)=μ(K+tL)=μ(V)+nV(K,…,K,L)t+…(t)=μ(K+tL)=μ(V)+nV(K,…,K,L)t+…, then g′(0)=nV(K,…,K,L)'(0)=nV(K,…,K,L). Let f(t):=μ(K+tL)1/n(t):=μ(K+tL)^1/n. Brunn's theorem implies that this is concave for t∈[0,1]∈[0,1]. Thus, f+(0)≥f(1)−f(0)=μ(K+L)1/n−V(K)1/n^+(0)(1)-f(0)=μ(K+L)^1/n-V(K)^1/n, where f+(0)^+(0) denotes the right derivative. We also have that f+(0)=1nμ(K)n−1nnV(K,…,K,L)^+(0)=1/nμ(K)^n-1/nnV(K,…,K,L). From this we get μ(K)n−1nV(K,…,K,L)≥μ(K+L)1/n−V(K)1/n≥V(L)1/nμ(K)^n-1/nV(K,…,K,L)≥μ(K+L)^1/n-V(K)^1/n(L)^1/n, where we applied BM in the last inequality.
