theorem: Theorem (Grunbaum's theorem[citation needed]): Consider a convex body K⊆Rn⊆ℝ^n. Let H be any half-space containing the center of mass of K; that is, the expected location of a uniform point sampled from K.. Then μ(H∩K)≥(nn+1)nμ(K)≥1eμ(K)μ(H)≥(n/n+1)^nμ(K)≥1/eμ(K). Grunbaum's theorem can be proven using Brunn–Minkowski inequality, specifically the convexity of the Brunn–Minkowski symmetrization[citation needed]. See these lecture notes for a proof sketch. Grunbaum's inequality has the following fair cake cutting interpretation. Suppose two players are playing a game of cutting up an n dimensional, convex cake. Player 1 chooses a point in the cake, and player two chooses a hyperplane to cut the cake along. Player 1 then receives the cut of the cake containing his point. Grunbaum's theorem implies that if player 1 chooses the center of mass, then the worst that an adversarial player 2 can do is give him a piece of cake with volume at least a 1/e1/e fraction of the total. In dimensions 2 and 3, the most common dimensions for cakes, the bounds given by the theorem are approximately .444,.42.444,.42 respectively. Note, however, that in n dimensions, calculating the centroid is #P#P hard[citation needed], limiting the usefulness of this cake cutting strategy for higher dimensional, but computationally bounded creatures. Applications of Grunbaum's theorem also appear in convex optimization, specifically in analyzing the converge of the center of gravity method. See theorem 2.1 in these notes. Isoperimetric
