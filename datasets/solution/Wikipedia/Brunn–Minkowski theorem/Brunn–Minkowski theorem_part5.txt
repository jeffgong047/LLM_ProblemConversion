Measurability: It is possible for A,B,B to be Lebesgue measurable and A+B+B to not be; a counter example can be found in "Measure zero sets with non-measurable sum." On the other hand, if A,B,B are Borel measurable, then A+B+B is the continuous image of the Borel set A×B, so analytic and thus measurable. See the discussion in Gardner's survey for more on this, as well as ways to avoid measurability hypothesis. We note that in the case that A and B are compact, so is A + B, being the image of the compact set A×B under the continuous addition map : +:Rn×Rn→Rn+:ℝ^n×ℝ^n→ℝ^n, so the measurability conditions are easy to verify.
