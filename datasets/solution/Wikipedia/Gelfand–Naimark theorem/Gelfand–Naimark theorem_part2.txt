Details: The Gelfand–Naimark representation π is the direct sum of representations πf of A where f ranges over the set of pure states of A and πf is the irreducible representation associated to f by the GNS construction. Thus the Gelfand–Naimark representation acts on the Hilbert direct sum of the Hilbert spaces Hf by π(x)[⨁fHf]=⨁fπf(x)Hf.π(x)[⊕_fH_f]=⊕_fπ_f(x)H_f. π(x) is a bounded linear operator since it is the direct sum of a family of operators, each one having norm ≤ ||x||. Theorem. The Gelfand–Naimark representation of a C*-algebra is an isometric *-representation. It suffices to show the map π is injective, since for *-morphisms of C*-algebras injective implies isometric. Let x be a non-zero element of A. By the Krein extension theorem for positive linear functionals, there is a state f on A such that f(z) ≥ 0 for all non-negative z in A and f(−x* x) < 0. Consider the GNS representation πf with cyclic vector ξ. Since ‖πf(x)ξ‖2=⟨πf(x)ξ∣πf(x)ξ⟩=⟨ξ∣πf(x∗)πf(x)ξ⟩=⟨ξ∣πf(x∗x)ξ⟩=f(x∗x)>0,π_f(x)ξ^2 =⟨π_f(x)ξ|π_f(x)ξ⟩=⟨ξ|π_f(x^*)π_f(x)ξ⟩ =⟨ξ|π_f(x^*x)ξ⟩=f(x^*x)>0, it follows that πf (x) ≠ 0, so π (x) ≠ 0, so π is injective. The construction of Gelfand–Naimark representation depends only on the GNS construction and therefore it is meaningful for any Banach *-algebra A having an approximate identity. In general (when A is not a C*-algebra) it will not be a faithful representation. The closure of the image of π(A) will be a C*-algebra of operators called the C*-enveloping algebra of A. Equivalently, we can define the C*-enveloping algebra as follows: Define a real valued function on A by ‖x‖C∗=supff(x∗x)x_C^*=sup_f√(f(x^*x)) as f ranges over pure states of A. This is a semi-norm, which we refer to as the C* semi-norm of A. The set I of elements of A whose semi-norm is 0 forms a two sided-ideal in A closed under involution. Thus the quotient vector space A / I is an involutive algebra and the norm ‖⋅‖C∗·_C^* factors through a norm on A / I, which except for completeness, is a C* norm on A / I (these are sometimes called pre-C*-norms). Taking the completion of A / I relative to this pre-C*-norm produces a C*-algebra B. By the Krein–Milman theorem one can show without too much difficulty that for x an element of the Banach *-algebra A having an approximate identity: supf∈State⁡(A)f(x∗x)=supf∈PureState⁡(A)f(x∗x).sup_f∈State(A)f(x^*x)=sup_f∈PureState(A)f(x^*x). It follows that an equivalent form for the C* norm on A is to take the above supremum over all states. The universal construction is also used to define universal C*-algebras of isometries. Remark. The Gelfand representation or Gelfand isomorphism for a commutative C*-algebra with unit A is an isometric *-isomorphism from A to the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the space of multiplicative linear functionals, which in the commutative case are precisely the pure states, of A with the weak* topology.
