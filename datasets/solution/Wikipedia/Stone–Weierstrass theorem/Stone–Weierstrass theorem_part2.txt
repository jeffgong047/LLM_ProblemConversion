theorem: The statement of the approximation theorem as originally discovered by Weierstrass is as follows: Weierstrass approximation theorem — Suppose f is a continuous real-valued function defined on the real interval [a, b]. For every ε > 0, there exists a polynomial p such that for all x in [a, b], we have |f(x) − p(x)| < ε, or equivalently, the supremum norm ||f − p|| < ε. A constructive proof of this theorem using Bernstein polynomials is outlined on that page.
