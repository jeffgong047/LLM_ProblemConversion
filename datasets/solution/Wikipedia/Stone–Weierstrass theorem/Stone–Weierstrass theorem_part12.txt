theorem: Nachbin's theorem gives an analog for Stone–Weierstrass theorem for algebras of complex valued smooth functions on a smooth manifold.[7] Nachbin's theorem is as follows:[8] Nachbin's theorem — Let A be a subalgebra of the algebra C∞(M) of smooth functions on a finite dimensional smooth manifold M. Suppose that A separates the points of M and also separates the tangent vectors of M: for each point m ∈ M and tangent vector v at the tangent space at m, there is a f ∈ A such that df(x)(v) ≠ 0. Then A is dense in C∞(M). Editorial
