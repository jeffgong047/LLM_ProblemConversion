versions: Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Stone's original proof of the theorem used the idea of lattices in C(X, R). A subset L of C(X, R) is called a lattice if for any two elements f, g ∈ L, the functions max{ f, g}, min{ f, g} also belong to L. The lattice version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem states: Stone–Weierstrass theorem (lattices) — Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and L is a lattice in C(X, R) with the property that for any two distinct elements x and y of X and any two real numbers a and b there exists an element f ∈ L with f (x) = a and f (y) = b. Then L is dense in C(X, R). The above versions of Stone–Weierstrass can be proven from this version once one realizes that the lattice property can also be formulated using the absolute value | f | which in turn can be approximated by polynomials in f . A variant of the theorem applies to linear subspaces of C(X, R) closed under max:[5] Stone–Weierstrass theorem (max-closed) — Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space and B is a family of functions in C(X, R) such that B separates points. B contains the constant function 1. If f ∈ B then af ∈ B for all constants a ∈ R. If f, g ∈ B, then f + g, max{ f, g} ∈ B. Then B is dense in C(X, R). More precise information is available: Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and L is a lattice in C(X, R). The function φ ∈ C(X, R) belongs to the closure of L if and only if for each pair of distinct points x and y in X and for each ε > 0 there exists some f ∈ L for which | f (x) − φ(x)| < ε and | f (y) − φ(y)| < ε.
