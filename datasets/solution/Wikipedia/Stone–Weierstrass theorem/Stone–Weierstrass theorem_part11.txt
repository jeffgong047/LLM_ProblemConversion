theorem: Another generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is due to Errett Bishop. Bishop's theorem is as follows:[6] Bishop's theorem — Let A be a closed subalgebra of the complex Banach algebra C(X, C) of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space X, using the supremum norm. For S ⊂ X we write AS = {g|S : g ∈ A}. Suppose that f ∈ C(X, C) has the following property: f |S ∈ AS for every maximal set S ⊂ X such that all real functions of AS are constant. Then f ∈ A. Glicksberg (1962) gives a short proof of Bishop's theorem using the Krein–Milman theorem in an essential way, as well as the Hahn–Banach theorem: the process of Louis de Branges (1959).
