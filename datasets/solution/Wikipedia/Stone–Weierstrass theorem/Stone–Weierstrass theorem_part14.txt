also: Müntz–Szász theorem Bernstein polynomial Runge's phenomenon shows that finding a polynomial P such that f (x) = P(x) for some finely spaced x = xn is a bad way to attempt to find a polynomial approximating f uniformly. A better approach, explained e.g. in Rudin (1976), p. 160, eq. (51) ff., is to construct polynomials P uniformly approximating f by taking the convolution of f with a family of suitably chosen polynomial kernels.
