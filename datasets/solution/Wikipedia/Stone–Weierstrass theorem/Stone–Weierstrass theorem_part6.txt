Applications: The Stone–Weierstrass theorem can be used to prove the following two statements, which go beyond Weierstrass's result. If f is a continuous real-valued function defined on the set [a, b] × [c, d] and ε > 0, then there exists a polynomial function p in two variables such that | f (x, y) − p(x, y) | < ε for all x in [a, b] and y in [c, d].[citation needed] If X and Y are two compact Hausdorff spaces and f : X × Y → R is a continuous function, then for every ε > 0 there exist n > 0 and continuous functions f1, ..., fn on X and continuous functions g1, ..., gn on Y such that || f − Σ fi gi || < ε.[citation needed] The theorem has many other applications to analysis, including: Fourier series: The set of linear combinations of functions en(x) = e2πinx, n ∈ Z is dense in C([0, 1]/{0, 1}), where we identify the endpoints of the interval [0, 1] to obtain a circle. An important consequence of this is that the en are an orthonormal basis of the space L2([0, 1]) of square-integrable functions on [0, 1]. Stone–Weierstrass theorem, complex
