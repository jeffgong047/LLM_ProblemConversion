version: Following Holladay (1957), consider the algebra C(X, H) of quaternion-valued continuous functions on the compact space X, again with the topology of uniform convergence. If a quaternion q is written in the form q=a+ib+jc+kd=a+ib+jc+kd its scalar part a is the real number q−iqi−jqj−kqk4q-iqi-jqj-kqk/4. Likewise the scalar part of −qi is b which is the real number −qi−iq+jqk−kqj4-qi-iq+jqk-kqj/4. the scalar part of −qj is c which is the real number −qj−iqk−jq+kqi4-qj-iqk-jq+kqi/4. the scalar part of −qk is d which is the real number −qk+iqj−jqk−kq4-qk+iqj-jqk-kq/4. Then we may state: Stone–Weierstrass theorem (quaternion numbers) — Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space and A is a subalgebra of C(X, H) which contains a non-zero constant function. Then A is dense in C(X, H) if and only if it separates points. Stone–Weierstrass theorem, C*-algebra
