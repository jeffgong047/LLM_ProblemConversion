version: The space of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X i.e. C(X,C)(X,ℂ) is the canonical example of a unital commutative C*-algebra A𝔄. The space X may be viewed as the space of pure states on A𝔄, with the weak-* topology. Following the above cue, a non-commutative extension of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which remains unsolved, is as follows: Conjecture — If a unital C*-algebra A𝔄 has a C*-subalgebra B𝔅 which separates the pure states of A𝔄, then A=B𝔄=𝔅. In 1960, Jim Glimm proved a weaker version of the above conjecture. Stone–Weierstrass theorem (C*-algebras)[4] — If a unital C*-algebra A𝔄 has a C*-subalgebra B𝔅 which separates the pure state space (i.e. the weak-* closure of the pure states) of A𝔄, then A=B𝔄=𝔅.
