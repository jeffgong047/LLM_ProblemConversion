Lemma: If two holomorphic functions f and g on a domain D agree on a set S which has an accumulation point c in D, then f=g=g on a disk in D centered at c. To prove this, it is enough to show that f(n)(c)=g(n)(c)^(n)(c)=g^(n)(c) for all n≥0≥0. If this is not the case, let m be the smallest nonnegative integer with f(m)(c)≠g(m)(c)^(m)(c)^(m)(c). By holomorphy, we have the following Taylor series representation in some open neighborhood U of c: (f−g)(z)=(z−c)m⋅[(f−g)(m)(c)m!+(z−c)⋅(f−g)(m+1)(c)(m+1)!+⋯]=(z−c)m⋅h(z).(f-g)(z) =(z-c)^m·[(f-g)^(m)(c)/m!+(z-c)·(f-g)^(m+1)(c)/(m+1)!+⋯] =(z-c)^m(z). By continuity, h is non-zero in some small open disk B around c. But then f−g≠0-g≠0 on the punctured set B−c-{c}. This contradicts the assumption that c is an accumulation point of f=g{f=g}. This lemma shows that for a complex number a∈C∈ℂ, the fiber f−1(a)^-1(a) is a discrete (and therefore countable) set, unless f≡a.
