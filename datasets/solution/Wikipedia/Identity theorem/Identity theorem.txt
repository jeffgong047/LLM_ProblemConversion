Theorem on the equality of analytic functions
In real analysis and complex analysis, branches of mathematics, the identity theorem for analytic functions states: given functions f and g analytic on a domain D (open and connected subset of Rℝ or Cℂ), if f = g on some S⊆D, where S has an accumulation point in D, then f = g on D.[1]
Thus an analytic function is completely determined by its values on a single open neighborhood in D, or even a countable subset of D (provided this contains a converging sequence together with its limit). This is not true in general for real-differentiable functions, even infinitely real-differentiable functions. In comparison, analytic functions are a much more rigid notion. Informally, one sometimes summarizes the theorem by saying analytic functions are "hard" (as opposed to, say, continuous functions which are "soft").
The underpinning fact from which the theorem is established is the expandability of a holomorphic function into its Taylor series.
The connectedness assumption on the domain D is necessary. For example, if D consists of two disjoint open sets, f can be 00 on one open set, and 11 on another, while g is 00 on one, and 22 on another.


Lemma[edit]
If two holomorphic functions f and g on a domain D agree on a set S which has an accumulation point c in D, then f=g=g on a disk in D centered at c.
To prove this, it is enough to show that f(n)(c)=g(n)(c)^(n)(c)=g^(n)(c) for all n≥0≥0. 
If this is not the case, let m be the smallest nonnegative integer with f(m)(c)≠g(m)(c)^(m)(c)^(m)(c). By holomorphy, we have the following Taylor series representation in some open neighborhood U of c:

(f−g)(z)=(z−c)m⋅[(f−g)(m)(c)m!+(z−c)⋅(f−g)(m+1)(c)(m+1)!+⋯]=(z−c)m⋅h(z).(f-g)(z)   =(z-c)^m·[(f-g)^(m)(c)/m!+(z-c)·(f-g)^(m+1)(c)/(m+1)!+⋯]
   =(z-c)^m(z).
By continuity, h is non-zero in some small open disk B around c. But then f−g≠0-g≠0 on the punctured set B−c-{c}. This contradicts the assumption that c is an accumulation point of f=g{f=g}.
This lemma shows that for a complex number a∈C∈ℂ, the fiber f−1(a)^-1(a)  is a discrete (and therefore countable) set, unless f≡a.

Proof[edit]
Define the set on which f and g have the same Taylor expansion:
S=z∈D∣f(k)(z)=g(k)(z)forallk≥0=⋂k=0∞z∈D∣(f(k)−g(k))(z)=0.={z^(k)(z)=g^(k)(z)forallk≥0}=⋂_k=0^∞{z|(f^(k)-g^(k))(z)=0}.
We'll show S is nonempty, open, and closed. Then by connectedness of D, S must be all of D, which implies f=g=g on S=D=D.
By the lemma, f=g=g in a disk centered at c in D, they have the same Taylor series at c, so c∈S, S is nonempty.
As f and g are holomorphic on D, ∀w∈S, the Taylor series of f and g at w have non-zero radius of convergence. Therefore, the open disk Br(w)_r(w) also lies in S for some r. So S is open.
By holomorphy of f and g, they have holomorphic derivatives, so all f(n),g(n)^(n),g^(n) are continuous. This means that z∈D∣(f(k)−g(k))(z)=0{z|(f^(k)-g^(k))(z)=0} is closed for all k. S is an intersection of closed sets, so it's closed.

Full characterisation[edit]
Since the Identity Theorem is concerned with the equality of two holomorphic functions, we can simply consider the difference (which remains holomorphic) and can simply characterise when a holomorphic function is identically 00. The following result can be found in.[2]

Claim[edit]
Let G⊆C⊆ℂ denote a non-empty, connected open subset of the complex plane.
For h:G→C:G→ℂ the following are equivalent.

h≡0≡0 on G;
the set G0=z∈G∣h(z)=0_0={z(z)=0} contains an accumulation point, z0_0;
the set G∗=⋂n∈N0Gn_∗=⋂_n∈ℕ_0G_n is non-empty, where Gn:=z∈G∣h(n)(z)=0_n:={z^(n)(z)=0}.
Proof[edit]
The directions (1 ⇒⇒ 2) and (1 ⇒⇒ 3) hold trivially.
For (3 ⇒⇒ 1), by connectedness of G it suffices to prove that the non-empty subset, G∗⊆G_∗, is clopen (since a topological space is connected if and only if it has no proper clopen subsets).
Since holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable, i.e. h∈C∞(G)^∞(G), it is clear that G∗_∗ is closed. To show openness, consider some u∈G∗_∗.
Consider an open ball U⊆G containing u, in which h has a convergent Taylor-series expansion centered on u.
By virtue of u∈G∗_∗, all coefficients of this series are 00, whence h≡0≡0 on U.
It follows that all n-th derivatives of h are 00 on U, whence U⊆G∗_∗.
So each u∈G∗_∗ lies in the interior of G∗_∗.
Towards (2 ⇒⇒ 3), fix an accumulation point z0∈G0_0_0.
We now prove directly by induction that z0∈Gn_0_n for each n∈N0∈ℕ_0.
To this end let r∈(0,∞)∈(0,∞) be strictly smaller than the convergence radius of the power series expansion of h around z0_0, given by ∑k∈N0h(k)(z0)k!(z−z0)k∑_k∈ℕ_0h^(k)(z_0)/k!(z-z_0)^k. Fix now some n≥0≥0 and assume that z0∈Gk_0_k for all k<n<n. Then for z∈B¯r(z0)∖z0∈B̅_r(z_0)∖{z_0} manipulation of the power series expansion yields



h(n)(z0)=n!h(z)(z−z0)n−(z−z0)n!∑k=n+1∞h(k)(z0)k!(z−z0)k−(n+1)⏟=:R(z).^(n)(z_0)=n!h(z)/(z-z_0)^n-(z-z_0)n!∑_k=n+1^∞h^(k)(z_0)/k!(z-z_0)^k-(n+1)_=:R(z).

Note that, since r is smaller than radius of the power series, one can readily derive that the power series R(⋅)(·) is continuous and thus bounded on B¯r(z0)B̅_r(z_0).
Now, since z0_0 is an accumulation point in G0_0, there is a sequence of points (z(i))i⊆G0∩Br(z0)∖z0(z^(i))_i_0_r(z_0)∖{z_0} convergent to z0_0.
Since h≡0≡0 on G0_0 and since each z(i)∈G0∩Br(z0)∖z0^(i)_0_r(z_0)∖{z_0}, the expression in (1) yields



h(n)(z0)=n!h(z(i))(z(i)−z0)n−(z(i)−z0)R(z(i))=0−(z(i)−z0)⏟⟶i0R(z(i)).^(n)(z_0)=n!h(z^(i))/(z^(i)-z_0)^n-(z^(i)-z_0)R(z^(i))=0-(z^(i)-z_0)_⟶_i0R(z^(i)).





 

 

 



 



(2)

By the boundedness of R(⋅)(·) on B¯r(z0)B̅_r(z_0),
it follows that h(n)(z0)=0^(n)(z_0)=0, whence z0∈Gn_0_n.
Via induction the claim holds.
