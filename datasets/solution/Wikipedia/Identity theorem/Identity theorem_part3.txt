Proof: Define the set on which f and g have the same Taylor expansion: S=z∈D∣f(k)(z)=g(k)(z)forallk≥0=⋂k=0∞z∈D∣(f(k)−g(k))(z)=0.={z^(k)(z)=g^(k)(z)forallk≥0}=⋂_k=0^∞{z|(f^(k)-g^(k))(z)=0}. We'll show S is nonempty, open, and closed. Then by connectedness of D, S must be all of D, which implies f=g=g on S=D=D. By the lemma, f=g=g in a disk centered at c in D, they have the same Taylor series at c, so c∈S, S is nonempty. As f and g are holomorphic on D, ∀w∈S, the Taylor series of f and g at w have non-zero radius of convergence. Therefore, the open disk Br(w)_r(w) also lies in S for some r. So S is open. By holomorphy of f and g, they have holomorphic derivatives, so all f(n),g(n)^(n),g^(n) are continuous. This means that z∈D∣(f(k)−g(k))(z)=0{z|(f^(k)-g^(k))(z)=0} is closed for all k. S is an intersection of closed sets, so it's closed. Full
