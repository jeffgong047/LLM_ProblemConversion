Proof: The directions (1 ⇒⇒ 2) and (1 ⇒⇒ 3) hold trivially. For (3 ⇒⇒ 1), by connectedness of G it suffices to prove that the non-empty subset, G∗⊆G_∗, is clopen (since a topological space is connected if and only if it has no proper clopen subsets). Since holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable, i.e. h∈C∞(G)^∞(G), it is clear that G∗_∗ is closed. To show openness, consider some u∈G∗_∗. Consider an open ball U⊆G containing u, in which h has a convergent Taylor-series expansion centered on u. By virtue of u∈G∗_∗, all coefficients of this series are 00, whence h≡0≡0 on U. It follows that all n-th derivatives of h are 00 on U, whence U⊆G∗_∗. So each u∈G∗_∗ lies in the interior of G∗_∗. Towards (2 ⇒⇒ 3), fix an accumulation point z0∈G0_0_0. We now prove directly by induction that z0∈Gn_0_n for each n∈N0∈ℕ_0. To this end let r∈(0,∞)∈(0,∞) be strictly smaller than the convergence radius of the power series expansion of h around z0_0, given by ∑k∈N0h(k)(z0)k!(z−z0)k∑_k∈ℕ_0h^(k)(z_0)/k!(z-z_0)^k. Fix now some n≥0≥0 and assume that z0∈Gk_0_k for all k<n<n. Then for z∈B¯r(z0)∖z0∈B̅_r(z_0)∖{z_0} manipulation of the power series expansion yields h(n)(z0)=n!h(z)(z−z0)n−(z−z0)n!∑k=n+1∞h(k)(z0)k!(z−z0)k−(n+1)⏟=:R(z).^(n)(z_0)=n!h(z)/(z-z_0)^n-(z-z_0)n!∑_k=n+1^∞h^(k)(z_0)/k!(z-z_0)^k-(n+1)_=:R(z). (1) Note that, since r is smaller than radius of the power series, one can readily derive that the power series R(⋅)(·) is continuous and thus bounded on B¯r(z0)B̅_r(z_0). Now, since z0_0 is an accumulation point in G0_0, there is a sequence of points (z(i))i⊆G0∩Br(z0)∖z0(z^(i))_i_0_r(z_0)∖{z_0} convergent to z0_0. Since h≡0≡0 on G0_0 and since each z(i)∈G0∩Br(z0)∖z0^(i)_0_r(z_0)∖{z_0}, the expression in (1) yields h(n)(z0)=n!h(z(i))(z(i)−z0)n−(z(i)−z0)R(z(i))=0−(z(i)−z0)⏟⟶i0R(z(i)).^(n)(z_0)=n!h(z^(i))/(z^(i)-z_0)^n-(z^(i)-z_0)R(z^(i))=0-(z^(i)-z_0)_⟶_i0R(z^(i)). (2) By the boundedness of R(⋅)(·) on B¯r(z0)B̅_r(z_0), it follows that h(n)(z0)=0^(n)(z_0)=0, whence z0∈Gn_0_n. Via induction the claim holds. Q.E.D. See
