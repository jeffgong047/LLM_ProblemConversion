Examples: The action of the symmetric group of X is transitive, in fact n-transitive for any n up to the cardinality of X. If X has cardinality n,, the action of the alternating group is (n−2)(n-2)-transitive but not (n−1)(n-1)-transitive. The action of the general linear group of a vector space V on the set V∖0∖{0} of non-zero vectors is transitive, but not 2-transitive (similarly for the action of the special linear group if the dimension of v is at least 2). The action of the orthogonal group of a Euclidean space is not transitive on nonzero vectors but it is on the unit sphere. Primitive
