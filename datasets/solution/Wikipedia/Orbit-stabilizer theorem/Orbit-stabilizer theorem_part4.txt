action: Likewise, a right group action of G on X is a function α:X×G→X,α, that satisfies the analogous axioms:[3] Identity: α(x,e)=xα(x,e)=x Compatibility: α(α(x,g),h)=α(x,gh)α(α(x,g),h)=α(x,gh) (with α(x, g) often shortened to xg or x ⋅ g when the action being considered is clear from context) Identity: x⋅e=x=x Compatibility: (x⋅g)⋅h=x⋅(gh)(x)=x·(gh) for all g and h in G and all x in X. The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product gh acts on x. For a left action, h acts first, followed by g second. For a right action, g acts first, followed by h second. Because of the formula (gh)−1 = h−1g−1, a left action can be constructed from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X can be considered as a left action of its opposite group Gop on X. Thus, for establishing general properties of group actions, it suffices to consider only left actions. However, there are cases where this is not possible. For example, the multiplication of a group induces both a left action and a right action on the group itself—multiplication on the left and on the right, respectively. Notable properties of
