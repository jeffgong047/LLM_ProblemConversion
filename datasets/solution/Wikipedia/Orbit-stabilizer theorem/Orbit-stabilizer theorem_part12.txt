stabilizers: In the compound of five tetrahedra, the symmetry group is the (rotational) icosahedral group I of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) tetrahedral group T of order 12, and the orbit space I/T (of order 60/12 = 5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra – the coset gT corresponds to the tetrahedron to which g sends the chosen tetrahedron. Consider a group G acting on a set X. The orbit of an element x in X is the set of elements in X to which x can be moved by the elements of G. The orbit of x is denoted by G⋅x: G⋅x=g⋅x:g∈G.={g:g}. The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points x in) X under the action of G form a partition of X. The associated equivalence relation is defined by saying x∼y if and only if there exists a g in G with g⋅x=y.=y. The orbits are then the equivalence classes under this relation; two elements x and y are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same, that is, G⋅x=G⋅y.=G. The group action is transitive if and only if it has exactly one orbit, that is, if there exists x in X with G⋅x=X.=X. This is the case if and only if G⋅x=X=X for all x in X (given that X is non-empty). The set of all orbits of X under the action of G is written as X/G/G (or, less frequently, as G∖X), and is called the quotient of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the orbit space, while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of coinvariants, and written XG,_G, by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted XG^G: the coinvariants are a quotient while the invariants are a subset. The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in group cohomology and group homology, which use the same superscript/subscript convention. Invariant
