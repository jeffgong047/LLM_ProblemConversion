subsets: If Y is a subset of X, then G⋅Y denotes the set g⋅y:g∈Gandy∈Y.{g:gandy}. The subset Y is said to be invariant under G if G⋅Y=Y=Y (which is equivalent to G⋅Y⊆Y). In that case, G also operates on Y by restricting the action to Y. The subset Y is called fixed under G if g⋅y=y=y for all g in G and all y in Y. Every subset that is fixed under G is also invariant under G, but not conversely. Every orbit is an invariant subset of X on which G acts transitively. Conversely, any invariant subset of X is a union of orbits. The action of G on X is transitive if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit. A G-invariant element of X is x∈X such that g⋅x=x=x for all g∈G.. The set of all such x is denoted XG^G and called the G-invariants of X. When X is a G-module, XG is the zeroth cohomology group of G with coefficients in X, and the higher cohomology groups are the derived functors of the functor of G-invariants.
