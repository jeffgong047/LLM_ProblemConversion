properties: Assume that X is a topological space and the action of G is by homeomorphisms. The action is wandering if every x∈X has a neighbourhood U such that there are only finitely many g∈G with g⋅U∩U≠∅≠∅.[4] More generally, a point x∈X is called a point of discontinuity for the action of G if there is an open subset U∋x such that there are only finitely many g∈G with g⋅U∩U≠∅≠∅. The domain of discontinuity of the action is the set of all points of discontinuity. Equivalently it is the largest G-stable open subset Ω⊂XΩ such that the action of G on ΩΩ is wandering.[5] In a dynamical context this is also called wandering set. The action is properly discontinuous if for every compact subset K⊂X there are finitely many g∈G such that g⋅K∩K≠∅≠∅. This is strictly stronger than wandering; for instance the action of Zℤ on R2∖(0,0)ℝ^2∖{(0,0)} given by n⋅(x,y)=(2nx,2−ny)·(x,y)=(2^nx,2^-ny) is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.[6] The action by deck transformations of the fundamental group of a locally simply connected space on an covering space is wandering and free. Such actions can be characterized by the following property: every x∈X has a neighbourhood U such that g⋅U∩U=∅=∅ for every g∈G∖eG∖{e_G}.[7] Actions with this property are sometimes called freely discontinuous, and the largest subset on which the action is freely discontinuous is then called the free regular set.[8] An action of a group G on a locally compact space X is called cocompact if there exists a compact subset A⊂X such that X=G⋅A=G. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space G∖X. Actions of topological
