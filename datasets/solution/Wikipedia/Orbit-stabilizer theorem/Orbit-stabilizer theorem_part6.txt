properties: The action of G on X is called transitive if for any two points x,y∈X,y there exists a g∈G so that g⋅x=y=y. The action is simply transitive (or sharply transitive, or regular) if it is both transitive and free. This means that given x,y∈X,y the element g in the definition of transitivity is unique. If X is acted upon simply transitively by a group G then it is called a principal homogeneous space for G or a G-torsor. For an integer n≥1≥1, the action is n-transitive if X has at least n elements, and for any pair of n-tuples (x1,…,xn),(y1,…,yn)∈Xn(x_1,…,x_n),(y_1,…,y_n)^n with pairwise distinct entries (that is xi≠xj_i≠x_j, yi≠yj_i≠y_j when i≠j≠j) there exists a g∈G such that g⋅xi=yi_i=y_i for i=1,…,n=1,…,n. In other words the action on the subset of Xn^n of tuples without repeated entries is transitive. For n=2,3=2,3 this is often called double, respectively triple, transitivity. The class of 2-transitive groups (that is, subgroups of a finite symmetric group whose action is 2-transitive) and more generally multiply transitive groups is well-studied in finite group theory. An action is sharply n-transitive when the action on tuples without repeated entries in Xn^n is sharply transitive.
