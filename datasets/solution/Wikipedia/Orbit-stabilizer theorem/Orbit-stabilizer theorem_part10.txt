groups: Main article: Continuous group action Now assume G is a topological group and X a topological space on which it acts by homeomorphisms. The action is said to be continuous if the map G×X→X is continuous for the product topology. The action is said to be proper if the map G×X→X×X defined by (g,x)↦(x,g⋅x)(g,x)↦(x,g) is proper.[9] This means that given compact sets K,K′,K' the set of g∈G such that g⋅K∩K′≠∅'≠∅ is compact. In particular, this is equivalent to proper discontinuity when G is a discrete group. It is said to be locally free if there exists a neighbourhood U of eG_G such that g⋅x≠x≠x for all x∈X and g∈U∖eG∖{e_G}. The action is said to be strongly continuous if the orbital map g↦g⋅x is continuous for every x∈X. Contrary to what the name suggests, this is a weaker property than continuity of the action.[citation needed] If G is a Lie group and X a differentiable manifold, then the subspace of smooth points for the action is the set of points x∈X such that the map g↦g⋅x is smooth. There is a well-developed theory of Lie group actions, i.e. action which are smooth on the whole space. Linear
