subgroups: Given g in G and x in X with g⋅x=x,=x, it is said that "x is a fixed point of g" or that "g fixes x". For every x in X, the stabilizer subgroup of G with respect to x (also called the isotropy group or little group[10]) is the set of all elements in G that fix x: Gx=g∈G:g⋅x=x._x={g:g=x}. This is a subgroup of G, though typically not a normal one. The action of G on X is free if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel N of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, G→Sym⁡(X),→Sym(X), is given by the intersection of the stabilizers Gx for all x in X. If N is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective). Let x and y be two elements in X, and let g be a group element such that y=g⋅x.=g. Then the two stabilizer groups Gx_x and Gy_y are related by Gy=gGxg−1._y=gG_xg^-1. Proof: by definition, h∈Gy_y if and only if h⋅(g⋅x)=g⋅x.·(g)=g. Applying g−1^-1 to both sides of this equality yields (g−1hg)⋅x=x;(g^-1hg)=x; that is, g−1hg∈Gx.^-1hg_x. An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking h∈Gx_x and supposing x=g−1⋅y.=g^-1. The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate to each other. Thus, to each orbit, we can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of G (that is, the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let (H)(H) denote the conjugacy class of H. Then the orbit O has type (H)(H) if the stabilizer Gx_x of some/any x in O belongs to (H)(H). A maximal orbit type is often called a principal orbit type. Orbit-stabilizer theorem and Burnside's
