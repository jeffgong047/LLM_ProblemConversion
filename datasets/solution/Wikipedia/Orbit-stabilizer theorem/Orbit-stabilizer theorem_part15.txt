lemma: Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed x in X, consider the map f:G→X:G given by g↦g⋅x.. By definition the image f(G)(G) of this map is the orbit G⋅x.. The condition for two elements to have the same image is f(g)=f(h)⟺g⋅x=h⋅x⟺g−1h⋅x=x⟺g−1h∈Gx⟺h∈gGx.(g)=f(h)=h^-1h=x^-1h_x_x. In other words, f(g)=f(h)(g)=f(h) if and only if g and h lie in the same coset for the stabilizer subgroup Gx._x. Thus, the fiber f−1(y)^-1({y}) of f over any y in G·x is contained in such a coset, and every such coset also occurs as a fiber. Therefore f induces a bijection between the set G/Gx/G_x of cosets for the stabilizer subgroup and the orbit G⋅x,, which sends gGx↦g⋅x_x.[11] This result is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem. If G is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with Lagrange's theorem, gives |G⋅x|=[G:Gx]=|G|/|Gx|,|G|=[G : G_x]=|G|/|G_x|, in other words the length of the orbit of x times the order of its stabilizer is the order of the group. In particular that implies that the orbit length is a divisor of the group order. Example: Let G be a group of prime order p acting on a set X with k elements. Since each orbit has either 1 or p elements, there are at least kmodpp orbits of length 1 which are G-invariant elements. This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where X is finite as well). Cubical graph with vertices labeled Example: We can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a graph. Consider the cubical graph as pictured, and let G denote its automorphism group. Then G acts on the set of vertices {1, 2, ..., 8}, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, |G|=|G⋅1||G1|=8|G1|.|G|=|G·1||G_1|=8|G_1|. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer G1,_1, we can obtain |G1|=|(G1)⋅2||(G1)2|.|G_1|=|(G_1)·2||(G_1)_2|. Any element of G that fixes 1 must send 2 to either 2, 4, or 5. As an example of such automorphisms consider the rotation around the diagonal axis through 1 and 7 by 2π/32π/3 which permutes 2,4,5 and 3,6,8, and fixes 1 and 7. Thus, |(G1)⋅2|=3.|(G_1)·2|=3. Applying the theorem a third time gives |(G1)2|=|((G1)2)⋅3||((G1)2)3|.|(G_1)_2|=|((G_1)_2)·3||((G_1)_2)_3|. Any element of G that fixes 1 and 2 must send 3 to either 3 or 6. Reflecting the cube at the plane through 1,2,7 and 8 is such an automorphism sending 3 to 6, thus |((G1)2)⋅3|=2|((G_1)_2)·3|=2. One also sees that ((G1)2)3((G_1)_2)_3 consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of G fixing 1, 2 and 3 must also fix all other vertices, since they are determined by their adjacency to 1, 2 and 3. Combining the preceding calculations, we can now obtain |G|=8⋅3⋅2⋅1=48.|G|=8·3·2·1=48. A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is Burnside's lemma: |X/G|=1|G|∑g∈G|Xg|,|X/G|=1/|G|∑_g|X^g|, where Xg is the set of points fixed by g. This result is mainly of use when G and X are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element. Fixing a group G, the set of formal differences of finite G-sets forms a ring called the Burnside ring of G, where addition corresponds to disjoint union, and multiplication to Cartesian product.
