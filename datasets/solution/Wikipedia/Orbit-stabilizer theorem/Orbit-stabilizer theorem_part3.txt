action: If G is a group with identity element e, and X is a set, then a (left) group action α of G on X is a function α:G×X→X,α, that satisfies the following two axioms:[1] Identity: α(e,x)=xα(e,x)=x Compatibility: α(g,α(h,x))=α(gh,x)α(g,α(h,x))=α(gh,x) (with α(g, x) often shortened to gx or g ⋅ x when the action being considered is clear from context): Identity: e⋅x=x=x Compatibility: g⋅(h⋅x)=(gh)⋅x·(h)=(gh) for all g and h in G and all x in X. The group G is said to act on X (from the left). A set X together with an action of G is called a (left) G-set. From these two axioms, it follows that for any fixed g in G, the function from X to itself which maps x to g ⋅ x is a bijection, with inverse bijection the corresponding map for g−1. Therefore, one may equivalently define a group action of G on X as a group homomorphism from G into the symmetric group Sym(X) of all bijections from X to itself.[2] Right group
