actions: Let G be a group acting on a set X. The action is called faithful or effective if g⋅x=x=x for all x∈X implies that g=eG=e_G. Equivalently, the morphism from G to the group of bijections of X corresponding to the action is injective. The action is called free (or semiregular or fixed-point free) if the statement that g⋅x=x=x for some x∈X already implies that g=eG=e_G. In other words, no non-trivial element of G fixes a point of X. This is a much stronger property than faithfulness. For example, the action of any group on itself by left multiplication is free. This observation implies Cayley's theorem that any group can be embedded in a symmetric group (which is infinite when the group is). A finite group may act faithfully on a set of size much smaller than its cardinality (however such an action cannot be free). For instance the abelian 2-group (Z/2Z)n(ℤ/2ℤ)^n (of cardinality 2n2^n) acts faithfully on a set of size 2n2n. This is not always the case, for example the cyclic group Z/2nZℤ/2^nℤ cannot act faithfully on a set of size less than 2n2^n. In general the smallest set on which a faithful action can be defined can vary greatly for groups of the same size. For example, three groups of size 120 are the symmetric group S5_5, the icosahedral group A5×Z/2Z_5×ℤ/2ℤ and the cyclic group Z/120Zℤ/120ℤ. The smallest sets on which faithful actions can be defined for these groups are of size 5, 7, and 16 respectively. Transitivity
