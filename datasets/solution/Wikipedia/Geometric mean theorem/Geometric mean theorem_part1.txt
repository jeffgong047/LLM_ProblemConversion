Theorem about right triangles area of grey square = area of grey rectangle: h2=pq⇔h=pq^2=pq=√(pq) In Euclidean geometry, the right triangle altitude theorem or geometric mean theorem is a relation between the altitude on the hypotenuse in a right triangle and the two line segments it creates on the hypotenuse. It states that the geometric mean of the two segments equals the altitude. Theorem and
