theorem: Proof with the Pythagorean theorem In the setting of the geometric mean theorem there are three right triangles △ABC, △ADC and △DBC in which the Pythagorean theorem yields: h2=a2−q2h2=b2−p2c2=a2+b2h^2 =a^2-q^2 h^2 =b^2-p^2 c^2 =a^2+b^2 Adding the first 2 two equations and then using the third then leads to: 2h2=a2+b2−p2−q2=c2−p2−q2=(p+q)2−p2−q2=2pq∴h2=pq.2h^2 =a^2+b^2-p^2-q^2 =c^2-p^2-q^2 =(p+q)^2-p^2-q^2 =2pq ∴^2 =pq. which finally yields the formula of the geometric mean theorem.[4] Based on dissection and
