similarity: △ABC∼△ADC∼△DBC∼∼ Proof of theorem: The triangles △ADC , △ BCD are similar, since: consider triangles △ABC, △ACD ; here we have ∠ACB=∠ADC=90∘,∠BAC=∠CAD;==90^∘, =; therefore by the AA postulate △ABC∼△ACD.∼. further, consider triangles △ABC, △BCD ; here we have ∠ACB=∠BDC=90∘,∠ABC=∠CBD;==90^∘, =; therefore by the AA postulate △ABC∼△BCD.∼. Therefore, both triangles △ACD, △BCD are similar to △ABC and themselves, i.e. △ACD∼△ABC∼△BCD.∼∼. Because of the similarity we get the following equality of ratios and its algebraic rearrangement yields the theorem:[1] hp=qh⇔h2=pq⇔h=pq(h,p,q>0)h/p=q/h ⇔ h^2=pq ⇔ h=√(pq) (h,p,q>0) Proof of converse: For the converse we have a triangle △ABC in which h2=pq^2=pq holds and need to show that the angle at C is a right angle. Now because of h2=pq^2=pq we also have hp=qh.hp=qh. Together with ∠ADC=∠CDB= the triangles △ADC, △BDC have an angle of equal size and have corresponding pairs of legs with the same ratio. This means the triangles are similar, which yields: ∠ACB=∠ACD+∠DCB=∠ACD+(90∘−∠DBC)=∠ACD+(90∘−∠ACD)=90∘ =+ =+(90^∘-) =+(90^∘-) =90^∘ Based on the Pythagorean
