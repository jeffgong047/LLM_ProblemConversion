coloring: Another application of perfect elimination orderings is finding a maximum clique of a chordal graph in polynomial-time, while the same problem for general graphs is NP-complete. More generally, a chordal graph can have only linearly many maximal cliques, while non-chordal graphs may have exponentially many. This implies that the class of chordal graphs has few cliques. To list all maximal cliques of a chordal graph, simply find a perfect elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex v together with the neighbors of v that are later than v in the perfect elimination ordering, and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal. The clique graphs of chordal graphs are the dually chordal graphs.[6] The largest maximal clique is a maximum clique, and, as chordal graphs are perfect, the size of this clique equals the chromatic number of the chordal graph. Chordal graphs are perfectly orderable: an optimal coloring may be obtained by applying a greedy coloring algorithm to the vertices in the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering.[7] The chromatic polynomial of a chordal graph is easy to compute. Find a perfect elimination ordering v1, v2, …, vn. Let Ni equal the number of neighbors of vi that come after vi in that ordering. For instance, Nn = 0. The chromatic polynomial equals (x−N1)(x−N2)⋯(x−Nn).(x-N_1)(x-N_2)⋯(x-N_n). (The last factor is simply x, so x divides the polynomial, as it should.) Clearly, this computation depends on chordality.[8] Minimal
