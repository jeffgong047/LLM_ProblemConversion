Subclasses: Interval graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees of path graphs, a special case of trees. Therefore, they are a subfamily of chordal graphs. Split graphs are graphs that are both chordal and the complements of chordal graphs. Bender, Richmond & Wormald (1985) showed that, in the limit as n goes to infinity, the fraction of n-vertex chordal graphs that are split approaches one. Ptolemaic graphs are graphs that are both chordal and distance hereditary. Quasi-threshold graphs are a subclass of Ptolemaic graphs that are both chordal and cographs. Block graphs are another subclass of Ptolemaic graphs in which every two maximal cliques have at most one vertex in common. A special type is windmill graphs, where the common vertex is the same for every pair of cliques. Strongly chordal graphs are graphs that are chordal and contain no n-sun (for n â‰¥ 3) as an induced subgraph. Here an n-sun is an n-vertex chordal graph G together with a collection of n degree-two vertices, adjacent to the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle in G. K-trees are chordal graphs in which all maximal cliques and all maximal clique separators have the same size.[10] Apollonian networks are chordal maximal planar graphs, or equivalently planar 3-trees.[10] Maximal outerplanar graphs are a subclass of 2-trees, and therefore are also chordal.
