Overview: The KS theorem explores whether it is possible to embed the set of quantum-mechanical observables into a set of classical quantities, in spite of the fact that all classical quantities are mutually compatible. The first observation made in the Kochen–Specker article is that this is possible in a trivial way, namely, by ignoring the algebraic structure of the set of quantum-mechanical observables. Indeed, let pA(ak) be the probability that observable A has value ak, then the product ΠA pA(ak), taken over all possible observables A, is a valid joint probability distribution, yielding all probabilities of quantum-mechanical observables by taking marginals. Kochen and Specker note that this joint probability distribution is not acceptable, however, since it ignores all correlations between the observables. Thus, in quantum mechanics A2 has value ak2 if A has value ak, implying that the values of A and A2 are highly correlated. More generally, it is required by Kochen and Specker that for an arbitrary function f the value v(f(A))(f(𝐀)) of observable f(A)(𝐀) satisfies v(f(A))=f(v(A)).(f(𝐀))=f(v(𝐀)). If A1 and A2 are compatible (commeasurable) observables, then, by the same token, we should have the following two equalities: v(c1A1+c2A2)=c1v(A1)+c2v(A2),(c_1𝐀_1+c_2𝐀_2)=c_1v(𝐀_1)+c_2v(𝐀_2), c1_1 and c2_2 real, and v(A1A2)=v(A1)v(A2).(𝐀_1𝐀_2)=v(𝐀_1)v(𝐀_2). The first of these is a considerable weakening compared to von Neumann's assumption that this equality should hold independently of whether A1 and A2 are compatible or incompatible. Kochen and Specker were capable of proving that a value assignment is not possible even on the basis of these weaker assumptions. In order to do so, they restricted the observables to a special class, namely, so-called yes–no observables, having only values 0 and 1, corresponding to projection operators on the eigenvectors of certain orthogonal bases of a Hilbert space. As long as the Hilbert space is at least three-dimensional, they were able to find a set of 117 such projection operators, not allowing to attribute to each of them in an unambiguous way either value 0 or 1. Instead of the rather involved proof by Kochen and Specker, it is more illuminating to reproduce here one of the much simpler proofs given much later, which employs a lower number of projection operators, but only proves the theorem when the dimension of the Hilbert space is at least 4. It turns out that it is possible to obtain a similar result on the basis of a set of only 18 projection operators.[13] In order to do so, it is sufficient to realize that if u1, u2, u3 and u4 are the four orthogonal vectors of an orthogonal basis in the four-dimensional Hilbert space, then the projection operators P1, P2, P3, P4 on these vectors are all mutually commuting (and, hence, correspond to compatible observables, allowing a simultaneous attribution of values 0 or 1). Since P1+P2+P3+P4=I,𝐏_1+𝐏_2+𝐏_3+𝐏_4=𝐈, it follows that v(P1+P2+P3+P4)=v(I)=1.(𝐏_1+𝐏_2+𝐏_3+𝐏_4)=v(𝐈)=1. But since v(P1+P2+P3+P4)=v(P1)+v(P2)+v(P3)+v(P4),(𝐏_1+𝐏_2+𝐏_3+𝐏_4)=v(𝐏_1)+v(𝐏_2)+v(𝐏_3)+v(𝐏_4), it follows from v(Pi)(𝐏_i) = 0 or 1, i=1,…,4=1,…,4, that out of the four values v(P1),v(P2),v(P3),v(P4)(𝐏_1),v(𝐏_2),v(𝐏_3),v(𝐏_4) one must be 1, while the other three must be 0. Cabello,[14][15] extending an argument developed by Kernaghan[16] considered 9 orthogonal bases, each basis corresponding to a column of the following table, in which the basis vectors are explicitly displayed. The bases are chosen in such a way that each projector appears in exactly two contexts, thus establishing functional relations between contexts. u1 (0, 0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 0, 1) (1, −1, 1, −1) (1, −1, 1, −1) (0, 0, 1, 0) (1, −1, −1, 1) (1, 1, −1, 1) (1, 1, −1, 1) (1, 1, 1, −1) u2 (0, 0, 1, 0) (0, 1, 0, 0) (1, −1, −1, 1) (1, 1, 1, 1) (0, 1, 0, 0) (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1, −1) (−1, 1, 1, 1) (−1, 1, 1, 1) u3 (1, 1, 0, 0) (1, 0, 1, 0) (1, 1, 0, 0) (1, 0, −1, 0) (1, 0, 0, 1) (1, 0, 0, −1) (1, −1, 0, 0) (1, 0, 1, 0) (1, 0, 0, 1) u4 (1, −1, 0, 0) (1, 0, −1, 0) (0, 0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 0, −1) (1, 0, 0, −1) (0, 1, −1, 0) (0, 0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 0, −1) (0, 1, −1, 0) Now the "no-go" theorem follows by making sure that the following is impossible: to place a value, either a 1 or a 0, into each compartment of the table above in such a way that: (a) the value 1 appears exactly once per column, the other entries in the column being 0; (b) equally colored compartments contain the same value – either both contain 1 or both contain 0. As it happens, all we have to do now is ask the question, how many times should the value 1 appear in the table? On the one hand, (a) implies that 1 should appear 9 times: there are 9 columns and (a) says that 1 should appear exactly once per column. On the other hand, (b) implies that 1 should appear an even number of times: the compartments all come in equally colored pairs, and (b) says that if one member of a pair contains 1, then the other member must contain 1 as well. To repeat, (a) says that 1 appears 9 times, while (b) says that it appears an even number of times. Since 9 is not even, it follows that (a) and (b) are mutually contradictory; no distribution of 1s and 0s into the compartments could possibly satisfy both. The usual proof of Bell's theorem (CHSH inequality) can also be converted into a simple proof of the KS theorem in dimension at least 4. Bell's setup involves four measurements with four outcomes (four pairs of a simultaneous binary measurement in each wing of the experiment) and four with two outcomes (the two binary measurements in each wing of the experiment, unaccompanied), thus 24 projection operators.
