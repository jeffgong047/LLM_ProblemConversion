conjecture: Beyond Gromov's theorem one can ask whether there exists a gap in the growth spectrum for finitely generated group just above polynomial growth, separating virtually nilpotent groups from others. Formally, this means that there would exist a function f:N→N:ℕ→ℕ such that a finitely generated group is virtually nilpotent if and only if its growth function is an O(f(n))(f(n)). Such a theorem was obtained by Shalom and Tao, with an explicit function nlog⁡log⁡(n)c^loglog(n)^c for some c>0>0. All known groups with intermediate growth (i.e. both superpolynomial and subexponential) are essentially generalizations of Grigorchuk's group, and have faster growth functions; so all known groups have growth faster than enα^n^α, with α=log⁡(2)/log⁡(2/η)≈0.767α=log(2)/log(2/η)≈0.767, where ηη is the real root of the polynomial x3+x2+x−2^3+x^2+x-2.[9] It is conjectured that the true lower bound on growth rates of groups with intermediate growth is en^√(n). This is known as the Gap conjecture.[10]
