theorem: In order to prove this theorem Gromov introduced a convergence for metric spaces. This convergence, now called the Gromovâ€“Hausdorff convergence, is currently widely used in geometry. A relatively simple proof of the theorem was found by Bruce Kleiner.[5] Later, Terence Tao and Yehuda Shalom modified Kleiner's proof to make an essentially elementary proof as well as a version of the theorem with explicit bounds.[6][7] Gromov's theorem also follows from the classification of approximate groups obtained by Breuillard, Green and Tao. A simple and concise proof based on functional analytic methods is given by Ozawa.[8] The gap
