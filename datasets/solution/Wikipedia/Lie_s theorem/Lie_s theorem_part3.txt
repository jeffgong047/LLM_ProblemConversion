Proof: The proof is by induction on the dimension of g𝔤 and consists of several steps. (Note: the structure of the proof is very similar to that for Engel's theorem.) The basic case is trivial and we assume the dimension of g𝔤 is positive. We also assume V is not zero. For simplicity, we write X⋅v=π(X)(v)=π(X)(v). Step 1: Observe that the theorem is equivalent to the statement:[3] There exists a vector in V that is an eigenvector for each linear transformation in π(g)π(𝔤). Indeed, the theorem says in particular that a nonzero vector spanning Vn−1_n-1 is a common eigenvector for all the linear transformations in π(g)π(𝔤). Conversely, if v is a common eigenvector, take Vn−1_n-1 to its span and then π(g)π(𝔤) admits a common eigenvector in the quotient V/Vn−1/V_n-1; repeat the argument. Step 2: Find an ideal h𝔥 of codimension one in g𝔤. Let Dg=[g,g]𝔤=[𝔤,𝔤] be the derived algebra. Since g𝔤 is solvable and has positive dimension, Dg≠g𝔤≠𝔤 and so the quotient g/Dg𝔤/D𝔤 is a nonzero abelian Lie algebra, which certainly contains an ideal of codimension one and by the ideal correspondence, it corresponds to an ideal of codimension one in g𝔤. Step 3: There exists some linear functional λλ in h∗𝔥^* such that Vλ=v∈V|X⋅v=λ(X)v,X∈h_λ={v|X=λ(X)v,X∈𝔥} is nonzero. This follows from the inductive hypothesis (it is easy to check that the eigenvalues determine a linear functional). Step 4: Vλ_λ is a g𝔤-invariant subspace. (Note this step proves a general fact and does not involve solvability.) Let Y∈g∈𝔤, v∈Vλ_λ, then we need to prove Y⋅v∈Vλ_λ. If v=0=0 then it's obvious, so assume v≠0≠0 and set recursively v0=v,vi+1=Y⋅vi_0=v, v_i+1=Y_i. Let U=span⁡vi|i≥0=span{v_i|i≥0} and ℓ∈N0ℓ∈ℕ_0 be the largest such that v0,…,vℓ_0,…,v_ℓ are linearly independent. Then we'll prove that they generate U and thus α=(v0,…,vℓ)α=(v_0,…,v_ℓ) is a basis of U. Indeed, assume by contradiction that it's not the case and let m∈N0∈ℕ_0 be the smallest such that vm∉⟨v0,…,vℓ⟩_m∉_0,…,v_ℓ⟩, then obviously m≥ℓ+1≥ℓ+1. Since v0,…,vℓ+1_0,…,v_ℓ+1 are linearly dependent, vℓ+1_ℓ+1 is a linear combination of v0,…,vℓ_0,…,v_ℓ. Applying the map Ym−ℓ−1^m-ℓ-1 it follows that vm_m is a linear combination of vm−ℓ−1,…,vm−1_m-ℓ-1,…,v_m-1. Since by the minimality of m each of these vectors is a linear combination of v0,…,vℓ_0,…,v_ℓ, so is vm_m, and we get the desired contradiction. We'll prove by induction that for every n∈N0∈ℕ_0 and X∈h∈𝔥 there exist elements a0,n,X,…,an,n,X_0,n,X,…,a_n,n,X of the base field such that an,n,X=λ(X)_n,n,X=λ(X) and X⋅vn=∑i=0nai,n,Xvi._n=∑_i=0^na_i,n,Xv_i. The n=0=0 case is straightforward since X⋅v0=λ(X)v0_0=λ(X)v_0. Now assume that we have proved the claim for some n∈N0∈ℕ_0 and all elements of h𝔥 and let X∈h∈𝔥. Since h𝔥 is an ideal, it's [X,Y]∈h[X,Y]∈𝔥, and thus X⋅vn+1=Y⋅(X⋅vn)+[X,Y]⋅vn=Y⋅∑i=0nai,n,Xvi+∑i=0nai,n,[X,Y]vi=a0,n,[X,Y]v0+∑i=1n(ai−1,n,X+ai,n,[X,Y])vi+λ(X)vn+1,_n+1=Y·(X_n)+[X,Y]_n=Y·∑_i=0^na_i,n,Xv_i+∑_i=0^na_i,n,[X,Y]v_i=a_0,n,[X,Y]v_0+∑_i=1^n(a_i-1,n,X+a_i,n,[X,Y])v_i+λ(X)v_n+1, and the induction step follows. This implies that for every X∈h∈𝔥 the subspace U is an invariant subspace of X and the matrix of the restricted map π(X)|Uπ(X)|_U in the basis αα is upper triangular with diagonal elements equal to λ(X)λ(X), hence tr⁡(π(X)|U)=dim⁡(U)λ(X)tr(π(X)|_U)=(U)λ(X). Applying this with [X,Y]∈h[X,Y]∈𝔥 instead of X gives tr⁡(π([X,Y])|U)=dim⁡(U)λ([X,Y])tr(π([X,Y])|_U)=(U)λ([X,Y]). On the other hand, U is also obviously an invariant subspace of Y, and so tr⁡(π([X,Y])|U)=tr⁡([π(X),π(Y)]|U])=tr⁡([π(X)|U,π(Y)|U])=0tr(π([X,Y])|_U)=tr([π(X),π(Y)]|_U])=tr([π(X)|_U,π(Y)|_U])=0 since commutators have zero trace, and thus dim⁡(U)λ([X,Y])=0(U)λ([X,Y])=0. Since dim⁡(U)>0(U)>0 is invertible (because of the assumption on the characteristic of the base field), λ([X,Y])=0λ([X,Y])=0 and X⋅(Y⋅v)=Y⋅(X⋅v)+[X,Y]⋅v=Y⋅(λ(X)v)+λ([X,Y])v=λ(X)(Y⋅v),·(Y)=Y·(X)+[X,Y]=Y·(λ(X)v)+λ([X,Y])v=λ(X)(Y), and so Y⋅v∈Vλ_λ. Step 5: Finish up the proof by finding a common eigenvector. Write g=h+L𝔤=𝔥+L where L is a one-dimensional vector subspace. Since the base field is algebraically closed, there exists an eigenvector in Vλ_λ for some (thus every) nonzero element of L. Since that vector is also eigenvector for each element of h𝔥, the proof is complete. ◻□
