In mathematics, specifically the theory of Lie algebras, Lie's theorem states that,[1] over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, if π:g→gl(V)π:𝔤→𝔤𝔩(V) is a finite-dimensional representation of a solvable Lie algebra, then there's a flag V=V0⊃V1⊃⋯⊃Vn=0=V_0_1⊃⋯_n=0 of invariant subspaces of π(g)π(𝔤) with codim⁡Vi=icodimV_i=i, meaning that π(X)(Vi)⊆Viπ(X)(V_i)_i for each X∈g∈𝔤 and i. Put in another way, the theorem says there is a basis for V such that all linear transformations in π(g)π(𝔤) are represented by upper triangular matrices.[2] This is a generalization of the result of Frobenius that commuting matrices are simultaneously upper triangularizable, as commuting matrices generate an abelian Lie algebra, which is a fortiori solvable. A consequence of Lie's theorem is that any finite dimensional solvable Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 has a nilpotent derived algebra (see #Consequences). Also, to each flag in a finite-dimensional vector space V, there correspond a Borel subalgebra (that consist of linear transformations stabilizing the flag); thus, the theorem says that π(g)π(𝔤) is contained in some Borel subalgebra of gl(V)𝔤𝔩(V).[1]
