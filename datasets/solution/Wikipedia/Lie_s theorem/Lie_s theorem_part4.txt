Consequences: The theorem applies in particular to the adjoint representation ad:g→gl(g)ad:𝔤→𝔤𝔩(𝔤) of a (finite-dimensional) solvable Lie algebra g𝔤 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero; thus, one can choose a basis on g𝔤 with respect to which ad⁡(g)ad(𝔤) consists of upper triangular matrices. It follows easily that for each x,y∈g,y∈𝔤, ad⁡([x,y])=[ad⁡(x),ad⁡(y)]ad([x,y])=[ad(x),ad(y)] has diagonal consisting of zeros; i.e., ad⁡([x,y])ad([x,y]) is a strictly upper triangular matrix. This implies that [g,g][𝔤,𝔤] is a nilpotent Lie algebra. Moreover, if the base field is not algebraically closed then solvability and nilpotency of a Lie algebra is unaffected by extending the base field to its algebraic closure. Hence, one concludes the statement (the other implication is obvious):[4] A finite-dimensional Lie algebra g𝔤 over a field of characteristic zero is solvable if and only if the derived algebra Dg=[g,g]𝔤=[𝔤,𝔤] is nilpotent. Lie's theorem also establishes one direction in Cartan's criterion for solvability: If V is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero and g⊆gl(V)𝔤⊆𝔤𝔩(V) a Lie subalgebra, then g𝔤 is solvable if and only if tr⁡(XY)=0tr(XY)=0 for every X∈g∈𝔤 and Y∈[g,g]∈[𝔤,𝔤].[5] Indeed, as above, after extending the base field, the implication ⇒⇒ is seen easily. (The converse is more difficult to prove.) Lie's theorem (for various V) is equivalent to the statement:[6] For a solvable Lie algebra g𝔤 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, each finite-dimensional simple g𝔤-module (i.e., irreducible as a representation) has dimension one. Indeed, Lie's theorem clearly implies this statement. Conversely, assume the statement is true. Given a finite-dimensional g𝔤-module V, let V1_1 be a maximal g𝔤-submodule (which exists by finiteness of the dimension). Then, by maximality, V/V1/V_1 is simple; thus, is one-dimensional. The induction now finishes the proof. The statement says in particular that a finite-dimensional simple module over an abelian Lie algebra is one-dimensional; this fact remains true over any base field since in this case every vector subspace is a Lie subalgebra.[7] Here is another quite useful application:[8] Let g𝔤 be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero with radical rad⁡(g)rad(𝔤). Then each finite-dimensional simple representation π:g→gl(V)π:𝔤→𝔤𝔩(V) is the tensor product of a simple representation of g/rad⁡(g)𝔤/rad(𝔤) with a one-dimensional representation of g𝔤 (i.e., a linear functional vanishing on Lie brackets). By Lie's theorem, we can find a linear functional λλ of rad⁡(g)rad(𝔤) so that there is the weight space Vλ_λ of rad⁡(g)rad(𝔤). By Step 4 of the proof of Lie's theorem, Vλ_λ is also a g𝔤-module; so V=Vλ=V_λ. In particular, for each X∈rad⁡(g)∈rad(𝔤), tr⁡(π(X))=dim⁡(V)λ(X)tr(π(X))=(V)λ(X). Extend λλ to a linear functional on g𝔤 that vanishes on [g,g][𝔤,𝔤]; λλ is then a one-dimensional representation of g𝔤. Now, (π,V)≃(π,V)⊗(−λ)⊗λ(π,V)≃(π,V)⊗(-λ)⊗λ. Since ππ coincides with λλ on rad⁡(g)rad(𝔤), we have that V⊗(−λ)⊗(-λ) is trivial on rad⁡(g)rad(𝔤) and thus is the restriction of a (simple) representation of g/rad⁡(g)𝔤/rad(𝔤). ◻□ See
