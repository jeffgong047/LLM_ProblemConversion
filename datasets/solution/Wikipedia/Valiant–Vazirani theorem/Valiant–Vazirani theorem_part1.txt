If there is a polynomial time algorithm for unambiguous-SAT, then NP equals RP The Valiant窶天azirani theorem is a theorem in computational complexity theory stating that if there is a polynomial time algorithm for Unambiguous-SAT, then NP = RP. It was proven by Leslie Valiant and Vijay Vazirani in their paper titled NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions published in 1986.[1] The proof is based on the Mulmuley窶天azirani窶天azirani isolation lemma, which was subsequently used for a number of important applications in theoretical computer science. The Valiant窶天azirani theorem implies that the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is NP-complete, remains a computationally hard problem even if the input instances are promised to have at most one satisfying assignment.
