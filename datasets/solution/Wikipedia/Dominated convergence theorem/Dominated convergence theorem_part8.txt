Extensions: The dominated convergence theorem applies also to measurable functions with values in a Banach space, with the dominating function still being non-negative and integrable as above. The assumption of convergence almost everywhere can be weakened to require only convergence in measure. The dominated convergence theorem applies also to conditional expectations. [2] See
