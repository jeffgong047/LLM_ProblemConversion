Statement: Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem.[1] Let (fn)(f_n) be a sequence of complex-valued measurable functions on a measure space (S,Σ,μ)(S,Σ,μ). Suppose that the sequence converges pointwise to a function f and is dominated by some integrable function g in the sense that |fn(x)|≤g(x)|f_n(x)|(x) for all numbers n in the index set of the sequence and all points x∈S. Then f is integrable (in the Lebesgue sense) and limn→∞∫S|fn−f|dμ=0lim_n→∞∫_S|f_n-f| dμ=0 which also implies limn→∞∫Sfndμ=∫Sfdμlim_n→∞∫_Sf_n dμ=∫_Sf dμ Remark 1. The statement "g is integrable" means that measurable function g is Lebesgue integrable; i.e. ∫S|g|dμ<∞.∫_S|g| dμ<∞. Remark 2. The convergence of the sequence and domination by g can be relaxed to hold only μ-almost everywhere provided the measure space (S, Σ, μ) is complete or f is chosen as a measurable function which agrees μ-almost everywhere with the μ-almost everywhere existing pointwise limit. (These precautions are necessary, because otherwise there might exist a non-measurable subset of a μ-null set N ∈ Σ, hence f might not be measurable.) Remark 3. If μ(S)<∞μ(S)<∞, the condition that there is a dominating integrable function g can be relaxed to uniform integrability of the sequence (fn), see Vitali convergence theorem. Remark 4. While f is Lebesgue integrable, it is not in general Riemann integrable. For example, take fn to be defined in [0,1][0,1] so that it is 1/n at rational numbers and zero everywhere else (on the irrationals). The series (fn) converges pointwise to 0, so f is identically zero, but |fn−f|=fn|f_n-f|=f_n is not Riemann integrable, since its image in every finite interval is 0,1/n{0,1/n} and thus the upper and lower Darboux integrals are 1/n and 0, respectively.
