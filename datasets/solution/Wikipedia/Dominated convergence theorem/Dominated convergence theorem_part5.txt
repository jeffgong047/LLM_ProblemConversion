theorem: One corollary to the dominated convergence theorem is the bounded convergence theorem, which states that if (fn) is a sequence of uniformly bounded complex-valued measurable functions which converges pointwise on a bounded measure space (S, Σ, μ) (i.e. one in which μ(S) is finite) to a function f, then the limit f is an integrable function and limn→∞∫Sfndμ=∫Sfdμ.lim_n→∞∫_Sf_n dμ=∫_Sf dμ. Remark: The pointwise convergence and uniform boundedness of the sequence can be relaxed to hold only μ-almost everywhere, provided the measure space (S, Σ, μ) is complete or f is chosen as a measurable function which agrees μ-almost everywhere with the μ-almost everywhere existing pointwise limit.
