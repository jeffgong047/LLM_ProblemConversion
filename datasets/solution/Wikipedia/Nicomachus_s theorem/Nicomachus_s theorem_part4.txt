Proofs: Charles Wheatstone (1854) gives a particularly simple derivation, by expanding each cube in the sum into a set of consecutive odd numbers. He begins by giving the identity n3=(n2−n+1)+(n2−n+1+2)+(n2−n+1+4)+⋯+(n2+n−1)⏟nconsecutiveoddnumbers.^3=(n^2-n+1)+(n^2-n+1+2)+(n^2-n+1+4)+⋯+(n^2+n-1)_nconsecutiveoddnumbers. That identity is related to triangular numbers Tn_n in the following way: n3=∑k=Tn−1+1Tn(2k−1),^3=∑_k=T_n-1+1^T_n(2k-1), and thus the summands forming n3^3 start off just after those forming all previous values 131^3 up to (n−1)3(n-1)^3. Applying this property, along with another well-known identity: n2=∑k=1n(2k−1),^2=∑_k=1^n(2k-1), produces the following derivation: ∑k=1nk3=1+8+27+64+⋯+n3=1⏟13+3+5⏟23+7+9+11⏟33+13+15+17+19⏟43+⋯+(n2−n+1)+⋯+(n2+n−1)⏟n3=1⏟12+3⏟22+5⏟32+⋯+(n2+n−1)⏟(n2+n2)2=(1+2+⋯+n)2=(∑k=1nk)2.∑_k=1^nk^3 =1+8+27+64+⋯+n^3 =1_1^3+3+5_2^3+7+9+11_3^3+13+15+17+19_4^3+⋯+(n^2-n+1)+⋯+(n^2+n-1)_n^3 =1_1^2+3_2^2+5_3^2+⋯+(n^2+n-1)_(n^2+n/2)^2 =(1+2+⋯+n)^2 =(∑_k=1^nk)^2. Row (1893) obtains another proof by summing the numbers in a square multiplication table in two different ways. The sum of the ith row is i times a triangular number, from which it follows that the sum of all the rows is the square of a triangular number. Alternatively, one can decompose the table into a sequence of nested gnomons, each consisting of the products in which the larger of the two terms is some fixed value. The sum within each gmonon is a cube, so the sum of the whole table is a sum of cubes. Visual demonstration that the square of a triangular number equals a sum of cubes. In the more recent mathematical literature, Edmonds (1957) provides a proof using summation by parts. Stein (1971) uses the rectangle-counting interpretation of these numbers to form a geometric proof of the identity (see also Benjamin, Quinn & Wurtz 2006); he observes that it may also be proved easily (but uninformatively) by induction, and states that Toeplitz (1963) provides "an interesting old Arabic proof". Kanim (2004) provides a purely visual proof, Benjamin & Orrison (2002) provide two additional proofs, and Nelsen (1993) gives seven geometric proofs.
