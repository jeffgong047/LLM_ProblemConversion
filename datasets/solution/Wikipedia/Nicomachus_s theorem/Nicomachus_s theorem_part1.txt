Square of a triangular number For triangular numbers that are themselves square, see square triangular number. A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. From Gulley (2010). In number theory, the sum of the first n cubes is the square of the nth triangular number. That is, 13+23+33+⋯+n3=(1+2+3+⋯+n)2.1^3+2^3+3^3+⋯+n^3=(1+2+3+⋯+n)^2. The same equation may be written more compactly using the mathematical notation for summation: ∑k=1nk3=(∑k=1nk)2.∑_k=1^nk^3=(∑_k=1^nk)^2. This identity is sometimes called Nicomachus's theorem, after Nicomachus of Gerasa (c. 60 – c. 120 CE).
