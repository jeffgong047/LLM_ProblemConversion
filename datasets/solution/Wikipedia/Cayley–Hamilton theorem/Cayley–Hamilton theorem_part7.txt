matrix: The Cayley–Hamilton theorem always provides a relationship between the powers of A (though not always the simplest one), which allows one to simplify expressions involving such powers, and evaluate them without having to compute the power An or any higher powers of A. As an example, for A=(1234)=[ 1 2; 3 4 ] the theorem gives A2=5A+2I2.^2=5A+2I_2 . Then, to calculate A4, observe A3=(5A+2I2)A=5A2+2A=5(5A+2I2)+2A=27A+10I2,A4=A3A=(27A+10I2)A=27A2+10A=27(5A+2I2)+10A=145A+54I2.A^3 =(5A+2I_2)A=5A^2+2A=5(5A+2I_2)+2A=27A+10I_2, A^4 =A^3A=(27A+10I_2)A=27A^2+10A=27(5A+2I_2)+10A=145A+54I_2 . Likewise, A−1=12(A−5I2).A−2=A−1A−1=14(A2−10A+25I2)=14((5A+2I2)−10A+25I2)=14(−5A+27I2).A^-1 =1/2(A-5I_2) . A^-2 =A^-1A^-1=1/4(A^2-10A+25I_2)=1/4((5A+2I_2)-10A+25I_2)=1/4(-5A+27I_2) . Notice that we have been able to write the matrix power as the sum of two terms. In fact, matrix power of any order k can be written as a matrix polynomial of degree at most n − 1, where n is the size of a square matrix. This is an instance where Cayley–Hamilton theorem can be used to express a matrix function, which we will discuss below systematically. Matrix
