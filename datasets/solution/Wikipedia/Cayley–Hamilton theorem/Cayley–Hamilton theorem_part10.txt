Proofs: The Cayley–Hamilton theorem is an immediate consequence of the existence of the Jordan normal form for matrices over algebraically closed fields, see Jordan normal form § Cayley–Hamilton theorem. In this section, direct proofs are presented. As the examples above show, obtaining the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem for an n × n matrix A=(aij)i,j=1n=(a_ij)_i,j=1^n requires two steps: first the coefficients ci of the characteristic polynomial are determined by development as a polynomial in t of the determinant p(t)=det(tIn−A)=|t−a1,1−a1,2⋯−a1,n−a2,1t−a2,2⋯−a2,n⋮⋮⋱⋮−an,1−an,2⋯t−an,n|=tn+cn−1tn−1+⋯+c1t+c0,p(t) =(tI_n-A)=t-a_1,1 -a_1,2 ⋯ -a_1,n -a_2,1 t-a_2,2 ⋯ -a_2,n ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ -a_n,1 -a_n,2 ⋯ t-a_n,n =t^n+c_n-1t^n-1+⋯+c_1t+c_0, and then these coefficients are used in a linear combination of powers of A that is equated to the n × n zero matrix: An+cn−1An−1+⋯+c1A+c0In=(0⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯0).^n+c_n-1A^n-1+⋯+c_1A+c_0I_n=[ 0 ⋯ 0; ⋮ ⋱ ⋮; 0 ⋯ 0 ]. The left-hand side can be worked out to an n × n matrix whose entries are (enormous) polynomial expressions in the set of entries ai,j of A, so the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that each of these n2 expressions equals 0. For any fixed value of n, these identities can be obtained by tedious but straightforward algebraic manipulations. None of these computations, however, can show why the Cayley–Hamilton theorem should be valid for matrices of all possible sizes n, so a uniform proof for all n is needed.
