Remarks: ^ An explicit expression for these coefficients is ci=∑k1,k2,…,kn∏l=1n(−1)kl+1lklkl!tr⁡(Al)kl,_i=∑_k_1,k_2,…,k_n∏_l=1^n(-1)^k_l+1/l^k_lk_l!tr(A^l)^k_l, where the sum is taken over the sets of all integer partitions kl ≥ 0 satisfying the equation ∑l=1nlkl=n−i.∑_l=1^nlk_l=n-i. ^ See, e.g., p. 54 of Brown 1994, which solves Jacobi's formula, ∂p(λ)∂λ=p(λ)∑m=0∞λ−(m+1)tr⁡Am=p(λ)tr⁡IλI−A≡tr⁡B,(λ)/∂λ=p(λ)∑_m=0^∞λ^-(m+1)trA^m=p(λ) trI/-A≡trB , where B is the adjugate matrix of the next section. There also exists an equivalent, related recursive algorithm introduced by Urbain Le Verrier and Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev—the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm, which reads M0≡Ocn=1(k=0)Mk≡AMk−1−1k−1(tr⁡(AMk−1))Icn−k=−1ktr⁡(AMk)k=1,…,n.M_0 c_n =1 (k=0) M_k _k-1-1/k-1(tr(AM_k-1))I c_n-k =-1/ktr(AM_k) k=1,…,n . (see, e.g., Gantmacher 1960, p. 88.) Observe A−1 = −Mn /c0 as the recursion terminates. See the algebraic proof in the following section, which relies on the modes of the adjugate, Bk ≡ Mn−k. Specifically, (λI−A)B=Ip(λ)(-A)B=Ip(λ) and the above derivative of p when one traces it yields λp′−np=tr⁡(AB),'-np=tr(AB) , (Hou 1998), and the above recursions, in turn. ^ Due to the non-commutative nature of the multiplication operation for quaternions and related constructions, care needs to be taken with definitions, most notably in this context, for the determinant. The theorem holds as well for the slightly less well-behaved split-quaternions, see Alagös, Oral & Yüce (2012). The rings of quaternions and split-quaternions can both be represented by certain 2 × 2 complex matrices. (When restricted to unit norm, these are the groups SU(2) and SU(1,1) respectively.) Therefore it is not surprising that the theorem holds.There is no such matrix representation for the octonions, since the multiplication operation is not associative in this case. However, a modified Cayley–Hamilton theorem still holds for the octonions, see Tian (2000).
