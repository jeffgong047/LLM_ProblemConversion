functions: Given an analytic function f(x)=∑k=0∞akxk(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k and the characteristic polynomial p(x) of degree n of an n × n matrix A, the function can be expressed using long division as f(x)=q(x)p(x)+r(x),(x)=q(x)p(x)+r(x), where q(x) is some quotient polynomial and r(x) is a remainder polynomial such that 0 ≤ deg r(x) < n. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, replacing x by the matrix A gives p(A) = 0, so one has f(A)=r(A).(A)=r(A). Thus, the analytic function of the matrix A can be expressed as a matrix polynomial of degree less than n. Let the remainder polynomial be r(x)=c0+c1x+⋯+cn−1xn−1.(x)=c_0+c_1x+⋯+c_n-1x^n-1. Since p(λ) = 0, evaluating the function f(x) at the n eigenvalues of A yields f(λi)=r(λi)=c0+c1λi+⋯+cn−1λin−1,fori=1,2,...,n.(λ_i)=r(λ_i)=c_0+c_1λ_i+⋯+c_n-1λ_i^n-1, fori=1,2,...,n. This amounts to a system of n linear equations, which can be solved to determine the coefficients ci. Thus, one has f(A)=∑k=0n−1ckAk.(A)=∑_k=0^n-1c_kA^k. When the eigenvalues are repeated, that is λi = λj for some i ≠ j, two or more equations are identical; and hence the linear equations cannot be solved uniquely. For such cases, for an eigenvalue λ with multiplicity m, the first m – 1 derivatives of p(x) vanish at the eigenvalue. This leads to the extra m – 1 linearly independent solutions dkf(x)dxk|x=λ=dkr(x)dxk|x=λfork=1,2,…,m−1,.d^kf(x)/dx^k|_x=λ=.d^kr(x)/dx^k|_x=λ fork=1,2,…,m-1, which, combined with others, yield the required n equations to solve for ci. Finding a polynomial that passes through the points (λi, f (λi)) is essentially an interpolation problem, and can be solved using Lagrange or Newton interpolation techniques, leading to Sylvester's formula. For example, suppose the task is to find the polynomial representation of f(A)=eAtwhereA=(1203).(A)=e^At where=[ 1 2; 0 3 ]. The characteristic polynomial is p(x) = (x − 1)(x − 3) = x2 − 4x + 3, and the eigenvalues are λ = 1, 3. Let r(x) = c0 + c1x. Evaluating f(λ) = r(λ) at the eigenvalues, one obtains two linear equations, et = c0 + c1 and e3t = c0 + 3c1. Solving the equations yields c0 = (3et − e3t)/2 and c1 = (e3t − et)/2. Thus, it follows that eAt=c0I2+c1A=(c0+c12c10c0+3c1)=(ete3t−et0e3t).^At=c_0I_2+c_1A=[ c_0+c_1 2c_1; 0 c_0+3c_1 ]=[ e^t e^3t-e^t; 0 e^3t ]. If, instead, the function were f(A) = sin At, then the coefficients would have been c0 = (3 sin t − sin 3t)/2 and c1 = (sin 3t − sin t)/2; hence sin⁡(At)=c0I2+c1A=(sin⁡tsin⁡3t−sin⁡t0sin⁡3t).sin(At)=c_0I_2+c_1A=[ sin3t-; 0 sin3t ]. As a further example, when considering f(A)=eAtwhereA=(01−10),(A)=e^At where=[ 0 1; -1 0 ], then the characteristic polynomial is p(x) = x2 + 1, and the eigenvalues are λ = ±i. As before, evaluating the function at the eigenvalues gives us the linear equations eit = c0 + i c1 and e−it = c0 − ic1; the solution of which gives, c0 = (eit + e−it)/2 = cos t and c1 = (eit − e−it)/2i = sin t. Thus, for this case, eAt=(cos⁡t)I2+(sin⁡t)A=(cos⁡tsin⁡t−sin⁡tcos⁡t),^At=()I_2+()A=[ ; - ], which is a rotation matrix. Standard examples of such usage is the exponential map from the Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group into the group. It is given by a matrix exponential, exp:g→G;tX↦etX=∑n=0∞tnXnn!=I+tX+t2X22+⋯,t∈R,X∈g.exp:𝔤;^tX=∑_n=0^∞t^nX^n/n!=I+tX+t^2X^2/2+⋯,t∈ℝ,X∈𝔤. Such expressions have long been known for SU(2), ei(θ/2)(n^⋅σ)=I2cos⁡θ2+i(n^⋅σ)sin⁡θ2,^i(θ/2)(𝐧̂·σ)=I_2cosθ/2+i(𝐧̂·σ)sinθ/2, where the σ are the Pauli matrices and for SO(3), eiθ(n^⋅J)=I3+i(n^⋅J)sin⁡θ+(n^⋅J)2(cos⁡θ−1),^iθ(𝐧̂·𝐉)=I_3+i(𝐧̂·𝐉)sinθ+(𝐧̂·𝐉)^2(cosθ-1), which is Rodrigues' rotation formula. For the notation, see 3D rotation group#A note on Lie algebras. More recently, expressions have appeared for other groups, like the Lorentz group SO(3, 1),[10] O(4, 2)[11] and SU(2, 2),[12] as well as GL(n, R).[13] The group O(4, 2) is the conformal group of spacetime, SU(2, 2) its simply connected cover (to be precise, the simply connected cover of the connected component SO+(4, 2) of O(4, 2)). The expressions obtained apply to the standard representation of these groups. They require knowledge of (some of) the eigenvalues of the matrix to exponentiate. For SU(2) (and hence for SO(3)), closed expressions have been obtained for all irreducible representations, i.e. of any spin.[14] Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (1849–1917), German mathematician. His main interests were elliptic functions, differential equations, and later group theory.In 1878 he gave the first full proof of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.[9] Algebraic number
