matrix: See also: Determinant § Relation to eigenvalues and trace, and Characteristic polynomial § Properties For a general n × n invertible matrix A, i.e., one with nonzero determinant, A−1 can thus be written as an (n − 1)-th order polynomial expression in A: As indicated, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem amounts to the identity p(A)=An+cn−1An−1+⋯+c1A+(−1)ndet(A)In=0.(A)=A^n+c_n-1A^n-1+⋯+c_1A+(-1)^n(A)I_n=0. The coefficients ci are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of A. Using Newton identities, the elementary symmetric polynomials can in turn be expressed in terms of power sum symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues: sk=∑i=1nλik=tr⁡(Ak),_k=∑_i=1^nλ_i^k=tr(A^k), where tr(Ak) is the trace of the matrix Ak. Thus, we can express ci in terms of the trace of powers of A. In general, the formula for the coefficients ci is given in terms of complete exponential Bell polynomials as[nb 1] cn−k=(−1)kk!Bk(s1,−1!s2,2!s3,…,(−1)k−1(k−1)!sk)._n-k=(-1)^k/k!B_k(s_1,-1!s_2,2!s_3,…,(-1)^k-1(k-1)!s_k). In particular, the determinant of A equals (−1)nc0. Thus, the determinant can be written as the trace identity: det(A)=1n!Bn(s1,−1!s2,2!s3,…,(−1)n−1(n−1)!sn).(A)=1/n!B_n(s_1,-1!s_2,2!s_3,…,(-1)^n-1(n-1)!s_n). Likewise, the characteristic polynomial can be written as −(−1)ndet(A)In=A(An−1+cn−1An−2+⋯+c1In),-(-1)^n(A)I_n=A(A^n-1+c_n-1A^n-2+⋯+c_1I_n), and, by multiplying both sides by A−1 (note −(−1)n = (−1)n−1), one is led to an expression for the inverse of A as a trace identity, A−1=(−1)n−1detA(An−1+cn−1An−2+⋯+c1In),=1detA∑k=0n−1(−1)n+k−1An−k−1k!Bk(s1,−1!s2,2!s3,…,(−1)k−1(k−1)!sk).A^-1 =(-1)^n-1/(A^n-1+c_n-1A^n-2+⋯+c_1I_n), =1/∑_k=0^n-1(-1)^n+k-1A^n-k-1/k!B_k(s_1,-1!s_2,2!s_3,…,(-1)^k-1(k-1)!s_k). Another method for obtaining these coefficients ck for a general n × n matrix, provided no root be zero, relies on the following alternative expression for the determinant, p(λ)=det(λIn−A)=λnexp⁡(tr⁡(log⁡(In−A/λ))).(λ)=(_n-A)=λ^nexp(tr(log(I_n-A/λ))). Hence, by virtue of the Mercator series, p(λ)=λnexp⁡(−tr⁡∑m=1∞(Aλ)mm),(λ)=λ^nexp(-tr∑_m=1^∞(Aλ)^m), where the exponential only needs be expanded to order λ−n, since p(λ) is of order n, the net negative powers of λ automatically vanishing by the C–H theorem. (Again, this requires a ring containing the rational numbers.) Differentiation of this expression with respect to λ allows one to express the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial for general n as determinants of m × m matrices,[nb 2] cn−m=(−1)mm!|tr⁡Am−10⋯tr⁡A2tr⁡Am−2⋯⋮⋮⋮tr⁡Am−1tr⁡Am−2⋯⋯1tr⁡Amtr⁡Am−1⋯⋯tr⁡A|._n-m=(-1)^m/m!trA m-1 0 ⋯ trA^2 trA m-2 ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ trA^m-1 trA^m-2 ⋯ ⋯ 1 trA^m trA^m-1 ⋯ ⋯ trA . Examples For instance, the first few Bell polynomials are B0 = 1, B1(x1) = x1, B2(x1, x2) = x21 + x2, and B3(x1, x2, x3) = x31 + 3 x1x2 + x3. Using these to specify the coefficients ci of the characteristic polynomial of a 2 × 2 matrix yields c2=B0=1,c1=−11!B1(s1)=−s1=−tr⁡(A),c0=12!B2(s1,−1!s2)=12(s12−s2)=12((tr⁡(A))2−tr⁡(A2)).c_2=B_0=1, c_1=-1/1!B_1(s_1)=-s_1=-tr(A), c_0=1/2!B_2(s_1,-1!s_2)=1/2(s_1^2-s_2)=1/2((tr(A))^2-tr(A^2)). The coefficient c0 gives the determinant of the 2 × 2 matrix, c1 minus its trace, while its inverse is given by A−1=−1detA(A+c1I2)=−2(A−tr⁡(A)I2)(tr⁡(A))2−tr⁡(A2).^-1=-1/(A+c_1I_2)=-2(A-tr(A)I_2)/(tr(A))^2-tr(A^2). It is apparent from the general formula for cn−k, expressed in terms of Bell polynomials, that the expressions −tr⁡(A)and12(tr⁡(A)2−tr⁡(A2))-tr(A) and 12(tr(A)^2-tr(A^2)) always give the coefficients cn−1 of λn−1 and cn−2 of λn−2 in the characteristic polynomial of any n × n matrix, respectively. So, for a 3 × 3 matrix A, the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem can also be written as A3−(tr⁡A)A2+12((tr⁡A)2−tr⁡(A2))A−det(A)I3=O,^3-(trA)A^2+1/2((trA)^2-tr(A^2))A-(A)I_3=O, where the right-hand side designates a 3 × 3 matrix with all entries reduced to zero. Likewise, this determinant in the n = 3 case, is now det(A)=13!B3(s1,−1!s2,2!s3)=16(s13+3s1(−s2)+2s3)=16[(tr⁡A)3−3tr⁡(A2)(tr⁡A)+2tr⁡(A3)].(A) =1/3!B_3(s_1,-1!s_2,2!s_3)=1/6(s_1^3+3s_1(-s_2)+2s_3) =1/6[(trA)^3-3tr(A^2)(trA)+2tr(A^3)]. This expression gives the negative of coefficient cn−3 of λn−3 in the general case, as seen below. Similarly, one can write for a 4 × 4 matrix A, A4−(tr⁡A)A3+12[(tr⁡A)2−tr⁡(A2)]A2−16[(tr⁡A)3−3tr⁡(A2)(tr⁡A)+2tr⁡(A3)]A+det(A)I4=O,^4-(trA)A^3+12[(trA)^2-tr(A^2)]A^2-16[(trA)^3-3tr(A^2)(trA)+2tr(A^3)]A+(A)I_4=O, where, now, the determinant is cn−4, 124[(tr⁡A)4−6tr⁡(A2)(tr⁡A)2+3(tr⁡(A2))2+8tr⁡(A3)tr⁡(A)−6tr⁡(A4)],124[(trA)^4-6tr(A^2)(trA)^2+3(tr(A^2))^2+8tr(A^3)tr(A)-6tr(A^4)], and so on for larger matrices. The increasingly complex expressions for the coefficients ck is deducible from Newton's identities or the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm. n-th power of
