generalizations: The above proofs show that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for matrices with entries in any commutative ring R, and that p(φ) = 0 will hold whenever φ is an endomorphism of an R-module generated by elements e1,...,en that satisfies φ(ej)=∑aijei,j=1,…,n.φ(e_j)=_ije_i,=1,…,n. This more general version of the theorem is the source of the celebrated Nakayama lemma in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem also holds for matrices over the quaternions, a noncommutative ring.[18][nb 3] See
