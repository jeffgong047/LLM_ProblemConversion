0: One persistent elementary but incorrect argument[17] for the theorem is to "simply" take the definition p(λ)=det(λIn−A)(λ)=(_n-A) and substitute A for λ, obtaining p(A)=det(AIn−A)=det(A−A)=det(0)=0.(A)=(AI_n-A)=(A-A)=(0)=0. There are many ways to see why this argument is wrong. First, in the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, p(A) is an n × n matrix. However, the right hand side of the above equation is the value of a determinant, which is a scalar. So they cannot be equated unless n = 1 (i.e. A is just a scalar). Second, in the expression det(λIn−A)(_n-A), the variable λ actually occurs at the diagonal entries of the matrix λIn−A_n-A. To illustrate, consider the characteristic polynomial in the previous example again: det(λ−1−2−3λ−4).[ λ-1 -2; -3 λ-4 ]. If one substitutes the entire matrix A for λ in those positions, one obtains det((1234)−1−2−3(1234)−4),[ [ 1 2; 3 4 ]-1 -2; -3 [ 1 2; 3 4 ]-4 ], in which the "matrix" expression is simply not a valid one. Note, however, that if scalar multiples of identity matrices instead of scalars are subtracted in the above, i.e. if the substitution is performed as det((1234)−I2−2I2−3I2(1234)−4I2),[ [ 1 2; 3 4 ]-I_2 -2I_2; -3I_2 [ 1 2; 3 4 ]-4I_2 ], then the determinant is indeed zero, but the expanded matrix in question does not evaluate to AIn−A_n-A; nor can its determinant (a scalar) be compared to p(A) (a matrix). So the argument that p(A)=det(AIn−A)=0(A)=(AI_n-A)=0 still does not apply. Actually, if such an argument holds, it should also hold when other multilinear forms instead of determinant is used. For instance, if we consider the permanent function and define q(λ)=perm⁡(λIn−A)(λ)=perm(_n-A), then by the same argument, we should be able to "prove" that q(A) = 0. But this statement is demonstrably wrong: in the 2-dimensional case, for instance, the permanent of a matrix is given by perm(abcd)=ad+bc.perm[ a b; c d ]=ad+bc. So, for the matrix A in the previous example, q(λ)=perm⁡(λI2−A)=perm(λ−1−2−3λ−4)=(λ−1)(λ−4)+(−2)(−3)=λ2−5λ+10.q(λ) =perm(_2-A)=perm[ λ-1 -2; -3 λ-4 ] =(λ-1)(λ-4)+(-2)(-3)=λ^2-5λ+10. Yet one can verify that q(A)=A2−5A+10I2=12I2≠0.(A)=A^2-5A+10I_2=12I_2≠0. One of the proofs for Cayley–Hamilton theorem above bears some similarity to the argument that p(A)=det(AIn−A)=0(A)=(AI_n-A)=0. By introducing a matrix with non-numeric coefficients, one can actually let A live inside a matrix entry, but then AIn_n is not equal to A, and the conclusion is reached differently.
