endomorphisms: As was mentioned above, the matrix p(A) in statement of the theorem is obtained by first evaluating the determinant and then substituting the matrix A for t; doing that substitution into the matrix tIn−A_n-A before evaluating the determinant is not meaningful. Nevertheless, it is possible to give an interpretation where p(A) is obtained directly as the value of a certain determinant, but this requires a more complicated setting, one of matrices over a ring in which one can interpret both the entries Ai,j_i,j of A, and all of A itself. One could take for this the ring M(n, R) of n × n matrices over R, where the entry Ai,j_i,j is realised as Ai,jIn_i,jI_n, and A as itself. But considering matrices with matrices as entries might cause confusion with block matrices, which is not intended, as that gives the wrong notion of determinant (recall that the determinant of a matrix is defined as a sum of products of its entries, and in the case of a block matrix this is generally not the same as the corresponding sum of products of its blocks!). It is clearer to distinguish A from the endomorphism φ of an n-dimensional vector space V (or free R-module if R is not a field) defined by it in a basis e1,…,en_1,…,e_n, and to take matrices over the ring End(V) of all such endomorphisms. Then φ ∈ End(V) is a possible matrix entry, while A designates the element of M(n, End(V)) whose i, j entry is endomorphism of scalar multiplication by Ai,j_i,j; similarly In_n will be interpreted as element of M(n, End(V)). However, since End(V) is not a commutative ring, no determinant is defined on M(n, End(V)); this can only be done for matrices over a commutative subring of End(V). Now the entries of the matrix φIn−A_n-A all lie in the subring R[φ] generated by the identity and φ, which is commutative. Then a determinant map M(n, R[φ]) → R[φ] is defined, and det(φIn−A)(_n-A) evaluates to the value p(φ) of the characteristic polynomial of A at φ (this holds independently of the relation between A and φ); the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that p(φ) is the null endomorphism. In this form, the following proof can be obtained from that of Atiyah & MacDonald (1969, Prop. 2.4) (which in fact is the more general statement related to the Nakayama lemma; one takes for the ideal in that proposition the whole ring R). The fact that A is the matrix of φ in the basis e1, ..., en means that φ(ei)=∑j=1nAj,iejfori=1,…,n.φ(e_i)=∑_j=1^nA_j,ie_j fori=1,…,n. One can interpret these as n components of one equation in Vn, whose members can be written using the matrix-vector product M(n, End(V)) × Vn → Vn that is defined as usual, but with individual entries ψ ∈ End(V) and v in V being "multiplied" by forming ψ(v)ψ(v); this gives: φIn⋅E=Atr⋅E,_n=A^tr, where E∈Vn^n is the element whose component i is ei (in other words it is the basis e1, ..., en of V written as a column of vectors). Writing this equation as (φIn−Atr)⋅E=0∈Vn(_n-A^tr)=0^n one recognizes the transpose of the matrix φIn−A_n-A considered above, and its determinant (as element of M(n, R[φ])) is also p(φ). To derive from this equation that p(φ) = 0 ∈ End(V), one left-multiplies by the adjugate matrix of φIn−Atr_n-A^tr, which is defined in the matrix ring M(n, R[φ]), giving 0=adj⁡(φIn−Atr)⋅((φIn−Atr)⋅E)=(adj⁡(φIn−Atr)⋅(φIn−Atr))⋅E=(det(φIn−Atr)In)⋅E=(p(φ)In)⋅E;0 =adj(_n-A^tr)·((_n-A^tr)) =(adj(_n-A^tr)·(_n-A^tr)) =((_n-A^tr)I_n) =(p(φ)I_n); the associativity of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication used in the first step is a purely formal property of those operations, independent of the nature of the entries. Now component i of this equation says that p(φ)(ei) = 0 ∈ V; thus p(φ) vanishes on all ei, and since these elements generate V it follows that p(φ) = 0 ∈ End(V), completing the proof. One additional fact that follows from this proof is that the matrix A whose characteristic polynomial is taken need not be identical to the value φ substituted into that polynomial; it suffices that φ be an endomorphism of V satisfying the initial equations φ(ei)=∑jAj,iejφ(e_i)=∑_jA_j,ie_j for some sequence of elements e1, ..., en that generate V (which space might have smaller dimension than n, or in case the ring R is not a field it might not be a free module at all). A bogus "proof": p(A) = det(AIn − A) = det(A − A) =
