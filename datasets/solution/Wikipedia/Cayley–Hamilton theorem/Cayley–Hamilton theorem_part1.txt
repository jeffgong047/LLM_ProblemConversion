Every square matrix over a commutative ring satisfies its own characteristic equation Arthur Cayley, F.R.S. (1821–1895) is widely regarded as Britain's leading pure mathematician of the 19th century. Cayley in 1848 went to Dublin to attend lectures on quaternions by Hamilton, their discoverer. Later Cayley impressed him by being the second to publish work on them.[1] Cayley stated the theorem for matrices of dimension 3 or less, and published a proof for the two-dimensional case. William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), Irish physicist, astronomer, and mathematician, first foreign member of the American National Academy of Sciences. While maintaining an opposing position about how geometry should be studied, Hamilton always remained on the best terms with Cayley.[1]Hamilton proved that for a linear function of quaternions there exists a certain equation, depending on the linear function, that is satisfied by the linear function itself.[2][3][4] In linear algebra, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem (named after the mathematicians Arthur Cayley and William Rowan Hamilton) states that every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex numbers or the integers) satisfies its own characteristic equation. If A is a given n × n matrix and In is the n × n identity matrix, then the characteristic polynomial of A is defined as[5] pA(λ)=det(λIn−A)_A(λ)=(_n-A), where det is the determinant operation and λ is a variable for a scalar element of the base ring. Since the entries of the matrix (λIn−A)(_n-A) are (linear or constant) polynomials in λ, the determinant is also a degree-n monic polynomial in λ, pA(λ)=λn+cn−1λn−1+⋯+c1λ+c0._A(λ)=λ^n+c_n-1λ^n-1+⋯+c_1λ+c_0 . One can create an analogous polynomial pA(A)_A(A) in the matrix A instead of the scalar variable λ, defined as pA(A)=An+cn−1An−1+⋯+c1A+c0In._A(A)=A^n+c_n-1A^n-1+⋯+c_1A+c_0I_n . The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that this polynomial expression is equal to the zero matrix, which is to say that pA(A)=0_A(A)=0. The theorem allows An to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of A. When the ring is a field, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minimal polynomial of a square matrix divides its characteristic polynomial. A special case of the theorem was first proved by Hamilton in 1853[6] in terms of inverses of linear functions of quaternions.[2][3][4] This corresponds to the special case of certain 4 × 4 real or 2 × 2 complex matrices. Cayley in 1858 stated the result for 3 × 3 and smaller matrices, but only published a proof for the 2 × 2 case.[7][8] As for n × n matrices, Cayley stated “..., I have not thought it necessary to undertake the labor of a formal proof of the theorem in the general case of a matrix of any degree”. The general case was first proved by Ferdinand Frobenius in 1878.[9]
