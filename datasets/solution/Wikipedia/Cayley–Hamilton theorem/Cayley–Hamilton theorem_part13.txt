proof: This proof uses just the kind of objects needed to formulate the Cayley–Hamilton theorem: matrices with polynomials as entries. The matrix t In − A whose determinant is the characteristic polynomial of A is such a matrix, and since polynomials form a commutative ring, it has an adjugate B=adj⁡(tIn−A).=adj(tI_n-A). Then, according to the right-hand fundamental relation of the adjugate, one has (tIn−A)B=det(tIn−A)In=p(t)In.(tI_n-A)B=(tI_n-A)I_n=p(t)I_n. Since B is also a matrix with polynomials in t as entries, one can, for each i, collect the coefficients of t i in each entry to form a matrix Bi of numbers, such that one has B=∑i=0n−1tiBi.=∑_i=0^n-1t^iB_i. (The way the entries of B are defined makes clear that no powers higher than tn−1 occur). While this looks like a polynomial with matrices as coefficients, we shall not consider such a notion; it is just a way to write a matrix with polynomial entries as a linear combination of n constant matrices, and the coefficient t i has been written to the left of the matrix to stress this point of view. Now, one can expand the matrix product in our equation by bilinearity: p(t)In=(tIn−A)B=(tIn−A)∑i=0n−1tiBi=∑i=0n−1tIn⋅tiBi−∑i=0n−1A⋅tiBi=∑i=0n−1ti+1Bi−∑i=0n−1tiABi=tnBn−1+∑i=1n−1ti(Bi−1−ABi)−AB0.p(t)I_n =(tI_n-A)B =(tI_n-A)∑_i=0^n-1t^iB_i =∑_i=0^n-1tI_n^iB_i-∑_i=0^n-1A^iB_i =∑_i=0^n-1t^i+1B_i-∑_i=0^n-1t^iAB_i =t^nB_n-1+∑_i=1^n-1t^i(B_i-1-AB_i)-AB_0. Writing p(t)In=tnIn+tn−1cn−1In+⋯+tc1In+c0In,(t)I_n=t^nI_n+t^n-1c_n-1I_n+⋯+tc_1I_n+c_0I_n, one obtains an equality of two matrices with polynomial entries, written as linear combinations of constant matrices with powers of t as coefficients. Such an equality can hold only if in any matrix position the entry that is multiplied by a given power t i is the same on both sides; it follows that the constant matrices with coefficient t i in both expressions must be equal. Writing these equations then for i from n down to 0, one finds Bn−1=In,Bi−1−ABi=ciInfor1≤i≤n−1,−AB0=c0In._n-1=I_n,_i-1-AB_i=c_iI_n for1-1, -AB_0=c_0I_n. Finally, multiply the equation of the coefficients of t i from the left by Ai, and sum up: AnBn−1+∑i=1n−1(AiBi−1−Ai+1Bi)−AB0=An+cn−1An−1+⋯+c1A+c0In.^nB_n-1+∑_i=1^n-1(A^iB_i-1-A^i+1B_i)-AB_0=A^n+c_n-1A^n-1+⋯+c_1A+c_0I_n. The left-hand sides form a telescoping sum and cancel completely; the right-hand sides add up to p(A)(A): 0=p(A).0=p(A). This completes the proof. A proof using polynomials with matrix
