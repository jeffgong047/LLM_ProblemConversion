group: The 3g − 1 curves from the twist theorem, shown here for g = 3. It is a theorem of Max Dehn that maps of this form generate the mapping class group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of any closed, oriented genus-g surface. W. B. R. Lickorish later rediscovered this result with a simpler proof and in addition showed that Dehn twists along 3g−13g-1 explicit curves generate the mapping class group (this is called by the punning name "Lickorish twist theorem"); this number was later improved by Stephen P. Humphries to 2g+12g+1, for g>1>1, which he showed was the minimal number. Lickorish also obtained an analogous result for non-orientable surfaces, which require not only Dehn twists, but also "Y-homeomorphisms." See
