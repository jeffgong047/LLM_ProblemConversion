Definition: General Dehn twist on a compact surface represented by a n-gon. Suppose that c is a simple closed curve in a closed, orientable surface S. Let A be a tubular neighborhood of c. Then A is an annulus, homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of a circle and a unit interval I: c⊂A≅S1×I.^1. Give A coordinates (s, t) where s is a complex number of the form eiθ^iθ with θ∈[0,2π],θ∈[0,2π], and t ∈ [0, 1]. Let f be the map from S to itself which is the identity outside of A and inside A we have f(s,t)=(sei2πt,t).(s,t)=(se^i2,t). Then f is a Dehn twist about the curve c. Dehn twists can also be defined on a non-orientable surface S, provided one starts with a 2-sided simple closed curve c on S.
