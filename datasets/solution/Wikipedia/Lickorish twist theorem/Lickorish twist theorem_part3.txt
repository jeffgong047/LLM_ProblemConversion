Example: An example of a Dehn twist on the torus, along the closed curve a, in blue, where a is an edge of the fundamental polygon representing the torus. The automorphism on the fundamental group of the torus induced by the self-homeomorphism of the Dehn twist along one of the generators of the torus. Consider the torus represented by a fundamental polygon with edges a and b T2≅R2/Z2.𝕋^2≅ℝ^2/ℤ^2. Let a closed curve be the line along the edge a called γaγ_a. Given the choice of gluing homeomorphism in the figure, a tubular neighborhood of the curve γaγ_a will look like a band linked around a doughnut. This neighborhood is homeomorphic to an annulus, say a(0;0,1)=z∈C:0<|z|<1(0;0,1)={z∈ℂ:0<|z|<1} in the complex plane. By extending to the torus the twisting map (eiθ,t)↦(ei(θ+2πt),t)(e^iθ,t)↦(e^i(θ+2),t) of the annulus, through the homeomorphisms of the annulus to an open cylinder to the neighborhood of γaγ_a, yields a Dehn twist of the torus by a. Ta:T2→T2_a:𝕋^2→𝕋^2 This self homeomorphism acts on the closed curve along b. In the tubular neighborhood it takes the curve of b once along the curve of a. A homeomorphism between topological spaces induces a natural isomorphism between their fundamental groups. Therefore one has an automorphism Ta∗:π1(T2)→π1(T2):[x]↦[Ta(x)]T_a_∗:π_1(𝕋^2)→π_1(𝕋^2):[x]↦[T_a(x)] where [x] are the homotopy classes of the closed curve x in the torus. Notice Ta∗([a])=[a]T_a_∗([a])=[a] and Ta∗([b])=[b∗a]T_a_∗([b])=[b*a], where b∗a*a is the path travelled around b then a. Mapping class
