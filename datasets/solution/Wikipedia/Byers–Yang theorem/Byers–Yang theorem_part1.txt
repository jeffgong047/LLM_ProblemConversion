Theorem in quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics, the Byers–Yang theorem states that all physical properties of a doubly connected system (an annulus) enclosing a magnetic flux ΦΦ through the opening are periodic in the flux with period Φ0=hc/eΦ_0=hc/e (the magnetic flux quantum). The theorem was first stated and proven by Nina Byers and Chen-Ning Yang (1961),[1] and further developed by Felix Bloch (1970).[2]
