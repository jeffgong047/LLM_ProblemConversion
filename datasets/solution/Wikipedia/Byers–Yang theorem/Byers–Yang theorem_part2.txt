Proof: An enclosed flux ΦΦ corresponds to a vector potential A(r)(r) inside the annulus with a line integral ∮CA⋅dl=Φ∮_CA=Φ along any path C that circulates around once. One can try to eliminate this vector potential by the gauge transformation ψ′(rn)=exp⁡(ieℏ∑jχ(rj))ψ(rn)ψ'({r_n})=exp(ie/ħ∑_jχ(r_j))ψ({r_n}) of the wave function ψ(rn)ψ({r_n}) of electrons at positions r1,r2,…_1,r_2,…. The gauge-transformed wave function satisfies the same Schrödinger equation as the original wave function, but with a different magnetic vector potential A′(r)=A(r)+∇χ(r)'(r)=A(r)+∇χ(r). It is assumed that the electrons experience zero magnetic field B(r)=∇×A(r)=0(r)=∇(r)=0 at all points r inside the annulus, the field being nonzero only within the opening (where there are no electrons). It is then always possible to find a function χ(r)χ(r) such that A′(r)=0'(r)=0 inside the annulus, so one would conclude that the system with enclosed flux ΦΦ is equivalent to a system with zero enclosed flux. However, for any arbitrary ΦΦ the gauge transformed wave function is no longer single-valued: The phase of ψ′ψ' changes by δϕ=(e/ℏ)∮C∇χ(r)⋅dl=−(e/ℏ)∮CA(r)⋅dl=−2πΦ/Φ0δϕ=(e/ħ)∮_C∇χ(r)=-(e/ħ)∮_CA(r)=-2πΦ/Φ_0 whenever one of the coordinates rn_n is moved along the ring to its starting point. The requirement of a single-valued wave function therefore restricts the gauge transformation to fluxes ΦΦ that are an integer multiple of Φ0Φ_0. Systems that enclose a flux differing by a multiple of h/e/e are equivalent.
