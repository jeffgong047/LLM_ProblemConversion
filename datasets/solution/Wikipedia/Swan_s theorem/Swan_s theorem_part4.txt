geometry: The analogous result in algebraic geometry, due to Serre (1955, §50) applies to vector bundles in the category of affine varieties. Let X be an affine variety with structure sheaf OX,𝒪_X, and Fℱ a coherent sheaf of OX𝒪_X -modules on X. Then Fℱ is the sheaf of germs of a finite-dimensional vector bundle if and only if Γ(F,X),Γ(ℱ,X), the space of sections of F,ℱ, is a projective module over the commutative ring A=Γ(OX,X).=Γ(𝒪_X,X).
