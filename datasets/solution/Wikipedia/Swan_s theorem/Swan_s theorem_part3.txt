Topology: Suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space, and C(X) is the ring of continuous real-valued functions on X. Analogous to the result above, the category of real vector bundles on X is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over C(X). The same result holds if one replaces "real-valued" by "complex-valued" and "real vector bundle" by "complex vector bundle", but it does not hold if one replace the field by a totally disconnected field like the rational numbers. In detail, let Vec(X) be the category of complex vector bundles over X, and let ProjMod(C(X)) be the category of finitely generated projective modules over the C*-algebra C(X). There is a functor Γ : Vec(X) → ProjMod(C(X)) which sends each complex vector bundle E over X to the C(X)-module Γ(X, E) of sections. If τ:(E1,π1)→(E2,π2)τ:(E_1,π_1)→(E_2,π_2) is a morphism of vector bundles over X then π2∘τ=π1π_2∘τ=π_1 and it follows that ∀s∈Γ(X,E1)π2∘τ∘s=π1∘s=idX,∈Γ(X,E_1) π_2∘τ=π_1=id_X, giving the map Γτ:Γ(X,E1)→Γ(X,E2)s↦τ∘sΓτ:Γ(X,E_1)→Γ(X,E_2) s↦τ which respects the module structure (Várilly, 97). Swan's theorem asserts that the functor Γ is an equivalence of categories. Algebraic
