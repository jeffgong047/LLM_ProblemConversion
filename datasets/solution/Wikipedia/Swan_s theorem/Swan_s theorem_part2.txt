geometry: Suppose M is a smooth manifold (not necessarily compact), and E is a smooth vector bundle over M. Then Γ(E), the space of smooth sections of E, is a module over C∞(M) (the commutative algebra of smooth real-valued functions on M). Swan's theorem states that this module is finitely generated and projective over C∞(M). In other words, every vector bundle is a direct summand of some trivial bundle: M×Rk×ℝ^k for some k. The theorem can be proved by constructing a bundle epimorphism from a trivial bundle M×Rk→E.×ℝ^k. This can be done by, for instance, exhibiting sections s1...sk with the property that for each point p, {si(p)} span the fiber over p. When M is connected, the converse is also true: every finitely generated projective module over C∞(M) arises in this way from some smooth vector bundle on M. Such a module can be viewed as a smooth function f on M with values in the n × n idempotent matrices for some n. The fiber of the corresponding vector bundle over x is then the range of f(x). If M is not connected, the converse does not hold unless one allows for vector bundles of non-constant rank (which means admitting manifolds of non-constant dimension). For example, if M is a zero-dimensional 2-point manifold, the module R⊕0ℝ⊕0 is finitely-generated and projective over C∞(M)≅R×R^∞(M)≅ℝ×ℝ but is not free, and so cannot correspond to the sections of any (constant-rank) vector bundle over M (all of which are trivial). Another way of stating the above is that for any connected smooth manifold M, the section functor Γ from the category of smooth vector bundles over M to the category of finitely generated, projective C∞(M)-modules is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. Therefore the category of smooth vector bundles on M is equivalent to the category of finitely generated, projective C∞(M)-modules. Details may be found in (Nestruev 2003).
