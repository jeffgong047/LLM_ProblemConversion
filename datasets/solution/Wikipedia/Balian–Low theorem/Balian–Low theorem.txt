In mathematics, the Balian–Low theorem in Fourier analysis is named for Roger Balian and Francis E. Low.
The theorem states that there is no well-localized window function (or Gabor atom) g either in time or frequency for an exact Gabor frame (Riesz Basis).


Statement[edit]
Suppose g is a square-integrable function on the real line, and consider the so-called Gabor system

gm,n(x)=e2πimbxg(x−na),_m,n(x)=e^2g(x-na),
for integers m and n, and a,b>0 satisfying ab=1.  The Balian–Low theorem states that if  

gm,n:m,n∈Z{g_m,n:m,n∈ℤ}
is an orthonormal basis for  the Hilbert space

L2(R),^2(ℝ),
then either

∫−∞∞x2|g(x)|2dx=∞or∫−∞∞ξ2|g^(ξ)|2dξ=∞.∫_-∞^∞x^2|g(x)|^2 dx=∞  or  ∫_-∞^∞ξ^2|ĝ(ξ)|^2 dξ=∞.
Generalizations[edit]
The Balian–Low theorem has been extended to exact Gabor frames.
