Statement: Suppose g is a square-integrable function on the real line, and consider the so-called Gabor system gm,n(x)=e2πimbxg(x−na),_m,n(x)=e^2g(x-na), for integers m and n, and a,b>0 satisfying ab=1. The Balian–Low theorem states that if gm,n:m,n∈Z{g_m,n:m,n∈ℤ} is an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space L2(R),^2(ℝ), then either ∫−∞∞x2|g(x)|2dx=∞or∫−∞∞ξ2|g^(ξ)|2dξ=∞.∫_-∞^∞x^2|g(x)|^2 dx=∞ or ∫_-∞^∞ξ^2|ĝ(ξ)|^2 dξ=∞.
