Overview: Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g𝔤. Now let H be an arbitrary closed subgroup of G. It is necessary to show that H is a smooth embedded submanifold of G. The first step is to identify something that could be the Lie algebra of H, that is, the tangent space of H at the identity. The challenge is that H is not assumed to have any smoothness and therefore it is not clear how one may define its tangent space. To proceed, define the "Lie algebra" h𝔥 of H by the formula h=X∣etX∈H,∀t∈R.𝔥={X^tX, ∈ℝ}. It is not difficult to show that h𝔥 is a Lie subalgebra of g𝔤.[6] In particular, h𝔥 is a subspace of g𝔤, which one might hope to be the tangent space of H at the identity. For this idea to work, however, h𝔥 must be big enough to capture some interesting information about H. If, for example, H were some large subgroup of G but h𝔥 turned out to be zero, h𝔥 would not be helpful. The key step, then, is to show that h𝔥 actually captures all the elements of H that are sufficiently close to the identity. That is to say, it is necessary to prove the following critical lemma: Lemma — Take a small neighborhood U of the origin in g𝔤 such that the exponential map sends U diffeomorphically onto some neighborhood V of the identity in G, and let log:V→Ulog:V be the inverse of the exponential map. Then there is some smaller neighborhood W⊂V such that if h belongs to W∩H, then log⁡(h)log(h) belongs to h𝔥.[7] Once this has been established, one can use exponential coordinates on W, that is, writing each g∈W (not necessarily in H) as g=eX=e^X for X=log⁡(g)=log(g). In these coordinates, the lemma says that X corresponds to a point in H precisely if X belongs to h⊂g𝔥⊂𝔤. That is to say, in exponential coordinates near the identity, H looks like h⊂g𝔥⊂𝔤. Since h𝔥 is just a subspace of g𝔤, this means that h⊂g𝔥⊂𝔤 is just like Rk⊂Rnℝ^k⊂ℝ^n, with k=dim⁡(h)=(𝔥) and n=dim⁡(g)=(𝔤). Thus, we have exhibited a "slice coordinate system" in which H⊂G looks locally like Rk⊂Rnℝ^k⊂ℝ^n, which is the condition for an embedded submanifold.[8] It is worth noting that Rossmann shows that for any subgroup H of G (not necessarily closed), the Lie algebra h𝔥 of H is a Lie subalgebra of g𝔤.[9] Rossmann then goes on to introduce coordinates[10] on H that make the identity component of H into a Lie group. It is important to note, however, that the topology on H coming from these coordinates is not the subset topology. That it so say, the identity component of H is an immersed submanifold of G but not an embedded submanifold. In particular, the lemma stated above does not hold if H is not closed.
