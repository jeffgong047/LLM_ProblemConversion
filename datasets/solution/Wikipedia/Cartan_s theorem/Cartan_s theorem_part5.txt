closed: A few sufficient conditions for H ⊂ G being closed, hence an embedded Lie group, are given below. All classical groups are closed in GL(F, n), where F is Rℝ, Cℂ, or Hℍ, the quaternions. A subgroup that is locally closed is closed.[16] A subgroup is locally closed if every point has a neighborhood in U ⊂G such that H ∩ U is closed in U. If H = AB = {ab | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}, where A is a compact group and B is a closed set, then H is closed.[17] If h ⊂ g is a Lie subalgebra such that for no X ∈ g \ h, [X, h] ∈ h, then Γ(h), the group generated by eh, is closed in G.[18] If X ∈ g, then the one-parameter subgroup generated by X is not closed if and only if X is similar over Cℂ to a diagonal matrix with two entries of irrational ratio.[19] Let h ⊂ g be a Lie subalgebra. If there is a simply connected compact group K with k isomorphic to h, then Γ(h) is closed in G. [20] If G is simply connected and h ⊂ g is an ideal, then the connected Lie subgroup with Lie algebra h is closed. [21]
