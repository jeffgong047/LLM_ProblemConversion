subgroup: The torus G. Imagine a bent helix laid out on the surface picturing H. If a = p⁄q in lowest terms, the helix will close up on itself at (1, 1) after p rotations in φ and q rotations in θ. If a is irrational, the helix winds indefinitely. For an example of a subgroup that is not an embedded Lie subgroup, consider the torus and an "irrational winding of the torus". G=T2=(e2πiθ00e2πiϕ)|θ,ϕ∈R,=𝕋^2={.[ e^2θ 0; 0 e^2ϕ ]|θ,ϕ∈ℝ}, and its subgroup H=(e2πiθ00e2πiaθ)|θ∈RwithLiealgebrah=(iθ00iaθ)|θ∈R,={.[ e^2θ 0; 0 e^2θ ]|θ∈ℝ}withLiealgebra𝔥={.[ iθ 0; 0 iaθ ]|θ∈ℝ}, with a irrational. Then H is dense in G and hence not closed.[11] In the relative topology, a small open subset of H is composed of infinitely many almost parallel line segments on the surface of the torus. This means that H is not locally path connected. In the group topology, the small open sets are single line segments on the surface of the torus and H is locally path connected. The example shows that for some groups H one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood U in the relative topology τr of the identity that are exponentials of elements of h, yet they cannot be connected to the identity with a path staying in U.[12] The group (H, τr) is not a Lie group. While the map exp : h → (H, τr) is an analytic bijection, its inverse is not continuous. That is, if U ⊂ h corresponds to a small open interval −ε < θ < ε, there is no open V ⊂ (H, τr) with log(V) ⊂ U due to the appearance of the sets V. However, with the group topology τg, (H, τg) is a Lie group. With this topology the injection ι : (H, τg) → G is an analytic injective immersion, but not a homeomorphism, hence not an embedding. There are also examples of groups H for which one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood (in the relative topology) of the identity that are not exponentials of elements of h.[12] For closed subgroups this is not the case as the proof below of the theorem shows.
