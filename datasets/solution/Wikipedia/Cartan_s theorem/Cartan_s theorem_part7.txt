Proof: John von Neumann in 1929 proved the theorem in the case of matrix groups as given here. He was prominent in many areas, including quantum mechanics, set theory and the foundations of mathematics. The proof is given for matrix groups with G = GL(n, R) for concreteness and relative simplicity, since matrices and their exponential mapping are easier concepts than in the general case. Historically, this case was proven first, by John von Neumann in 1929, and inspired Cartan to prove the full closed subgroup theorem in 1930.[5] The proof for general G is formally identical,[24] except that elements of the Lie algebra are left invariant vector fields on G and the exponential mapping is the time one flow of the vector field. If H ⊂ G with G closed in GL(n, R), then H is closed in GL(n, R), so the specialization to GL(n, R) instead of arbitrary G ⊂ GL(n, R) matters little. Proof of the key
