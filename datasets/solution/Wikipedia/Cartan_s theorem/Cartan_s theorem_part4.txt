It follows every closed subgroup is an embedded submanifold of GL(n, C)[15] The homogeneous space construction theorem — If H ⊂ G is a closed Lie subgroup, then G/H, the left coset space, has a unique real-analytic manifold structure such that the quotient map π:G → G/H is an analytic submersion. The left action given by g1 ⋅ (g2H) = (g1g2)H turns G/H into a homogeneous G-space. The closed subgroup theorem now simplifies the hypotheses considerably, a priori widening the class of homogeneous spaces. Every closed subgroup yields a homogeneous space. In a similar way, the closed subgroup theorem simplifies the hypothesis in the following theorem. If X is a set with transitive group action and the isotropy group or stabilizer of a point x ∈ X is a closed Lie subgroup, then X has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the action is smooth.
