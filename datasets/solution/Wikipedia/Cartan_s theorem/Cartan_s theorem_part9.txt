theorem: For j ≥ i, the image in H of Bj under Φ form a neighborhood basis at I. This is, by the way it is constructed, a neighborhood basis both in the group topology and the relative topology. Since multiplication in G is analytic, the left and right translates of this neighborhood basis by a group element g ∈ G gives a neighborhood basis at g. These bases restricted to H gives neighborhood bases at all h ∈ H. The topology generated by these bases is the relative topology. The conclusion is that the relative topology is the same as the group topology. Next, construct coordinate charts on H. First define φ1 : e(U) ⊂ G → g, g ↦ log(g). This is an analytic bijection with analytic inverse. Furthermore, if h ∈ H, then φ1(h) ∈ h. By fixing a basis for g = h ⊕ s and identifying g with Rnℝ^n, then in these coordinates φ1(h) = (x1(h), …, xm(h), 0, …, 0), where m is the dimension of h. This shows that (eU, φ1) is a slice chart. By translating the charts obtained from the countable neighborhood basis used above one obtains slice charts around every point in H. This shows that H is an embedded submanifold of G. Moreover, multiplication m, and inversion i in H are analytic since these operations are analytic in G and restriction to a submanifold (embedded or immersed) with the relative topology again yield analytic operations m : H × H → G and i : H × H → G.[28] But since H is embedded, m : H × H → H and i : H × H → H are analytic as well.[29] See
