Notes: ^ Lee 2003 Theorem 20.10. Lee states and proves this theorem in all generality. ^ Rossmann 2002 Theorem 1, Section 2.7 Rossmann states the theorem for linear groups. The statement is that there is an open subset U ⊂ g such that U × H → G, (X, H) → eXH is an analytic bijection onto an open neighborhood of H in G. ^ Hall 2015 For linear groups, Hall proves a similar result in Corollary 3.45. ^ Cartan 1930 See § 26. ^ a b von Neumann (1929); Bochner (1958). ^ Hall 2015 Theorem 3.20 ^ Hall 2015 Theorem 3.42 ^ Lee 2003 Chapter 5 ^ Rossmann 2002 Chapter 2, Proposition 1 and Corollary 7 ^ Rossmann 2002 Section 2.3 ^ Lee 2003 Example 7.3 ^ a b Rossmann 2002 See comment to Corollary 5, Section 2.2. ^ E.g.

Section 2.7 ^ Rossmann 2002 Problem 5. Section 2.7 ^ Hall 2015 The result follows from Theorem 5.6 ^ Hall 2015 Exercise 14 in Chapter 5 ^ Lee 2003 Corollary 15.30. ^ Rossmann 2002 Problem 2. Section 2.7. ^ See for instance Lee 2003 Chapter 21 ^ For this one can choose open balls, Β = {Bk| diam(Bk) = 1⁄(k + m), k ∈ N} for some large enough m such that B1 ⊂ U1. Here the metric obtained from the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is used. ^ Willard 1970 By problem 17G, s is sequentially compact, meaning every sequence has a convergent subsequence. ^ Willard 1970 Corollary 10.5. ^ Lee 2003 Proposition 8.22. ^ Lee 2003 Corollary 8.25.
