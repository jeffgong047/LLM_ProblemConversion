Example: Suppose T(n)(n) is defined as 1 for integers 0≤n≤30≤3 and n2+74T(⌊12n⌋)+T(⌈34n⌉)^2+7/4T(⌊1/2n⌋)+T(⌈3/4n⌉) for integers n>3>3. In applying the Akra–Bazzi method, the first step is to find the value of p for which 74(12)p+(34)p=17/4(1/2)^p+(3/4)^p=1. In this example, p=2=2. Then, using the formula, the asymptotic behavior can be determined as follows:[3] T(x)∈Θ(xp(1+∫1xg(u)up+1du))=Θ(x2(1+∫1xu2u3du))=Θ(x2(1+ln⁡x))=Θ(x2log⁡x).T(x) ∈Θ(x^p(1+∫_1^xg(u)/u^p+1 du)) =Θ(x^2(1+∫_1^xu^2/u^3 du)) =Θ(x^2(1+)) =Θ(x^2).
