Significance: The Akra–Bazzi method is more useful than most other techniques for determining asymptotic behavior because it covers such a wide variety of cases. Its primary application is the approximation of the running time of many divide-and-conquer algorithms. For example, in the merge sort, the number of comparisons required in the worst case, which is roughly proportional to its runtime, is given recursively as T(1)=0(1)=0 and T(n)=T(⌊12n⌋)+T(⌈12n⌉)+n−1(n)=T(⌊1/2n⌋)+T(⌈1/2n⌉)+n-1 for integers n>0>0, and can thus be computed using the Akra–Bazzi method to be Θ(nlog⁡n)Θ(n).
