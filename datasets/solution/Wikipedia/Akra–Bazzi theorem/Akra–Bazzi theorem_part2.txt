Formulation: The Akra–Bazzi method applies to recurrence formulas of the form:[1] T(x)=g(x)+∑i=1kaiT(bix+hi(x))forx≥x0.(x)=g(x)+∑_i=1^ka_iT(b_ix+h_i(x)) forx_0. The conditions for usage are: sufficient base cases are provided ai_i and bi_i are constants for all i ai>0_i>0 for all i 0<bi<10<b_i<1 for all i |g′(x)|∈O(xc)|g'(x)|(x^c), where c is a constant and O notates Big O notation |hi(x)|∈O(x(log⁡x)2)|h_i(x)|(x/()^2) for all i x0_0 is a constant The asymptotic behavior of T(x)(x) is found by determining the value of p for which ∑i=1kaibip=1∑_i=1^ka_ib_i^p=1 and plugging that value into the equation:[2] T(x)∈Θ(xp(1+∫1xg(u)up+1du))(x)∈Θ(x^p(1+∫_1^xg(u)/u^p+1du)) (see Θ). Intuitively, hi(x)_i(x) represents a small perturbation in the index of T. By noting that ⌊bix⌋=bix+(⌊bix⌋−bix)_ix⌋=b_ix+(_ix⌋-b_ix) and that the absolute value of ⌊bix⌋−bix_ix⌋-b_ix is always between 0 and 1, hi(x)_i(x) can be used to ignore the floor function in the index. Similarly, one can also ignore the ceiling function. For example, T(n)=n+T(12n)(n)=n+T(1/2n) and T(n)=n+T(⌊12n⌋)(n)=n+T(⌊1/2n⌋) will, as per the Akra–Bazzi theorem, have the same asymptotic behavior.
