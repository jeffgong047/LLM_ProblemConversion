These Reuleaux polygons have constant width, and all have the same width; therefore by Barbier's theorem they also have equal perimeters. In geometry, Barbier's theorem states that every curve of constant width has perimeter π times its width, regardless of its precise shape.[1] This theorem was first published by Joseph-Émile Barbier in 1860.[2]
