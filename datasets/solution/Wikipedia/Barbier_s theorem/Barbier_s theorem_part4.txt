dimensions: The analogue of Barbier's theorem for surfaces of constant width is false. In particular, the unit sphere has surface area 4π≈12.5664π≈12.566, while the surface of revolution of a Reuleaux triangle with the same constant width has surface area 8π−43π2≈11.9738π-43π^2≈11.973.[5] Instead, Barbier's theorem generalizes to bodies of constant brightness, three-dimensional convex sets for which every two-dimensional projection has the same area. These all have the same surface area as a sphere of the same projected area. And in general, if S is a convex subset of Rnℝ^n, for which every (n−1)-dimensional projection has area of the unit ball in Rn−1ℝ^n-1, then the surface area of S is equal to that of the unit sphere in Rnℝ^n. This follows from the general form of Crofton formula.[6] See
