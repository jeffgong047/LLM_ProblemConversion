Although f being k + 1 times differentiable on the open interval between a and x does imply that f(k) is continuous on the open interval between a and x, it does not imply that f(k) is continuous on the closed interval between a and x, i.e. it does not imply that f(k) is continuous at the endpoints of that interval. Consider, for example, the function f : [0,1] → R defined to equal sin⁡(1/x)sin(1/x) on (0,1](0,1] and with f(0)=0(0)=0. This is not continuous at 0, but is continuous on (0,1)(0,1). Moreover, one can show that this function has an antiderivative. Therefore that antiderivative is differentiable on (0,1)(0,1), its derivative (the function f) is continuous on the open interval (0,1)(0,1), but its derivative f is not continuous on the closed interval [0,1][0,1]. So the theorem would not apply in this case. ^ Kline 1998, §20.3; Apostol 1967, §7.7. ^ Apostol 1967, §7.7. ^ Apostol 1967, §7.5. ^ Apostol 1967, §7.6 ^ Rudin 1987, §10.26 ^ This follows from iterated application of the theorem that if the partial derivatives of a function f exist in a neighborhood of a and are continuous at a, then the function is differentiable at a.
