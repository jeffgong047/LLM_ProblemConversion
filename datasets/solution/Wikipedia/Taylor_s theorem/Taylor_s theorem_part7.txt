Example: Approximation of ex^x (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk_k of order k=1,…,7=1,…,7 centered at x=0=0 (red). Suppose that we wish to find the approximate value of the function f(x)=ex(x)=e^x on the interval [−1,1][-1,1] while ensuring that the error in the approximation is no more than 10−5. In this example we pretend that we only know the following properties of the exponential function: e0=1,ddxex=ex,ex>0,x∈R.^0=1, d/dxe^x=e^x,^x>0,∈ℝ. (★) From these properties it follows that f(k)(x)=ex^(k)(x)=e^x for all k, and in particular, f(k)(0)=1^(k)(0)=1. Hence the k-th order Taylor polynomial of f at 00 and its remainder term in the Lagrange form are given by Pk(x)=1+x+x22!+⋯+xkk!,Rk(x)=eξ(k+1)!xk+1,_k(x)=1+x+x^2/2!+⋯+x^k/k!,_k(x)=e^ξ/(k+1)!x^k+1, where ξξ is some number between 0 and x. Since ex is increasing by (★), we can simply use ex≤1^x≤1 for x∈[−1,0]∈[-1,0] to estimate the remainder on the subinterval [−1,0][-1,0]. To obtain an upper bound for the remainder on [0,1][0,1], we use the property eξ<ex^ξ<e^x for 0<ξ<x0<ξ<x to estimate ex=1+x+eξ2x2<1+x+ex2x2,0<x≤1^x=1+x+e^ξ/2x^2<1+x+e^x/2x^2, 0<x≤1 using the second order Taylor expansion. Then we solve for ex to deduce that ex≤1+x1−x22=21+x2−x2≤4,0≤x≤1^x≤1+x/1-x^2/2=21+x/2-x^2≤4, 0≤1 simply by maximizing the numerator and minimizing the denominator. Combining these estimates for ex we see that |Rk(x)|≤4|x|k+1(k+1)!≤4(k+1)!,−1≤x≤1,|R_k(x)|≤4|x|^k+1/(k+1)!≤4/(k+1)!, -1≤1, so the required precision is certainly reached, when 4(k+1)!<10−5⟺4⋅105<(k+1)!⟺k≥9.4/(k+1)!<10^-5 ⟺ 4·10^5<(k+1)! ⟺≥9. (See factorial or compute by hand the values 9!=3628809!=362880 and 10!=362880010!=3628800.) As a conclusion, Taylor's theorem leads to the approximation ex=1+x+x22!+⋯+x99!+R9(x),|R9(x)|<10−5,−1≤x≤1.^x=1+x+x^2/2!+⋯+x^9/9!+R_9(x), |R_9(x)|<10^-5, -1≤1. For instance, this approximation provides a decimal expression e≈2.71828≈2.71828, correct up to five decimal places. Relationship to
