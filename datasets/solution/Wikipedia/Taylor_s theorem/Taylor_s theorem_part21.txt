remainder: Due to absolute continuity of f(k)^(k) on the closed interval between a and x its derivative f(k+1)^(k+1) exists as an L1^1-function, and we can use fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that f(k)^(k) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval between a and x, and this leads to the same result than using the mean value theorem. The fundamental theorem of calculus states that f(x)=f(a)+∫axf′(t)dt.(x)=f(a)+∫_a^x f'(t) dt. Now we can integrate by parts and use the fundamental theorem of calculus again to see that f(x)=f(a)+(xf′(x)−af′(a))−∫axtf″(t)dt=f(a)+x(f′(a)+∫axf″(t)dt)−af′(a)−∫axtf″(t)dt=f(a)+(x−a)f′(a)+∫ax(x−t)f″(t)dt,f(x) =f(a)+(xf'(x)-af'(a))-∫_a^xtf”(t) dt =f(a)+x(f'(a)+∫_a^xf”(t) dt)-af'(a)-∫_a^xtf”(t) dt =f(a)+(x-a)f'(a)+∫_a^x (x-t)f”(t) dt, which is exactly Taylor's theorem with remainder in the integral form in the case k=1=1. The general statement is proved using induction. Suppose that f(x)=f(a)+f′(a)1!(x−a)+⋯+f(k)(a)k!(x−a)k+∫axf(k+1)(t)k!(x−t)kdt.(x)=f(a)+f'(a)/1!(x-a)+⋯+f^(k)(a)/k!(x-a)^k+∫_a^xf^(k+1)(t)/k!(x-t)^k dt. (★★★★) Integrating the remainder term by parts we arrive at ∫axf(k+1)(t)k!(x−t)kdt=−[f(k+1)(t)(k+1)k!(x−t)k+1]ax+∫axf(k+2)(t)(k+1)k!(x−t)k+1dt=f(k+1)(a)(k+1)!(x−a)k+1+∫axf(k+2)(t)(k+1)!(x−t)k+1dt.∫_a^xf^(k+1)(t)/k!(x-t)^k dt= -[f^(k+1)(t)/(k+1)k!(x-t)^k+1]_a^x+∫_a^xf^(k+2)(t)/(k+1)k!(x-t)^k+1 dt = {f^(k+1)(a)/(k+1)!(x-a)^k+1+∫_a^xf^(k+2)(t)/(k+1)!(x-t)^k+1 dt. Substituting this into the formula in (★★★★) shows that if it holds for the value k, it must also hold for the value k+1+1. Therefore, since it holds for k=1=1, it must hold for every positive integer k. Derivation for the remainder of multivariate Taylor
