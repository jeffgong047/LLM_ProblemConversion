remainder: Under stronger regularity assumptions on f there are several precise formulas for the remainder term Rk of the Taylor polynomial, the most common ones being the following. Mean-value forms of the remainder — Let f : R → R be k + 1 times differentiable on the open interval with f(k) continuous on the closed interval between a and x.[7] Then Rk(x)=f(k+1)(ξL)(k+1)!(x−a)k+1_k(x)=f^(k+1)(ξ_L)/(k+1)!(x-a)^k+1 for some real number ξLξ_L between a and x. This is the Lagrange form[8] of the remainder. Similarly, Rk(x)=f(k+1)(ξC)k!(x−ξC)k(x−a)_k(x)=f^(k+1)(ξ_C)/k!(x-ξ_C)^k(x-a) for some real number ξCξ_C between a and x. This is the Cauchy form[9] of the remainder. Both can be thought of as specific cases of the following result: Consider p>0>0 Rk(x)=f(k+1)(ξS)k!(x−ξC)k+1−p(x−a)pp_k(x)=f^(k+1)(ξ_S)/k!(x-ξ_C)^k+1-p(x-a)^p/p for some real number ξSξ_S between a and x. This is the Schlömilch form of the remainder (sometimes called the Schlömilch-Roché). The choice p=k+1=k+1 is the Lagrange form, whilst the choice p=1=1 is the Cauchy form. These refinements of Taylor's theorem are usually proved using the mean value theorem, whence the name. Additionally, notice that this is precisely the mean value theorem when k=0=0. Also other similar expressions can be found. For example, if G(t) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, then Rk(x)=f(k+1)(ξ)k!(x−ξ)kG(x)−G(a)G′(ξ)_k(x)=f^(k+1)(ξ)/k!(x-ξ)^kG(x)-G(a)/G'(ξ) for some number ξξ between a and x. This version covers the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder as special cases, and is proved below using Cauchy's mean value theorem. The Lagrange form is obtained by taking G(t)=(x−t)k+1(t)=(x-t)^k+1 and the Cauchy form is obtained by taking G(t)=t−a(t)=t-a. The statement for the integral form of the remainder is more advanced than the previous ones, and requires understanding of Lebesgue integration theory for the full generality. However, it holds also in the sense of Riemann integral provided the (k + 1)th derivative of f is continuous on the closed interval [a,x]. Integral form of the remainder[10] — Let f(k)^(k) be absolutely continuous on the closed interval between a and x. Then Rk(x)=∫axf(k+1)(t)k!(x−t)kdt._k(x)=∫_a^xf^(k+1)(t)/k!(x-t)^k dt. Due to absolute continuity of f(k) on the closed interval between a and x, its derivative f(k+1) exists as an L1-function, and the result can be proven by a formal calculation using fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts.
