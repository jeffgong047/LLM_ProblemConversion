series: The Taylor series of f will converge in some interval in which all its derivatives are bounded and do not grow too fast as k goes to infinity. (However, even if the Taylor series converges, it might not converge to f, as explained below; f is then said to be non-analytic.) One might think of the Taylor series f(x)≈∑k=0∞ck(x−a)k=c0+c1(x−a)+c2(x−a)2+⋯(x)≈∑_k=0^∞c_k(x-a)^k=c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+⋯ of an infinitely many times differentiable function f : R → R as its "infinite order Taylor polynomial" at a. Now the estimates for the remainder imply that if, for any r, the derivatives of f are known to be bounded over (a − r, a + r), then for any order k and for any r > 0 there exists a constant Mk,r > 0 such that |Rk(x)|≤Mk,r|x−a|k+1(k+1)!|R_k(x)|_k,r|x-a|^k+1/(k+1)! (★★) for every x ∈ (a − r,a + r). Sometimes the constants Mk,r can be chosen in such way that Mk,r is bounded above, for fixed r and all k. Then the Taylor series of f converges uniformly to some analytic function Tf:(a−r,a+r)→RTf(x)=∑k=0∞f(k)(a)k!(x−a)k T_f:(a-r,a+r)→ℝ T_f(x)=∑_k=0^∞f^(k)(a)/k!(x-a)^k (One also gets convergence even if Mk,r is not bounded above as long as it grows slowly enough.) The limit function Tf is by definition always analytic, but it is not necessarily equal to the original function f, even if f is infinitely differentiable. In this case, we say f is a non-analytic smooth function, for example a flat function: f:R→Rf(x)=e−1x2x>00x≤0. f:ℝ→ℝ f(x)=e^-1/x^2 x>0 0 x≤0. Using the chain rule repeatedly by mathematical induction, one shows that for any order k, f(k)(x)=pk(x)x3k⋅e−1x2x>00x≤0^(k)(x)=p_k(x)/x^3k^-1/x^2 x>0 0 x≤0 for some polynomial pk of degree 2(k − 1). The function e−1x2^-1/x^2 tends to zero faster than any polynomial as x→0→0, so f is infinitely many times differentiable and f(k)(0) = 0 for every positive integer k. The above results all hold in this case: The Taylor series of f converges uniformly to the zero function Tf(x) = 0, which is analytic with all coefficients equal to zero. The function f is unequal to this Taylor series, and hence non-analytic. For any order k ∈ N and radius r > 0 there exists Mk,r > 0 satisfying the remainder bound (★★) above. However, as k increases for fixed r, the value of Mk,r grows more quickly than rk, and the error does not go to zero. Taylor's theorem in complex
