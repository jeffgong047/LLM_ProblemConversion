remainder: Let G be any real-valued function, continuous on the closed interval between a and x and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between a and x, and define F(t)=f(t)+f′(t)(x−t)+f″(t)2!(x−t)2+⋯+f(k)(t)k!(x−t)k.(t)=f(t)+f'(t)(x-t)+f”(t)/2!(x-t)^2+⋯+f^(k)(t)/k!(x-t)^k. For t∈[a,x]∈[a,x]. Then, by Cauchy's mean value theorem, F′(ξ)G′(ξ)=F(x)−F(a)G(x)−G(a)F'(ξ)/G'(ξ)=F(x)-F(a)/G(x)-G(a) (★★★) for some ξξ on the open interval between a and x. Note that here the numerator F(x)−F(a)=Rk(x)(x)-F(a)=R_k(x) is exactly the remainder of the Taylor polynomial for y=f(x)=f(x). Compute F′(t)=f′(t)+(f″(t)(x−t)−f′(t))+(f(3)(t)2!(x−t)2−f(2)(t)1!(x−t))+⋯⋯+(f(k+1)(t)k!(x−t)k−f(k)(t)(k−1)!(x−t)k−1)=f(k+1)(t)k!(x−t)k,F'(t)= f'(t)+(f”(t)(x-t)-f'(t))+(f^(3)(t)/2!(x-t)^2-f^(2)(t)/1!(x-t))+⋯ ⋯+(f^(k+1)(t)/k!(x-t)^k-f^(k)(t)/(k-1)!(x-t)^k-1)=f^(k+1)(t)/k!(x-t)^k, plug it into (★★★) and rearrange terms to find that Rk(x)=f(k+1)(ξ)k!(x−ξ)kG(x)−G(a)G′(ξ)._k(x)=f^(k+1)(ξ)/k!(x-ξ)^kG(x)-G(a)/G'(ξ). This is the form of the remainder term mentioned after the actual statement of Taylor's theorem with remainder in the mean value form. The Lagrange form of the remainder is found by choosing G(t)=(x−t)k+1(t)=(x-t)^k+1 and the Cauchy form by choosing G(t)=t−a(t)=t-a. Remark. Using this method one can also recover the integral form of the remainder by choosing G(t)=∫atf(k+1)(s)k!(x−s)kds,(t)=∫_a^tf^(k+1)(s)/k!(x-s)^k ds, but the requirements for f needed for the use of mean value theorem are too strong, if one aims to prove the claim in the case that f(k) is only absolutely continuous. However, if one uses Riemann integral instead of Lebesgue integral, the assumptions cannot be weakened. Derivation for the integral form of the
