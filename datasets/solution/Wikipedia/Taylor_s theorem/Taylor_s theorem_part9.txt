functions: Let I ⊂ R be an open interval. By definition, a function f : I → R is real analytic if it is locally defined by a convergent power series. This means that for every a ∈ I there exists some r > 0 and a sequence of coefficients ck ∈ R such that (a − r, a + r) ⊂ I and f(x)=∑k=0∞ck(x−a)k=c0+c1(x−a)+c2(x−a)2+⋯,|x−a|<r.(x)=∑_k=0^∞c_k(x-a)^k=c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+⋯, |x-a|<r. In general, the radius of convergence of a power series can be computed from the Cauchy–Hadamard formula 1R=limsupk→∞|ck|1k.1/R=lim sup_k→∞|c_k|^1/k. This result is based on comparison with a geometric series, and the same method shows that if the power series based on a converges for some b ∈ R, it must converge uniformly on the closed interval [a−rb,a+rb][a-r_b,a+r_b], where rb=|b−a|_b=-a|. Here only the convergence of the power series is considered, and it might well be that (a − R,a + R) extends beyond the domain I of f. The Taylor polynomials of the real analytic function f at a are simply the finite truncations Pk(x)=∑j=0kcj(x−a)j,cj=f(j)(a)j!_k(x)=∑_j=0^kc_j(x-a)^j,_j=f^(j)(a)/j! of its locally defining power series, and the corresponding remainder terms are locally given by the analytic functions Rk(x)=∑j=k+1∞cj(x−a)j=(x−a)khk(x),|x−a|<r._k(x)=∑_j=k+1^∞c_j(x-a)^j=(x-a)^kh_k(x), |x-a|<r. Here the functions hk:(a−r,a+r)→Rhk(x)=(x−a)∑j=0∞ck+1+j(x−a)j h_k:(a-r,a+r)→ℝ h_k(x)=(x-a)∑_j=0^∞c_k+1+j(x-a)^j are also analytic, since their defining power series have the same radius of convergence as the original series. Assuming that [a − r, a + r] ⊂ I and r < R, all these series converge uniformly on (a − r, a + r). Naturally, in the case of analytic functions one can estimate the remainder term Rk(x)_k(x) by the tail of the sequence of the derivatives f′(a) at the center of the expansion, but using complex analysis also another possibility arises, which is described below.
