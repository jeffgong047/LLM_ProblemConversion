theorem: The precise statement of the most basic version of Taylor's theorem is as follows: Taylor's theorem[4][5][6] — Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let the function f : R → R be k times differentiable at the point a ∈ R. Then there exists a function hk : R → R such that f(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)+f″(a)2!(x−a)2+⋯+f(k)(a)k!(x−a)k+hk(x)(x−a)k,(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f”(a)/2!(x-a)^2+⋯+f^(k)(a)/k!(x-a)^k+h_k(x)(x-a)^k, and limx→ahk(x)=0.lim_xh_k(x)=0. This is called the Peano form of the remainder. The polynomial appearing in Taylor's theorem is the kk-th order Taylor polynomial Pk(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)+f″(a)2!(x−a)2+⋯+f(k)(a)k!(x−a)k_k(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f”(a)/2!(x-a)^2+⋯+f^(k)(a)/k!(x-a)^k of the function f at the point a. The Taylor polynomial is the unique "asymptotic best fit" polynomial in the sense that if there exists a function hk : R → R and a k-th order polynomial p such that f(x)=p(x)+hk(x)(x−a)k,limx→ahk(x)=0,(x)=p(x)+h_k(x)(x-a)^k, lim_xh_k(x)=0, then p = Pk. Taylor's theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the remainder term Rk(x)=f(x)−Pk(x),_k(x)=f(x)-P_k(x), which is the approximation error when approximating f with its Taylor polynomial. Using the little-o notation, the statement in Taylor's theorem reads as Rk(x)=o(|x−a|k),x→a._k(x)=o(|x-a|^k),. Explicit formulas for the
