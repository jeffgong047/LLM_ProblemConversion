Example: Complex plot of f(z)=11+z2(z)=1/1+z^2. Modulus is shown by elevation and argument by coloring: cyan = 00, blue = π3π/3, violet = 2π32π/3, red = ππ, yellow = 4π34π/3, green = 5π35π/3. The function f:R→Rf(x)=11+x2 f:ℝ→ℝ f(x)=1/1+x^2 is real analytic, that is, locally determined by its Taylor series. This function was plotted above to illustrate the fact that some elementary functions cannot be approximated by Taylor polynomials in neighborhoods of the center of expansion which are too large. This kind of behavior is easily understood in the framework of complex analysis. Namely, the function f extends into a meromorphic function f:C∪∞→C∪∞f(z)=11+z2 f:ℂ∪{∞}→ℂ∪{∞} f(z)=1/1+z^2 on the compactified complex plane. It has simple poles at z=i=i and z=−i=-i, and it is analytic elsewhere. Now its Taylor series centered at z0 converges on any disc B(z0, r) with r < |z − z0|, where the same Taylor series converges at z ∈ C. Therefore, Taylor series of f centered at 0 converges on B(0, 1) and it does not converge for any z ∈ C with |z| > 1 due to the poles at i and −i. For the same reason the Taylor series of f centered at 1 converges on B(1,2)(1,√(2)) and does not converge for any z ∈ C with |z−1|>2-1|>√(2). Generalizations of Taylor's
