analysis: Taylor's theorem generalizes to functions f : C → C which are complex differentiable in an open subset U ⊂ C of the complex plane. However, its usefulness is dwarfed by other general theorems in complex analysis. Namely, stronger versions of related results can be deduced for complex differentiable functions f : U → C using Cauchy's integral formula as follows. Let r > 0 such that the closed disk B(z, r) ∪ S(z, r) is contained in U. Then Cauchy's integral formula with a positive parametrization γ(t) = z + reit of the circle S(z, r) with t∈[0,2π]∈[0,2π] gives f(z)=12πi∫γf(w)w−zdw,f′(z)=12πi∫γf(w)(w−z)2dw,…,f(k)(z)=k!2πi∫γf(w)(w−z)k+1dw.(z)=1/2∫_γf(w)/w-z dw,'(z)=1/2∫_γf(w)/(w-z)^2 dw, …,^(k)(z)=k!/2∫_γf(w)/(w-z)^k+1 dw. Here all the integrands are continuous on the circle S(z, r), which justifies differentiation under the integral sign. In particular, if f is once complex differentiable on the open set U, then it is actually infinitely many times complex differentiable on U. One also obtains the Cauchy's estimates[12] |f(k)(z)|≤k!2π∫γMr|w−z|k+1dw=k!Mrrk,Mr=max|w−c|=r|f(w)||f^(k)(z)|≤k!/2π∫_γM_r/|w-z|^k+1 dw=k!M_r/r^k,_r=max_|w-c|=r|f(w)| for any z ∈ U and r > 0 such that B(z, r) ∪ S(c, r) ⊂ U. These estimates imply that the complex Taylor series Tf(z)=∑k=0∞f(k)(c)k!(z−c)k_f(z)=∑_k=0^∞f^(k)(c)/k!(z-c)^k of f converges uniformly on any open disk B(c,r)⊂U(c,r) with S(c,r)⊂U(c,r) into some function Tf. Furthermore, using the contour integral formulas for the derivatives f(k)(c), Tf(z)=∑k=0∞(z−c)k2πi∫γf(w)(w−c)k+1dw=12πi∫γf(w)w−c∑k=0∞(z−cw−c)kdw=12πi∫γf(w)w−c(11−z−cw−c)dw=12πi∫γf(w)w−zdw=f(z),T_f(z) =∑_k=0^∞(z-c)^k/2∫_γf(w)/(w-c)^k+1 dw =1/2∫_γf(w)/w-c∑_k=0^∞(z-c/w-c)^k dw =1/2∫_γf(w)/w-c(1/1-z-c/w-c) dw =1/2∫_γf(w)/w-z dw=f(z), so any complex differentiable function f in an open set U ⊂ C is in fact complex analytic. All that is said for real analytic functions here holds also for complex analytic functions with the open interval I replaced by an open subset U ∈ C and a-centered intervals (a − r, a + r) replaced by c-centered disks B(c, r). In particular, the Taylor expansion holds in the form f(z)=Pk(z)+Rk(z),Pk(z)=∑j=0kf(j)(c)j!(z−c)j,(z)=P_k(z)+R_k(z),_k(z)=∑_j=0^kf^(j)(c)/j!(z-c)^j, where the remainder term Rk is complex analytic. Methods of complex analysis provide some powerful results regarding Taylor expansions. For example, using Cauchy's integral formula for any positively oriented Jordan curve γγ which parametrizes the boundary ∂W⊂U of a region W⊂U, one obtains expressions for the derivatives f(j)(c) as above, and modifying slightly the computation for Tf(z) = f(z), one arrives at the exact formula Rk(z)=∑j=k+1∞(z−c)j2πi∫γf(w)(w−c)j+1dw=(z−c)k+12πi∫γf(w)dw(w−c)k+1(w−z),z∈W._k(z)=∑_j=k+1^∞(z-c)^j/2∫_γf(w)/(w-c)^j+1 dw=(z-c)^k+1/2∫_γf(w) dw/(w-c)^k+1(w-z),. The important feature here is that the quality of the approximation by a Taylor polynomial on the region W⊂U is dominated by the values of the function f itself on the boundary ∂W⊂U. Similarly, applying Cauchy's estimates to the series expression for the remainder, one obtains the uniform estimates |Rk(z)|≤∑j=k+1∞Mr|z−c|jrj=Mrrk+1|z−c|k+11−|z−c|r≤Mrβk+11−β,|z−c|r≤β<1.|R_k(z)|≤∑_j=k+1^∞M_r|z-c|^j/r^j=M_r/r^k+1|z-c|^k+1/1-|z-c|/r≤M_rβ^k+1/1-β, |z-c|/r≤β<1.
