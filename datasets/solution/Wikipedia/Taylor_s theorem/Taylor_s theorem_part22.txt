polynomials: We prove the special case, where f:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ has continuous partial derivatives up to the order k+1+1 in some closed ball B with center aa. The strategy of the proof is to apply the one-variable case of Taylor's theorem to the restriction of f to the line segment adjoining xx and aa.[17] Parametrize the line segment between aa and xx by u(t)=a+t(x−a)u(t)=a+t(x-a) We apply the one-variable version of Taylor's theorem to the function g(t)=f(u(t))(t)=f(u(t)): f(x)=g(1)=g(0)+∑j=1k1j!g(j)(0)+∫01(1−t)kk!g(k+1)(t)dt.(x)=g(1)=g(0)+∑_j=1^k1/j!g^(j)(0) int_0^1(1-t)^k/k!g^(k+1)(t) dt. Applying the chain rule for several variables gives g(j)(t)=djdtjf(u(t))=djdtjf(a+t(x−a))=∑|α|=j(jα)(Dαf)(a+t(x−a))(x−a)αg^(j)(t) =d^j/dt^jf(u(t)) =d^j/dt^jf(a+t(x-a)) =∑_|α|=j(j α)(D^αf)(a+t(x-a))(x-a)^α where (jα)jα is the multinomial coefficient. Since 1j!(jα)=1α!1j!jα=1α!, we get: f(x)=f(a)+∑1≤|α|≤k1α!(Dαf)(a)(x−a)α+∑|α|=k+1k+1α!(x−a)α∫01(1−t)k(Dαf)(a+t(x−a))dt.(x)=f(a)+∑_1≤|α|1/α!(D^αf)(a)(x-a)^α+∑_|α|=k+1k+1/α!(x-a)^α∫_0^1(1-t)^k(D^αf)(a+t(x-a)) dt.
