remainder: It is often useful in practice to be able to estimate the remainder term appearing in the Taylor approximation, rather than having an exact formula for it. Suppose that f is (k + 1)-times continuously differentiable in an interval I containing a. Suppose that there are real constants q and Q such that q≤f(k+1)(x)≤Q^(k+1)(x) throughout I. Then the remainder term satisfies the inequality[11] q(x−a)k+1(k+1)!≤Rk(x)≤Q(x−a)k+1(k+1)!,(x-a)^k+1/(k+1)!_k(x)(x-a)^k+1/(k+1)!, if x > a, and a similar estimate if x < a. This is a simple consequence of the Lagrange form of the remainder. In particular, if |f(k+1)(x)|≤M|f^(k+1)(x)| on an interval I = (a − r,a + r) with some r>0>0 , then |Rk(x)|≤M|x−a|k+1(k+1)!≤Mrk+1(k+1)!|R_k(x)||x-a|^k+1/(k+1)!r^k+1/(k+1)! for all x∈(a − r,a + r). The second inequality is called a uniform estimate, because it holds uniformly for all x on the interval (a − r,a + r).
