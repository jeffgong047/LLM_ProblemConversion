variable: Let[16] hk(x)=f(x)−P(x)(x−a)kx≠a0x=a_k(x)=f(x)-P(x)/(x-a)^k x≠a 0 x=a where, as in the statement of Taylor's theorem, P(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)+f″(a)2!(x−a)2+⋯+f(k)(a)k!(x−a)k.(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f”(a)/2!(x-a)^2+⋯+f^(k)(a)/k!(x-a)^k. It is sufficient to show that limx→ahk(x)=0.lim_xh_k(x)=0. The proof here is based on repeated application of L'Hôpital's rule. Note that, for each j=0,1,...,k−1=0,1,...,k-1, f(j)(a)=P(j)(a)^(j)(a)=P^(j)(a). Hence each of the first k−1-1 derivatives of the numerator in hk(x)_k(x) vanishes at x=a=a, and the same is true of the denominator. Also, since the condition that the function f be k times differentiable at a point requires differentiability up to order k−1-1 in a neighborhood of said point (this is true, because differentiability requires a function to be defined in a whole neighborhood of a point), the numerator and its k−2-2 derivatives are differentiable in a neighborhood of a. Clearly, the denominator also satisfies said condition, and additionally, doesn't vanish unless x=a=a, therefore all conditions necessary for L'Hôpital's rule are fulfilled, and its use is justified. So limx→af(x)−P(x)(x−a)k=limx→addx(f(x)−P(x))ddx(x−a)k=⋯=limx→adk−1dxk−1(f(x)−P(x))dk−1dxk−1(x−a)k=1k!limx→af(k−1)(x)−P(k−1)(x)x−a=1k!(f(k)(a)−f(k)(a))=0lim_xf(x)-P(x)/(x-a)^k =lim_xd/dx(f(x)-P(x))/d/dx(x-a)^k=⋯=lim_xd^k-1/dx^k-1(f(x)-P(x))/d^k-1/dx^k-1(x-a)^k =1/k!lim_xf^(k-1)(x)-P^(k-1)(x)/x-a =1/k!(f^(k)(a)-f^(k)(a))=0 where the second-to-last equality follows by the definition of the derivative at x=a=a.
