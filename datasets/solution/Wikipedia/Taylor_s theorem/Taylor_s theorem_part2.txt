Motivation: Graph of f(x)=ex(x)=e^x (blue) with its linear approximation P1(x)=1+x_1(x)=1+x (red) at a=0=0. If a real-valued function f(x)(x) is differentiable at the point x=a=a, then it has a linear approximation near this point. This means that there exists a function h1(x) such that f(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)+h1(x)(x−a),limx→ah1(x)=0.(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+h_1(x)(x-a), lim_xh_1(x)=0. Here P1(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)_1(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) is the linear approximation of f(x)(x) for x near the point a, whose graph y=P1(x)=P_1(x) is the tangent line to the graph y=f(x)=f(x) at x = a. The error in the approximation is: R1(x)=f(x)−P1(x)=h1(x)(x−a)._1(x)=f(x)-P_1(x)=h_1(x)(x-a). As x tends to a, this error goes to zero much faster than f′(a)(x−a)'(a)(x-a), making f(x)≈P1(x)(x)_1(x) a useful approximation. Graph of f(x)=ex(x)=e^x (blue) with its quadratic approximation P2(x)=1+x+x22_2(x)=1+x+x^22 (red) at a=0=0. Note the improvement in the approximation. For a better approximation to f(x)(x), we can fit a quadratic polynomial instead of a linear function: P2(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a)+f″(a)2(x−a)2._2(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f”(a)/2(x-a)^2. Instead of just matching one derivative of f(x)(x) at x=a=a, this polynomial has the same first and second derivatives, as is evident upon differentiation. Taylor's theorem ensures that the quadratic approximation is, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of x=a=a, more accurate than the linear approximation. Specifically, f(x)=P2(x)+h2(x)(x−a)2,limx→ah2(x)=0.(x)=P_2(x)+h_2(x)(x-a)^2, lim_xh_2(x)=0. Here the error in the approximation is R2(x)=f(x)−P2(x)=h2(x)(x−a)2,_2(x)=f(x)-P_2(x)=h_2(x)(x-a)^2, which, given the limiting behavior of h2_2, goes to zero faster than (x−a)2(x-a)^2 as x tends to a. Approximation of f(x)=11+x2(x)=11+x^2 (blue) by its Taylor polynomials Pk_k of order k=1,…,16=1,…,16 centered at x=0=0 (red) and x=1=1 (green). The approximations do not improve at all outside (−1,1)(-1,1) and (1−2,1+2)(1-√(2),1+√(2)), respectively. Similarly, we might get still better approximations to f if we use polynomials of higher degree, since then we can match even more derivatives with f at the selected base point. In general, the error in approximating a function by a polynomial of degree k will go to zero much faster than (x−a)k(x-a)^k as x tends to a. However, there are functions, even infinitely differentiable ones, for which increasing the degree of the approximating polynomial does not increase the accuracy of approximation: we say such a function fails to be analytic at x = a: it is not (locally) determined by its derivatives at this point. Taylor's theorem is of asymptotic nature: it only tells us that the error Rk_k in an approximation by a k-th order Taylor polynomial Pk tends to zero faster than any nonzero k-th degree polynomial as x→a. It does not tell us how large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulas for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on f. These enhanced versions of Taylor's theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function f is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.) There are several ways we might use the remainder term: Estimate the error for a polynomial Pk(x) of degree k estimating f(x)(x) on a given interval (a – r, a + r). (Given the interval and degree, we find the error.) Find the smallest degree k for which the polynomial Pk(x) approximates f(x)(x) to within a given error tolerance on a given interval (a − r, a + r) . (Given the interval and error tolerance, we find the degree.) Find the largest interval (a − r, a + r) on which Pk(x) approximates f(x)(x) to within a given error tolerance. (Given the degree and error tolerance, we find the interval.) Taylor's theorem in one real
