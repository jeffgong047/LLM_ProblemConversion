differentiability: A function f: Rn → R is differentiable at a ∈ Rn if and only if there exists a linear functional L : Rn → R and a function h : Rn → R such that f(x)=f(a)+L(x−a)+h(x)‖x−a‖,limx→ah(x)=0.(x)=f(a)+L(x-a)+h(x)‖x-a‖, lim_x→ah(x)=0. If this is the case, then L=df(a)=df(a) is the (uniquely defined) differential of f at the point a. Furthermore, then the partial derivatives of f exist at a and the differential of f at a is given by df(a)(v)=∂f∂x1(a)v1+⋯+∂f∂xn(a)vn.(a)(v)=/_1(a)v_1+⋯+/_n(a)v_n. Introduce the multi-index notation |α|=α1+⋯+αn,α!=α1!⋯αn!,xα=x1α1⋯xnαn|α|=α_1+⋯+α_n, α!=α_1!⋯α_n!, x^α=x_1^α_1_n^α_n for α ∈ Nn and x ∈ Rn. If all the k-th order partial derivatives of f : Rn → R are continuous at a ∈ Rn, then by Clairaut's theorem, one can change the order of mixed derivatives at a, so the notation Dαf=∂|α|f∂x1α1⋯∂xnαn,|α|≤k^αf=∂^|α|f/_1^α_1⋯_n^α_n, |α| for the higher order partial derivatives is justified in this situation. The same is true if all the (k − 1)-th order partial derivatives of f exist in some neighborhood of a and are differentiable at a.[13] Then we say that f is k times differentiable at the point a.
