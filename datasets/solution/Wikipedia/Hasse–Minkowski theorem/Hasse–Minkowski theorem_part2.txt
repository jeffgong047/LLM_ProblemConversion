Importance: The importance of the Hasseâ€“Minkowski theorem lies in the novel paradigm it presented for answering arithmetical questions: in order to determine whether an equation of a certain type has a solution in rational numbers, it is sufficient to test whether it has solutions over complete fields of real and p-adic numbers, where analytic considerations, such as Newton's method and its p-adic analogue, Hensel's lemma, apply. This is encapsulated in the idea of a local-global principle, which is one of the most fundamental techniques in arithmetic geometry. Application to the classification of quadratic
