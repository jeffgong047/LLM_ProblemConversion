forms: The Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of classifying quadratic forms over a number field K up to equivalence to the set of analogous but much simpler questions over local fields. Basic invariants of a nonsingular quadratic form are its dimension, which is a positive integer, and its discriminant modulo the squares in K, which is an element of the multiplicative group K*/K*2. In addition, for every place v of K, there is an invariant coming from the completion Kv. Depending on the choice of v, this completion may be the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, or a p-adic number field, each of which has different kinds of invariants: Case of R. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the signature (or, alternatively, the negative index of inertia) is a complete invariant. Case of C. All nonsingular quadratic forms of the same dimension are equivalent. Case of Qp and its algebraic extensions. Forms of the same dimension are classified up to equivalence by their Hasse invariant. These invariants must satisfy some compatibility conditions: a parity relation (the sign of the discriminant must match the negative index of inertia) and a product formula (a local–global relation). Conversely, for every set of invariants satisfying these relations, there is a quadratic form over K with these invariants.
