∞: For some authors, notably Royden,[1] the Riesz-Fischer Theorem is the result that Lp^p is complete: that every Cauchy sequence of functions in Lp^p converges to a function in Lp,^p, under the metric induced by the p-norm. The proof below is based on the convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral; the result can also be obtained for p∈[1,∞]∈[1,∞] by showing that every Cauchy sequence has a rapidly converging Cauchy sub-sequence, that every Cauchy sequence with a convergent sub-sequence converges, and that every rapidly Cauchy sequence in Lp^p converges in Lp.^p. When 1≤p≤∞,1≤∞, the Minkowski inequality implies that the Lp space Lp^p is a normed space. In order to prove that Lp^p is complete, i.e. that Lp^p is a Banach space, it is enough (see e.g. Banach space#Definition) to prove that every series ∑un_n of functions in Lp(μ)^p(μ) such that ∑‖un‖p<∞∑u_n_p<∞ converges in the Lp^p-norm to some function f∈Lp(μ).^p(μ). For p<∞,<∞, the Minkowski inequality and the monotone convergence theorem imply that ∫(∑n=0∞|un|)pdμ≤(∑n=0∞‖un‖p)p<∞,hencef=∑n=0∞un∫(∑_n=0^∞|u_n|)^p dμ≤(∑_n=0^∞u_n_p)^p<∞, hence f=∑_n=0^∞u_n is defined μμ–almost everywhere and f∈Lp(μ).^p(μ). The dominated convergence theorem is then used to prove that the partial sums of the series converge to f in the Lp^p-norm, ∫|f−∑k=0nuk|pdμ≤∫(∑ℓ>n|uℓ|)pdμ→0asn→∞.∫|f-∑_k=0^nu_k|^p dμ≤∫(∑_ℓ>n|u_ℓ|)^p dμ→0asn→∞. The case 0<p<10<p<1 requires some modifications, because the p-norm is no longer subadditive. One starts with the stronger assumption that ∑‖un‖pp<∞∑u_n_p^p<∞ and uses repeatedly that |∑k=0nuk|p≤∑k=0n|uk|pwhenp<1|∑_k=0^nu_k|^p≤∑_k=0^n|u_k|^pwhenp<1 The case p=∞=∞ reduces to a simple question about uniform convergence outside a μμ-negligible set.
