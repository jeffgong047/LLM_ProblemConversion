For more theorems that are sometimes called Riesz's theorem, see Riesz theorem. In mathematics, the Riesz–Fischer theorem in real analysis is any of a number of closely related results concerning the properties of the space L2 of square integrable functions. The theorem was proven independently in 1907 by Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer. For many authors, the Riesz–Fischer theorem refers to the fact that the Lp spaces Lp^p from Lebesgue integration theory are complete. Modern forms of the
