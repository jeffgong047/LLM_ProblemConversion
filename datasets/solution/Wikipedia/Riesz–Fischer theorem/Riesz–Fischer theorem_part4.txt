(1907): In his Note, Riesz (1907, p. 616) states the following result (translated here to modern language at one point: the notation L2([a,b])^2([a,b]) was not used in 1907). Let φn{φ_n}be an orthonormal system in L2([a,b])^2([a,b]) and an{a_n} a sequence of reals. The convergence of the series ∑an2_n^2 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a function f such that ∫abf(x)φn(x)dx=anforeveryn.∫_a^bf(x)φ_n(x) dx=a_n foreveryn. Today, this result of Riesz is a special case of basic facts about series of orthogonal vectors in Hilbert spaces. Riesz's Note appeared in March. In May, Fischer (1907, p. 1023) states explicitly in a theorem (almost with modern words) that a Cauchy sequence in L2([a,b])^2([a,b]) converges in L2^2-norm to some function f∈L2([a,b]).^2([a,b]). In this Note, Cauchy sequences are called "sequences converging in the mean" and L2([a,b])^2([a,b]) is denoted by Ω.Ω. Also, convergence to a limit in L2^2–norm is called "convergence in the mean towards a function". Here is the statement, translated from French: Theorem. If a sequence of functions belonging to ΩΩ converges in the mean, there exists in ΩΩ a function f towards which the sequence converges in the mean. Fischer goes on proving the preceding result of Riesz, as a consequence of the orthogonality of the system, and of the completeness of L2.^2. Fischer's proof of completeness is somewhat indirect. It uses the fact that the indefinite integrals of the functions gn in the given Cauchy sequence, namely Gn(x)=∫axgn(t)dt,_n(x)=∫_a^xg_n(t) dt, converge uniformly on [a,b][a,b] to some function G, continuous with bounded variation. The existence of the limit g∈L2^2 for the Cauchy sequence is obtained by applying to G differentiation theorems from Lebesgue's theory. Riesz uses a similar reasoning in his Note, but makes no explicit mention to the completeness of L2,^2, although his result may be interpreted this way. He says that integrating term by term a trigonometric series with given square summable coefficients, he gets a series converging uniformly to a continuous function F with bounded variation. The derivative f of F, defined almost everywhere, is square summable and has for Fourier coefficients the given coefficients. Completeness of Lp, 0 < p ≤
