Example: The Riesz–Fischer theorem also applies in a more general setting. Let R be an inner product space consisting of functions (for example, measurable functions on the line, analytic functions in the unit disc; in old literature, sometimes called Euclidean Space), and let φn{φ_n} be an orthonormal system in R (e.g. Fourier basis, Hermite or Laguerre polynomials, etc. – see orthogonal polynomials), not necessarily complete (in an inner product space, an orthonormal set is complete if no nonzero vector is orthogonal to every vector in the set). The theorem asserts that if the normed space R is complete (thus R is a Hilbert space), then any sequence cn{c_n} that has finite ℓ2ℓ^2 norm defines a function f in the space R. The function f is defined by f=limn→∞∑k=0nckφk,=lim_n→∞∑_k=0^nc_kφ_k, limit in R-norm. Combined with the Bessel's inequality, we know the converse as well: if f is a function in R, then the Fourier coefficients (f,φn)(f,φ_n) have finite ℓ2ℓ^2 norm.
