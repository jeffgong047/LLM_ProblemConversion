theorem: The most common form of the theorem states that a measurable function on [−π,π][-π,π] is square integrable if and only if the corresponding Fourier series converges in the Lp space L2.^2. This means that if the Nth partial sum of the Fourier series corresponding to a square-integrable function f is given by SNf(x)=∑n=−NNFneinx,_Nf(x)=∑_n=-N^NF_n e^inx, where Fn,_n, the nth Fourier coefficient, is given by Fn=12π∫−ππf(x)e−inxdx,_n=1/2π∫_-π^πf(x) e^-inx dx, then limN→∞‖SNf−f‖2=0,lim_N→∞_Nf-f_2=0, where ‖⋅‖2 · _2 is the L2^2-norm. Conversely, if an{a_n} is a two-sided sequence of complex numbers (that is, its indices range from negative infinity to positive infinity) such that ∑n=−∞∞|an|2<∞,∑_n=-∞^∞|a_n|^2<∞, then there exists a function f such that f is square-integrable and the values an_n are the Fourier coefficients of f. This form of the Riesz–Fischer theorem is a stronger form of Bessel's inequality, and can be used to prove Parseval's identity for Fourier series. Other results are often called the Riesz–Fischer theorem (Dunford & Schwartz 1958, §IV.16). Among them is the theorem that, if A is an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space H, and x∈H,, then ⟨x,y⟩=0,y⟩=0 for all but countably many y∈A,, and ∑y∈A|⟨x,y⟩|2≤‖x‖2.∑_y|,y⟩|^2≤x^2. Furthermore, if A is an orthonormal basis for H and x an arbitrary vector, the series ∑y∈A⟨x,y⟩y∑_y,y⟩ y converges commutatively (or unconditionally) to x. This is equivalent to saying that for every ε>0,ε>0, there exists a finite set B0_0 in A such that ‖x−∑y∈B⟨x,y⟩y‖<εx-∑_y,y<ε for every finite set B containing B0. Moreover, the following conditions on the set A are equivalent: the set A is an orthonormal basis of H for every vector x∈H,, ‖x‖2=∑y∈A|⟨x,y⟩|2.x^2=∑_y|,y⟩|^2. Another result, which also sometimes bears the name of Riesz and Fischer, is the theorem that L2^2 (or more generally Lp,0<p≤∞^p,0<p≤∞) is complete.
