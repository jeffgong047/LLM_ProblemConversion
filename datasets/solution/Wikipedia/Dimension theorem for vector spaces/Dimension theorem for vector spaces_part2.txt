Proof: Let V be a vector space, {ai: i ∈ I} be a linearly independent set of elements of V, and {bj: j ∈ J} be a generating set. One has to prove that the cardinality of I is not larger than that of J. If J is finite, this results from the Steinitz exchange lemma. (Indeed, the Steinitz exchange lemma implies every finite subset of I has cardinality not larger than that of J, hence I is finite with cardinality not larger than that of J.) If J is finite, a proof based on matrix theory is also possible.[2] Assume that J is infinite. If I is finite, there is nothing to prove. Thus, we may assume that I is also infinite. Let us suppose that the cardinality of I is larger than that of J.[note 1] We have to prove that this leads to a contradiction. By Zorn's lemma, every linearly independent set is contained in a maximal linearly independent set K. This maximality implies that K spans V and is therefore a basis (the maximality implies that every element of V is linearly dependent from the elements of K, and therefore is a linear combination of elements of K). As the cardinality of K is greater than or equal to the cardinality of I, one may replace {ai: i ∈ I} with K, that is, one may suppose, without loss of generality, that {ai: i ∈ I} is a basis. Thus, every bj can be written as a finite sum bj=∑i∈Ejλi,jai,_j=∑_i_jλ_i,ja_i, where Ej_j is a finite subset of I.. As J is infinite, ⋃j∈JEj⋃_jE_j has the same cardinality as J.[note 1] Therefore ⋃j∈JEj⋃_jE_j has cardinality smaller than that of I. So there is some i0∈I_0 which does not appear in any Ej_j. The corresponding ai0_i_0 can be expressed as a finite linear combination of bj_js, which in turn can be expressed as finite linear combination of ai_is, not involving ai0_i_0. Hence ai0_i_0 is linearly dependent on the other ai_is, which provides the desired contradiction. Kernel extension theorem for vector
