spaces: This application of the dimension theorem is sometimes itself called the dimension theorem. Let T: U → V be a linear transformation. Then dim(range(T)) + dim(ker(T)) = dim(U), that is, the dimension of U is equal to the dimension of the transformation's range plus the dimension of the kernel. See rank–nullity theorem for a fuller discussion.
