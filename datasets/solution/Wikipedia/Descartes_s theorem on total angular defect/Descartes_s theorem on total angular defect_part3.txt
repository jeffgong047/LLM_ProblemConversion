Examples: The defect of any of the vertices of a regular dodecahedron (in which three regular pentagons meet at each vertex) is 36°, or π/5 radians, or 1/10 of a circle. Each of the angles measures 108°; three of these meet at each vertex, so the defect is 360° − (108° + 108° + 108°) = 36°. The same procedure can be followed for the other Platonic solids: Shape Number of vertices Polygons meeting at each vertex Defect at each vertex Total defect tetrahedron 4 Three equilateral triangles π(180∘)π (180^∘) 4π(720∘)4π (720^∘) octahedron 6 Four equilateral triangles 2π3(120∘)2π3120^∘) 4π(720∘)4π (720^∘) cube 8 Three squares π2(90∘)π2 (90^∘) 4π(720∘)4π (720^∘) icosahedron 12 Five equilateral triangles π3(60∘)π3 (60^∘) 4π(720∘)4π (720^∘) dodecahedron 20 Three regular pentagons π5(36∘)π5 (36^∘) 4π(720∘)4π (720^∘) Descartes'
