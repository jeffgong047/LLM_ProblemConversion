The Jurkat–Richert theorem is a mathematical theorem in sieve theory. It is a key ingredient in proofs of Chen's theorem on Goldbach's conjecture.[1]: 272 
It was proved in 1965 by Wolfgang B. Jurkat and Hans-Egon Richert.[2]

Statement of the theorem[edit]
This formulation is from Diamond & Halberstam.[3]: 81 
Other formulations are in Jurkat & Richert,[2]: 230  Halberstam & Richert,[4]: 231 
and Nathanson.[1]: 257 
Suppose A is a finite sequence of integers and P is a set of primes. Write Ad for the number of items in A that are divisible by d, and write P(z) for the product of the elements in P that are less than z. Write ω(d) for a multiplicative function such that ω(p)/p is approximately the proportion of elements of A divisible by p, write X for any convenient approximation to |A|, and write the remainder as

rA(d)=|Ad|−ω(d)dX._A(d)=|A_d|-ω(d)/dX.
Write S(A,P,z) for the number of items in A that are relatively prime to P(z). Write

V(z)=∏p∈P,p<z(1−ω(p)p).(z)=∏_p,p<z(1-ω(p)/p).
Write ν(m) for the number of distinct prime divisors of m. Write F1 and f1 for functions satisfying certain difference differential equations (see Diamond & Halberstam[3]: 67–68  for the definition and properties).
We assume the dimension (sifting density) is 1: that is, there is a constant C such that for 2 ≤ z < w we have

∏z≤p<w(1−ω(p)p)−1≤(log⁡wlog⁡z)(1+Clog⁡z).∏_z<w(1-ω(p)/p)^-1≤(/)(1+C/).
(The book of Diamond & Halberstam[3] extends the theorem to dimensions higher than 1.) Then the Jurkat–Richert theorem states that for any numbers y and z with 2 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ X we have

S(A,P,z)≤XV(z)(F1(log⁡ylog⁡z)+O((log⁡log⁡y)3/4(log⁡y)1/4))+∑m|P(z),m<y4ν(m)|rA(m)|(A,P,z)(z)(F_1(/)+O((log)^3/4/()^1/4))+∑_m|P(z),m<y4^ν(m)|r_A(m)|
and

S(A,P,z)≥XV(z)(f1(log⁡ylog⁡z)−O((log⁡log⁡y)3/4(log⁡y)1/4))−∑m|P(z),m<y4ν(m)|rA(m)|.(A,P,z)(z)(f_1(/)-O((log)^3/4/()^1/4))-∑_m|P(z),m<y4^ν(m)|r_A(m)|.
