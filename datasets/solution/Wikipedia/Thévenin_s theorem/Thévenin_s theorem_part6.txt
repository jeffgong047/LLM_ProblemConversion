theorem: The proof involves two steps. The first step is to use superposition theorem to construct a solution. Then, uniqueness theorem is employed to show that the obtained solution is unique. It is noted that the second step is usually implied in literature. By using superposition of specific configurations, it can be shown that for any linear "black box" circuit which contains voltage sources and resistors, its voltage is a linear function of the corresponding current as follows V=VEqâˆ’ZEqI.=V_Eq-Z_EqI. Here, the first term reflects the linear summation of contributions from each voltage source, while the second term measures the contributions from all the resistors. The above expression is obtained by using the fact that the voltage of the black box for a given current I is identical to the linear superposition of the solutions of the following problems: (1) to leave the black box open circuited but activate individual voltage source one at a time and, (2) to short circuit all the voltage sources but feed the circuit with a certain ideal voltage source so that the resulting current exactly reads I (Alternatively, one can use an ideal current source of current I). Moreover, it is straightforward to show that Veq and Zeq are the single voltage source and the single series resistor in question. As a matter of fact, the above relation between V and I is established by superposition of some particular configurations. Now, the uniqueness theorem guarantees that the result is general. To be specific, there is one and only one value of V once the value of I is given. In other words, the above relation holds true independent of what the "black box" is plugged to. In three-phase
