Example: Original circuitThe equivalent voltageThe equivalent resistanceThe equivalent circuit In the example, calculating the equivalent voltage: VTh=R2+R3(R2+R3)+R4⋅V1=1kΩ+1kΩ(1kΩ+1kΩ)+2kΩ⋅15V=12⋅15V=7.5VV_Th =R_2+R_3(R_2+R_3)+R_4_1 =1 kΩ+1 kΩ(1 kΩ+1 kΩ)+2 kΩ·15 V =12·15 V=7.5 V (Notice that R1 is not taken into consideration, as above calculations are done in an open-circuit condition between A and B, therefore no current flows through this part, which means there is no current through R1 and therefore no voltage drop along this part.) Calculating equivalent resistance (Rx || Ry is the total resistance of two parallel resistors): RTh=R1+[(R2+R3)‖R4]=1kΩ+[(1kΩ+1kΩ)‖2kΩ]=1kΩ+(1(1kΩ+1kΩ)+1(2kΩ))−1=2kΩ.R_Th =R_1+[(R_2+R_3)R_4] =1 kΩ+[(1 kΩ+1 kΩ)2 kΩ] =1 kΩ+(1(1 kΩ+1 kΩ)+1(2 kΩ))^-1=2 kΩ.
