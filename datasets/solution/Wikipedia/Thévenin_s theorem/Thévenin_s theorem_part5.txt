limitations: Many circuits are only linear over a certain range of values, thus the Thévenin equivalent is valid only within this linear range. The Thévenin equivalent has an equivalent I–V characteristic only from the point of view of the load. The power dissipation of the Thévenin equivalent is not necessarily identical to the power dissipation of the real system. However, the power dissipated by an external resistor between the two output terminals is the same regardless of how the internal circuit is implemented. A proof of the
