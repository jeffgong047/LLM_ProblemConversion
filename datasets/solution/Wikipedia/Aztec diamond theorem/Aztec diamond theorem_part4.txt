tilings: Finding valid tilings of the Aztec diamond involves the solution of the underlying set-covering problem. Let D=d1,d2,…,dn={d_1,d_2,…,d_n} be the set of 2X1 dominoes where each domino in D may be placed within the diamond (without crossing its boundaries) when no other dominoes are present. Let S=s1,s2,…,sm={s_1,s_2,…,s_m} be the set of 1X1 squares lying within the diamond that must be covered. Two dominoes within D can be found to cover any boundary square within S, and four dominoes within D can be found to cover any non-boundary square within S. Define c(si)⊂D(s_i) to be the set of dominoes that cover square si_i, and let xi_i be an indicator variable such that xi=1_i=1 if the ith^th domino is used in the tiling, and 0 otherwise. With these definitions, the task of tiling the Aztec diamond may be reduced to a constraint satisfaction problem formulated as a binary integer program: min∑1≤i≤m0⋅ximin∑_10_i Subject to: ∑i∈c(si)xi=1,∑_i(s_i)x_i=1, for 1≤i≤m1, and xi∈0,1_i∈{0,1}. The ith^th constraint guarantee that square si_i will be covered by a single tile, and the collection of m constraints ensures that each square will be covered (no holes in the covering). This formulation can be solved with standard integer programming packages. Additional constraints can be constructed to force placement of particular dominoes, ensure a minimum number of horizontal or vertically-oriented dominoes are used, or generate distinct tilings. An alternative approach is to apply Knuth's Algorithm X to enumerate valid tilings for the problem.
