paths: Something that is very useful for counting tilings is looking at the non-intersecting paths through its corresponding directed graph. If we define our movements through a tiling (domino tiling) to be (1,1) when we are the bottom of a vertical tiling (1,0) where we are the end of a horizontal tiling (1,-1) when we are at the top of a vertical tiling Then through any tiling we can have these paths from our sources to our sinks. These movements are similar to Schröder paths. For example, consider an Aztec Diamond of order 2, and after drawing its directed graph we can label its sources and sinks. a1,a2_1,a_2 are our sources and b1,b2_1,b_2 are our sinks. On its directed graph, we can draw a path from ai_i to bj_j, this gives us a path matrix, P2_2, P2=[a1b1a2b1a1b2a2b2]=[6222]_2=[ a_1b_1 a_2b_1; a_1b_2 a_2b_2; ]=[ 6 2; 2 2; ] where aibj=_ib_j= all the paths from ai_i to bj_j. The number of tilings for order 2 is det(P2)=12−4=8=22(2+1)/2(P_2)=12-4=8=2^2(2+1)/2 According to Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot, if we let S be the set of all our sources and T be the set of all our sinks of our directed graph then det(Pn)=(P_n)=number of non-intersecting paths from S to T.[5] Considering the directed graph of the Aztec Diamond, it has also been shown by Eu and Fu that Schröder paths and the tilings of the Aztec diamond are in bijection.[6] Hence, finding the determinant of the path matrix, Pn_n, will give us the number of tilings for the Aztec Diamond of order n. Another way to determine the number of tilings of an Aztec Diamond is using Hankel matrices of large and small Schröder numbers,[6] using the method from Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot again.[5] Finding the determinant of these matrices gives us the number of non-intersecting paths of small and large Schröder numbers, which is in bijection with the tilings. The small Schröder numbers are 1,1,3,11,45,⋯=y0,y1,y2,y3,y4,⋯{1,1,3,11,45,⋯}={y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,⋯} and the large Schröder numbers are 1,2,6,22,90,⋯=x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,⋯{1,2,6,22,90,⋯}={x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,⋯}, and in general our two Hankel matrices will be Hn=[x1x2⋯xnx2x3⋯xn+1⋮⋮⋮xnxn+1⋯x2n−1]_n=[ x_1 x_2 ⋯ x_n; x_2 x_3 ⋯ x_n+1; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; x_n x_n+1 ⋯ x_2n-1; ] and Gn=[y1y2⋯yny2y3⋯yn+1⋮⋮⋮ynyn+1⋯y2n−1]_n=[ y_1 y_2 ⋯ y_n; y_2 y_3 ⋯ y_n+1; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; y_n y_n+1 ⋯ y_2n-1; ] where det(Hn)=2n(n+1)/2(H_n)=2^n(n+1)/2 and det(Gn)=2n(n−1)/2(G_n)=2^n(n-1)/2 where n≥1≥1 (It also true that det(Hn0)=2n(n−1)/2(H_n^0)=2^n(n-1)/2 where this is the Hankel matrix like Hn_n, but started with x0_0 instead of x1_1 for the first entry of the matrix in the top left corner).
