problems: Consider the shape, 2×n2 block, and we can ask the same question as for the Aztec Diamond of order n. As this has been proven in many papers, we will refer to.[7] Letting the 2×n2 block shape be denoted by Bn_n, then it can be seen The number of tilings of Bn=Fn_n=F_n where Fn_n is the nth^th Fibonacci number and n≥0≥0. It is understood that B0_0 is a 2×02×0 shape that can only be tiled 1 way, no ways. Using induction, consider B1_1 and that is just 2×12×1 domino tile where there is only F1=1_1=1 tiling. Assuming the number of tilings for Bn=Fn_n=F_n, then we consider Bn+1_n+1. Focusing on how we can begin our tiling, we have two cases. We can start with our first tile being vertical, which means we are left with Bn_n which has Fn_n different tilings. The other way we can start our tiling is by laying two horizontal tiles on top of each other, which leaves us with Bn−1_n-1 that has Fn−1_n-1 different tilings. By adding the two together, the number of tilings for Bn+1=Fn+Fn−1=Fn+1_n+1=F_n+F_n-1=F_n+1.[7] Generating valid
