Statement: Let (X, || ||) be a separable Banach space. Let μ be a centred Gaussian measure on X, i.e. a probability measure defined on the Borel sets of X such that, for every bounded linear functional ℓ : X → R, the push-forward measure ℓ∗μ defined on the Borel sets of R by (ℓ∗μ)(A)=μ(ℓ−1(A)),(ℓ_∗μ)(A)=μ(ℓ^-1(A)), is a Gaussian measure (a normal distribution) with zero mean. Then there exists α > 0 such that ∫Xexp⁡(α‖x‖2)dμ(x)<+∞.∫_Xexp(αx^2) dμ(x)<+∞. A fortiori, μ (equivalently, any X-valued random variable G whose law is μ) has moments of all orders: for all k ≥ 0, E[‖G‖k]=∫X‖x‖kdμ(x)<+∞.𝔼[G^k]=∫_Xx^k dμ(x)<+∞.
