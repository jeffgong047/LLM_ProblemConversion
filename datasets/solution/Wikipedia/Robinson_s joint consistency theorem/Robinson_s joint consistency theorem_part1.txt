Robinson's joint consistency theorem is an important theorem of mathematical logic. It is related to Craig interpolation and Beth definability. The classical formulation of Robinson's joint consistency theorem is as follows: Let T1_1 and T2_2 be first-order theories. If T1_1 and T2_2 are consistent and the intersection T1∩T2_1_2 is complete (in the common language of T1_1 and T2_2), then the union T1∪T2_1_2 is consistent. A theory T is called complete if it decides every formula, meaning that for every sentence φ,φ, the theory contains the sentence or its negation but not both (that is, either T⊢φ⊢φ or T⊢¬φ⊢φ). Since the completeness assumption is quite hard to fulfill, there is a variant of the theorem: Let T1_1 and T2_2 be first-order theories. If T1_1 and T2_2 are consistent and if there is no formula φφ in the common language of T1_1 and T2_2 such that T1⊢φ_1⊢φ and T2⊢¬φ,_2⊢φ, then the union T1∪T2_1_2 is consistent. See
