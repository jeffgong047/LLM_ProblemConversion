CLT: Main article: Lindeberg's condition In the same setting and with the same notation as above, the Lyapunov condition can be replaced with the following weaker one (from Lindeberg in 1920). Suppose that for every ε>0ε>0 limn→∞1sn2∑i=1nE⁡[(Xi−μi)2⋅1Xi:|Xi−μi|>εsn]=0lim_n→∞1/s_n^2∑_i=1^nE[(X_i-μ_i)^2·1_{X_i:|X_i-μ_i|>_n}]=0 where 1…1_{…} is the indicator function. Then the distribution of the standardized sums 1sn∑i=1n(Xi−μi)1/s_n∑_i=1^n(X_i-μ_i) converges towards the standard normal distribution N(0,1)𝒩(0,1). Multidimensional
