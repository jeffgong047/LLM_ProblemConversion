numbers: The law of large numbers as well as the central limit theorem are partial solutions to a general problem: "What is the limiting behavior of Sn as n approaches infinity?" In mathematical analysis, asymptotic series are one of the most popular tools employed to approach such questions. Suppose we have an asymptotic expansion of f(n)(n): f(n)=a1φ1(n)+a2φ2(n)+O(φ3(n))(n→∞).(n)=a_1φ_1(n)+a_2φ_2(n)+O(φ_3(n)) (n→∞). Dividing both parts by φ1(n) and taking the limit will produce a1, the coefficient of the highest-order term in the expansion, which represents the rate at which f(n) changes in its leading term. limn→∞f(n)φ1(n)=a1.lim_n→∞f(n)/φ_1(n)=a_1. Informally, one can say: "f(n) grows approximately as a1φ1(n)". Taking the difference between f(n) and its approximation and then dividing by the next term in the expansion, we arrive at a more refined statement about f(n): limn→∞f(n)−a1φ1(n)φ2(n)=a2.lim_n→∞f(n)-a_1φ_1(n)/φ_2(n)=a_2. Here one can say that the difference between the function and its approximation grows approximately as a2φ2(n). The idea is that dividing the function by appropriate normalizing functions, and looking at the limiting behavior of the result, can tell us much about the limiting behavior of the original function itself. Informally, something along these lines happens when the sum, Sn, of independent identically distributed random variables, X1, ..., Xn, is studied in classical probability theory.[citation needed] If each Xi has finite mean μ, then by the law of large numbers, Sn/n → μ.[26] If in addition each Xi has finite variance σ2, then by the central limit theorem, Sn−nμn→ξ,S_n-nμ/√(n)→ξ, where ξ is distributed as N(0,σ2). This provides values of the first two constants in the informal expansion Sn≈μn+ξn._n≈+ξ√(n). In the case where the Xi do not have finite mean or variance, convergence of the shifted and rescaled sum can also occur with different centering and scaling factors: Sn−anbn→Ξ,S_n-a_n/b_n→Ξ, or informally Sn≈an+Ξbn._n_n+_n. Distributions Ξ which can arise in this way are called stable.[27] Clearly, the normal distribution is stable, but there are also other stable distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, for which the mean or variance are not defined. The scaling factor bn may be proportional to nc, for any c ≥ 1/2; it may also be multiplied by a slowly varying function of n.[28][29] The law of the iterated logarithm specifies what is happening "in between" the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Specifically it says that the normalizing function √n log log n, intermediate in size between n of the law of large numbers and √n of the central limit theorem, provides a non-trivial limiting behavior.
