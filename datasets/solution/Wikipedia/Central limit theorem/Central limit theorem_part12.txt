CLT: The central limit theorem has a proof using characteristic functions.[18] It is similar to the proof of the (weak) law of large numbers. Assume X1,…,Xn,…{X_1,…,X_n,…} are independent and identically distributed random variables, each with mean μμ and finite variance σ2σ^2. The sum X1+⋯+Xn_1+⋯+X_n has mean nμμ and variance nσ2σ^2. Consider the random variable Zn=X1+⋯+Xn−nμnσ2=∑i=1nXi−μnσ2=∑i=1n1nYi,_n=X_1+⋯+X_n-nμ/√(nσ^2)=∑_i=1^nX_i-μ/√(nσ^2)=∑_i=1^n1/√(n)Y_i, where in the last step we defined the new random variables Yi=Xi−μσ_i=X_i-μ/σ, each with zero mean and unit variance (var⁡(Y)=1var(Y)=1). The characteristic function of Zn_n is given by φZn(t)=φ∑i=1n1nYi(t)=φY1(tn)φY2(tn)⋯φYn(tn)=[φY1(tn)]n,φ_Z_n(t)=φ_∑_i=1^n1/√(n)Y_i(t)varphi_Y_1(t/√(n))φ_Y_2(t/√(n))⋯φ_Y_n(t/√(n))left[φ_Y_1(t/√(n))]^n, where in the last step we used the fact that all of the Yi_i are identically distributed. The characteristic function of Y1_1 is, by Taylor's theorem, φY1(tn)=1−t22n+o(t2n),(tn)→0φ_Y_1(t/√(n))=1-t^2/2n+o(t^2/n), (t/√(n))→0 where o(t2/n)(t^2/n) is "little o notation" for some function of t that goes to zero more rapidly than t2/n^2/n. By the limit of the exponential function (ex=limn→∞(1+xn)n^x=lim_n→∞(1+x/n)^n), the characteristic function of Zn_n equals φZn(t)=(1−t22n+o(t2n))n→e−12t2,n→∞.φ_Z_n(t)=(1-t^2/2n+o(t^2/n))^n^-1/2t^2,→∞. All of the higher order terms vanish in the limit n→∞→∞. The right hand side equals the characteristic function of a standard normal distribution N(0,1)𝒩(0,1), which implies through Lévy's continuity theorem that the distribution of Zn_n will approach N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) as n→∞→∞. Therefore, the sample average X¯n=X1+⋯+XnnX̅_n=X_1+⋯+X_n/n is such that nσ(X¯n−μ)=Zn√(n)/σ(X̅_n-μ)=Z_n converges to the normal distribution N(0,1)𝒩(0,1), from which the central limit theorem follows.
