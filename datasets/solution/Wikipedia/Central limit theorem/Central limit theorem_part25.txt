polytopes: Theorem — Let A1, ..., An be independent random points on the plane R2 each having the two-dimensional standard normal distribution. Let Kn be the convex hull of these points, and Xn the area of Kn Then[39] Xn−E⁡(Xn)Var⁡(Xn)X_n-E(X_n)/√(Var(X_n)) converges in distribution to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) as n tends to infinity. The same also holds in all dimensions greater than 2. The polytope Kn is called a Gaussian random polytope. A similar result holds for the number of vertices (of the Gaussian polytope), the number of edges, and in fact, faces of all dimensions.[40] Linear functions of orthogonal
