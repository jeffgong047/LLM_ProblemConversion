Theorem: The Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) was an effort of multiple mathematicians (Bernstein, Lindeberg, Lévy, Feller, Kolmogorov, and others) over the period from 1920 to 1937.[10] The first published complete proof of the GCLT was in 1937 by Paul Lévy in French.[11] An English language version of the complete proof of the GCLT is available in the translation of Gnedenko and Kolmogorov's 1954 book.[12] The statement of the GCLT is as follows:[13] A non-degenerate random variable Z is α-stable for some 0 < α ≤ 2 if and only if there is an independent, identically distributed sequence of random variables X1, X2, X3, ... and constants an > 0, bn ∈ ℝ with an (X1 + ... + Xn) - bn → Z. Here → means the sequence of random variable sums converges in distribution; i.e., the corresponding distributions satisfy Fn(y) → F(y) at all continuity points of F. In other words, if sums of independent, identically distributed random variables converge in distribution to some Z, then Z must be a stable distribution. Dependent
