CLT: Let X1,…,Xn{X_1,…,X_n} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables having a distribution with expected value given by μμ and finite variance given by σ2.σ^2. Suppose we are interested in the sample average X¯n≡X1+⋯+Xnn.X̅_n≡X_1+⋯+X_n/n. By the law of large numbers, the sample average converges almost surely (and therefore also converges in probability) to the expected value μμ as n→∞.→∞. The classical central limit theorem describes the size and the distributional form of the stochastic fluctuations around the deterministic number μμ during this convergence. More precisely, it states that as n gets larger, the distribution of the difference between the sample average X¯nX̅_n and its limit μ,μ, when multiplied by the factor n√(n) (that is, n(X¯n−μ)√(n)(X̅_n-μ)) approximates the normal distribution with mean 00 and variance σ2.σ^2. For large enough n,, the distribution of X¯nX̅_n gets arbitrarily close to the normal distribution with mean μμ and variance σ2/n.σ^2/n. The usefulness of the theorem is that the distribution of n(X¯n−μ)√(n)(X̅_n-μ) approaches normality regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual Xi._i. Formally, the theorem can be stated as follows: Lindeberg–Lévy CLT — Suppose X1,…,Xn{X_1,…,X_n} is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with E⁡[Xi]=μE[X_i]=μ and Var⁡[Xi]=σ2<∞.Var[X_i]=σ^2<∞. Then, as n approaches infinity, the random variables n(X¯n−μ)√(n)(X̅_n-μ) converge in distribution to a normal N(0,σ2)𝒩(0,σ^2):[4] n(X¯n−μ)→dN(0,σ2).√(n)(X̅_n-μ) xrightarrowd{𝒩(0,σ^2). In the case σ>0,σ>0, convergence in distribution means that the cumulative distribution functions of n(X¯n−μ)√(n)(X̅_n-μ) converge pointwise to the cdf of the N(0,σ2)𝒩(0,σ^2) distribution: for every real number z,, limn→∞P[n(X¯n−μ)≤z]=limn→∞P[n(X¯n−μ)σ≤zσ]=Φ(zσ),lim_n→∞ℙ[√(n)(X̅_n-μ)]=lim_n→∞ℙ[√(n)(X̅_n-μ)/σ≤z/σ]=Φ(z/σ), where Φ(z)Φ(z) is the standard normal cdf evaluated at z.. The convergence is uniform in z in the sense that limn→∞supz∈R|P[n(X¯n−μ)≤z]−Φ(zσ)|=0,lim_n→∞ sup_z∈ℝ |ℙ[√(n)(X̅_n-μ)]-Φ(z/σ)|=0 , where supsup denotes the least upper bound (or supremum) of the set.[5] Lyapunov
