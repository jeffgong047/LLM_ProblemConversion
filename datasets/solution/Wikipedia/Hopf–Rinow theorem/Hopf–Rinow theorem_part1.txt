Gives equivalent statements about the geodesic completeness of Riemannian manifolds Hopf–Rinow theorem is a set of statements about the geodesic completeness of Riemannian manifolds. It is named after Heinz Hopf and his student Willi Rinow, who published it in 1931.[1] Stefan Cohn-Vossen extended part of the Hopf–Rinow theorem to the context of certain types of metric spaces.
