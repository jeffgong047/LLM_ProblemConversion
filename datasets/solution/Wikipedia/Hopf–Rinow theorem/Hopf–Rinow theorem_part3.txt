generalizations: The Hopf–Rinow theorem is generalized to length-metric spaces the following way:[3] If a length-metric space is complete and locally compact then any two points can be connected by a minimizing geodesic, and any bounded closed set is compact. In fact these properties characterize completeness for locally compact length-metric spaces.[4] The theorem does not hold for infinite-dimensional manifolds. The unit sphere in a separable Hilbert space can be endowed with the structure of a Hilbert manifold in such a way that antipodal points cannot be joined by a length-minimizing geodesic.[5] It was later observed that it is not even automatically true that two points are joined by any geodesic, whether minimizing or not.[6] The theorem also does not generalize to Lorentzian manifolds: the Clifton–Pohl torus provides an example (diffeomorphic to the two-dimensional torus) that is compact but not complete.[7]
