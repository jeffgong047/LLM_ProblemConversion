Statement: Let (M,g)(M,g) be a connected and smooth Riemannian manifold. Then the following statements are equivalent:[2] The closed and bounded subsets of M are compact; M is a complete metric space; M is geodesically complete; that is, for every p∈M,, the exponential map expp is defined on the entire tangent space Tp⁡M.T_pM. Furthermore, any one of the above implies that given any two points p,q∈M,,q, there exists a length minimizing geodesic connecting these two points (geodesics are in general critical points for the length functional, and may or may not be minima). In the Hopf–Rinow theorem, the first characterization of completeness deals purely with the topology of the manifold and the boundedness of various sets; the second deals with the existence of minimizers to a certain problem in the calculus of variations (namely minimization of the length functional); the third deals with the nature of solutions to a certain system of ordinary differential equations.
