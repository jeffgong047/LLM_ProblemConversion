statement: In terms of order theory, (part of) Fitting's theorem can be stated as: The set of nilpotent normal subgroups form a lattice of subgroups. Thus the nilpotent normal subgroups of a finite group also form a bounded lattice, and have a top element, the Fitting subgroup. However, nilpotent normal subgroups do not in general form a complete lattice, as a subgroup generated by an infinite collection of nilpotent normal subgroups need not be nilpotent, though it will be normal. The join of all nilpotent normal subgroups is still defined as the Fitting subgroup, but it need not be nilpotent. External
