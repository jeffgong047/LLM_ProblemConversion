Prewhitening: For some type of colored noise, a typical practise is to add a prewhitening filter before the matched filter to transform the colored noise into white noise. For example, N(t) is a wide-sense stationary colored noise with correlation function RN(τ)=BN04e−B|τ|_N(τ)=BN_0/4e^-B|τ| SN(f)=N02(1+(wB)2)_N(f)=N_0/2(1+(w/B)^2) The transfer function of prewhitening filter is H(f)=1+jwB.(f)=1+jw/B.
