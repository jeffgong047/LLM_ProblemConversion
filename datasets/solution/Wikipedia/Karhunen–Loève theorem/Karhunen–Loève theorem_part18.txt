process: There are numerous equivalent characterizations of the Wiener process which is a mathematical formalization of Brownian motion. Here we regard it as the centered standard Gaussian process Wt with covariance function KW(t,s)=cov⁡(Wt,Ws)=min(s,t)._W(t,s)=cov(W_t,W_s)=min(s,t). We restrict the time domain to [a, b]=[0,1] without loss of generality. The eigenvectors of the covariance kernel are easily determined. These are ek(t)=2sin⁡((k−12)πt)_k(t)=√(2)sin((k-12)) and the corresponding eigenvalues are λk=1(k−12)2π2.λ_k=1/(k-1/2)^2π^2. Proof In order to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we need to solve the integral equation: ∫abKW(s,t)e(s)ds=λe(t)∀t,0≤t≤1∫01min(s,t)e(s)ds=λe(t)∀t,0≤t≤1∫0tse(s)ds+t∫t1e(s)ds=λe(t)∀t,0≤t≤1∫_a^bK_W(s,t)e(s) ds =(t) ,0≤1 ∫_0^1min(s,t)e(s) ds =(t) ,0≤1 ∫_0^tse(s) ds+t∫_t^1e(s) ds =(t) ,0≤1 differentiating once with respect to t yields: ∫t1e(s)ds=λe′(t)∫_t^1e(s) ds='(t) a second differentiation produces the following differential equation: −e(t)=λe″(t)-e(t)=”(t) The general solution of which has the form: e(t)=Asin⁡(tλ)+Bcos⁡(tλ)(t)=Asin(t/√(λ))+Bcos(t/√(λ)) where A and B are two constants to be determined with the boundary conditions. Setting t = 0 in the initial integral equation gives e(0) = 0 which implies that B = 0 and similarly, setting t = 1 in the first differentiation yields e' (1) = 0, whence: cos⁡(1λ)=0cos(1/√(λ))=0 which in turn implies that eigenvalues of TKX are: λk=(1(k−12)π)2,k≥1λ_k=(1/(k-1/2)π)^2,≥1 The corresponding eigenfunctions are thus of the form: ek(t)=Asin⁡((k−12)πt),k≥1_k(t)=Asin((k-1/2)),≥1 A is then chosen so as to normalize ek: ∫01ek2(t)dt=1⟹A=2∫_0^1e_k^2(t) dt=1 =√(2) This gives the following representation of the Wiener process: Theorem. There is a sequence {Zi}i of independent Gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance 1 such that Wt=2∑k=1∞Zksin⁡((k−12)πt)(k−12)π._t=√(2)∑_k=1^∞Z_ksin((k-1/2))/(k-1/2)π. Note that this representation is only valid for t∈[0,1].∈[0,1]. On larger intervals, the increments are not independent. As stated in the theorem, convergence is in the L2 norm and uniform in t.
