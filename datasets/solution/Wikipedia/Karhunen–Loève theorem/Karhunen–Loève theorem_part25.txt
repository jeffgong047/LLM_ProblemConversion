k(t): Since ∫0TRN(t,s)k(s)ds=∑i=1∞λiSi∫0TRN(t,s)Φi(s)ds=∑i=1∞SiΦi(t)=S(t),∫_0^TR_N(t,s)k(s) ds=∑_i=1^∞λ_iS_i∫_0^TR_N(t,s)Φ_i(s) ds=∑_i=1^∞S_iΦ_i(t)=S(t), k(t) is the solution to ∫0TRN(t,s)k(s)ds=S(t).∫_0^TR_N(t,s)k(s) ds=S(t). If N(t)is wide-sense stationary, ∫0TRN(t−s)k(s)ds=S(t),∫_0^TR_N(t-s)k(s) ds=S(t), which is known as the Wiener–Hopf equation. The equation can be solved by taking fourier transform, but not practically realizable since infinite spectrum needs spatial factorization. A special case which is easy to calculate k(t) is white Gaussian noise. ∫0TN02δ(t−s)k(s)ds=S(t)⇒k(t)=CS(t),0<t<T.∫_0^TN_0/2δ(t-s)k(s) ds=S(t)(t)=CS(t), 0<t<T. The corresponding impulse response is h(t) = k(T − t) = CS(T − t). Let C = 1, this is just the result we arrived at in previous section for detecting of signal in white noise.
