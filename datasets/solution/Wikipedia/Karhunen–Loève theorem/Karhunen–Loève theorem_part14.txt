analysis: Main article: Principal component analysis We have established the Karhunen–Loève theorem and derived a few properties thereof. We also noted that one hurdle in its application was the numerical cost of determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of its covariance operator through the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind ∫abKX(s,t)ek(s)ds=λkek(t).∫_a^bK_X(s,t)e_k(s) ds=λ_ke_k(t). However, when applied to a discrete and finite process (Xn)n∈1,…,N(X_n)_n∈{1,…,N}, the problem takes a much simpler form and standard algebra can be used to carry out the calculations. Note that a continuous process can also be sampled at N points in time in order to reduce the problem to a finite version. We henceforth consider a random N-dimensional vector X=(X1X2…XN)T=(X_1 X_2 … X_N)^T. As mentioned above, X could contain N samples of a signal but it can hold many more representations depending on the field of application. For instance it could be the answers to a survey or economic data in an econometrics analysis. As in the continuous version, we assume that X is centered, otherwise we can let X:=X−μX:=X-μ_X (where μXμ_X is the mean vector of X) which is centered. Let us adapt the procedure to the discrete case. Covariance
