bases: To further illustrate the differences between linear and non-linear approximations, we study the decomposition of a simple non-Gaussian random vector in a Karhunen–Loève basis. Processes whose realizations have a random translation are stationary. The Karhunen–Loève basis is then a Fourier basis and we study its performance. To simplify the analysis, consider a random vector Y[n] of size N that is random shift modulo N of a deterministic signal f[n] of zero mean ∑n=0N−1f[n]=0∑_n=0^N-1f[n]=0 Y[n]=f[(n−p)modN][n]=f[(n-p)N] The random shift P is uniformly distributed on [0, N − 1]: Pr(P=p)=1N,0≤p<N(P=p)=1/N, 0<N Clearly EY[n]=1N∑p=0N−1f[(n−p)modN]=0𝐄{Y[n]}=1/N∑_p=0^N-1f[(n-p)N]=0 and R[n,k]=EY[n]Y[k]=1N∑p=0N−1f[(n−p)modN]f[(k−p)modN]=1NfΘf¯[n−k],f¯[n]=f[−n][n,k]=𝐄{Y[n]Y[k]}=1/N∑_p=0^N-1f[(n-p)N]f[(k-p)N]=1/NfΘf̅[n-k], f̅[n]=f[-n] Hence R[n,k]=RY[n−k],RY[k]=1NfΘf¯[k][n,k]=R_Y[n-k],_Y[k]=1/NfΘf̅[k] Since RY is N periodic, Y is a circular stationary random vector. The covariance operator is a circular convolution with RY and is therefore diagonalized in the discrete Fourier Karhunen–Loève basis 1Nei2πmn/N0≤m<N.{1/√(N)e^i2/N}_0<N. The power spectrum is Fourier transform of RY: PY[m]=R^Y[m]=1N|f^[m]|2_Y[m]=R̂_Y[m]=1/N|f̂[m]|^2 Example: Consider an extreme case where f[n]=δ[n]−δ[n−1][n]=δ[n]-δ[n-1]. A theorem stated above guarantees that the Fourier Karhunen–Loève basis produces a smaller expected approximation error than a canonical basis of Diracs gm[n]=δ[n−m]0≤m<N{g_m[n]=δ[n-m]}_0<N. Indeed, we do not know a priori the abscissa of the non-zero coefficients of Y, so there is no particular Dirac that is better adapted to perform the approximation. But the Fourier vectors cover the whole support of Y and thus absorb a part of the signal energy. E|⟨Y[n],1Nei2πmn/N⟩|2=PY[m]=4Nsin2⁡(πkN)𝐄{|[n],1/√(N)e^i2/N⟩|^2}=P_Y[m]=4/Nsin^2(/N) Selecting higher frequency Fourier coefficients yields a better mean-square approximation than choosing a priori a few Dirac vectors to perform the approximation. The situation is totally different for non-linear approximations. If f[n]=δ[n]−δ[n−1][n]=δ[n]-δ[n-1] then the discrete Fourier basis is extremely inefficient because f and hence Y have an energy that is almost uniformly spread among all Fourier vectors. In contrast, since f has only two non-zero coefficients in the Dirac basis, a non-linear approximation of Y with M ≥ 2 gives zero error.[7] Principal component
