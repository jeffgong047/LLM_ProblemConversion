distribution: Since the limit in the mean of jointly Gaussian random variables is jointly Gaussian, and jointly Gaussian random (centered) variables are independent if and only if they are orthogonal, we can also conclude: Theorem. The variables Zi have a joint Gaussian distribution and are stochastically independent if the original process {Xt}t is Gaussian. In the Gaussian case, since the variables Zi are independent, we can say more: limN→∞∑i=1Nei(t)Zi(ω)=Xt(ω)lim_N→∞∑_i=1^Ne_i(t)Z_i(ω)=X_t(ω) almost surely. The Karhunen–Loève transform decorrelates the
