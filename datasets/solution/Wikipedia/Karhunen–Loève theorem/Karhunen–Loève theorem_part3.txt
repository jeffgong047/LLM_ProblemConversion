theorem: Theorem. Let Xt be a zero-mean square-integrable stochastic process defined over a probability space (Ω, F, P) and indexed over a closed and bounded interval [a, b], with continuous covariance function KX(s, t). Then KX(s,t) is a Mercer kernel and letting ek be an orthonormal basis on L2([a, b]) formed by the eigenfunctions of TKX with respective eigenvalues λk, Xt admits the following representation Xt=∑k=1∞Zkek(t)_t=∑_k=1^∞Z_ke_k(t) where the convergence is in L2, uniform in t and Zk=∫abXtek(t)dt_k=∫_a^bX_te_k(t) dt Furthermore, the random variables Zk have zero-mean, are uncorrelated and have variance λk E[Zk]=0,∀k∈NandE[ZiZj]=δijλj,∀i,j∈N𝐄[Z_k]=0, ∈ℕ 𝐄[Z_iZ_j]=δ_ijλ_j, ,j∈ℕ Note that by generalizations of Mercer's theorem we can replace the interval [a, b] with other compact spaces C and the Lebesgue measure on [a, b] with a Borel measure whose support is C.
