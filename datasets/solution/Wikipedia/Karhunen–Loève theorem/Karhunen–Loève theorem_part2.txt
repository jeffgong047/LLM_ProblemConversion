Formulation: Throughout this article, we will consider a random process Xt defined over a probability space (Ω, F, P) and indexed over a closed interval [a, b], which is square-integrable, is zero-mean, and with covariance function KX(s, t). In other words, we have: ∀t∈[a,b]Xt∈L2(Ω,F,P),i.e.E[Xt2]<∞,∈[a,b]_t^2(Ω,F,𝐏), i.e.𝐄[X_t^2]<∞, ∀t∈[a,b]E[Xt]=0,∈[a,b] 𝐄[X_t]=0, ∀t,s∈[a,b]KX(s,t)=E[XsXt].,s∈[a,b]_X(s,t)=𝐄[X_sX_t]. The square-integrable condition E[Xt2]<∞𝐄[X_t^2]<∞ is logically equivalent to KX(s,t)_X(s,t) being finite for all s,t∈[a,b],t∈[a,b].[6] We associate to KX a linear operator (more specifically a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator) TKX defined in the following way: TKX:L2([a,b])→L2([a,b]):f↦TKXf=∫abKX(s,⋅)f(s)ds T_K_X :L^2([a,b]) ^2([a,b]) :f_K_Xf =∫_a^bK_X(s,·)f(s) ds Since TKX is a linear operator, it makes sense to talk about its eigenvalues λk and eigenfunctions ek, which are found solving the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second kind ∫abKX(s,t)ek(s)ds=λkek(t)∫_a^bK_X(s,t)e_k(s) ds=λ_ke_k(t) Statement of the
