(AWGN): When the signal we want to detect from the noisy channel is also random, for example, a white Gaussian process X(t), we can still implement K–L expansion to get independent sequence of observation. In this case, the detection problem is described as follows: H0:Y(t)=N(t)_0:Y(t)=N(t) H1:Y(t)=N(t)+X(t),0<t<T._1:Y(t)=N(t)+X(t), 0<t<T. X(t) is a random process with correlation function RX(t,s)=EX(t)X(s)_X(t,s)=E{X(t)X(s)} The K–L expansion of X(t) is X(t)=∑i=1∞XiΦi(t),(t)=∑_i=1^∞X_iΦ_i(t), where Xi=∫0TX(t)Φi(t)dt_i=∫_0^TX(t)Φ_i(t) dt and Φi(t)Φ_i(t) are solutions to ∫0TRX(t,s)Φi(s)ds=λiΦi(t).∫_0^TR_X(t,s)Φ_i(s)ds=λ_iΦ_i(t). So Xi_i's are independent sequence of r.v's with zero mean and variance λiλ_i. Expanding Y(t) and N(t) by Φi(t)Φ_i(t), we get Yi=∫0TY(t)Φi(t)dt=∫0T[N(t)+X(t)]Φi(t)=Ni+Xi,_i=∫_0^TY(t)Φ_i(t) dt=∫_0^T[N(t)+X(t)]Φ_i(t)=N_i+X_i, where Ni=∫0TN(t)Φi(t)dt._i=∫_0^TN(t)Φ_i(t) dt. As N(t) is Gaussian white noise, Ni_i's are i.i.d sequence of r.v with zero mean and variance 12N012N_0, then the problem is simplified as follows, H0:Yi=Ni_0:Y_i=N_i H1:Yi=Ni+Xi_1:Y_i=N_i+X_i The Neyman–Pearson optimal test: Λ=fY∣H1fY∣H0=Ce−∑i=1∞yi22λi12N0(12N0+λi),Λ=f_Y_1/f_Y_0=Ce^-∑_i=1^∞y_i^2/2λ_i/12N_0(12N_0+λ_i), so the log-likelihood ratio is L=ln⁡(Λ)=K−∑i=1∞12yi2λiN02(N02+λi).ℒ=ln(Λ)=K-∑_i=1^∞12y_i^2λ_i/N_0/2(N_0/2+λ_i). Since X^i=λiN02(N02+λi)X_i=λ_i/N_0/2(N_0/2+λ_i) is just the minimum-mean-square estimate of Xi_i given Yi_i's, L=K+1N0∑i=1∞YiX^i.ℒ=K+1/N_0∑_i=1^∞Y_iX_i. K–L expansion has the following property: If f(t)=∑fiΦi(t),g(t)=∑giΦi(t),(t)=_iΦ_i(t),g(t)=_iΦ_i(t), where fi=∫0Tf(t)Φi(t)dt,gi=∫0Tg(t)Φi(t)dt._i=∫_0^Tf(t)Φ_i(t) dt,_i=∫_0^Tg(t)Φ_i(t) dt. then ∑i=1∞figi=∫0Tg(t)f(t)dt.∑_i=1^∞f_ig_i=∫_0^Tg(t)f(t) dt. So let X^(t∣T)=∑i=1∞X^iΦi(t),L=K+1N0∫0TY(t)X^(t∣T)dt.X(t)=∑_i=1^∞X_iΦ_i(t), ℒ=K+1/N_0∫_0^TY(t)X(t) dt. Noncausal filter Q(t,s) can be used to get the estimate through X^(t∣T)=∫0TQ(t,s)Y(s)ds.X(t)=∫_0^TQ(t,s)Y(s) ds. By orthogonality principle, Q(t,s) satisfies ∫0TQ(t,s)RX(s,t)ds+N02Q(t,λ)=RX(t,λ),0<λ<T,0<t<T.∫_0^TQ(t,s)R_X(s,t) ds+N_02Q(t,λ)=R_X(t,λ),0<λ<T,0<t<T. However, for practical reasons, it's necessary to further derive the causal filter h(t,s), where h(t,s) = 0 for s > t, to get estimate X^(t∣t)X(t). Specifically, Q(t,s)=h(t,s)+h(s,t)−∫0Th(λ,t)h(s,λ)dλ(t,s)=h(t,s)+h(s,t)-∫_0^Th(λ,t)h(s,λ) dλ See
