variance: An important observation is that since the random coefficients Zk of the KL expansion are uncorrelated, the Bienaymé formula asserts that the variance of Xt is simply the sum of the variances of the individual components of the sum: var⁡[Xt]=∑k=0∞ek(t)2var⁡[Zk]=∑k=1∞λkek(t)2var[X_t]=∑_k=0^∞e_k(t)^2var[Z_k]=∑_k=1^∞λ_ke_k(t)^2 Integrating over [a, b] and using the orthonormality of the ek, we obtain that the total variance of the process is: ∫abvar⁡[Xt]dt=∑k=1∞λk∫_a^bvar[X_t] dt=∑_k=1^∞λ_k In particular, the total variance of the N-truncated approximation is ∑k=1Nλk.∑_k=1^Nλ_k. As a result, the N-truncated expansion explains ∑k=1Nλk∑k=1∞λk∑_k=1^Nλ_k/∑_k=1^∞λ_k of the variance; and if we are content with an approximation that explains, say, 95% of the variance, then we just have to determine an N∈N∈ℕ such that ∑k=1Nλk∑k=1∞λk≥0.95.∑_k=1^Nλ_k/∑_k=1^∞λ_k≥0.95. The Karhunen–Loève expansion has the minimum representation entropy
