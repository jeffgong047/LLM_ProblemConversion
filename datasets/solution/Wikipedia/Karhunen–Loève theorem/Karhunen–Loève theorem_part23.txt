noise: When the channel noise is white, its correlation function is RN(t)=12N0δ(t),_N(t)=12N_0δ(t), and it has constant power spectrum density. In physically practical channel, the noise power is finite, so: SN(f)=N02|f|<w0|f|>w_N(f)=N_0/2 |f|<w 0 |f|>w Then the noise correlation function is sinc function with zeros at n2ω,n∈Z.n/2ω,n∈𝐙. Since are uncorrelated and gaussian, they are independent. Thus we can take samples from X(t) with time spacing Δt=n2ωwithin(0,″T″).=n/2ωwithin(0,”T”). Let Xi=X(iΔt)_i=X(i ). We have a total of n=TΔt=T(2ω)=2ωT=T/=T(2ω)=2 i.i.d observations X1,X2,…,Xn{X_1,X_2,…,X_n} to develop the likelihood-ratio test. Define signal Si=S(iΔt)_i=S(i ), the problem becomes, H:Xi=Ni,:X_i=N_i, K:Xi=Ni+Si,i=1,2,…,n.:X_i=N_i+S_i,i=1,2,…,n. The log-likelihood ratio L(x_)=log⁡∑i=1n(2Sixi−Si2)2σ2⇔Δt∑i=1nSixi=∑i=1nS(iΔt)x(iΔt)Δt≷λ⋅2ℒ(x)=log∑_i=1^n(2S_ix_i-S_i^2)/2σ^2⇔∑_i=1^nS_ix_i=∑_i=1^nS(i )x(i ) ≷λ_·2 As t → 0, let: G=∫0TS(t)x(t)dt.=∫_0^TS(t)x(t) dt. Then G is the test statistics and the Neyman–Pearson optimum detector is G(x_)>G0⇒K<G0⇒H.(x)>G_0<G_0. As G is Gaussian, we can characterize it by finding its mean and variances. Then we get H:G∼N(0,12N0E):G(0,12N_0E) K:G∼N(E,12N0E):G(E,12N_0E) where E=∫0TS2(t)dt𝐄=∫_0^TS^2(t) dt is the signal energy.
