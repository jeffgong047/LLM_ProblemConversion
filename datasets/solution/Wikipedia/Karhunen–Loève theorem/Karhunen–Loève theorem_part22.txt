S(t): In communication, we usually have to decide whether a signal from a noisy channel contains valuable information. The following hypothesis testing is used for detecting continuous signal s(t) from channel output X(t), N(t) is the channel noise, which is usually assumed zero mean Gaussian process with correlation function RN(t,s)=E[N(t)N(s)]_N(t,s)=E[N(t)N(s)] H:X(t)=N(t),:X(t)=N(t), K:X(t)=N(t)+s(t),t∈(0,T):X(t)=N(t)+s(t),∈(0,T) Signal detection in white
