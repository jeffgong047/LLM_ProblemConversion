statement: Let s(n)n≥0(n)_n≥0 be a sequence of complex numbers satisfying s(n)=c1s(n−1)+c2s(n−2)+⋯+cds(n−d)(n)=c_1s(n-1)+c_2s(n-2)+⋯+c_ds(n-d) for all n≥d, where ci_i are complex number constants (i.e., a constant-recursive sequence of order d). Then the set of zeros n∣s(n)=0{n(n)=0} is equal to the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions. If we have cd≠0_d≠0 (excluding sequences such as 1, 0, 0, 0, ...), then the set of zeros in fact equal to the union of a finite set and finitely many full arithmetic progressions, where an infinite arithmetic progression is full if there exist integers a and b such that the progression consists of all positive integers equal to b modulo a.
