Example: Consider the sequence 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, ... that alternates between zeros and the Fibonacci numbers. This sequence can be generated by the linear recurrence relation F(i)=F(i−2)+F(i−4)(i)=F(i-2)+F(i-4) (a modified form of the Fibonacci recurrence), starting from the base cases F(1) = F(2) = F(4) = 0 and F(3) = 1. For this sequence, F(i) = 0 if and only if i is either one or even. Thus, the positions at which the sequence is zero can be partitioned into a finite set (the singleton set {1}) and a full arithmetic progression (the positive even numbers). In this example, only one arithmetic progression was needed, but other recurrence sequences may have zeros at positions forming multiple arithmetic progressions. Related
