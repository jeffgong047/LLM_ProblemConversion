theorem: The model used in Aumann[1] to prove the theorem consists of a finite set of states S with a prior probability p, which is common to all agents. Agent a's knowledge is given by a partition ΠaΠ_a of S. The posterior probability of agent a, denoted pa_a is the conditional probability of p given ΠaΠ_a. Fix an event E and let X be the event that for each a, pa(E)=xa_a(E)=x_a. The theorem claims that if the event C(X)(X) that X is common knowledge is not empty then all the numbers xa_a are the same. The proof follows directly from the definition of common knowledge. The event C(X)(X) is a union of elements of ΠaΠ_a for each a. Thus, for each a, p(E|C(x))=xa(E|C(x))=x_a. The claim of the theorem follows since the left hand side is independent of a. The theorem was proved for two agents but the proof for any number of agents is similar.
