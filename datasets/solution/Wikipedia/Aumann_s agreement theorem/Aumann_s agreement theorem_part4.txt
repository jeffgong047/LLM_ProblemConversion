Dynamics: A dialogue between two agents is a dynamic process in which, in each stage, the agents tell each other their posteriors of a given event E. Upon gaining this new information, each is updating her posterior of E. Aumann suggested that such a process leads the agents to commonly know their posteriors, and hence, by the agreement theorem, the posteriors at the end of the process coincide.[1] Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis proved it for dialogues in finite state spaces.[9] Polemarchakis showed that any pair of finite sequences of the same length that end with the same number can be obtained as a dialogue.[10] In contrast, Di Tillio and co-authors showed that infinite dialogues must satisfy certain restrictions on their variation.[11] Scott Aaronson studied the complexity and rate of convergence of various types of dialogues with more than two agents.[12]
