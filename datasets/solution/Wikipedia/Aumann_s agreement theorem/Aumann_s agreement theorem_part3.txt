Extensions: Monderer and Samet relaxed the assumption of common knowledge and assumed instead common p-belief of the posteriors of the agents.[2] They gave an upper bound of the distance between the posteriors xa_a. This bound approaches 0 when p approaches 1. Ziv Hellman relaxed the assumption of a common prior and assumed instead that the agents have priors that are εε-close in a well defined metric.[3] He showed that common knowledge of the posteriors in this case implies that they are εε-close. When εε goes to zero, Aumann's original theorem is recapitulated. Nielsen extended the theorem to non-discrete models in which knowledge is described by σσ-algebras rather than partitions.[4] Knowledge which is defined in terms of partitions has the property of negative introspection. That is, agents know that they do not know what they do not know. However, it is possible to show that it is impossible to agree to disagree even when knowledge does not have this property. [5] Halpern and Kets argued that players can agree to disagree in the presence of ambiguity, even if there is a common prior. However, allowing for ambiguity is more restrictive than assuming heterogeneous priors.[6] The impossibility of agreeing to disagree, in Aumann's theorem, is a necessary condition for the existence of a common prior. A stronger condition can be formulated in terms of bets. A bet is a set of random variables fa_a, one for each agent a, such the ∑afa=0∑_af_a=0. The bet is favorable to agent a in a state s if the expected value of fa_a at s is positive. The impossibility of agreeing on the profitability of a bet is a stronger condition than the impossibility of agreeing to disagree, and moreover, it is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a common prior.[7][8]
