theorem: Let (M, g) be a closed m-dimensional Riemannian manifold with injectivity radius inj(M). Let vol(M) denote the Riemannian volume of M and let cm denote the volume of the standard m-dimensional sphere of radius one. Then vol(M)≥cm(inj(M))mπm,vol(M)≥c_m(inj(M))^m/π^m, with equality if and only if (M, g) is isometric to the m-sphere with its usual round metric. This result is known as Berger's isoembolic inequality.[1] The proof relies upon an analytic inequality proved by Kazdan.[2] The original work of Berger and Kazdan appears in the appendices of Arthur Besse's book "Manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed." At this stage, the isoembolic inequality appeared with a non-optimal constant.[3] Sometimes Kazdan's inequality is called Berger–Kazdan inequality.[4]
