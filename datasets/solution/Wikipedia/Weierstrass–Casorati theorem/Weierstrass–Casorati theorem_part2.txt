theorem: Start with some open subset U in the complex plane containing the number z0_0, and a function f that is holomorphic on U∖z0∖{z_0}, but has an essential singularity at z0_0 . The Casorati–Weierstrass theorem then states that if V is any neighbourhood of z0_0 contained in U, then f(V∖z0)(V∖{z_0}) is dense in Cℂ. This can also be stated as follows: for any ε>0,δ>0ε>0,δ>0, and a complex number w, there exists a complex number z in U with 0<|z−z0|<δ0<|z-z_0|<δ and |f(z)−w|<ε|f(z)-w|<ε. Or in still more descriptive terms: f comes arbitrarily close to any complex value in every neighbourhood of z0_0. The theorem is considerably strengthened by Picard's great theorem, which states, in the notation above, that f assumes every complex value, with one possible exception, infinitely often on V. In the case that f is an entire function and a=∞=∞, the theorem says that the values f(z)(z) approach every complex number and ∞∞, as z tends to infinity. It is remarkable that this does not hold for holomorphic maps in higher dimensions, as the famous example of Pierre Fatou shows.[1] Plot of the function exp(1/z), centered on the essential singularity at z = 0. The hue represents the complex argument, the luminance represents the absolute value. This plot shows how approaching the essential singularity from different directions yields different behaviors (as opposed to a pole, which would be uniformly white).
