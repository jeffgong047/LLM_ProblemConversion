theorem: A short proof of the theorem is as follows: Take as given that function f is meromorphic on some punctured neighborhood V \ {z0}, and that z0 is an essential singularity. Assume by way of contradiction that some value b exists that the function can never get close to; that is: assume that there is some complex value b and some ε > 0 such that ‖f(z) − b‖ ≥ ε for all z in V at which f is defined. Then the new function: g(z)=1f(z)−b(z)=1/f(z)-b must be holomorphic on V \ {z0}, with zeroes at the poles of f, and bounded by 1/ε. It can therefore be analytically continued (or continuously extended, or holomorphically extended) to all of V by Riemann's analytic continuation theorem. So the original function can be expressed in terms of g: f(z)=1g(z)+b(z)=1/g(z)+b for all arguments z in V \ {z0}. Consider the two possible cases for limz→z0g(z).lim_z_0g(z). If the limit is 0, then f has a pole at z0 . If the limit is not 0, then z0 is a removable singularity of f . Both possibilities contradict the assumption that the point z0 is an essential singularity of the function f . Hence the assumption is false and the theorem holds.
