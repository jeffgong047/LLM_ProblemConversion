Examples: The function f(z) = exp(1/z) has an essential singularity at 0, but the function g(z) = 1/z3 does not (it has a pole at 0). Consider the function f(z)=e1/z.(z)=e^1/z. This function has the following Laurent series about the essential singular point at 0: f(z)=∑n=0∞1n!z−n.(z)=∑_n=0^∞1/n!z^-n. Because f′(z)=−−e1/zz2'(z)=--e^1/z/z^2 exists for all points z ≠ 0 we know that f(z) is analytic in a punctured neighborhood of z = 0. Hence it is an isolated singularity, as well as being an essential singularity. Using a change of variable to polar coordinates z=reiθ=re^iθ our function, f(z) = e1/z becomes: f(z)=e1re−iθ=e1rcos⁡(θ)e−1risin⁡(θ).(z)=e^1/re^-iθ=e^1/rcos(θ)e^-1/risin(θ). Taking the absolute value of both sides: |f(z)|=|e1rcos⁡θ||e−1risin⁡(θ)|=e1rcos⁡θ.|f(z)|=|e^1/rcosθ||e^-1/risin(θ)|=e^1/rcosθ. Thus, for values of θ such that cos θ > 0, we have f(z)→∞(z)→∞ as r→0→0, and for cos⁡θ<0cosθ<0, f(z)→0(z)→0 as r→0→0. Consider what happens, for example when z takes values on a circle of diameter 1/R tangent to the imaginary axis. This circle is given by r = (1/R) cos θ. Then, f(z)=eR[cos⁡(Rtan⁡θ)−isin⁡(Rtan⁡θ)](z)=e^R[cos(Rtanθ)-isin(Rtanθ)] and |f(z)|=eR.|f(z)|=e^R. Thus,|f(z)||f(z)| may take any positive value other than zero by the appropriate choice of R. As z→0→0 on the circle, θ→π2θ→π/2 with R fixed. So this part of the equation: [cos⁡(Rtan⁡θ)−isin⁡(Rtan⁡θ)][cos(Rtanθ)-isin(Rtanθ)] takes on all values on the unit circle infinitely often. Hence f(z) takes on the value of every number in the complex plane except for zero infinitely often. Proof of the
