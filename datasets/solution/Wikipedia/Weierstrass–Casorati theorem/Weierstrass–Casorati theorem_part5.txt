History: The history of this important theorem is described by Collingwood and Lohwater.[2] It was published by Weierstrass in 1876 (in German) and by Sokhotski in 1868 in his Master thesis (in Russian). So it was called Sokhotski's theorem in the Russian literature and Weierstrass's theorem in the Western literature. The same theorem was published by Casorati in 1868, and by Briot and Bouquet in the first edition of their book (1859).[3] However, Briot and Bouquet removed this theorem from the second edition (1875).
