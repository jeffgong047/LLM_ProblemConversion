In any party of 6 people, at least 3 are mutual strangers or at least 3 are acquaintances. For the friendship theorem of Paul Erdős, Alfréd Rényi, and Vera T. Sós characterizing graphs in which each two vertices have exactly one neighbor, see friendship graph. 78 of the 156 possible friends-strangers graphs with 6 nodes. The other 78 can be obtained by reversing the red and blue colours of each graph. For each graph the red/blue nodes shows a sample triplet of mutual friends/strangers. The theorem on friends and strangers is a mathematical theorem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory.
