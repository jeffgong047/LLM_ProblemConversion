theorem: A 2-colouring of K5 with no monochromatic K3 The conclusion to the theorem does not hold if we replace the party of six people by a party of less than six. To show this, we give a coloring of K5 with red and blue that does not contain a triangle with all edges the same color. We draw K5 as a pentagon surrounding a star (a pentagram). We color the edges of the pentagon red and the edges of the star blue. Thus, 6 is the smallest number for which we can claim the conclusion of the theorem. In Ramsey theory, we write this fact as: R(3,3:2)=6.(3,3:2)=6.
