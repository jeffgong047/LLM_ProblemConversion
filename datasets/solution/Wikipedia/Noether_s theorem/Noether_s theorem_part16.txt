proof: This applies to any local symmetry derivation Q satisfying QS ≈ 0, and also to more general local functional differentiable actions, including ones where the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the fields. Let ε be any arbitrary smooth function of the spacetime (or time) manifold such that the closure of its support is disjoint from the boundary. ε is a test function. Then, because of the variational principle (which does not apply to the boundary, by the way), the derivation distribution q generated by q[ε][Φ(x)] = ε(x)Q[Φ(x)] satisfies q[ε][S] ≈ 0 for every ε, or more compactly, q(x)[S] ≈ 0 for all x not on the boundary (but remember that q(x) is a shorthand for a derivation distribution, not a derivation parametrized by x in general). This is the generalization of Noether's theorem. To see how the generalization is related to the version given above, assume that the action is the spacetime integral of a Lagrangian that only depends on φφ and its first derivatives. Also, assume Q[L]≈∂μfμ[ℒ]≈∂_μf^μ Then, q[ε][S]=∫q[ε][L]dnx=∫(∂∂φL)εQ[φ]+[∂∂(∂μφ)L]∂μ(εQ[φ])dnx=∫εQ[L]+∂με[∂∂(∂μφ)L]Q[φ]dnx≈∫ε∂μfμ−[∂∂(∂μφ)L]Q[φ]dnxq[ε][𝒮] =[ε][ℒ]d^nx =∫{(∂/∂φℒ)[φ]+[∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ]∂_μ([φ])}d^nx =∫{[ℒ]+∂_με[∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ]Q[φ]} d^nx ≈∫ε∂_μ{f^μ-[∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ]Q[φ]} d^nx for all εε. More generally, if the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives, then ∂μ[fμ−[∂∂(∂μφ)L]Q[φ]−2[∂∂(∂μ∂νφ)L]∂νQ[φ]+∂ν[[∂∂(∂μ∂νφ)L]Q[φ]]−⋯]≈0.∂_μ[f^μ-[∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ]Q[φ]-2[∂/∂(∂_μ∂_νφ)ℒ]∂_νQ[φ]+∂_ν[[∂/∂(∂_μ∂_νφ)ℒ]Q[φ]]- …]≈0.
