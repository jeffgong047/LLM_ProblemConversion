theorem: All fine technical points aside, Noether's theorem can be stated informally: If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.[7] A more sophisticated version of the theorem involving fields states that: To every differentiable symmetry generated by local actions there corresponds a conserved current. The word "symmetry" in the above statement refers more precisely to the covariance of the form that a physical law takes with respect to a one-dimensional Lie group of transformations satisfying certain technical criteria. The conservation law of a physical quantity is usually expressed as a continuity equation. The formal proof of the theorem utilizes the condition of invariance to derive an expression for a current associated with a conserved physical quantity. In modern (since c. 1980[8]) terminology, the conserved quantity is called the Noether charge, while the flow carrying that charge is called the Noether current. The Noether current is defined up to a solenoidal (divergenceless) vector field. In the context of gravitation, Felix Klein's statement of Noether's theorem for action I stipulates for the invariants:[9] If an integral I is invariant under a continuous group Gρ with ρ parameters, then ρ linearly independent combinations of the Lagrangian expressions are divergences.
