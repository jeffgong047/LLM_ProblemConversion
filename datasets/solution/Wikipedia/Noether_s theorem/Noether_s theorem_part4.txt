concept: Plot illustrating Noether's theorem for a coordinate-wise symmetry. The main idea behind Noether's theorem is most easily illustrated by a system with one coordinate q and a continuous symmetry φ:q↦q+δqφ:q+ (gray arrows on the diagram). Consider any trajectory q(t)(t) (bold on the diagram) that satisfies the system's laws of motion. That is, the action S governing this system is stationary on this trajectory, i.e. does not change under any local variation of the trajectory. In particular it would not change under a variation that applies the symmetry flow φφ on a time segment [t0, t1] and is motionless outside that segment. To keep the trajectory continuous, we use "buffering" periods of small time ττ to transition between the segments gradually. The total change in the action S now comprises changes brought by every interval in play. Parts, where variation itself vanishes, bring no ΔS. The middle part does not change the action either, because its transformation φφ is a symmetry and thus preserves the Lagrangian L and the action S=∫L=. The only remaining parts are the "buffering" pieces. Roughly speaking, they contribute mostly through their "slanting" q˙→q˙±δq/τq̇→q̇±/τ. That changes the Lagrangian by ΔL≈(∂L/∂q˙)Δq˙≈(/∂q̇)Δq̇, which integrates to ΔS=∫ΔL≈∫∂L∂q˙Δq˙≈∫∂L∂q˙(±δqτ)≈±∂L∂q˙δq=±∂L∂q˙φ.=∫≈∫/∂q̇Δq̇≈∫/∂q̇(±/τ)≈ pm/∂q̇=±/∂q̇φ. These last terms, evaluated around the endpoints t0_0 and t1_1, should cancel each other in order to make the total change in the action ΔS be zero, as would be expected if the trajectory is a solution. That is (∂L∂q˙φ)(t0)=(∂L∂q˙φ)(t1),(/∂q̇φ)(t_0)=(/∂q̇φ)(t_1), meaning the quantity (∂L/∂q˙)φ(/∂q̇)φ is conserved, which is the conclusion of Noether's theorem. For instance if pure translations of q by a constant are the symmetry, then the conserved quantity becomes just (∂L/∂q˙)=p(/∂q̇)=p, the canonical momentum. More general cases follow the same idea:When more coordinates qr_r undergo a symmetry transformation qr↦qr+φr_r_r+φ_r, their effects add up by linearity to a conserved quantity ∑r(∂L/∂q˙r)φr∑_r(/∂q̇_r)φ_r.When there are time transformations t↦t+T+T, they cause the "buffering" segments to contribute the two following terms to ΔS: ΔS≈±(TL+∫∂L∂q˙rΔq˙r)≈±T(L−∂L∂q˙rq˙r),≈±(TL+∫/∂q̇_rΔq̇_r)≈(L-/∂q̇_rq̇_r), first term being due to stretching in temporal dimension of the "buffering" segment (that changes the size of the domain of integration), and the second is due to its "slanting" just as in the exemplar case. Together they add a summand T(L−∑r(∂L/∂q˙r)q˙r)(L-∑_r(/∂q̇_r)q̇_r) to the conserved quantity.Finally, when instead of a trajectory q(t)(t) entire fields ψ(qr,t)ψ(q_r,t) are considered, the argument replaces the interval [t0,t1][t_0,t_1] with a bounded region U of the (qr,t)(q_r,t)-domain, the endpoints t0_0 and t1_1 with the boundary ∂U of the region, and its contribution to ΔS is interpreted as a flux of a conserved current jr_r, that is built in a way analogous to the prior definition of a conserved quantity. Now, the zero contribution of the "buffering" ∂U to ΔS is interpreted as vanishing of the total flux of the current jr_r through the ∂U. That is the sense in which it is conserved: how much is "flowing" in, just as much is "flowing" out. Historical
