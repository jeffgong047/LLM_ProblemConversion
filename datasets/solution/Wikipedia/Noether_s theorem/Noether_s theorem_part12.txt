derivation: Noether's theorem may also be derived for tensor fields φAφ^A where the index A ranges over the various components of the various tensor fields. These field quantities are functions defined over a four-dimensional space whose points are labeled by coordinates xμ where the index μ ranges over time (μ = 0) and three spatial dimensions (μ = 1, 2, 3). These four coordinates are the independent variables; and the values of the fields at each event are the dependent variables. Under an infinitesimal transformation, the variation in the coordinates is written xμ→ξμ=xμ+δxμ^μ→ξ^μ=x^μ+^μ whereas the transformation of the field variables is expressed as φA→αA(ξμ)=φA(xμ)+δφA(xμ).φ^A→α^A(ξ^μ)=φ^A(x^μ)+δφ^A(x^μ) . By this definition, the field variations δφAδφ^A result from two factors: intrinsic changes in the field themselves and changes in coordinates, since the transformed field αA depends on the transformed coordinates ξμ. To isolate the intrinsic changes, the field variation at a single point xμ may be defined αA(xμ)=φA(xμ)+δ¯φA(xμ).α^A(x^μ)=φ^A(x^μ)+δ̅φ^A(x^μ) . If the coordinates are changed, the boundary of the region of space–time over which the Lagrangian is being integrated also changes; the original boundary and its transformed version are denoted as Ω and Ω’, respectively. Noether's theorem begins with the assumption that a specific transformation of the coordinates and field variables does not change the action, which is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the given region of spacetime. Expressed mathematically, this assumption may be written as ∫Ω′L(αA,αA,ν,ξμ)d4ξ−∫ΩL(φA,φA,ν,xμ)d4x=0∫_Ω^'L(α^A,α^A_,ν,ξ^μ)d^4ξ-∫_ΩL(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)d^4x=0 where the comma subscript indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate(s) that follows the comma, e.g. φA,σ=∂φA∂xσ.φ^A_,σ=∂φ^A/^σ . Since ξ is a dummy variable of integration, and since the change in the boundary Ω is infinitesimal by assumption, the two integrals may be combined using the four-dimensional version of the divergence theorem into the following form ∫Ω[L(αA,αA,ν,xμ)−L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)]+∂∂xσ[L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)δxσ]d4x=0.∫_Ω{[L(α^A,α^A_,ν,x^μ)-L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)]+∂/^σ[L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)^σ]}d^4x=0 . The difference in Lagrangians can be written to first-order in the infinitesimal variations as [L(αA,αA,ν,xμ)−L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)]=∂L∂φAδ¯φA+∂L∂φA,σδ¯φA,σ.[L(α^A,α^A_,ν,x^μ)-L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)]=/∂φ^Aδ̅φ^A+/∂φ^A_,σδ̅φ^A_,σ . However, because the variations are defined at the same point as described above, the variation and the derivative can be done in reverse order; they commute δ¯φA,σ=δ¯∂φA∂xσ=∂∂xσ(δ¯φA).δ̅φ^A_,σ=δ̅∂φ^A/^σ=∂/^σ(δ̅φ^A) . Using the Euler–Lagrange field equations ∂∂xσ(∂L∂φA,σ)=∂L∂φA∂/^σ(/∂φ^A_,σ)=/∂φ^A the difference in Lagrangians can be written neatly as [L(αA,αA,ν,xμ)−L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)]=∂∂xσ(∂L∂φA,σ)δ¯φA+∂L∂φA,σδ¯φA,σ=∂∂xσ(∂L∂φA,σδ¯φA). [L(α^A,α^A_,ν,x^μ)-L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)] = ∂/^σ(/∂φ^A_,σ)δ̅φ^A+/∂φ^A_,σδ̅φ^A_,σ=∂/^σ(/∂φ^A_,σδ̅φ^A). Thus, the change in the action can be written as ∫Ω∂∂xσ∂L∂φA,σδ¯φA+L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)δxσd4x=0.∫_Ω∂/^σ{/∂φ^A_,σδ̅φ^A+L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)^σ}d^4x=0 . Since this holds for any region Ω, the integrand must be zero ∂∂xσ∂L∂φA,σδ¯φA+L(φA,φA,ν,xμ)δxσ=0.∂/^σ{/∂φ^A_,σδ̅φ^A+L(φ^A,φ^A_,ν,x^μ)^σ}=0 . For any combination of the various symmetry transformations, the perturbation can be written δxμ=εXμδφA=εΨA=δ¯φA+εLXφA^μ =^μ δφ^A =εΨ^A=δ̅φ^A+εℒ_Xφ^A where LXφAℒ_Xφ^A is the Lie derivative of φAφ^A in the Xμ direction. When φAφ^A is a scalar or Xμ,ν=0X^μ_,ν=0, LXφA=∂φA∂xμXμ.ℒ_Xφ^A=∂φ^A/^μX^μ . These equations imply that the field variation taken at one point equals δ¯φA=εΨA−εLXφA.δ̅φ^A=εΨ^A-εℒ_Xφ^A . Differentiating the above divergence with respect to ε at ε = 0 and changing the sign yields the conservation law ∂∂xσjσ=0∂/^σj^σ=0 where the conserved current equals jσ=[∂L∂φA,σLXφA−LXσ]−(∂L∂φA,σ)ΨA.^σ=[/∂φ^A_,σℒ_Xφ^A-L X^σ]-(/∂φ^A_,σ)Ψ^A .
