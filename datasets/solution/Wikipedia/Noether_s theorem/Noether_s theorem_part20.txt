transformation: Both examples 1 and 2 are over a 1-dimensional manifold (time). An example involving spacetime is a conformal transformation of a massless real scalar field with a quartic potential in (3 + 1)-Minkowski spacetime. S[φ]=∫L[φ(x),∂μφ(x)]d4x=∫(12∂μφ∂μφ−λφ4)d4x𝒮[φ] =∫ℒ[φ(x),∂_μφ(x)]d^4x =∫(1/2∂^μφ∂_μφ-λφ^4)d^4x For Q, consider the generator of a spacetime rescaling. In other words, Q[φ(x)]=xμ∂μφ(x)+φ(x).[φ(x)]=x^μ∂_μφ(x)+φ(x). The second term on the right hand side is due to the "conformal weight" of φφ. And Q[L]=∂μφ(∂μφ+xν∂μ∂νφ+∂μφ)−4λφ3(xμ∂μφ+φ).[ℒ]=∂^μφ(∂_μφ+x^ν∂_μ∂_νφ+∂_μφ)-4λφ^3(x^μ∂_μφ+φ). This has the form of ∂μ[12xμ∂νφ∂νφ−λxμφ4]=∂μ(xμL)∂_μ[1/2x^μ∂^νφ∂_νφ-^μφ^4]=∂_μ(x^μℒ) (where we have performed a change of dummy indices) so set fμ=xμL.^μ=x^μℒ. Then jμ=[∂∂(∂μφ)L]Q[φ]−fμ=∂μφ(xν∂νφ+φ)−xμ(12∂νφ∂νφ−λφ4).j^μ =[∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ]Q[φ]-f^μ =∂^μφ(x^ν∂_νφ+φ)-x^μ(1/2∂^νφ∂_νφ-λφ^4). Noether's theorem states that ∂μjμ=0∂_μj^μ=0 (as one may explicitly check by substituting the Euler–Lagrange equations into the left hand side). If one tries to find the Ward–Takahashi analog of this equation, one runs into a problem because of anomalies.
