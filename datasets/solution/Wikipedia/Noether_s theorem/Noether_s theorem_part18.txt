energy: Looking at the specific case of a Newtonian particle of mass m, coordinate x, moving under the influence of a potential V, coordinatized by time t. The action, S, is: S[x]=∫L[x(t),x˙(t)]dt=∫(m2∑i=13x˙i2−V(x(t)))dt.𝒮[x] =[x(t),ẋ(t)] dt =∫(m/2∑_i=1^3ẋ_i^2-V(x(t))) dt. The first term in the brackets is the kinetic energy of the particle, while the second is its potential energy. Consider the generator of time translations Q = d/dt. In other words, Q[x(t)]=x˙(t)[x(t)]=ẋ(t). The coordinate x has an explicit dependence on time, whilst V does not; consequently: Q[L]=ddt[m2∑ix˙i2−V(x)]=m∑ix˙ix¨i−∑i∂V(x)∂xix˙i[L]=d/dt[m/2∑_iẋ_i^2-V(x)]=m∑_iẋ_iẍ_i-∑_i(x)/_iẋ_i so we can set L=m2∑ix˙i2−V(x).=m/2∑_iẋ_i^2-V(x). Then, j=∑i=13∂L∂x˙iQ[xi]−L=m∑ix˙i2−[m2∑ix˙i2−V(x)]=m2∑ix˙i2+V(x).j =∑_i=1^3/∂ẋ_iQ[x_i]-L =m∑_iẋ_i^2-[m/2∑_iẋ_i^2-V(x)] =m/2∑_iẋ_i^2+V(x). The right hand side is the energy, and Noether's theorem states that dj/dt=0/dt=0 (i.e. the principle of conservation of energy is a consequence of invariance under time translations). More generally, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, the quantity ∑i=13∂L∂x˙ixi˙−L∑_i=1^3/∂ẋ_iẋ_̇i̇-L (called the Hamiltonian) is conserved. Example 2: Conservation of center of
