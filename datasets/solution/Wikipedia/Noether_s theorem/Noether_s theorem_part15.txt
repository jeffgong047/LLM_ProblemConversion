algebras: Suppose we have two symmetry derivations Q1 and Q2. Then, [Q1, Q2] is also a symmetry derivation. Let us see this explicitly. Let us say Q1[L]≈∂μf1μ_1[ℒ]≈∂_μf_1^μ and Q2[L]≈∂μf2μ_2[ℒ]≈∂_μf_2^μ Then, [Q1,Q2][L]=Q1[Q2[L]]−Q2[Q1[L]]≈∂μf12μ[Q_1,Q_2][ℒ]=Q_1[Q_2[ℒ]]-Q_2[Q_1[ℒ]]≈∂_μf_12^μ where f12 = Q1[f2μ] − Q2[f1μ]. So, j12μ=(∂∂(∂μφ)L)(Q1[Q2[φ]]−Q2[Q1[φ]])−f12μ._12^μ=(∂/∂(∂_μφ)ℒ)(Q_1[Q_2[φ]]-Q_2[Q_1[φ]])-f_12^μ. This shows we can extend Noether's theorem to larger Lie algebras in a natural way.
