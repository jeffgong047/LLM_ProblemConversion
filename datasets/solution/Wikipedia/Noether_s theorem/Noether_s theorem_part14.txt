Comments: Noether's theorem is an on shell theorem: it relies on use of the equations of motion—the classical path. It reflects the relation between the boundary conditions and the variational principle. Assuming no boundary terms in the action, Noether's theorem implies that ∫∂NJμdsμ≈0.∫_J^μds_μ≈0. The quantum analogs of Noether's theorem involving expectation values (e.g., ⟨∫d4x∂⋅J⟩=0⟨^4x ∂·J⟩=0) probing off shell quantities as well are the Ward–Takahashi identities. Generalization to Lie
