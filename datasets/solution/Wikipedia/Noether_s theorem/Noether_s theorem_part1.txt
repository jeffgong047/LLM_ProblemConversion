Statement relating differentiable symmetries to conserved quantities This article is about Emmy Noether's first theorem, which derives conserved quantities from symmetries. For other uses, see Noether's theorem (disambiguation). First page of Emmy Noether's article "Invariante Variationsprobleme" (1918), where she proved her theorem.

This theorem only applies to continuous and smooth symmetries over physical space. Noether's theorem is used in theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. It reveals the fundamental relation between the symmetries of a physical system and the conservation laws. It also made modern theoretical physicists much more focused on symmetries of physical systems. A generalization of the formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g., systems with a Rayleigh dissipation function). In particular, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.[citation needed] Briefly, the relationships between symmetries and conservation laws are as follows: 1) Uniformity of space distance-wise ⟹ conservation of linear momentum; 2) Isotropy of space direction-wise ⟹ conservation of angular momentum; 3) Uniformity of time ⟹ conservation of energy Basic illustrations and
