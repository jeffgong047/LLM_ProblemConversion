perturbations: The essence of Noether's theorem is generalizing the notion of ignorable coordinates. One can assume that the Lagrangian L defined above is invariant under small perturbations (warpings) of the time variable t and the generalized coordinates q. One may write t→t′=t+δtq→q′=q+δq,t ^'=t+ 𝐪 →𝐪^'=𝐪+δ𝐪 , where the perturbations δt and δq are both small, but variable. For generality, assume there are (say) N such symmetry transformations of the action, i.e. transformations leaving the action unchanged; labelled by an index r = 1, 2, 3, ..., N. Then the resultant perturbation can be written as a linear sum of the individual types of perturbations, δt=∑rεrTrδq=∑rεrQr, =∑_rε_rT_r δ𝐪 =∑_rε_r𝐐_r , where εr are infinitesimal parameter coefficients corresponding to each: generator Tr of time evolution, and generator Qr of the generalized coordinates. For translations, Qr is a constant with units of length; for rotations, it is an expression linear in the components of q, and the parameters make up an angle. Using these definitions, Noether showed that the N quantities (∂L∂q˙⋅q˙−L)Tr−∂L∂q˙⋅Qr(/∂𝐪̇·𝐪̇-L)T_r-/∂𝐪̇·𝐐_r are conserved (constants of motion).
