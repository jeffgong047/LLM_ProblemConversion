version: Although useful in its own right, the version of Noether's theorem just given is a special case of the general version derived in 1915. To give the flavor of the general theorem, a version of Noether's theorem for continuous fields in four-dimensional space–time is now given. Since field theory problems are more common in modern physics than mechanics problems, this field theory version is the most commonly used (or most often implemented) version of Noether's theorem. Let there be a set of differentiable fields φφ defined over all space and time; for example, the temperature T(x,t)(𝐱,t) would be representative of such a field, being a number defined at every place and time. The principle of least action can be applied to such fields, but the action is now an integral over space and time S=∫L(φ,∂μφ,xμ)d4x𝒮=∫ℒ(φ,∂_μφ,x^μ) d^4x (the theorem can be further generalized to the case where the Lagrangian depends on up to the nth derivative, and can also be formulated using jet bundles). A continuous transformation of the fields φφ can be written infinitesimally as φ↦φ+εΨ,φ↦φ+εΨ, where ΨΨ is in general a function that may depend on both xμ^μ and φφ. The condition for ΨΨ to generate a physical symmetry is that the action S𝒮 is left invariant. This will certainly be true if the Lagrangian density Lℒ is left invariant, but it will also be true if the Lagrangian changes by a divergence, L↦L+ε∂μΛμ,ℒ↦ℒ+ε∂_μΛ^μ, since the integral of a divergence becomes a boundary term according to the divergence theorem. A system described by a given action might have multiple independent symmetries of this type, indexed by r=1,2,…,N,=1,2,…,N, so the most general symmetry transformation would be written as φ↦φ+εrΨr,φ↦φ+ε_rΨ_r, with the consequence L↦L+εr∂μΛrμ.ℒ↦ℒ+ε_r∂_μΛ_r^μ. For such systems, Noether's theorem states that there are N conserved current densities jrν=Λrν−∂L∂φ,ν⋅Ψr_r^ν=Λ_r^ν-∂ℒ/∂φ_,ν·Ψ_r (where the dot product is understood to contract the field indices, not the νν index or r index). In such cases, the conservation law is expressed in a four-dimensional way ∂νjν=0,∂_νj^ν=0, which expresses the idea that the amount of a conserved quantity within a sphere cannot change unless some of it flows out of the sphere. For example, electric charge is conserved; the amount of charge within a sphere cannot change unless some of the charge leaves the sphere. For illustration, consider a physical system of fields that behaves the same under translations in time and space, as considered above; in other words, L(φ,∂μφ,xμ)(φ,∂_μφ,x^μ) is constant in its third argument. In that case, N = 4, one for each dimension of space and time. An infinitesimal translation in space, xμ↦xμ+εrδrμ^μ^μ+ε_rδ_r^μ (with δδ denoting the Kronecker delta), affects the fields as φ(xμ)↦φ(xμ−εrδrμ)φ(x^μ)↦φ(x^μ-ε_rδ_r^μ): that is, relabelling the coordinates is equivalent to leaving the coordinates in place while translating the field itself, which in turn is equivalent to transforming the field by replacing its value at each point xμ^μ with the value at the point xμ−εXμ^μ-^μ "behind" it which would be mapped onto xμ^μ by the infinitesimal displacement under consideration. Since this is infinitesimal, we may write this transformation as Ψr=−δrμ∂μφ.Ψ_r=-δ_r^μ∂_μφ. The Lagrangian density transforms in the same way, L(xμ)↦L(xμ−εrδrμ)ℒ(x^μ)↦ℒ(x^μ-ε_rδ_r^μ), so Λrμ=−δrμLΛ_r^μ=-δ_r^μℒ and thus Noether's theorem corresponds to the conservation law for the stress–energy tensor Tμν,[12] where we have used μμ in place of r. To wit, by using the expression given earlier, and collecting the four conserved currents (one for each μμ) into a tensor T, Noether's theorem gives Tμν=−δμνL+δμσ∂σφ∂L∂φ,ν=(∂L∂φ,ν)⋅φ,μ−δμνL_μ^ν=-δ_μ^νℒ+δ_μ^σ∂_σφ∂ℒ/∂φ_,ν=(∂ℒ/∂φ_,ν)·φ_,μ-δ_μ^νℒ with Tμν,ν=0_μ^ν_,ν=0 (we relabelled μμ as σσ at an intermediate step to avoid conflict). (However, the T obtained in this way may differ from the symmetric tensor used as the source term in general relativity; see Canonical stress–energy tensor.) The conservation of electric charge, by contrast, can be derived by considering Ψ linear in the fields φ rather than in the derivatives.[14] In quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude ψ(x) of finding a particle at a point x is a complex field φ, because it ascribes a complex number to every point in space and time. The probability amplitude itself is physically unmeasurable; only the probability p = |ψ|2 can be inferred from a set of measurements. Therefore, the system is invariant under transformations of the ψ field and its complex conjugate field ψ* that leave |ψ|2 unchanged, such as ψ→eiθψ,ψ∗→e−iθψ∗,ψ^iθψ psi^*^-iθψ^* , a complex rotation. In the limit when the phase θ becomes infinitesimally small, δθ, it may be taken as the parameter ε, while the Ψ are equal to iψ and −iψ*, respectively. A specific example is the Klein–Gordon equation, the relativistically correct version of the Schrödinger equation for spinless particles, which has the Lagrangian density L=∂νψ∂μψ∗ηνμ+m2ψψ∗.=∂_νψ∂_μψ^*η^νμ+m^2ψψ^*. In this case, Noether's theorem states that the conserved (∂ ⋅ j = 0) current equals jν=i(∂ψ∂xμψ∗−∂ψ∗∂xμψ)ηνμ,^ν=i(∂ψ/^μψ^*-∂ψ^*/^μψ)η^νμ , which, when multiplied by the charge on that species of particle, equals the electric current density due to that type of particle. This "gauge invariance" was first noted by Hermann Weyl, and is one of the prototype gauge symmetries of physics.
