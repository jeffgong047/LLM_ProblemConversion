Examples: I. Time invariance For illustration, consider a Lagrangian that does not depend on time, i.e., that is invariant (symmetric) under changes t → t + δt, without any change in the coordinates q. In this case, N = 1, T = 1 and Q = 0; the corresponding conserved quantity is the total energy H[10] H=∂L∂q˙⋅q˙−L.=/∂𝐪̇·𝐪̇-L. II. Translational invariance Consider a Lagrangian which does not depend on an ("ignorable", as above) coordinate qk; so it is invariant (symmetric) under changes qk → qk + δqk. In that case, N = 1, T = 0, and Qk = 1; the conserved quantity is the corresponding linear momentum pk[11] pk=∂L∂qk˙._k=/∂q̇_̇k̇. In special and general relativity, these two conservation laws can be expressed either globally (as it is done above), or locally as a continuity equation. The global versions can be united into a single global conservation law: the conservation of the energy-momentum 4-vector. The local versions of energy and momentum conservation (at any point in space-time) can also be united, into the conservation of a quantity defined locally at the space-time point: the stress–energy tensor[12] (this will be derived in the next section). III. Rotational invariance The conservation of the angular momentum L = r × p is analogous to its linear momentum counterpart.[13] It is assumed that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is rotational, i.e., that the Lagrangian does not depend on the absolute orientation of the physical system in space. For concreteness, assume that the Lagrangian does not change under small rotations of an angle δθ about an axis n; such a rotation transforms the Cartesian coordinates by the equation r→r+δθn×r.𝐫→𝐫+δθ 𝐧×𝐫. Since time is not being transformed, T = 0, and N = 1. Taking δθ as the ε parameter and the Cartesian coordinates r as the generalized coordinates q, the corresponding Q variables are given by Q=n×r.𝐐=𝐧×𝐫. Then Noether's theorem states that the following quantity is conserved, ∂L∂q˙⋅Q=p⋅(n×r)=n⋅(r×p)=n⋅L./∂𝐪̇·𝐐=𝐩·(𝐧×𝐫)=𝐧·(𝐫×𝐩)=𝐧·𝐋. In other words, the component of the angular momentum L along the n axis is conserved. And if n is arbitrary, i.e., if the system is insensitive to any rotation, then every component of L is conserved; in short, angular momentum is conserved. Field theory
