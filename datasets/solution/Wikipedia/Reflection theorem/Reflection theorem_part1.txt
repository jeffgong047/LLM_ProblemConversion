(February 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In algebraic number theory, a reflection theorem or Spiegelungssatz (German for reflection theorem – see Spiegel and Satz) is one of a collection of theorems linking the sizes of different ideal class groups (or ray class groups), or the sizes of different isotypic components of a class group. The original example is due to Ernst Eduard Kummer, who showed that the class number of the cyclotomic field Q(ζp)ℚ(ζ_p), with p a prime number, will be divisible by p if the class number of the maximal real subfield Q(ζp)+ℚ(ζ_p)^+ is. Another example is due to Scholz.[1] A simplified version of his theorem states that if 3 divides the class number of a real quadratic field Q(d)ℚ(√(d)), then 3 also divides the class number of the imaginary quadratic field Q(−3d)ℚ(√(-3d)).
