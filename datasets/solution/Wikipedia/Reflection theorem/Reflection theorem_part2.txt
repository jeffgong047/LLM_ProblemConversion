Spiegelungssatz: Both of the above results are generalized by Leopoldt's "Spiegelungssatz", which relates the p-ranks of different isotypic components of the class group of a number field considered as a module over the Galois group of a Galois extension. Let L/K be a finite Galois extension of number fields, with group G, degree prime to p and L containing the p-th roots of unity. Let A be the p-Sylow subgroup of the class group of L. Let φ run over the irreducible characters of the group ring Qp[G] and let Aφ denote the corresponding direct summands of A. For any φ let q = pφ(1) and let the G-rank eφ be the exponent in the index [Aϕ:Aϕp]=qeϕ.[A_ϕ:A_ϕ^p]=q^e_ϕ. Let ω be the character of G ζg=ζω(g)forζ∈μp.ζ^g=ζ^ω(g)forζ∈μ_p. The reflection (Spiegelung) φ* is defined by ϕ∗(g)=ω(g)ϕ(g−1).ϕ^*(g)=ω(g)ϕ(g^-1). Let E be the unit group of K. We say that ε is "primary" if K(ϵp)/K(√(ϵ))/K is unramified, and let E0 denote the group of primary units modulo Ep. Let δφ denote the G-rank of the φ component of E0. The Spiegelungssatz states that |eϕ∗−eϕ|≤δϕ.|e_ϕ^*-e_ϕ|≤δ_ϕ.
