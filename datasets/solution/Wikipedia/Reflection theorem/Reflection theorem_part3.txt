Extensions: Extensions of this Spiegelungssatz were given by Oriat and Oriat-Satge, where class groups were no longer associated with characters of the Galois group of K/k, but rather by ideals in a group ring over the Galois group of K/k. Leopoldt's Spiegelungssatz was generalized in a different direction by Kuroda, who extended it to a statement about ray class groups. This was further developed into the very general "T-S reflection theorem" of Georges Gras.[2] Kenkichi Iwasawa also provided an Iwasawa-theoretic reflection theorem.
