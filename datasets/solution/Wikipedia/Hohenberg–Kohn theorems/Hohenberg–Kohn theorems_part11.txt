Pseudo-potentials: The many-electron Schr√∂dinger equation can be very much simplified if electrons are divided in two groups: valence electrons and inner core electrons. The electrons in the inner shells are strongly bound and do not play a significant role in the chemical binding of atoms; they also partially screen the nucleus, thus forming with the nucleus an almost inert core. Binding properties are almost completely due to the valence electrons, especially in metals and semiconductors. This separation suggests that inner electrons can be ignored in a large number of cases, thereby reducing the atom to an ionic core that interacts with the valence electrons. The use of an effective interaction, a pseudopotential, that approximates the potential felt by the valence electrons, was first proposed by Fermi in 1934 and Hellmann in 1935. In spite of the simplification pseudo-potentials introduce in calculations, they remained forgotten until the late 1950s. Pseudopotential representing the effective core charge. The physical image of the system with the accurate wavefunction and potential is replaced by a pseudo-wavefunction and a pseudopotential up to a cutoff value. In the image on the right, core electrons and atomic core are considered as the effective core in DFT calculations Ab initio
