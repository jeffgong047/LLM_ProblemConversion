functionals): The major problem with DFT is that the exact functionals for exchange and correlation are not known, except for the free-electron gas. However, approximations exist which permit the calculation of certain physical quantities quite accurately.[19] One of the simplest approximations is the local-density approximation (LDA), where the functional depends only on the density at the coordinate where the functional is evaluated: EXCLDA[n]=∫εXC(n)n(r)d3r._XC^LDA[n]=∫ε_XC(n)n(𝐫) d^3𝐫. The local spin-density approximation (LSDA) is a straightforward generalization of the LDA to include electron spin: EXCLSDA[n↑,n↓]=∫εXC(n↑,n↓)n(r)d3r._XC^LSDA[n_↑,n_↓]=∫ε_XC(n_↑,n_↓)n(𝐫) d^3𝐫. In LDA, the exchange–correlation energy is typically separated into the exchange part and the correlation part: εXC = εX + εC. The exchange part is called the Dirac (or sometimes Slater) exchange, which takes the form εX ∝ n1/3. There are, however, many mathematical forms for the correlation part. Highly accurate formulae for the correlation energy density εC(n↑, n↓) have been constructed from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of jellium.[20] A simple first-principles correlation functional has been recently proposed as well.[21][22] Although unrelated to the Monte Carlo simulation, the two variants provide comparable accuracy.[23] The LDA assumes that the density is the same everywhere. Because of this, the LDA has a tendency to underestimate the exchange energy and over-estimate the correlation energy.[24] The errors due to the exchange and correlation parts tend to compensate each other to a certain degree. To correct for this tendency, it is common to expand in terms of the gradient of the density in order to account for the non-homogeneity of the true electron density. This allows corrections based on the changes in density away from the coordinate. These expansions are referred to as generalized gradient approximations (GGA)[25][26][27] and have the following form: EXCGGA[n↑,n↓]=∫εXC(n↑,n↓,∇n↑,∇n↓)n(r)d3r._XC^GGA[n_↑,n_↓]=∫ε_XC(n_↑,n_↓,_↑,_↓)n(𝐫) d^3𝐫. Using the latter (GGA), very good results for molecular geometries and ground-state energies have been achieved. Potentially more accurate than the GGA functionals are the meta-GGA functionals, a natural development after the GGA (generalized gradient approximation). Meta-GGA DFT functional in its original form includes the second derivative of the electron density (the Laplacian), whereas GGA includes only the density and its first derivative in the exchange–correlation potential. Functionals of this type are, for example, TPSS and the Minnesota Functionals. These functionals include a further term in the expansion, depending on the density, the gradient of the density and the Laplacian (second derivative) of the density. Difficulties in expressing the exchange part of the energy can be relieved by including a component of the exact exchange energy calculated from Hartree–Fock theory. Functionals of this type are known as hybrid functionals. Generalizations to include magnetic
