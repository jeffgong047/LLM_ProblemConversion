theorems: The Hohenberg–Kohn theorems relate to any system consisting of electrons moving under the influence of an external potential. Theorem 1. The external potential (and hence the total energy), is a unique functional of the electron density. If two systems of electrons, one trapped in a potential v1(r)_1(𝐫) and the other in v2(r)_2(𝐫), have the same ground-state density n(r)(𝐫), then v1(r)−v2(r)_1(𝐫)-v_2(𝐫) is necessarily a constant. Corollary 1: the ground-state density uniquely determines the potential and thus all properties of the system, including the many-body wavefunction. In particular, the HK functional, defined as F[n]=T[n]+U[n][n]=T[n]+U[n], is a universal functional of the density (not depending explicitly on the external potential). Corollary 2: In light of the fact that the sum of the occupied energies provides the energy content of the Hamiltonian, a unique functional of the ground state charge density, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is also a unique functional of the ground state charge density.[12] Theorem 2. The functional that delivers the ground-state energy of the system gives the lowest energy if and only if the input density is the true ground-state density. In other words, the energy content of the Hamiltonian reaches its absolute minimum, i.e., the ground state, when the charge density is that of the ground state. For any positive integer N and potential v(r)(𝐫), a density functional F[n][n] exists such that E(v,N)[n]=F[n]+∫v(r)n(r)d3r_(v,N)[n]=F[n]+(𝐫)n(𝐫) d^3𝐫 reaches its minimal value at the ground-state density of N electrons in the potential v(r)(𝐫). The minimal value of E(v,N)[n]_(v,N)[n] is then the ground-state energy of this system.
