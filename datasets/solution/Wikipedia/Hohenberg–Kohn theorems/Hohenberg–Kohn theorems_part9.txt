model: The predecessor to density functional theory was the Thomas–Fermi model, developed independently by both Llewellyn Thomas and Enrico Fermi in 1927. They used a statistical model to approximate the distribution of electrons in an atom. The mathematical basis postulated that electrons are distributed uniformly in phase space with two electrons in every h3^3 of volume.[38] For each element of coordinate space volume d3rd^3𝐫 we can fill out a sphere of momentum space up to the Fermi momentum pF_F[39] 43πpF3(r).43_F^3(𝐫). Equating the number of electrons in coordinate space to that in phase space gives n(r)=8π3h3pF3(r).(𝐫)=8π/3h^3p_F^3(𝐫). Solving for pF and substituting into the classical kinetic energy formula then leads directly to a kinetic energy represented as a functional of the electron density: tTF[n]=p22me∝(n1/3)22me∝n2/3(r),TTF[n]=CF∫n(r)n2/3(r)d3r=CF∫n5/3(r)d3r,t_TF[n] =p^2/2m_e∝(n^1/3)^2/2m_e^2/3(𝐫), T_TF[n] =C_F(𝐫)n^2/3(𝐫) d^3𝐫=C_F^5/3(𝐫) d^3𝐫, where CF=3h210me(38π)2/3._F=3h^2/10m_e(3/8π)^2/3. As such, they were able to calculate the energy of an atom using this kinetic-energy functional combined with the classical expressions for the nucleus–electron and electron–electron interactions (which can both also be represented in terms of the electron density). Although this was an important first step, the Thomas–Fermi equation's accuracy is limited because the resulting kinetic-energy functional is only approximate, and because the method does not attempt to represent the exchange energy of an atom as a conclusion of the Pauli principle. An exchange-energy functional was added by Paul Dirac in 1928. However, the Thomas–Fermi–Dirac theory remained rather inaccurate for most applications. The largest source of error was in the representation of the kinetic energy, followed by the errors in the exchange energy, and due to the complete neglect of electron correlation. Edward Teller (1962) showed that Thomas–Fermi theory cannot describe molecular bonding. This can be overcome by improving the kinetic-energy functional. The kinetic-energy functional can be improved by adding the von Weizsäcker (1935) correction:[40][41] TW[n]=ℏ28m∫|∇n(r)|2n(r)d3r._W[n]=ħ^2/8m∫|(𝐫)|^2/n(𝐫) d^3𝐫. Hohenberg–Kohn
