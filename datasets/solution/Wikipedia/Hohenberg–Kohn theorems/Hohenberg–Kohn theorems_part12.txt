pseudo-potentials: A crucial step toward more realistic pseudo-potentials was given by Topp and Hopfield,[42] who suggested that the pseudo-potential should be adjusted such that they describe the valence charge density accurately. Based on that idea, modern pseudo-potentials are obtained inverting the free-atom Schrödinger equation for a given reference electronic configuration and forcing the pseudo-wavefunctions to coincide with the true valence wavefunctions beyond a certain distance rl. The pseudo-wavefunctions are also forced to have the same norm (i.e., the so-called norm-conserving condition) as the true valence wavefunctions and can be written as RlPP(r)=RnlAE(r),∫0rl|RlPP(r)|2r2dr=∫0rl|RnlAE(r)|2r2dr,R_l^PP(r) =R_nl^AE(r), ∫_0^r_l|R_l^PP(r)|^2r^2 dr =∫_0^r_l|R_nl^AE(r)|^2r^2 dr, where Rl(r) is the radial part of the wavefunction with angular momentum l, and PP and AE denote the pseudo-wavefunction and the true (all-electron) wavefunction respectively. The index n in the true wavefunctions denotes the valence level. The distance rl beyond which the true and the pseudo-wavefunctions are equal is also dependent on l. Electron
