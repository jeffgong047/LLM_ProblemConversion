homomorphism: A 3-coloring of a graph G may be described by a graph homomorphism from G to a triangle K3. In the language of homomorphisms, Gr√∂tzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to K3. Naserasr showed that every triangle-free planar graph also has a homomorphism to the Clebsch graph, a 4-chromatic graph. By combining these two results, it may be shown that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to a triangle-free 3-colorable graph, the tensor product of K3 with the Clebsch graph. The coloring of the graph may then be recovered by composing this homomorphism with the homomorphism from this tensor product to its K3 factor. However, the Clebsch graph and its tensor product with K3 are both non-planar; there does not exist a triangle-free planar graph to which every other triangle-free planar graph may be mapped by a homomorphism.[9] Geometric
