graphs: A slightly more general result is true: if a planar graph has at most three triangles then it is 3-colorable.[1] However, the planar complete graph K4, and infinitely many other planar graphs containing K4, contain four triangles and are not 3-colorable. In 2009, Dvořák, Kráľ, and Thomas announced a proof of another generalization, conjectured in 1969 by L. Havel: there exists a constant d such that, if a planar graph has no two triangles within distance d of each other, then it can be colored with three colors.[6] This work formed part of the basis for Dvořák's 2015 European Prize in Combinatorics.[7] The theorem cannot be generalized to all nonplanar triangle-free graphs: not every nonplanar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable. In particular, the Grötzsch graph and the Chvátal graph are triangle-free graphs requiring four colors, and the Mycielskian is a transformation of graphs that can be used to construct triangle-free graphs that require arbitrarily high numbers of colors. The theorem cannot be generalized to all planar K4-free graphs, either: not every planar graph that requires 4 colors contains K4. In particular, there exists a planar graph without 4-cycles that cannot be 3-colored.[8] Factoring through a
