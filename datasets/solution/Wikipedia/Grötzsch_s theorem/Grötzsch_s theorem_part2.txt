History: The theorem is named after German mathematician Herbert Grötzsch, who published its proof in 1959. Grötzsch's original proof was complex. Berge (1960) attempted to simplify it but his proof was erroneous.[1] In 2003, Carsten Thomassen[2] derived an alternative proof from another related theorem: every planar graph with girth at least five is 3-list-colorable. However, Grötzsch's theorem itself does not extend from coloring to list coloring: there exist triangle-free planar graphs that are not 3-list-colorable.[3] In 2012, Nabiha Asghar[4] gave a new and much simpler proof of the theorem that is inspired by Thomassen's work. In 1989, Richard Steinberg and Dan Younger[5] gave the first correct proof, in English, of the dual[clarification needed] version of this theorem. Larger classes of
