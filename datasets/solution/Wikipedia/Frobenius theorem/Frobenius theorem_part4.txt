claim: The key to the argument is the following Claim. The set V of all elements a of D such that a2 ≤ 0 is a vector subspace of D of dimension n - 1. Moreover D = R ⊕ V as R-vector spaces, which implies that V generates D as an algebra. Proof of Claim: Let m be the dimension of D as an R-vector space, and pick a in D with characteristic polynomial p(x). By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write p(x)=(x−t1)⋯(x−tr)(x−z1)(x−z1¯)⋯(x−zs)(x−zs¯),ti∈R,zj∈C∖R.(x)=(x-t_1)⋯(x-t_r)(x-z_1)(x-z_1)⋯(x-z_s)(x-z_s),_i∈𝐑,_j∈𝐂\𝐑. We can rewrite p(x) in terms of the polynomials Q(z; x): p(x)=(x−t1)⋯(x−tr)Q(z1;x)⋯Q(zs;x).(x)=(x-t_1)⋯(x-t_r)Q(z_1;x)(z_s;x). Since zj ∈ C\R, the polynomials Q(zj; x) are all irreducible over R. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, p(a) = 0 and because D is a division algebra, it follows that either a − ti = 0 for some i or that Q(zj; a) = 0 for some j. The first case implies that a is real. In the second case, it follows that Q(zj; x) is the minimal polynomial of a. Because p(x) has the same complex roots as the minimal polynomial and because it is real it follows that p(x)=Q(zj;x)k=(x2−2Re⁡(zj)x+|zj|2)k(x)=Q(z_j;x)^k=(x^2-2Re(z_j)x+|z_j|^2)^k Since p(x) is the characteristic polynomial of a the coefficient of x2k−1 in p(x) is tr(a) up to a sign. Therefore, we read from the above equation we have: tr(a) = 0 if and only if Re(zj) = 0, in other words tr(a) = 0 if and only if a2 = −|zj|2 < 0. So V is the subset of all a with tr(a) = 0. In particular, it is a vector subspace. The rank–nullity theorem then implies that V has dimension n - 1 since it is the kernel of tr:D→Rtr:D→𝐑. Since R and V are disjoint (i.e. they satisfy R∩V=0𝐑={0}), and their dimensions sum to n, we have that D = R ⊕ V. The
