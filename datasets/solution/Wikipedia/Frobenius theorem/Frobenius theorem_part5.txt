finish: For a, b in V define B(a, b) = (−ab − ba)/2. Because of the identity (a + b)2 − a2 − b2 = ab + ba, it follows that B(a, b) is real. Furthermore, since a2 ≤ 0, we have: B(a, a) > 0 for a ≠ 0. Thus B is a positive definite symmetric bilinear form, in other words, an inner product on V. Let W be a subspace of V that generates D as an algebra and which is minimal with respect to this property. Let e1, ..., en be an orthonormal basis of W with respect to B. Then orthonormality implies that: ei2=−1,eiej=−ejei._i^2=-1,_ie_j=-e_je_i. If n = 0, then D is isomorphic to R. If n = 1, then D is generated by 1 and e1 subject to the relation e21 = −1. Hence it is isomorphic to C. If n = 2, it has been shown above that D is generated by 1, e1, e2 subject to the relations e12=e22=−1,e1e2=−e2e1,(e1e2)(e1e2)=−1._1^2=e_2^2=-1,_1e_2=-e_2e_1, (e_1e_2)(e_1e_2)=-1. These are precisely the relations for H. If n > 2, then D cannot be a division algebra. Assume that n > 2. Let u = e1e2en. It is easy to see that u2 = 1 (this only works if n > 2). If D were a division algebra, 0 = u2 − 1 = (u − 1)(u + 1) implies u = ±1, which in turn means: en = ∓e1e2 and so e1, ..., en−1 generate D. This contradicts the minimality of W. Remarks and related
