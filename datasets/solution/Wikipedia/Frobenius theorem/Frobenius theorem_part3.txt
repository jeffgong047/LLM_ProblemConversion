notation: Let D be the division algebra in question. Let n be the dimension of D. We identify the real multiples of 1 with R. When we write a ≤ 0 for an element a of D, we imply that a is contained in R. We can consider D as a finite-dimensional R-vector space. Any element d of D defines an endomorphism of D by left-multiplication, we identify d with that endomorphism. Therefore, we can speak about the trace of d, and its characteristic and minimal polynomials. For any z in C define the following real quadratic polynomial: Q(z;x)=x2−2Re⁡(z)x+|z|2=(x−z)(x−z¯)∈R[x].(z;x)=x^2-2Re(z)x+|z|^2=(x-z)(x-z)∈𝐑[x]. Note that if z ∈ C ∖ R then Q(z; x) is irreducible over R. The
