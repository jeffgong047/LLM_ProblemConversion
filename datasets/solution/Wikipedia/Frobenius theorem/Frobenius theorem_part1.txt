Theorem in abstract algebra For other theorems named after Frobenius, see Frobenius theorem. In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, the Frobenius theorem, proved by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1877, characterizes the finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers. According to the theorem, every such algebra is isomorphic to one of the following: R (the real numbers) C (the complex numbers) H (the quaternions). These algebras have real dimension 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Of these three algebras, R and C are commutative, but H is not.
