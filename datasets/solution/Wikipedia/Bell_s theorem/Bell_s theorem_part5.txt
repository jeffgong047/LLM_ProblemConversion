(1990): Main article: GHZ experiment Daniel Greenberger, Michael A. Horne, and Anton Zeilinger presented a four-particle thought experiment in 1990, which David Mermin then simplified to use only three particles.[17][18] In this thought experiment, Victor generates a set of three spin-1/2 particles described by the quantum state |ψ⟩=12(|000⟩−|111⟩),|ψ⟩=1/√(2)(|000⟩-|111⟩) , where as above, |0⟩|0⟩ and |1⟩|1⟩ are the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrix σzσ_z. Victor then sends a particle each to Alice, Bob, and Charlie, who wait at widely separated locations. Alice measures either σxσ_x or σyσ_y on her particle, and so do Bob and Charlie. The result of each measurement is either +1+1 or −1-1. Applying the Born rule to the three-qubit state |ψ⟩|ψ⟩, Victor predicts that whenever the three measurements include one σxσ_x and two σyσ_y's, the product of the outcomes will always be +1+1. This follows because |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ is an eigenvector of σx⊗σy⊗σyσ_x⊗σ_y⊗σ_y with eigenvalue +1+1, and likewise for σy⊗σx⊗σyσ_y⊗σ_x⊗σ_y and σy⊗σy⊗σxσ_y⊗σ_y⊗σ_x. Therefore, knowing Alice's result for a σxσ_x measurement and Bob's result for a σyσ_y measurement, Victor can predict with probability 1 what result Charlie will return for a σyσ_y measurement. According to the EPR criterion of reality, there would be an "element of reality" corresponding to the outcome of a σyσ_y measurement upon Charlie's qubit. Indeed, this same logic applies to both measurements and all three qubits. Per the EPR criterion of reality, then, each particle contains an "instruction set" that determines the outcome of a σxσ_x or σyσ_y measurement upon it. The set of all three particles would then be described by the instruction set (ax,ay,bx,by,cx,cy),(a_x,a_y,b_x,b_y,c_x,c_y) , with each entry being either −1-1 or +1+1, and each σxσ_x or σyσ_y measurement simply returning the appropriate value. If Alice, Bob, and Charlie all perform the σxσ_x measurement, then the product of their results would be axbxcx_xb_xc_x. This value can be deduced from (axbycy)(aybxcy)(aybycx)=axbxcxay2by2cy2=axbxcx,(a_xb_yc_y)(a_yb_xc_y)(a_yb_yc_x)=a_xb_xc_xa_y^2b_y^2c_y^2=a_xb_xc_x , because the square of either −1-1 or +1+1 is 11. Each factor in parentheses equals +1+1, so axbxcx=+1,_xb_xc_x=+1 , and the product of Alice, Bob, and Charlie's results will be +1+1 with probability unity. But this is inconsistent with quantum physics: Victor can predict using the state |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ that the measurement σx⊗σx⊗σxσ_x⊗σ_x⊗σ_x will instead yield −1-1 with probability unity. This thought experiment can also be recast as a traditional Bell inequality or, equivalently, as a nonlocal game in the same spirit as the CHSH game.[19] In it, Alice, Bob, and Charlie receive bits x,y,z,y,z from Victor, promised to always have an even number of ones, that is, x⊕y⊕z=0=0, and send him back bits a,b,c,b,c. They win the game if a,b,c,b,c have an odd number of ones for all inputs except x=y=z=0=y=z=0, when they need to have an even number of ones. That is, they win the game iff a⊕b⊕c=x∨y∨z=x. With local hidden variables the highest probability of victory they can have is 3/4, whereas using the quantum strategy above they win it with certainty. This is an example of quantum pseudo-telepathy. Kochen–Specker theorem
