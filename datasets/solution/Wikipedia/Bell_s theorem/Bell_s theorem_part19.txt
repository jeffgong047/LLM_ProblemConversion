Notes: ^ We are for convenience assuming that the response of the detector to the underlying property is deterministic. This assumption can be replaced; it is equivalent to postulating a joint probability distribution over all the observables of the experiment.[11][12] ^ In more detail, as developed by Paul Dirac,[20] David Hilbert,[21] John von Neumann,[22] and Hermann Weyl,[23] the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ belonging to a (separable) Hilbert space Hℋ. Physical quantities of interest — position, momentum, energy, spin — are represented by "observables", which are self-adjoint linear operators acting on the Hilbert space. When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue ηη is non-degenerate and the probability is given by |⟨η|ψ⟩|2|⟨η|ψ⟩|^2, where |η⟩|η⟩ is its associated eigenvector. More generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by ⟨ψ|Pηψ⟩⟨ψ|P_ηψ⟩, where Pη_η is the projector onto its associated eigenspace. For the purposes of this discussion, we can take the eigenvalues to be non-degenerate. ^ See Reichenbach[37] and Jammer,[38]: 276 Mermin and Schack,[39] and for Einstein's remarks, Clauser and Shimony[40] and Wick.[41]: 286 ^ A hidden-variable theory that is deterministic implies that the probability of a given outcome is always either 0 or 1. For example, a Stern–Gerlach measurement on a spin-1 atom will report that the atom's angular momentum along the chosen axis is one of three possible values, which can be designated −-, 00 and ++. In a deterministic hidden-variable theory, there exists an underlying physical property that fixes the result found in the measurement. Conditional on the value of the underlying physical property, any given outcome (for example, a result of ++) must be either impossible or guaranteed. But Gleason's theorem implies that there can be no such deterministic probability measure, because it proves that any probability measure must take the form of a mapping u→⟨ρu,u⟩→⟨,u⟩ for some density operator ρρ. This mapping is continuous on the unit sphere of the Hilbert space, and since this unit sphere is connected, no continuous probability measure on it can be deterministic.[50]: §1.3 ^ This was reported by Max Jammer.[38]: 308 Lee is best known for his prediction with Chen-Ning Yang of the violation of parity conservation, a prediction that earned them the Nobel Prize after it was confirmed by Chien-Shiung Wu, who did not share in the Prize. ^ E. T. Jaynes was one exception,[84] but Jaynes' arguments have not generally been found persuasive.[85]
