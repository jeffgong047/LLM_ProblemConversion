Theorem: There are many variations on the basic idea, some employing stronger mathematical assumptions than others.[9] Significantly, Bell-type theorems do not refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables, but instead show that quantum physics violates general assumptions behind classical pictures of nature. The original theorem proved by Bell in 1964 is not the most amenable to experiment, and it is convenient to introduce the genre of Bell-type inequalities with a later example.[10] Hypothetical characters Alice and Bob stand in widely separated locations. Their colleague Victor prepares a pair of particles and sends one to Alice and the other to Bob. When Alice receives her particle, she chooses to perform one of two possible measurements (perhaps by flipping a coin to decide which). Denote these measurements by A0_0 and A1_1. Both A0_0 and A1_1 are binary measurements: the result of A0_0 is either +1+1 or −1-1, and likewise for A1_1. When Bob receives his particle, he chooses one of two measurements, B0_0 and B1_1, which are also both binary. Suppose that each measurement reveals a property that the particle already possessed. For instance, if Alice chooses to measure A0_0 and obtains the result +1+1, then the particle she received carried a value of +1+1 for a property a0_0.[note 1] Consider the following combination: a0b0+a0b1+a1b0−a1b1=(a0+a1)b0+(a0−a1)b1._0b_0+a_0b_1+a_1b_0-a_1b_1=(a_0+a_1)b_0+(a_0-a_1)b_1 . Because both a0_0 and a1_1 take the values ±1±1, then either a0=a1_0=a_1 or a0=−a1_0=-a_1. In the former case, (a0−a1)b1=0(a_0-a_1)b_1=0, while in the latter case, (a0+a1)b0=0(a_0+a_1)b_0=0. So, one of the terms on the right-hand side of the above expression will vanish, and the other will equal ±2±2. Consequently, if the experiment is repeated over many trials, with Victor preparing new pairs of particles, the average value of the combination a0b0+a0b1+a1b0−a1b1_0b_0+a_0b_1+a_1b_0-a_1b_1 across all the trials will be less than or equal to 2. No single trial can measure this quantity, because Alice and Bob can only choose one measurement each, but on the assumption that the underlying properties exist, the average value of the sum is just the sum of the averages for each term. Using angle brackets to denote averages, ⟨A0B0⟩+⟨A0B1⟩+⟨A1B0⟩−⟨A1B1⟩≤2._0B_0⟩+_0B_1⟩+_1B_0⟩-_1B_1⟩≤2 . This is a Bell inequality, specifically, the CHSH inequality.[10]: 115 Its derivation here depends upon two assumptions: first, that the underlying physical properties a0,a1,b0,_0,a_1,b_0, and b1_1 exist independently of being observed or measured (sometimes called the assumption of realism); and second, that Alice's choice of action cannot influence Bob's result or vice versa (often called the assumption of locality).[10]: 117 Quantum mechanics can violate the CHSH inequality, as follows. Victor prepares a pair of qubits which he describes by the Bell state |ψ⟩=|0⟩⊗|1⟩−|1⟩⊗|0⟩2,|ψ⟩=|0⟩⊗|1⟩-|1⟩⊗|0⟩/√(2), where |0⟩|0⟩ and |1⟩|1⟩ are the eigenstates of one of the Pauli matrices, σz=(100−1).σ_z=[ 1 0; 0 -1 ]. Victor then passes the first qubit to Alice and the second to Bob. Alice and Bob's choices of possible measurements are also defined in terms of the Pauli matrices. Alice measures either of the two observables σzσ_z and σxσ_x: A0=σz,A1=σx=(0110);_0=σ_z,_1=σ_x=[ 0 1; 1 0 ]; and Bob measures either of the two observables B0=−σx+σz2,B1=σx−σz2._0=-σ_x+σ_z/√(2),_1=σ_x-σ_z/√(2). Victor can calculate the quantum expectation values for pairs of these observables using the Born rule: ⟨A0⊗B0⟩=12,⟨A0⊗B1⟩=12,⟨A1⊗B0⟩=12,⟨A1⊗B1⟩=−12._0_0⟩=1/√(2),_0_1⟩=1/√(2),_1_0⟩=1/√(2),_1_1⟩=-1/√(2) . While only one of these four measurements can be made in a single trial of the experiment, the sum ⟨A0⊗B0⟩+⟨A0⊗B1⟩+⟨A1⊗B0⟩−⟨A1⊗B1⟩=22_0_0⟩+_0_1⟩+_1_0⟩-_1_1⟩=2√(2) gives the sum of the average values that Victor expects to find across multiple trials. This value exceeds the classical upper bound of 2 that was deduced from the hypothesis of local hidden variables.[10]: 116 The value 222√(2) is in fact the largest that quantum physics permits for this combination of expectation values, making it a Tsirelson bound.[13]: 140 An illustration of the CHSH game: the referee, Victor, sends a bit each to Alice and to Bob, and Alice and Bob each send a bit back to the referee. The CHSH inequality can also be thought of as a game in which Alice and Bob try to coordinate their actions.[14][15] Victor prepares two bits, x and y, independently and at random. He sends bit x to Alice and bit y to Bob. Alice and Bob win if they return answer bits a and b to Victor, satisfying xy=a+bmod2.=a+b2 . Or, equivalently, Alice and Bob win if the logical AND of x and y is the logical XOR of a and b. Alice and Bob can agree upon any strategy they desire before the game, but they cannot communicate once the game begins. In any theory based on local hidden variables, Alice and Bob's probability of winning is no greater than 3/43/4, regardless of what strategy they agree upon beforehand. However, if they share an entangled quantum state, their probability of winning can be as large as 2+24≈0.85.2+√(2)/4≈0.85 . Variations and related
