(1964): Bell's 1964 paper points out that under restricted conditions, local hidden variable models can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics. He then demonstrates that this cannot hold true in general.[3] Bell considers a refinement by David Bohm of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) thought experiment. In this scenario, a pair of particles are formed together in such a way that they are described by a spin singlet state (which is an example of an entangled state). The particles then move apart in opposite directions. Each particle is measured by a Stern–Gerlach device, a measuring instrument that can be oriented in different directions and that reports one of two possible outcomes, representable by +1+1 and −1-1. The configuration of each measuring instrument is represented by a unit vector, and the quantum-mechanical prediction for the correlation between two detectors with settings a→a⃗ and b→b⃗ is P(a→,b→)=−a→⋅b→.(a⃗,b⃗)=-a⃗·b⃗ . In particular, if the orientation of the two detectors is the same (a→=b→a⃗=b⃗), then the outcome of one measurement is certain to be the negative of the outcome of the other, giving P(a→,a→)=−1(a⃗,a⃗)=-1. And if the orientations of the two detectors are orthogonal (a→⋅b→=0a⃗·b⃗=0), then the outcomes are uncorrelated, and P(a→,b→)=0(a⃗,b⃗)=0. Bell proves by example that these special cases can be explained in terms of hidden variables, then proceeds to show that the full range of possibilities involving intermediate angles cannot. Bell posited that a local hidden variable model for these correlations would explain them in terms of an integral over the possible values of some hidden parameter λλ: P(a→,b→)=∫dλρ(λ)A(a→,λ)B(b→,λ),(a⃗,b⃗)=λ ρ(λ)A(a⃗,λ)B(b⃗,λ) , where ρ(λ)ρ(λ) is a probability density function. The two functions A(a→,λ)(a⃗,λ) and B(b→,λ)(b⃗,λ) provide the responses of the two detectors given the orientation vectors and the hidden variable: A(a→,λ)=±1,B(b→,λ)=±1.(a⃗,λ)=±1, B(b⃗,λ)=±1 . Crucially, the outcome of detector A does not depend upon b→b⃗, and likewise the outcome of B does not depend upon a→a⃗, because the two detectors are physically separated. Now we suppose that the experimenter has a choice of settings for the second detector: it can be set either to b→b⃗ or to c→c⃗. Bell proves that the difference in correlation between these two choices of detector setting must satisfy the inequality |P(a→,b→)−P(a→,c→)|≤1+P(b→,c→).|P(a⃗,b⃗)-P(a⃗,c⃗)|≤1+P(b⃗,c⃗) . However, it is easy to find situations where quantum mechanics violates the Bell inequality.[16]: 425–426 For example, let the vectors a→a⃗ and b→b⃗ be orthogonal, and let c→c⃗ lie in their plane at a 45° angle from both of them. Then P(a→,b→)=0,(a⃗,b⃗)=0 , while P(a→,c→)=P(b→,c→)=−22,(a⃗,c⃗)=P(b⃗,c⃗)=-√(2)/2 , but 22≰1−22.√(2)/2≰1-√(2)/2 . Therefore, there is no local hidden variable model that can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics for all choices of a→a⃗, b→b⃗, and c→.c⃗. Experimental results contradict the classical curves and match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics as long as experimental shortcomings are accounted for.[9] Bell's 1964 theorem requires the possibility of perfect anti-correlations: the ability to make a probability-1 prediction about the result from the second detector, knowing the result from the first. This is related to the "EPR criterion of reality", a concept introduced in the 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. This paper posits, "If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity."[2] GHZ–Mermin
