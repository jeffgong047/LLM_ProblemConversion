theorem: Richardson's theorem can be stated as follows:[2] Let E be a set of expressions that represent R→Rℝ→ℝ functions. Suppose that E includes these expressions: x (representing the identity function) ex (representing the exponential functions) sin x (representing the sin function) all rational numbers, ln 2, and π (representing constant functions that ignore their input and produce the given number as output) Suppose E is also closed under a few standard operations. Specifically, suppose that if A and B are in E, then all of the following are also in E: A + B (representing the pointwise addition of the functions that A and B represent) A − B (representing pointwise subtraction) AB (representing pointwise multiplication) A∘B (representing the composition of the functions represented by A and B) Then the following decision problems are unsolvable: Deciding whether an expression A in E represents a function that is nonnegative everywhere If E includes also the expression |x| (representing the absolute value function), deciding whether an expression A in E represents a function that is zero everywhere If E includes an expression B representing a function whose antiderivative has no representative in E, deciding whether an expression A in E represents a function whose antiderivative can be represented in E. (Example: eax2^ax^2 has an antiderivative in the elementary functions if and only if a = 0.)
