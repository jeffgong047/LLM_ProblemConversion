conditions: The standard proof of the second incompleteness theorem assumes that the provability predicate ProvA(P) satisfies the Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions. Letting #(P) represent the Gödel number of a formula P, the provability conditions say: If F proves P, then F proves ProvA(#(P)). F proves 1.; that is, F proves ProvA(#(P)) → ProvA(#(ProvA(#(P)))). F proves ProvA(#(P → Q)) ∧ ProvA(#(P)) → ProvA(#(Q)) (analogue of modus ponens). There are systems, such as Robinson arithmetic, which are strong enough to meet the assumptions of the first incompleteness theorem, but which do not prove the Hilbert–Bernays conditions. Peano arithmetic, however, is strong enough to verify these conditions, as are all theories stronger than Peano arithmetic. Implications for consistency
