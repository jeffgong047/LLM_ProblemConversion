Zermelo: In September 1931, Ernst Zermelo wrote to Gödel to announce what he described as an "essential gap" in Gödel's argument (Dawson 1996, p. 76). In October, Gödel replied with a 10-page letter (Dawson 1996, p. 76, Grattan-Guinness 2005, pp. 512–513), where he pointed out that Zermelo mistakenly assumed that the notion of truth in a system is definable in that system (which is not true in general by Tarski's undefinability theorem). But Zermelo did not relent and published his criticisms in print with "a rather scathing paragraph on his young competitor" (Grattan-Guinness 2005, pp. 513). Gödel decided that to pursue the matter further was pointless, and Carnap agreed (Dawson 1996, p. 77). Much of Zermelo's subsequent work was related to logics stronger than first-order logic, with which he hoped to show both the consistency and categoricity of mathematical theories.
