approximation: Under some mild conditions the queue-length process[clarification needed] Q(t)(t) of an open generalized Jackson network can be approximated by a reflected Brownian motion defined as RBMQ(0)⁡(θ,Γ;R).RBM_Q(0)(θ,Γ;R)., where θθ is the drift of the process, ΓΓ is the covariance matrix, and R is the reflection matrix. This is a two-order approximation obtained by relation between general Jackson network with homogeneous fluid network and reflected Brownian motion. The parameters of the reflected Brownian process is specified as follows: θ=α−(I−PT)μθ=α-(I-P^T)μ Γ=(Γkℓ)withΓkℓ=∑j=1J(λj∧μj)[pjk(δkℓ−pjℓ)+cj2(pjk−δjk)(pjℓ−δjℓ)]+αkc0,k2δkℓΓ=(Γ_kℓ)withΓ_kℓ=∑_j=1^J(λ_j∧μ_j)[p_jk(δ_kℓ-p_jℓ)+c_j^2(p_jk-δ_jk)(p_jℓ-δ_jℓ)]+α_kc_0,k^2δ_kℓ R=I−PT=I-P^T where the symbols are defined as: Definitions of symbols in the approximation formula symbol Meaning α=(αj)j=1Jα=(α_j)_j=1^J a J-vector specifying the arrival rates to each node. μ=(μ)j=1Jμ=(μ)_j=1^J a J-vector specifying the service rates of each node. P routing matrix. λjλ_j effective arrival of jth^th node. cj_j variation of service time at jth^th node. c0,j_0,j variation of inter-arrival time at jth^th node. δijδ_ij coefficients to specify correlation between nodes. They are defined in this way: Let A(t)(t) be the arrival process of the system, then A(t)−αt≈A^(t)(t)-≈Â(t) in distribution, where A^(t)Â(t) is a driftless Brownian process with covariate matrix Γ0=(Γij0)Γ^0=(Γ_ij^0), with Γij0=αic0,i2δijΓ_ij^0=α_ic_0,i^2δ_ij, for any i,j∈1,…,J,j∈{1,…,J} See
