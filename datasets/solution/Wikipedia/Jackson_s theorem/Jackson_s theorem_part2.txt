network: A network of m interconnected queues is known as a Jackson network[11] or Jacksonian network[12] if it meets the following conditions: if the network is open, any external arrivals to node i form a Poisson process, All service times are exponentially distributed and the service discipline at all queues is first-come, first-served, a customer completing service at queue i will either move to some new queue j with probability Pij_ij or leave the system with probability 1−∑j=1mPij1-∑_j=1^mP_ij, which, for an open network, is non-zero for some subset of the queues, the utilization of all of the queues is less than one.
