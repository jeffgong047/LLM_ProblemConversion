Definition: In an open network, jobs arrive from outside following a Poisson process with rate α>0α>0. Each arrival is independently routed to node j with probability p0j≥0_0j≥0 and ∑j=1Jp0j=1∑_j=1^Jp_0j=1. Upon service completion at node i, a job may go to another node j with probability pij_ij or leave the network with probability pi0=1−∑j=1Jpij_i0=1-∑_j=1^Jp_ij. Hence we have the overall arrival rate to node i, λiλ_i, including both external arrivals and internal transitions: λi=αp0i+∑j=1Jλjpji,i=1,…,J.(1)λ_i=_0i+∑_j=1^Jλ_jp_ji,i=1,…,J. (1) (Since the utilisation at each node is less than 1, and we are looking at the equilibrium distribution i.e. the long-run-average behaviour, the rate of jobs transitioning from j to i is bounded by a fraction of the arrival rate at j and we ignore the service rate μjμ_j in the above.) Define a=(αp0i)i=1J=(_0i)_i=1^J, then we can solve λ=(I−PT)−1aλ=(I-P^T)^-1a. All jobs leave each node also following Poisson process, and define μi(xi)μ_i(x_i) as the service rate of node i when there are xi_i jobs at node i. Let Xi(t)_i(t) denote the number of jobs at node i at time t, and X=(Xi)i=1J𝐗=(X_i)_i=1^J. Then the equilibrium distribution of X𝐗, π(x)=P(X=x)π(𝐱)=P(𝐗=𝐱) is determined by the following system of balance equations: π(x)∑i=1J[αp0i+μi(xi)(1−pii)]=∑i=1J[π(x−ei)αp0i+π(x+ei)μi(xi+1)pi0]+∑i=1J∑j≠iπ(x+ei−ej)μi(xi+1)pij.(2) π(𝐱)∑_i=1^J[_0i+μ_i(x_i)(1-p_ii)] = ∑_i=1^J[π(𝐱-𝐞_i)_0i+π(𝐱+𝐞_i)μ_i(x_i+1)p_i0]+∑_i=1^J∑_jπ(𝐱+𝐞_i-𝐞_j)μ_i(x_i+1)p_ij.
