spaces: A metric space (X,d)(X,d) is said to have the Heine–Borel property if each closed bounded[3] set in X is compact. Many metric spaces fail to have the Heine–Borel property, such as the metric space of rational numbers (or indeed any incomplete metric space). Complete metric spaces may also fail to have the property; for instance, no infinite-dimensional Banach spaces have the Heine–Borel property (as metric spaces). Even more trivially, if the real line is not endowed with the usual metric, it may fail to have the Heine–Borel property. A metric space (X,d)(X,d) has a Heine–Borel metric which is Cauchy locally identical to d if and only if it is complete, σσ-compact, and locally compact.[4] In the theory of topological vector
