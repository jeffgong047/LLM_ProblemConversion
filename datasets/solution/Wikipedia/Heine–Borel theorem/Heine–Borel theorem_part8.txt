For instance, the space C∞[0,1]𝒞^∞[0,1] of smooth functions on the interval [0,1][0,1] with the metric d(x,y)=∑k=0∞12k⋅maxt∈[0,1]|x(k)(t)−y(k)(t)|1+maxt∈[0,1]|x(k)(t)−y(k)(t)|(x,y)=∑_k=0^∞1/2^k·max_t∈[0,1]|x^(k)(t)-y^(k)(t)|/1+max_t∈[0,1]|x^(k)(t)-y^(k)(t)| (here x(k)^(k) is the k-th derivative of the function x∈C∞[0,1]∈𝒞^∞[0,1]) has the Heine–Borel property as a topological vector space but not as a metric space.
