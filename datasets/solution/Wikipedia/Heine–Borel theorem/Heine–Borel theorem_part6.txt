spaces: A topological vector space X is said to have the Heine–Borel property[5] (R.E. Edwards uses the term boundedly compact space[6]) if each closed bounded[7] set in X is compact.[8] No infinite-dimensional Banach spaces have the Heine–Borel property (as topological vector spaces). But some infinite-dimensional Fréchet spaces do have, for instance, the space C∞(Ω)^∞(Ω) of smooth functions on an open set Ω⊂RnΩ⊂ℝ^n[6] and the space H(Ω)(Ω) of holomorphic functions on an open set Ω⊂CnΩ⊂ℂ^n.[6] More generally, any quasi-complete nuclear space has the Heine–Borel property. All Montel spaces have the Heine–Borel property as well. See
