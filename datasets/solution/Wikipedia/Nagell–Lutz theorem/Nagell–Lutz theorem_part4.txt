Generalizations: The Nagellâ€“Lutz theorem generalizes to arbitrary number fields and more general cubic equations.[1] For curves over the rationals, the generalization says that, for a nonsingular cubic curve whose Weierstrass form y2+a1xy+a3y=x3+a2x2+a4x+a6^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6 has integer coefficients, any rational point P=(x,y) of finite order must have integer coordinates, or else have order 2 and coordinates of the form x=m/4, y=n/8, for m and n integers.
