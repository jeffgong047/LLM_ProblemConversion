proof: Poisson shows that the Fourier series in Eq.1 produces the periodic summation of X(f)(f), regardless of fs_s and B. Shannon, however, only derives the series coefficients for the case fs=2B_s=2B. Virtually quoting Shannon's original paper: Let X(ω)(ω) be the spectrum of x(t)(t). Then x(t)=12π∫−∞∞X(ω)eiωtdω=12π∫−2πB2πBX(ω)eiωtdω,(t)=12π∫_-∞^∞X(ω)e^i dω=12π∫_-2^2X(ω)e^i dω, because X(ω)(ω) is assumed to be zero outside the band |ω2π|<B|ω2π|<B. If we let t=n2B=n2B, where n is any positive or negative integer, we obtain: x(n2B)=12π∫−2πB2πBX(ω)eiωn2Bdω.(Eq.2)(n2B)=12π∫_-2^2X(ω)e^iωn2B dω.(Eq.2) On the left are values of x(t)(t) at the sampling points. The integral on the right will be recognized as essentially[a] the nth coefficient in a Fourier-series expansion of the function X(ω)(ω), taking the interval −B-B to B as a fundamental period. This means that the values of the samples x(n/2B)(n/2B) determine the Fourier coefficients in the series expansion of X(ω)(ω). Thus they determine X(ω)(ω), since X(ω)(ω) is zero for frequencies greater than B, and for lower frequencies X(ω)(ω) is determined if its Fourier coefficients are determined. But X(ω)(ω) determines the original function x(t)(t) completely, since a function is determined if its spectrum is known. Therefore the original samples determine the function x(t)(t) completely. Shannon's proof of the theorem is complete at that point, but he goes on to discuss reconstruction via sinc functions, what we now call the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula as discussed above. He does not derive or prove the properties of the sinc function, as the Fourier pair relationship between the rect (the rectangular function) and sinc functions was well known by that time.[4] Let xn_n be the nth sample. Then the function x(t)(t) is represented by: x(t)=∑n=−∞∞xnsin⁡(π(2Bt−n))π(2Bt−n).(t)=∑_n=-∞^∞x_nsin(π(2Bt-n))π(2Bt-n). As in the other proof, the existence of the Fourier transform of the original signal is assumed, so the proof does not say whether the sampling theorem extends to bandlimited stationary random processes.
