Aliasing: Main article: Aliasing The samples of two sine waves can be identical when at least one of them is at a frequency above half the sample rate. When x(t)(t) is a function with a Fourier transform X(f)(f): X(f)≜∫−∞∞x(t)e−i2πftdt,(f) triangleq int_-∞^∞x(t)^-i2{dt, the Poisson summation formula indicates that the samples, x(nT)(nT), of x(t)(t) are sufficient to create a periodic summation of X(f)(f). The result is: Xs(f)≜∑k=−∞∞X(f−kfs)=∑n=−∞∞T⋅x(nT)e−i2πnTf_s(f) triangleq∑_k=-∞^∞X(f-kf_s)=∑_n=-∞^∞T(nT)^-i2 (Eq.1) X(f)(f) (top blue) and XA(f)_A(f) (bottom blue) are continuous Fourier transforms of two different functions, x(t)(t) and xA(t)_A(t) (not shown). When the functions are sampled at rate fs_s, the images (green) are added to the original transforms (blue) when one examines the discrete-time Fourier transforms (DTFT) of the sequences. In this hypothetical example, the DTFTs are identical, which means the sampled sequences are identical, even though the original continuous pre-sampled functions are not. If these were audio signals, x(t)(t) and xA(t)_A(t) might not sound the same. But their samples (taken at rate fs_s) are identical and would lead to identical reproduced sounds; thus xA(t)_A(t) is an alias of x(t)(t) at this sample rate. which is a periodic function and its equivalent representation as a Fourier series, whose coefficients are T⋅x(nT)(nT). This function is also known as the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the sample sequence. As depicted, copies of X(f)(f) are shifted by multiples of the sampling rate fs_s and combined by addition. For a band-limited function (X(f)=0,forall|f|≥B)(X(f)=0,forall|f|) and sufficiently large fs,_s, it is possible for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the Nyquist criterion is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous X(f).(f). Any frequency component above fs/2_s/2 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an alias, associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), x(t)(t) is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a lowpass filter, and in this application it is called an anti-aliasing filter. Spectrum, Xs(f)_s(f), of a properly sampled bandlimited signal (blue) and the adjacent DTFT images (green) that do not overlap. A brick-wall low-pass filter, H(f)(f), removes the images, leaves the original spectrum, X(f)(f), and recovers the original signal from its samples. The figure on the left shows a function (in gray/black) being sampled and reconstructed (in gold) at steadily increasing sample-densities, while the figure on the right shows the frequency spectrum of the gray/black function, which does not change. The highest frequency in the spectrum is half the width of the entire spectrum. The width of the steadily-increasing pink shading is equal to the sample-rate. When it encompasses the entire frequency spectrum it is twice as large as the highest frequency, and that is when the reconstructed waveform matches the sampled one.
