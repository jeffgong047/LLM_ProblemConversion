summation: When there is no overlap of the copies (also known as "images") of X(f)(f), the k=0=0 term of Eq.1 can be recovered by the product: X(f)=H(f)⋅Xs(f),(f)=H(f)_s(f), where: H(f)≜1|f|<B0|f|>fs−B.(f) triangleq{1 |f|<B 0 |f|>f_s-B. The sampling theorem is proved since X(f)(f) uniquely determines x(t)(t). All that remains is to derive the formula for reconstruction. H(f)(f) need not be precisely defined in the region [B,fs−B][B,_s-B] because Xs(f)_s(f) is zero in that region. However, the worst case is when B=fs/2,=f_s/2, the Nyquist frequency. A function that is sufficient for that and all less severe cases is: H(f)=rect(ffs)=1|f|<fs20|f|>fs2,(f)=rect(f/f_s)=1 |f|<f_s/2 0 |f|>f_s/2, where rectrect is the rectangular function. Therefore:[A] X(f)=rect(ffs)⋅Xs(f)=rect(Tf)⋅∑n=−∞∞T⋅x(nT)e−i2πnTf(fromEq.1,above)=∑n=−∞∞x(nT)⋅T⋅rect(Tf)⋅e−i2πnTf⏟Fsinc(t−nTT).X(f) =rect(f/f_s)_s(f) =rect(Tf)·∑_n=-∞^∞T(nT)^-i2 (fromEq.1,above) =∑_n=-∞^∞x(nT)·T·rect(Tf)^-i2_ℱ{sinc(t-nT/T)}. The inverse transform of both sides produces the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula: x(t)=∑n=−∞∞x(nT)⋅sinc(t−nTT),(t)=∑_n=-∞^∞x(nT)·sinc(t-nT/T), which shows how the samples, x(nT)(nT), can be combined to reconstruct x(t)(t). Larger-than-necessary values of fs_s (smaller values of T), called oversampling, have no effect on the outcome of the reconstruction and have the benefit of leaving room for a transition band in which H(f)(f) is free to take intermediate values. Undersampling, which causes aliasing, is not in general a reversible operation. Theoretically, the interpolation formula can be implemented as a low-pass filter, whose impulse response is sinc(t/T)sinc(t/T) and whose input is ∑n=−∞∞x(nT)⋅δ(t−nT),∑_n=-∞^∞x(nT)·δ(t-nT), which is a Dirac comb function modulated by the signal samples. Practical digital-to-analog converters (DAC) implement an approximation like the zero-order hold. In that case, oversampling can reduce the approximation error. Shannon's original
