frequency: To illustrate the necessity of fs>2B_s>2B, consider the family of sinusoids generated by different values of θθ in this formula: x(t)=cos⁡(2πBt+θ)cos⁡(θ)=cos⁡(2πBt)−sin⁡(2πBt)tan⁡(θ),−π/2<θ<π/2.(t)=cos(2+θ)/cos(θ)cos(2)-sin(2)tan(θ), -π/2<θ<π/2. A family of sinusoids at the critical frequency, all having the same sample sequences of alternating +1 and –1. That is, they all are aliases of each other, even though their frequency is not above half the sample rate. With fs=2B_s=2B or equivalently T=1/2B=1/2B, the samples are given by: x(nT)=cos⁡(πn)−sin⁡(πn)⏟0tan⁡(θ)=(−1)n(nT)=cos()-sin()_0tan(θ)=(-1)^n regardless of the value of θθ. That sort of ambiguity is the reason for the strict inequality of the sampling theorem's condition. Sampling of non-baseband
