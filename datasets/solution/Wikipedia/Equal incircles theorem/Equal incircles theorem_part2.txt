lemma: In the diagram, lines PS and PT are adjacent rays making angles γnγ_n and γn+1γ_n+1 with line PR, which is perpendicular to the baseline, RST. Line QXOY is parallel to the baseline and passes through O, the center of the incircle of △ PST, which is tangent to the rays at W and Z. Also, line PQ has length h−r-r, and line QR has length r, the radius of the incircle. Then △ OWX is similar to △ PQX and △ OZY is similar to △ PQY, and from XY = XO + OY we get (h−r)(tan⁡γn+1−tan⁡γn)=r(sec⁡γn+sec⁡γn+1).(h-r)(tanγ_n+1-tanγ_n)=r(γ_n+γ_n+1). This relation on a set of angles, γm{γ_m}, expresses the condition of equal incircles. To prove the lemma, we set tan⁡γn=sinh⁡(a+nb)tanγ_n=sinh(a+nb), which gives sec⁡γn=cosh⁡(a+nb)γ_n=cosh(a+nb). Using a+(n+1)b=(a+nb)+b+(n+1)b=(a+nb)+b, we apply the addition rules for sinhsinh and coshcosh, and verify that the equal incircles relation is satisfied by setting rh−r=tanh⁡b2.r/h-r=tanhb/2. This gives an expression for the parameter b in terms of the geometric measures, h and r. With this definition of b we then obtain an expression for the radii, rN_N, of the incircles formed by taking every Nth ray as the sides of the triangles rNh−rN=tanh⁡Nb2.r_N/h-r_N=tanhNb/2. See
