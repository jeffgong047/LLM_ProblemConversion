Theorem in control theory Artstein's theorem states that a nonlinear dynamical system in the control-affine form x˙=f(x)+∑i=1mgi(x)ui𝐱̇=𝐟(𝐱)+∑_i=1^m𝐠_i(𝐱)u_i has a differentiable control-Lyapunov function if and only if it admits a regular stabilizing feedback u(x), that is a locally Lipschitz function on Rn\{0}.[1] The original 1983 proof by Zvi Artstein proceeds by a nonconstructive argument. In 1989 Eduardo D. Sontag provided a constructive version of this theorem explicitly exhibiting the feedback.[2][3] See
