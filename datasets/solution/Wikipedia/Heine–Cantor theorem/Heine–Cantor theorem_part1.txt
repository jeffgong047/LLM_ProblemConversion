(April 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mathematics, the Heine–Cantor theorem, named after Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor, states that if f:M→N is a continuous function between two metric spaces M and N, and M is compact, then f is uniformly continuous. An important special case is that every continuous function from a closed bounded interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.
