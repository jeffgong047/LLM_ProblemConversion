In mathematics, the Heine–Cantor theorem, named after Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor, states that if f:M→N is a continuous function between two metric spaces M and N, and M is compact, then f is uniformly continuous. An important special case is that every continuous function from a closed bounded interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.

Proof[edit]
Suppose that M and N are two metric spaces with metrics dM_M and dN_N, respectively. Suppose further that a function f:M→N:M is continuous and M is compact. We want to show that f is uniformly continuous, that is, for every positive real number ε>0ε>0 there exists a positive real number δ>0δ>0 such that for all points x,y,y in the function domain M, dM(x,y)<δ_M(x,y)<δ implies that dN(f(x),f(y))<ε_N(f(x),f(y))<ε.
Consider some positive real number ε>0ε>0. By continuity, for any point x in the domain M, there exists some positive real number δx>0δ_x>0 such that dN(f(x),f(y))<ε/2_N(f(x),f(y))<ε/2 when dM(x,y)<δx_M(x,y)<δ_x, i.e., a fact that y is within δxδ_x of x implies that f(y)(y) is within ε/2ε/2 of f(x)(x). 
Let Ux_x be the open δx/2δ_x/2-neighborhood of x, i.e. the set

Ux=y∣dM(x,y)<12δx._x={y_M(x,y)<1/2δ_x}.
Since each point x is contained in its own Ux_x, we find that the collection Ux∣x∈M{U_x} is an open cover of M. Since M is compact, this cover has a finite subcover Ux1,Ux2,…,Uxn{U_x_1,U_x_2,…,U_x_n} where x1,x2,…,xn∈M_1,x_2,…,x_n. Each of these open sets has an associated radius δxi/2δ_x_i/2. Let us now define δ=min1≤i≤nδxi/2δ=min_1δ_x_i/2, i.e. the minimum radius of these open sets. Since we have a finite number of positive radii, this minimum δδ is well-defined and positive. We now show that this δδ works for the definition of uniform continuity.
Suppose that dM(x,y)<δ_M(x,y)<δ for any two x,y,y in M. Since the sets Uxi_x_i form an open (sub)cover of our space M, we know that x must lie within one of them, say Uxi_x_i. Then we have that dM(x,xi)<12δxi_M(x,x_i)<1/2δ_x_i. The triangle inequality then implies that

dM(xi,y)≤dM(xi,x)+dM(x,y)<12δxi+δ≤δxi,_M(x_i,y)_M(x_i,x)+d_M(x,y)<1/2δ_x_i+δ≤δ_x_i,
implying that x and y are both at most δxiδ_x_i away from xi_i. By definition of δxiδ_x_i, this implies that dN(f(xi),f(x))_N(f(x_i),f(x)) and dN(f(xi),f(y))_N(f(x_i),f(y)) are both less than ε/2ε/2. Applying the triangle inequality then yields the desired

dN(f(x),f(y))≤dN(f(xi),f(x))+dN(f(xi),f(y))<ε2+ε2=ε._N(f(x),f(y))_N(f(x_i),f(x))+d_N(f(x_i),f(y))<ε/2+ε/2=ε.
For an alternative proof in the case of M=[a,b]=[a,b], a closed interval, see the article Non-standard calculus.
