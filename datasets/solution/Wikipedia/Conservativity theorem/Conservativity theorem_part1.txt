In mathematical logic, a theory can be extended with new constants or function names under certain conditions with assurance that the extension will introduce no contradiction. Extension by definitions is perhaps the best-known approach, but it requires unique existence of an object with the desired property. Addition of new names can also be done safely without uniqueness. Suppose that a closed formula ∃x1…∃xmφ(x1,…,xm)_1…_m φ(x_1,…,x_m) is a theorem of a first-order theory T. Let T1_1 be a theory obtained from T by extending its language with new constants a1,…,am_1,…,a_m and adding a new axiom φ(a1,…,am)φ(a_1,…,a_m). Then T1_1 is a conservative extension of T, which means that the theory T1_1 has the same set of theorems in the original language (i.e., without constants ai_i) as the theory T. Such a theory can also be conservatively extended by introducing a new functional symbol:[1] Suppose that a closed formula ∀x→∃yφ(y,x→)∀x⃗ φ(y,x⃗) is a theorem of a first-order theory T, where we denote x→:=(x1,…,xn)x⃗:=(x_1,…,x_n). Let T1_1 be a theory obtained from T by extending its language with a new functional symbol f (of arity n) and adding a new axiom ∀x→φ(f(x→),x→)∀x⃗ φ(f(x⃗),x⃗). Then T1_1 is a conservative extension of T, i.e. the theories T and T1_1 prove the same theorems not involving the functional symbol f). Shoenfield states the theorem in the form for a new function name, and constants are the same as functions of zero arguments. In formal systems that admit ordered tuples, extension by multiple constants as shown here can be accomplished by addition of a new constant tuple and the new constant names having the values of elements of the tuple.
