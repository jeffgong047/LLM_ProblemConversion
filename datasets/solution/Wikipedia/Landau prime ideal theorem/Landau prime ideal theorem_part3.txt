fields: This general pattern holds for number fields in general, so that the prime ideal theorem is dominated by the ideals of norm a prime number. As Edmund Landau proved in Landau 1903, for norm at most X the same asymptotic formula Xlog⁡XX/ always holds. Heuristically this is because the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta-function of K always has a simple pole with residue −1 at s = 1. As with the Prime Number Theorem, a more precise estimate may be given in terms of the logarithmic integral function. The number of prime ideals of norm ≤ X is Li(X)+OK(Xexp⁡(−cKlog⁡(X))),Li(X)+O_K(Xexp(-c_K√(log(X)))), where cK is a constant depending on K. See
