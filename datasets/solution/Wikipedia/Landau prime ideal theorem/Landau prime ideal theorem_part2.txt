Example: What to expect can be seen already for the Gaussian integers. There for any prime number p of the form 4n + 1, p factors as a product of two Gaussian primes of norm p. Primes of the form 4n + 3 remain prime, giving a Gaussian prime of norm p2. Therefore, we should estimate 2r(X)+r′(X)2r(X)+r^'(√(X)) where r counts primes in the arithmetic progression 4n + 1, and r′ in the arithmetic progression 4n + 3. By the quantitative form of Dirichlet's theorem on primes, each of r(Y) and r′(Y) is asymptotically Y2log⁡Y.Y/2. Therefore, the 2r(X) term dominates, and is asymptotically Xlog⁡X.X/. General number
