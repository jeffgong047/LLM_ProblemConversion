Operator: Frequently when describing how Fourier series behave, authors introduce the partial sum operator Sn_n for a function f(x)(x).[6] SN(f)=∑n=−NNcne2πinxP_N(f)=∑_n=-N^Nc_ne^2/P (Eq. 8) Where cn_n are the Fourier coefficients of f. Unlike series in calculus, it is important that the partial sums are taken symmetrically for Fourier series, otherwise convergence results may not hold.
