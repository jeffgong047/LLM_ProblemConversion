functions: Fourier series can also be applied to functions that are not necessarily periodic. The simplest extension occurs when the function s(x)(x) is defined only in a fixed interval [x0,x0+P][x_0,x_0+P]. In this case the integrals defining the Fourier coefficients can be taken over this interval. In this case all of the convergence results will be the same as for the periodic extension of s(x)(x) to the whole real line. In particular, it may happen that for a continuous function s(x)(x) there is a discontinuity in the periodic extension of at x0_0 and x0+P_0+P. In this case, it is possible to see Gibbs phenomenon at the end points of the interval. For functions which have compact support, meaning that values of s(x)(x) are defined everywhere but identically zero outside some fixed interval [x0,x0+P][x_0,x_0+P], the Fourier series can be taken on any interval containing the support [x0,x0+P][x_0,x_0+P]. For both the cases above, it is sometimes desirable to take an even or odd reflection of the function, or extend it by zero in the case the function is only defined on a finite interval. This allows one to prescribe desired properties for the Fourier coefficients. For example, by making the function even you ensure Bn=0_n=0. This is often known as a cosine series. One may similarly arrive at a sine series. In the case where the function doesn't have compact support and is defined on entire real line, one can use the Fourier transform. Fourier series can be taken for a truncated version of the function or to the periodic summation. Partial Sum
