square: We can also define the Fourier series for functions of two variables x and y in the square [−π,π]×[−π,π][-π,π]×[-π,π]: f(x,y)=∑j,k∈Zcj,keijxeiky,cj,k=14π2∫−ππ∫−ππf(x,y)e−ijxe−ikydxdy.f(x,y) =∑_j,k∈ℤc_j,ke^ijxe^iky, c_j,k =1/4π^2∫_-π^π∫_-π^πf(x,y)e^-ijxe^-iky dx dy. Aside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of Fourier series on the square is in image compression. In particular, the JPEG image compression standard uses the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, a discrete form of the Fourier cosine transform, which uses only cosine as the basis function. For two-dimensional arrays with a staggered appearance, half of the Fourier series coefficients disappear, due to additional symmetry.[23] Fourier series of
