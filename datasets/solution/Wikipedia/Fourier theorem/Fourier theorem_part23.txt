theorems: Main article: Convolution theorem § Periodic convolution (Fourier series coefficients) Given P-periodic functions, sP__P and rP__P with Fourier series coefficients S[n][n] and R[n],[n], n∈Z,∈ℤ, The pointwise product: hP(x)≜sP(x)⋅rP(x)__P(x)__P(x)__P(x) is also P-periodic, and its Fourier series coefficients are given by the discrete convolution of the S and R sequences: H[n]=S∗R[n].[n]={S*R}[n]. The periodic convolution: hP(x)≜∫PsP(τ)⋅rP(x−τ)dτ__P(x)≜∫_Ps__P(τ)__P(x-τ) dτ is also P-periodic, with Fourier series coefficients: H[n]=P⋅S[n]⋅R[n].[n]=P[n][n]. A doubly infinite sequence cnn∈Z{c_n}_n in c0(Z)_0(ℤ) is the sequence of Fourier coefficients of a function in L1([0,2π])^1([0,2π]) if and only if it is a convolution of two sequences in ℓ2(Z)ℓ^2(ℤ).
