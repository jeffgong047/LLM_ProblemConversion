theorems: See also: Gibbs phenomenon Because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the Fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result. Theorem — If s belongs to L2(P)^2(P) (an interval of length P), then s∞_∞ converges to s in L2(P)^2(P), that is, ‖sN−s‖2s__N-s_2 converges to 0 as N→∞→∞. We have already mentioned that if s is continuously differentiable, then (i⋅n)S[n](i)S[n] is the nth^th Fourier coefficient of the derivative s′'. It follows, essentially from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, that s∞_∞ is absolutely summable. The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to s, since the Fourier series converges in the mean to s: Theorem — If s∈C1(T)^1(𝕋), then s∞_∞ converges to s uniformly (and hence also pointwise.) This result can be proven easily if s is further assumed to be C2^2, since in that case n2S[n]^2S[n] tends to zero as n→∞→∞. More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to s, provided that s satisfies a Hölder condition of order α>1/2α>1/2. In the absolutely summable case, the inequality: supx|s(x)−sN(x)|≤∑|n|>N|S[n]|sup_x|s(x)-s__N(x)|≤∑_|n|>N|S[n]| proves uniform convergence. Many other results concerning the convergence of Fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at x if s is differentiable at x, to Lennart Carleson's much more sophisticated result that the Fourier series of an L2^2 function actually converges almost everywhere.
