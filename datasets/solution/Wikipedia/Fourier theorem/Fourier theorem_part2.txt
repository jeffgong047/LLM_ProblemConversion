series: The Fourier series can be represented in different forms. The sine-cosine form, exponential form, and amplitude-phase form are expressed here for a periodic function s(x)(x) with periodicity of P. Fig 1. The top graph shows a non-periodic function s(x) in blue defined only over the red interval from 0 to P. The Fourier series can be thought of as analyzing the periodic extension (bottom graph) of the original function. The Fourier series is always a periodic function, even if original function s(x) wasn't. Sine-cosine
