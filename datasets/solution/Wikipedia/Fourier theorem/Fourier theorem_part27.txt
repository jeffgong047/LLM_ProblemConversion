groups: Main article: Pontryagin duality The generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact, nonabelian groups. However, there is a straightforward generalization to Locally Compact Abelian (LCA) groups. This generalizes the Fourier transform to L1(G)^1(G) or L2(G)^2(G), where G is an LCA group. If G is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the [−π,π][-π,π] case, but if G is noncompact, one obtains instead a Fourier integral. This generalization yields the usual Fourier transform when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is Rℝ.
