property: We say that s belongs to Ck(T)^k(𝕋) if s is a 2π-periodic function on Rℝ which is k times differentiable, and its kth^th derivative is continuous. If s∈C1(T)^1(𝕋), then the Fourier coefficients s′^[n]s'[n] of the derivative s′' can be expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients s^[n]s[n] of the function s, via the formula s′^[n]=ins^[n]s'[n]=ins[n]. If s∈Ck(T)^k(𝕋), then s(k)^[n]=(in)ks^[n]s^(k)[n]=(in)^ks[n]. In particular, since for a fixed k≥1≥1 we have s(k)^[n]→0s^(k)[n]→0 as n→∞→∞, it follows that |n|ks^[n]|n|^ks[n] tends to zero, which means that the Fourier coefficients converge to zero faster than the kth power of n for any k≥1≥1.
