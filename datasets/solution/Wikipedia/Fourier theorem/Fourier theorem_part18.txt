properties: When the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are decomposed into their even and odd parts, there are four components, denoted below by the subscripts RE, RO, IE, and IO. And there is a one-to-one mapping between the four components of a complex time function and the four components of its complex frequency transform:[21] Timedomains=sRE+sRO+isIE+isIO⏟⇕F⇕F⇕F⇕F⇕FFrequencydomainS=SRE+iSIO⏞+iSIE+SRO[ Timedomain s = s__RE + s__RO + is__IE + i__IO; ⇕ℱ ⇕ℱ; ⇕ℱ; ⇕ℱ; ⇕ℱ; Frequencydomain S = S_RE + i_IO + iS_IE + S_RO ] From this, various relationships are apparent, for example: The transform of a real-valued function (sRE + sRO) is the even symmetric function SRE + i SIO. Conversely, an even-symmetric transform implies a real-valued time-domain. The transform of an imaginary-valued function (i sIE + i sIO) is the odd symmetric function SRO + i SIE, and the converse is true. The transform of an even-symmetric function (sRE + i sIO) is the real-valued function SRE + SRO, and the converse is true. The transform of an odd-symmetric function (sRO + i sIE) is the imaginary-valued function i SIE + i SIO, and the converse is true. Other
