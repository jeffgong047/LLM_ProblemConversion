property: Parseval's theorem implies that: Theorem — The trigonometric polynomial sN__N is the unique best trigonometric polynomial of degree N approximating s(x)(x), in the sense that, for any trigonometric polynomial pN≠sN__N__N of degree N, we have: ‖sN−s‖2<‖pN−s‖2,s__N-s_2<p__N-s_2, where the Hilbert space norm is defined as: ‖g‖2=1P∫P|g(x)|2dx.g_2=√(1∫_P|g(x)|^2 dx).
