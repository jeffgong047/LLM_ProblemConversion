Divergence: Since Fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous T-periodic function need not converge pointwise.[citation needed] The uniform boundedness principle yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact. In 1922, Andrey Kolmogorov published an article titled Une s√©rie de Fourier-Lebesgue divergente presque partout in which he gave an example of a Lebesgue-integrable function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. He later constructed an example of an integrable function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere (Katznelson 1976). See
