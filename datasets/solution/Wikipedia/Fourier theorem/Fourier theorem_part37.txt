Notes: ^ Some authors define A0_0 differently so that the same integral can be used to define A0_0 and An_n. This changes Eq. 2 so that the first term needs to be divided by 2, and is no longer the average value. ^ The scale factor 2P,2P, which could be inserted later, results in a series that converges to s(x)(x) instead of P2s(x).P2s(x). ^ Since the integral defining the Fourier transform of a periodic function is not convergent, it is necessary to view the periodic function and its transform as distributions. In this sense Fei2πnxPℱ{e^i2/P} is a Dirac delta function, which is an example of a distribution. ^ These three did some important early work on the wave equation, especially D'Alembert. Euler's work in this area was mostly comtemporaneous/ in collaboration with Bernoulli, although the latter made some independent contributions to the theory of waves and vibrations. (See Fetter & Walecka 2003, pp. 209–210). ^ These words are not strictly Fourier's. Whilst the cited article does list the author as Fourier, a footnote indicates that the article was actually written by Poisson (that it was not written by Fourier is also clear from the consistent use of the third person to refer to him) and that it is, "for reasons of historical interest", presented as though it were Fourier's original memoire.
