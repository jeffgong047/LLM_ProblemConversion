notations: The notation cn_n is inadequate for discussing the Fourier coefficients of several different functions. Therefore, it is customarily replaced by a modified form of the function (s, in this case), such as s^[n]ŝ[n] or S[n][n], and functional notation often replaces subscripting: s(x)=∑n=−∞∞s^(n)⋅e2πinx/Pcommonmathematicsnotation=∑n=−∞∞S[n]⋅ei2πnx/Pcommonengineeringnotations(x) =∑_n=-∞^∞ŝ(n)^2/P commonmathematicsnotation =∑_n=-∞^∞S[n]^i 2/P commonengineeringnotation In engineering, particularly when the variable x represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies. Another commonly used frequency domain representation uses the Fourier series coefficients to modulate a Dirac comb: S(f)≜∑n=−∞∞S[n]⋅δ(f−nP),(f) triangleq sum_n=-∞^∞S[n]·δ(f-n/P), where f represents a continuous frequency domain. When variable x has units of seconds, f has units of hertz. The "teeth" of the comb are spaced at multiples (i.e. harmonics) of 1P1P, which is called the fundamental frequency. s∞(x)_∞(x) can be recovered from this representation by an inverse Fourier transform: F−1S(f)=∫−∞∞(∑n=−∞∞S[n]⋅δ(f−nP))ei2πfxdf,=∑n=−∞∞S[n]⋅∫−∞∞δ(f−nP)ei2πfxdf,=∑n=−∞∞S[n]⋅ei2πnx/P≜s∞(x).ℱ^-1{S(f)} =∫_-∞^∞(∑_n=-∞^∞S[n]·δ(f-n/P))e^i2 df, =∑_n=-∞^∞S[n]·∫_-∞^∞δ(f-n/P)e^i2 df, =∑_n=-∞^∞S[n]^i 2/P ≜_∞(x). The constructed function S(f)(f) is therefore commonly referred to as a Fourier transform, even though the Fourier integral of a periodic function is not convergent at the harmonic frequencies.[C]
