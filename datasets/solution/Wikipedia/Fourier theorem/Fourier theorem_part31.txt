interpretation: Main article: Hilbert space In the language of Hilbert spaces, the set of functions en=einx:n∈Z{e_n=e^inx:n∈ℤ} is an orthonormal basis for the space L2([−π,π])^2([-π,π]) of square-integrable functions on [−π,π][-π,π]. This space is actually a Hilbert space with an inner product given for any two elements f and g by: ⟨f,g⟩≜12π∫−ππf(x)g∗(x)dx,, g⟩ ≜ 1/2π∫_-π^πf(x)g^*(x) dx, where g∗(x)^*(x) is the complex conjugate of g(x).(x). The basic Fourier series result for Hilbert spaces can be written as f=∑n=−∞∞⟨f,en⟩en.=∑_n=-∞^∞,e_n⟩ e_n. Sines and cosines form an orthogonal set, as illustrated above. The integral of sine, cosine and their product is zero (green and red areas are equal, and cancel out) when m, n or the functions are different, and π only if m and n are equal, and the function used is the same. They would form an orthonormal set, if the integral equaled 1 (that is, each function would need to be scaled by 1/π1/√(π)). This corresponds exactly to the complex exponential formulation given above. The version with sines and cosines is also justified with the Hilbert space interpretation. Indeed, the sines and cosines form an orthogonal set: ∫−ππcos⁡(mx)cos⁡(nx)dx=12∫−ππcos⁡((n−m)x)+cos⁡((n+m)x)dx=πδmn,m,n≥1,∫_-π^πcos(mx) cos(nx) dx=1/2∫_-π^πcos((n-m)x)+cos((n+m)x) dx=πδ_mn,,n≥1, ∫−ππsin⁡(mx)sin⁡(nx)dx=12∫−ππcos⁡((n−m)x)−cos⁡((n+m)x)dx=πδmn,m,n≥1∫_-π^πsin(mx) sin(nx) dx=1/2∫_-π^πcos((n-m)x)-cos((n+m)x) dx=πδ_mn,,n≥1 (where δmn is the Kronecker delta), and ∫−ππcos⁡(mx)sin⁡(nx)dx=12∫−ππsin⁡((n+m)x)+sin⁡((n−m)x)dx=0;∫_-π^πcos(mx) sin(nx) dx=1/2∫_-π^πsin((n+m)x)+sin((n-m)x) dx=0; furthermore, the sines and cosines are orthogonal to the constant function 11. An orthonormal basis for L2([−π,π])^2([-π,π]) consisting of real functions is formed by the functions 11 and 2cos⁡(nx)√(2)cos(nx), 2sin⁡(nx)√(2)sin(nx) with n= 1,2,.... The density of their span is a consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the Fejér kernel.
