series: Main article: Convergence of Fourier series These theorems, and informal variations of them that don't specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as Fourier's theorem or the Fourier theorem.[24][25][26][27] The earlier Eq.7 sN(x)=∑n=−NNS[n]ei2πPnx,__N(x)=∑_n=-N^NS[n]^i2πPnx, is a trigonometric polynomial of degree N that can be generally expressed as: pN(x)=∑n=−NNp[n]ei2πPnx.__N(x)=∑_n=-N^Np[n]^i2πPnx.
