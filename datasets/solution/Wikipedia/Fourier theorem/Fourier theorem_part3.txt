form: The Fourier series coefficients[3] are defined by the integrals: Fourier series coefficients A0=1P∫−P/2P/2s(x)dxAn=2P∫−P/2P/2s(x)cos⁡(2πnxP)dxforn≥1Bn=2P∫−P/2P/2s(x)sin⁡(2πnxP)dxforn≥1A_0 =1/P∫_-P/2^P/2s(x) dx A_n =2/P∫_-P/2^P/2s(x)cos(2/P) dx forn≥1 B_n =2/P∫_-P/2^P/2s(x)sin(2/P) dx forn≥1 (Eq. 1) It is notable that A0_0 is the average value of the function s(x)(x). This is a property that extends to similar transforms such as the Fourier transform.[A] With these coefficients defined the Fourier series is: Fourier series s(x)∼A0+∑n=1∞(Ancos⁡(2πnxP)+Bnsin⁡(2πnxP))(x)_0+∑_n=1^∞(A_ncos(2/P)+B_nsin(2/P)) (Eq. 2) Many others use the ∼∼ symbol, because it is not always true that the sum of the Fourier series is equal to s(x)(x). It can fail to converge entirely, or converge to something that differs from s(x)(x). While these situations can occur, their differences are rarely a problem in science and engineering, and authors in these disciplines will sometimes write Eq. 2 with ∼∼ replaced by ==. The integer index n in the Fourier series coefficients is the number of cycles the corresponding coscos or sinsin from the series make in the function's period P. Therefore the terms corresponding to An_n and Bn_n have: a wavelength equal to PnPn and having the same units as x. a frequency equal to nPnP and having reciprocal units as x.
