motivation: Heat distribution in a metal plate, using Fourier's method The Fourier series expansion of the sawtooth function (above) looks more complicated than the simple formula s(x)=xπ(x)=xπ, so it is not immediately apparent why one would need the Fourier series. While there are many applications, Fourier's motivation was in solving the heat equation. For example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose sides measure ππ meters, with coordinates (x,y)∈[0,π]×[0,π](x,y)∈[0,π]×[0,π]. If there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees Celsius, while the fourth side, given by y=π=π, is maintained at the temperature gradient T(x,π)=x(x,π)=x degrees Celsius, for x in (0,π)(0,π), then one can show that the stationary heat distribution (or the heat distribution after a long period of time has elapsed) is given by T(x,y)=2∑n=1∞(−1)n+1nsin⁡(nx)sinh⁡(ny)sinh⁡(nπ).(x,y)=2∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n+1/nsin(nx)sinh(ny)sinh(nπ). Here, sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. This solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of Eq.6 by sinh⁡(ny)/sinh⁡(nπ)sinh(ny)/sinh(nπ). While our example function s(x)(x) seems to have a needlessly complicated Fourier series, the heat distribution T(x,y)(x,y) is nontrivial. The function T cannot be written as a closed-form expression. This method of solving the heat problem was made possible by Fourier's work. Complex Fourier series
