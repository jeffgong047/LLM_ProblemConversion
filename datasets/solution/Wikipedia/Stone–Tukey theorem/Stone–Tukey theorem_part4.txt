rotating-knife: A two-dimensional ham sandwich theorem example with noncontiguous regions: lines at 5° increments bisect the similarly coloured region (pink ham and green vegetable) into two equal areas, the black line denoting the common bisector of both regions The two-dimensional variant of the theorem (also known as the pancake theorem) can be proved by an argument which appears in the fair cake-cutting literature (see e.g. Robertson–Webb rotating-knife procedure). For each angle α∈[0,180∘]α∈[0,180^∘], a straight line ("knife") of angle αα can bisect pancake #1. To see this, translate [move parallelly] a straight line of angle αα from −∞-∞ to ∞∞; the fraction of pancake #1 covered by the line changes continuously from 0 to 1, so by the intermediate value theorem it must be equal to 1/2 somewhere along the way. It is possible that an entire range of translations of our line yield a fraction of 1/2; in this case, it is a canonical choice to pick the middle one of all such translations. When the knife is at angle 0, it also cuts pancake #2, but the pieces are probably unequal (if we are lucky and the pieces are equal, we are done). Define the 'positive' side of the knife as the side in which the fraction of pancake #2 is larger. We now turn the knife, and translate it as described above. When the angle is αα, define p(α)(α) as the fraction of pancake #2 at the positive side of the knife. Initially p(0)>1/2(0)>1/2. The function p is continuous, since small changes in the angle lead to small changes in the position of the knife. When the knife is at angle 180, the knife is upside-down, so p(180)<1/2(180)<1/2. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be an angle in which p(α)=1/2(α)=1/2. Cutting at that angle bisects both pancakes simultaneously. n-dimensional variant: proof using the Borsuk–Ulam
