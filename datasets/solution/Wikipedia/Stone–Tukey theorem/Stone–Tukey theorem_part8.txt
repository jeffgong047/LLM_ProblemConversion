Generalizations: The original theorem works for at most n collections, where n is the number of dimensions. To bisect a larger number of collections without going to higher dimensions, one can use, instead of a hyperplane, an algebraic surface of degree k, i.e., an (n−1)–dimensional surface defined by a polynomial function of degree k: Given (k+nn)−1k+nn-1 measures in an n–dimensional space, there exists an algebraic surface of degree k which bisects them all. (Smith & Wormald (1998)). This generalization is proved by mapping the n–dimensional plane into a (k+nn)−1k+nn-1 dimensional plane, and then applying the original theorem. For example, for n = 2 and k = 2, the 2–dimensional plane is mapped to a 5–dimensional plane via: (x, y) → (x, y, x2, y2, xy). See
