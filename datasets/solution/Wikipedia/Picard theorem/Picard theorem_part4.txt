Theorem: Suppose f:C→C:ℂ→ℂ is an entire function that omits two values z0_0 and z1_1. By considering f(z)−z0z1−z0f(z)-z_0/z_1-z_0 we may assume without loss of generality that z0=0_0=0 and z1=1_1=1. Because Cℂ is simply connected and the range of f omits 00 , f has a holomorphic logarithm. Let g be an entire function such that f(z)=e2πig(z)(z)=e^2(z). Then the range of g omits all integers. By a similar argument using the quadratic formula, there is an entire function h such that g(z)=cos⁡(h(z))(z)=cos(h(z)). Then the range of h omits all complex numbers of the form 2πn±icosh−1⁡(m)2cosh^-1(m), where n is an integer and m is a nonnegative integer. By Landau's theorem, if h′(w)≠0'(w)≠0, then for all R>0R>0, the range of h contains a disk of radius |h′(w)|R/72|h'(w)|R/72. But from above, any sufficiently large disk contains at least one number that the range of h omits. Therefore h′(w)=0'(w)=0 for all w. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, h is constant, so f is constant. Great Picard
