Theorem about the range of an analytic function For the theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions of differential equations, see Picard–Lindelöf theorem. In complex analysis, Picard's great theorem and Picard's little theorem are related theorems about the range of an analytic function. They are named after Émile Picard. The
