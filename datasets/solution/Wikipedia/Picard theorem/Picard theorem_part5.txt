Theorem: Proof of the Great Picard Theorem Suppose f is an analytic function on the punctured disk of radius r around the point w, and that f omits two values z0 and z1. By considering (f(p + rz) − z0)/(z1 − z0) we may assume without loss of generality that z0 = 0, z1 = 1, w = 0, and r = 1. The function F(z) = f(e−z) is analytic in the right half-plane Re(z) > 0. Because the right half-plane is simply connected, similar to the proof of the Little Picard Theorem, there are analytic functions G and H defined on the right half-plane such that F(z) = e2πiG(z) and G(z) = cos(H(z)). For any w in the right half-plane, the open disk with radius Re(w) around w is contained in the domain of H. By Landau's theorem and the observation about the range of H in the proof of the Little Picard Theorem, there is a constant C > 0 such that |H′(w)| ≤ C / Re(w). Thus, for all real numbers x ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2π, |H(x+iy)|=|H(2+iy)+∫2xH′(t+iy)dt|≤|H(2+iy)|+∫2xCtdt≤Alog⁡x,|H(x+iy)|=|H(2+iy)+∫_2^xH'(t+iy) dt|≤|H(2+iy)|+∫_2^xC/t dt, where A > 0 is a constant. So |G(x + iy)| ≤ xA. Next, we observe that F(z + 2πi) = F(z) in the right half-plane, which implies that G(z + 2πi) − G(z) is always an integer. Because G is continuous and its domain is connected, the difference G(z + 2πi) − G(z) = k is a constant. In other words, the function G(z) − kz / (2πi) has period 2πi. Thus, there is an analytic function g defined in the punctured disk with radius e−2 around 0 such that G(z) − kz / (2πi) = g(e−z). Using the bound on G above, for all real numbers x ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2π, |G(x+iy)−k(x+iy)2πi|≤xA+|k|2π(x+2π)≤C′xA′|G(x+iy)-k(x+iy)/2|^A+|k|/2π(x+2π)'x^A' holds, where A′ > A and C′ > 0 are constants. Because of the periodicity, this bound actually holds for all y. Thus, we have a bound |g(z)| ≤ C′(−log|z|)A′ for 0 < |z| < e−2. By Riemann's theorem on removable singularities, g extends to an analytic function in the open disk of radius e−2 around 0. Hence, G(z) − kz / (2πi) is bounded on the half-plane Re(z) ≥ 3. So F(z)e−kz is bounded on the half-plane Re(z) ≥ 3, and f(z)zk is bounded in the punctured disk of radius e−3 around 0. By Riemann's theorem on removable singularities, f(z)zk extends to an analytic function in the open disk of radius e−3 around 0. Therefore, f does not have an essential singularity at 0. Therefore, if the function f has an essential singularity at 0, the range of f in any open disk around 0 omits at most one value. If f takes a value only finitely often, then in a sufficiently small open disk around 0, f omits that value. So f(z) takes all possible complex values, except at most one, infinitely often.
