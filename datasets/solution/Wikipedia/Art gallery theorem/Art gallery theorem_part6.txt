proof: To illustrate the proof, we consider the polygon below. The first step is to triangulate the polygon (see Figure 1). Then, one applies a proper 33-colouring (Figure 2) and observes that there are 44 red, 44 blue and 66 green vertices. The colour with the fewest vertices is blue or red, thus the polygon can be covered by 44 guards (Figure 3). This agrees with the art gallery theorem, because the polygon has 1414 vertices, and ⌊143⌋=4⌊14/3⌋=4. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3
