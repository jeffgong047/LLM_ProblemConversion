Generalizations: Chvátal's upper bound remains valid if the restriction to guards at corners is loosened to guards at any point not exterior to the polygon. There are a number of other generalizations and specializations of the original art-gallery theorem.[6] For instance, for orthogonal polygons, those whose edges/walls meet at right angles, only ⌊n/4⌋/4⌋ guards are needed. There are at least three distinct proofs of this result, none of them simple: by Kahn, Klawe, and Kleitman; by Lubiw; and by Sack and Toussaint.[7][8] A related problem asks for the number of guards to cover the exterior of an arbitrary polygon (the "Fortress Problem"): ⌈n/2⌉/2⌉ are sometimes necessary and always sufficient if guards are placed on the boundary of the polygon, while ⌈n/3⌉/3⌉ are sometimes necessary and always sufficient if guards are placed anywhere in the exterior of the polygon.[9] In other words, the infinite exterior is more challenging to cover than the finite interior.
