dimensions: An orthogonal polyhedron with every vertex invisible from its middle [14] An example of a polyhedron with interior points not visible from any vertex, the figure on the right showing a cross-section through its middle, O, and parallel to ABCD 360° spherical panorama from inside the polyhedron above showing that all vertices are hidden by the yellow faces(view as a 360° interactive panorama) If a museum is represented in three dimensions as a polyhedron, then putting a guard at each vertex will not ensure that all of the museum is under observation. Although all of the surface of the polyhedron would be surveyed, for some polyhedra there are points in the interior which might not be under surveillance.[15] Possible Usage Scenarios of the Art Gallery Problem The art gallery problem can be used to position multiple cameras when the objective is to cover a large area in view of cameras, using the minimum number of cameras.
