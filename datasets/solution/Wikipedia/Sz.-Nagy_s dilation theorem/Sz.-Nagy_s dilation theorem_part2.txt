Proof: For a contraction T (i.e., (‖T‖≤1T≤1), its defect operator DT is defined to be the (unique) positive square root DT = (I - T*T)½. In the special case that S is an isometry, DS* is a projector and DS=0, hence the following is an Sz. Nagy unitary dilation of S with the required polynomial functional calculus property: U=[SDS∗DS−S∗].=[ S D_S^*; D_S -S^* ]. Returning to the general case of a contraction T, every contraction T on a Hilbert space H has an isometric dilation, again with the calculus property, on ⊕n≥0H⊕_n≥0H given by S=[T00⋯DT000I0⋱00I⋱⋮⋱⋱].=[ T 0 0 ⋯; D_T 0 0; 0 I 0 ⋱; 0 0 I ⋱; ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ]. Substituting the S thus constructed into the previous Sz.-Nagy unitary dilation for an isometry S, one obtains a unitary dilation for a contraction T: Tn=PHSn|H=PH(QH′U|H′)n|H=PHUn|H.^n=P_HS^n|_H=P_H(Q_H'U|_H')^n|_H=P_HU^n|_H.
