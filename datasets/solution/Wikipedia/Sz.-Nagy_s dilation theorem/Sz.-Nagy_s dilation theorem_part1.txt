Dilation theorem The Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem (proved by Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy) states that every contraction T on a Hilbert space H has a unitary dilation U to a Hilbert space K, containing H, with Tn=PHUn|H,n≥0,^n=P_HU^n|_H,≥0, where PH_H is the projection from K onto H. Moreover, such a dilation is unique (up to unitary equivalence) when one assumes K is minimal, in the sense that the linear span of ⋃n∈NUnH⋃_n∈ℕ U^nH is dense in K. When this minimality condition holds, U is called the minimal unitary dilation of T.
