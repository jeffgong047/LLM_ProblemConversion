Dilation theorem
The Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem (proved by Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy) states that every contraction T on a Hilbert space H has a unitary dilation U to a Hilbert space K, containing H, with

Tn=PHUn|H,n≥0,^n=P_HU^n|_H,≥0,
where PH_H is the projection from K onto H.
Moreover, such a dilation is unique (up to unitary equivalence) when one assumes K is minimal, in the sense that the linear span of ⋃n∈NUnH⋃_n∈ℕ U^nH is dense in K. When this minimality condition holds, U is called the minimal unitary dilation of T.


Proof[edit]
For a contraction T (i.e., (‖T‖≤1T≤1), its defect operator DT is defined to be the (unique) positive square root DT = (I - T*T)½. In the special case that S is an isometry, DS* is a projector and DS=0, hence the following is an Sz. Nagy unitary dilation of S with the required polynomial functional calculus property:

U=[SDS∗DS−S∗].=[     S D_S^*;   D_S  -S^* ].
Returning to the general case of a contraction T, every contraction T on a Hilbert space H has an isometric dilation, again with the calculus property, on

⊕n≥0H⊕_n≥0H
given by

S=[T00⋯DT000I0⋱00I⋱⋮⋱⋱].=[   T   0   0   ⋯; D_T   0   0;   0   I   0   ⋱;   0   0   I   ⋱;   ⋮   ⋱   ⋱ ].
Substituting the S thus constructed into the previous Sz.-Nagy unitary dilation for an isometry S, one obtains a unitary dilation for a contraction T:

Tn=PHSn|H=PH(QH′U|H′)n|H=PHUn|H.^n=P_HS^n|_H=P_H(Q_H'U|_H')^n|_H=P_HU^n|_H.
Schaffer form[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (June 2008)
The Schaffer form of a unitary Sz. Nagy dilation can be viewed as a beginning point for the characterization of all unitary dilations, with the required property, for a given contraction.

Remarks[edit]
A generalisation of this theorem, by Berger, Foias and Lebow, shows that if X is a spectral set for T, and 

R(X)ℛ(X)
is a Dirichlet algebra, then T has a minimal normal δX dilation, of the form above. A consequence of this is that any operator with a simply connected spectral set X has a minimal normal δX dilation.
To see that this generalises Sz.-Nagy's theorem, note that contraction operators have the unit disc D as a spectral set, and that normal operators with spectrum in the unit circle δD are unitary.
