Remarks: A generalisation of this theorem, by Berger, Foias and Lebow, shows that if X is a spectral set for T, and R(X)ℛ(X) is a Dirichlet algebra, then T has a minimal normal δX dilation, of the form above. A consequence of this is that any operator with a simply connected spectral set X has a minimal normal δX dilation. To see that this generalises Sz.-Nagy's theorem, note that contraction operators have the unit disc D as a spectral set, and that normal operators with spectrum in the unit circle δD are unitary.
