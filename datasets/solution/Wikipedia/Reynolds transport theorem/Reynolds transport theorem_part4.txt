case: If we take Ω to be constant with respect to time, then vb = 0 and the identity reduces to ddt∫ΩfdV=∫Ω∂f∂tdV.d/dt∫_Ωf dV=∫_Ω/ dV. as expected. (This simplification is not possible if the flow velocity is incorrectly used in place of the velocity of an area element.) Interpretation and reduction to one
