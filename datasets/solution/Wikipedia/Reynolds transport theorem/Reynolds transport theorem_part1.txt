It is used to recast time derivatives of integrated quantities and is useful in formulating the basic equations of continuum mechanics. Consider integrating f = f(x,t) over the time-dependent region Œ©(t) that has boundary ‚àÇŒ©(t), then taking the derivative with respect to time: ddt‚à´Œ©(t)fdV.d/dt‚à´_Œ©(t)ùêü dV. If we wish to move the derivative into the integral, there are two issues: the time dependence of f, and the introduction of and removal of space from Œ© due to its dynamic boundary. Reynolds transport theorem provides the necessary framework. General
