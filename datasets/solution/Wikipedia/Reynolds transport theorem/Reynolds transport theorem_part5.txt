dimension: The theorem is the higher-dimensional extension of differentiation under the integral sign and reduces to that expression in some cases. Suppose f is independent of y and z, and that Ω(t) is a unit square in the yz-plane and has x limits a(t) and b(t). Then Reynolds transport theorem reduces to ddt∫a(t)b(t)f(x,t)dx=∫a(t)b(t)∂f∂tdx+∂b(t)∂tf(b(t),t)−∂a(t)∂tf(a(t),t),d/dt∫_a(t)^b(t)f(x,t) dx=∫_a(t)^b(t)/ dx+(t)/f(b(t),t)-(t)/f(a(t),t) , which, up to swapping x and t, is the standard expression for differentiation under the integral sign.
