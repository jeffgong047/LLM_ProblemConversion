map: In complex algebraic geometry, the Jacobian of a curve C is constructed using path integration. Namely, suppose C has genus g, which means topologically that H1(C,Z)≅Z2g._1(C,ℤ)≅ℤ^2g. Geometrically, this homology group consists of (homology classes of) cycles in C, or in other words, closed loops. Therefore, we can choose 2g loops γ1,…,γ2gγ_1,…,γ_2g generating it. On the other hand, another more algebro-geometric way of saying that the genus of C is g is that H0(C,K)≅Cg,^0(C,K)≅ℂ^g, where K is the canonical bundle on C. By definition, this is the space of globally defined holomorphic differential forms on C, so we can choose g linearly independent forms ω1,…,ωgω_1,…,ω_g. Given forms and closed loops we can integrate, and we define 2g vectors Ωj=(∫γjω1,…,∫γjωg)∈Cg.Ω_j=(∫_γ_jω_1,…,∫_γ_jω_g)∈ℂ^g. It follows from the Riemann bilinear relations that the ΩjΩ_j generate a nondegenerate lattice ΛΛ (that is, they are a real basis for Cg≅R2gℂ^g≅ℝ^2g), and the Jacobian is defined by J(C)=Cg/Λ.(C)=ℂ^g/Λ. The Abel–Jacobi map is then defined as follows. We pick some base point p0∈C_0 and, nearly mimicking the definition of Λ,Λ, define the map u:C→J(C)u(p)=(∫p0pω1,…,∫p0pωg)modΛu:C(C) u(p)=(∫_p_0^pω_1,…,∫_p_0^pω_g)Λ Although this is seemingly dependent on a path from p0_0 to p,, any two such paths define a closed loop in C and, therefore, an element of H1(C,Z),_1(C,ℤ), so integration over it gives an element of Λ.Λ. Thus the difference is erased in the passage to the quotient by ΛΛ. Changing base-point p0_0 does change the map, but only by a translation of the torus. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian
