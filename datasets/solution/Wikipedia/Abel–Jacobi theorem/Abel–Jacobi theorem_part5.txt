theorem: The following theorem was proved by Abel (known as Abel's theorem): Suppose that D=∑inipi=∑_in_ip_i is a divisor (meaning a formal integer-linear combination of points of C). We can define u(D)=∑iniu(pi)(D)=∑_in_iu(p_i) and therefore speak of the value of the Abel–Jacobi map on divisors. The theorem is then that if D and E are two effective divisors, meaning that the ni_i are all positive integers, then u(D)=u(E)(D)=u(E) if and only if D is linearly equivalent to E.. This implies that the Abel-Jacobi map induces an injective map (of abelian groups) from the space of divisor classes of degree zero to the Jacobian. Jacobi proved that this map is also surjective (known as Jacobi inversion problem), so the two groups are naturally isomorphic. The Abel–Jacobi theorem implies that the Albanese variety of a compact complex curve (dual of holomorphic 1-forms modulo periods) is isomorphic to its Jacobian variety (divisors of degree 0 modulo equivalence). For higher-dimensional compact projective varieties the Albanese variety and the Picard variety are dual but need not be isomorphic.
