In mathematics, the Abel–Jacobi map is a construction of algebraic geometry which relates an algebraic curve to its Jacobian variety. In Riemannian geometry, it is a more general construction mapping a manifold to its Jacobi torus.
The name derives from the theorem of Abel and Jacobi that two effective divisors are linearly equivalent if and only if they are indistinguishable under the Abel–Jacobi map.


Construction of the map[edit]
In complex algebraic geometry, the Jacobian of a curve C is constructed using path integration. Namely, suppose C has genus g, which means topologically that

H1(C,Z)≅Z2g._1(C,ℤ)≅ℤ^2g.
Geometrically, this homology group consists of (homology classes of) cycles in C, or in other words, closed loops. Therefore, we can choose 2g loops γ1,…,γ2gγ_1,…,γ_2g generating it. On the other hand, another more algebro-geometric way of saying that the genus of C is g is that

H0(C,K)≅Cg,^0(C,K)≅ℂ^g,
where K is the canonical bundle on C.
By definition, this is the space of globally defined holomorphic differential forms on C, so we can choose g linearly independent forms ω1,…,ωgω_1,…,ω_g. Given forms and closed loops we can integrate, and we define 2g vectors

Ωj=(∫γjω1,…,∫γjωg)∈Cg.Ω_j=(∫_γ_jω_1,…,∫_γ_jω_g)∈ℂ^g.
It follows from the Riemann bilinear relations that the ΩjΩ_j generate a nondegenerate lattice ΛΛ (that is, they are a real basis for Cg≅R2gℂ^g≅ℝ^2g), and the Jacobian is defined by

J(C)=Cg/Λ.(C)=ℂ^g/Λ.
The Abel–Jacobi map is then defined as follows. We pick some base point p0∈C_0 and, nearly mimicking the definition of Λ,Λ, define the map

u:C→J(C)u(p)=(∫p0pω1,…,∫p0pωg)modΛu:C(C)
u(p)=(∫_p_0^pω_1,…,∫_p_0^pω_g)Λ
Although this is seemingly dependent on a path from p0_0 to p,, any two such paths define a closed loop in C and, therefore, an element of H1(C,Z),_1(C,ℤ), so integration over it gives an element of Λ.Λ. Thus the difference is erased in the passage to the quotient by ΛΛ. Changing base-point p0_0 does change the map, but only by a translation of the torus.

The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold[edit]
Let M be a smooth compact manifold. Let π=π1(M)π=π_1(M) be its fundamental group. Let f:π→πab:π→π^ab be its abelianisation map. Let tor=tor⁡(πab)tor=tor(π^ab) be the torsion subgroup of πabπ^ab. Let g:πab→πab/tor:π^ab→π^ab/tor be the quotient by torsion. If M is a surface, πab/torπ^ab/tor is non-canonically isomorphic to Z2gℤ^2g, where g is the genus; more generally, πab/torπ^ab/tor is non-canonically isomorphic to Zbℤ^b, where b is the first Betti number. Let φ=g∘f:π→Zbφ=g:π→ℤ^b be the composite homomorphism.
Definition. The cover M¯M̅ of the manifold M corresponding to the subgroup ker⁡(φ)⊂π(φ)⊂π is called the universal (or maximal) free abelian cover.
Now assume M has a Riemannian metric. Let E be the space of harmonic 1-forms on M, with dual E∗^* canonically identified with H1(M,R)_1(M,ℝ). By integrating an integral harmonic 1-form along paths from a basepoint x0∈M_0, we obtain a map to the circle R/Z=S1ℝ/ℤ=S^1.
Similarly, in order to define a map M→H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R_1(M,ℝ)/H_1(M,ℤ)_ℝ without choosing a basis for cohomology, we argue as follows. Let x be a point in the universal cover M M̃ of M. Thus x is represented by a point of M together with a path c from x0_0 to it. By integrating along the path c, we obtain a linear form on E: 

h→∫ch.→∫_ch.
This gives rise a map 

M →E∗=H1(M,R),M̃^*=H_1(M,ℝ),
which, furthermore, descends to a map

A¯M:M¯→E∗c↦(h↦∫ch)A_M:M^*
c↦(h↦∫_ch)
where M¯M is the universal free abelian cover.
Definition. The Jacobi variety (Jacobi torus) of M is the torus

J1(M)=H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R._1(M)=H_1(M,ℝ)/H_1(M,ℤ)_ℝ.
Definition. The Abel–Jacobi map

AM:M→J1(M),_M:M_1(M),
is obtained from the map above by passing to quotients.
The Abel–Jacobi map is unique up to translations of the Jacobi torus. The map has applications in Systolic geometry. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold shows up in the large time asymptotics of the heat kernel on a periodic manifold (Kotani & Sunada (2000) and Sunada (2012)).
In much the same way, one can define a graph-theoretic analogue of Abel–Jacobi map as a piecewise-linear map from a finite graph into a flat torus (or a Cayley graph associated with a finite abelian group), which is closely related to asymptotic behaviors of random walks on crystal lattices, and can be used for design of crystal structures.

The Abel-Jacobi map of a compact Riemann surface[edit]
We provide an analytic construction of the Abel-Jacobi map on compact Riemann surfaces.
Let M denotes a compact Riemann surface of genus g>0>0. Let a1,...,ag,b1,...,bg{a_1,...,a_g,b_1,...,b_g} be a canonical homology basis on M, and ζ1,...,ζg{ζ_1,...,ζ_g} the dual basis for H1(M)ℋ^1(M), which is a g dimensional complex vector space consists of holomorphic differential forms. Dual basis we mean ∫akζj=δjk∫_a_kζ_j=δ_jk, for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g. We can form a symmetric matrix whose entries are ∫bkζj∫_b_kζ_j, for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g. Let L be the lattice generated by the 2g2g-columns of the g×2g×2g matrix whose entries consists of ∫ckζj∫_c_kζ_j for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g where ck∈ak,bk_k∈{a_k,b_k}. We call J(M)=Cg/L(M)(M)=ℂ^g/L(M) the Jacobian variety of M which is a compact, commutative g-dimensional complex Lie group.
We can define a map φ:M→J(M)φ:M(M) by choosing a point P0∈M_0 and setting
φ(P)=(∫P0Pζ1,...,∫P0Pζg).φ(P)=(∫_P_0^Pζ_1,...,∫_P_0^Pζ_g).
which is a well-defined holomorphic mapping with rank 1 (maximal rank). Then we can naturally extend this to a mapping of divisor classes;
If we denote Div(M)Div(M) the divisor class group of M then define a map φ:Div(M)→J(M)φ:Div(M)(M) by setting
φ(D)=∑j=1rφ(Pj)−∑j=1sφ(Qj),D=P1⋯Pr/Q1⋯Qs.φ(D)=∑_j=1^rφ(P_j)-∑_j=1^sφ(Q_j),=P_1_r/Q_1_s.
Note that if r=s=s then this map is independent of the choice of the base point so we can define the base point independent map
φ0:Div(0)(M)→J(M)φ_0:Div^(0)(M)(M) where Div(0)(M)Div^(0)(M) denotes the divisors of degree zero of M.
The below Abel's theorem show that the kernel of the map φ0φ_0 is precisely the subgroup of principal divisors. Together with the Jacobi inversion problem, we can say that As a group, J(M)(M) is isomorphic to the group of divisors of degree zero modulo its subgroup of principal divisors.

Abel–Jacobi theorem[edit]
The following theorem was proved by Abel (known as Abel's theorem): Suppose that

D=∑inipi=∑_in_ip_i
is a divisor (meaning a formal integer-linear combination of points of C). We can define

u(D)=∑iniu(pi)(D)=∑_in_iu(p_i)
and therefore speak of the value of the Abel–Jacobi map on divisors. The theorem is then that if D and E are two effective divisors, meaning that the ni_i are all positive integers, then

u(D)=u(E)(D)=u(E) if and only if D is linearly equivalent to E.. This implies that the Abel-Jacobi map induces an injective map (of abelian groups) from the space of divisor classes of degree zero to the Jacobian.
Jacobi proved that this map is also surjective (known as Jacobi inversion problem), so the two groups are naturally isomorphic.
The Abel–Jacobi theorem implies that the Albanese variety of a compact complex curve (dual of holomorphic 1-forms modulo periods) is isomorphic to its Jacobian variety (divisors of degree 0 modulo equivalence). For higher-dimensional compact projective varieties the Albanese variety and the Picard variety are dual but need not be isomorphic.
