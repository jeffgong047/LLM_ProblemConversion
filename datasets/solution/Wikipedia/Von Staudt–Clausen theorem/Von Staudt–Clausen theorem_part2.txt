Proof: A proof of the Von Staudt–Clausen theorem follows from an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers which is: B2n=∑j=02n1j+1∑m=0j(−1)m(jm)m2n_2n=∑_j=0^2n1/j+1∑_m=0^j(-1)^mjm^2n and as a corollary: B2n=∑j=02nj!j+1(−1)jS(2n,j)_2n=∑_j=0^2nj!/j+1(-1)^jS(2n,j) where S(n,j)(n,j) are the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Furthermore the following lemmas are needed: Let p be a prime number then, 1. If p-1 divides 2n then, ∑m=0p−1(−1)m(p−1m)m2n≡−1(modp)∑_m=0^p-1(-1)^mp-1m^2n≡-1p 2. If p-1 does not divide 2n then, ∑m=0p−1(−1)m(p−1m)m2n≡0(modp)∑_m=0^p-1(-1)^mp-1m^2n≡0p Proof of (1) and (2): One has from Fermat's little theorem, mp−1≡1(modp)^p-1≡1p for m=1,2,...,p−1=1,2,...,p-1. If p-1 divides 2n then one has, m2n≡1(modp)^2n≡1p for m=1,2,...,p−1=1,2,...,p-1. Thereafter one has, ∑m=1p−1(−1)m(p−1m)m2n≡∑m=1p−1(−1)m(p−1m)(modp)∑_m=1^p-1(-1)^mp-1m^2n≡∑_m=1^p-1(-1)^mp-1p from which (1) follows immediately. If p-1 does not divide 2n then after Fermat's theorem one has, m2n≡m2n−(p−1)(modp)^2n^2n-(p-1)p If one lets ℘=[2np−1]℘=[2n/p-1] (Greatest integer function) then after iteration one has, m2n≡m2n−℘(p−1)(modp)^2n^2n-℘(p-1)p for m=1,2,...,p−1=1,2,...,p-1 and 0<2n−℘(p−1)<p−10<2n-℘(p-1)<p-1. Thereafter one has, ∑m=0p−1(−1)m(p−1m)m2n≡∑m=0p−1(−1)m(p−1m)m2n−℘(p−1)(modp)∑_m=0^p-1(-1)^mp-1m^2n≡∑_m=0^p-1(-1)^mp-1m^2n-℘(p-1)p Lemma (2) now follows from the above and the fact that S(n,j)=0 for j>n. (3). It is easy to deduce that for a>2 and b>2, ab divides (ab-1)!. (4). Stirling numbers of second kind are integers. Proof of the theorem: Now we are ready to prove Von-Staudt Clausen theorem, If j+1 is composite and j>3 then from (3), j+1 divides j!. For j=3, ∑m=03(−1)m(3m)m2n=3⋅22n−32n−3≡0(mod4)∑_m=0^3(-1)^m3m^2n=3·2^2n-3^2n-3≡04 If j+1 is prime then we use (1) and (2) and if j+1 is composite then we use (3) and (4) to deduce: B2n=In−∑(p−1)|2n1p_2n=I_n-∑_(p-1)|2n1/p where In_n is an integer, which is the Von-Staudt Clausen theorem.[1][2] See
