In algebraic geometry, the Mumford vanishing theorem proved by Mumford[1] in 1967 states that if L is a semi-ample invertible sheaf with Iitaka dimension at least 2 on a complex projective manifold, then Hi(X,L−1)=0fori=0,1.^i(X,L^-1)=0fori=0,1.} The Mumford vanishing theorem is related to the Ramanujam vanishing theorem, and is generalized by the Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem.
