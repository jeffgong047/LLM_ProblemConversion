resistor: In 1928, John B. Johnson discovered and Harry Nyquist explained Johnson–Nyquist noise. With no applied current, the mean-square voltage depends on the resistance R, kBT_BT, and the bandwidth ΔνΔν over which the voltage is measured:[4] ⟨V2⟩≈4RkBTΔν.^2⟩≈4Rk_BT Δν. A simple circuit for illustrating Johnson–Nyquist thermal noise in a resistor. This observation can be understood through the lens of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Take, for example, a simple circuit consisting of a resistor with a resistance R and a capacitor with a small capacitance C. Kirchhoff's law yields V=−RdQdt+QC=-RdQ/dt+Q/C and so the response function for this circuit is χ(ω)≡Q(ω)V(ω)=11C−iωRχ(ω)≡Q(ω)/V(ω)=1/1/C-i In the low-frequency limit ω≪(RC)−1ω≪(RC)^-1, its imaginary part is simply Im[χ(ω)]≈ωRC2Im[χ(ω)]≈^2 which then can be linked to the power spectral density function SV(ω)_V(ω) of the voltage via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem SV(ω)=SQ(ω)C2≈2kBTC2ωIm[χ(ω)]=2RkBT_V(ω)=S_Q(ω)/C^2≈2k_BT/C^2ωIm[χ(ω)]=2Rk_BT The Johnson–Nyquist voltage noise ⟨V2⟩^2⟩ was observed within a small frequency bandwidth Δν=Δω/(2π)Δν=Δω/(2π) centered around ω=±ω0ω=±ω_0. Hence ⟨V2⟩≈SV(ω)×2Δν≈4RkBTΔν^2⟩_V(ω)×2Δν≈4Rk_BTΔν General
