version: We derive the fluctuation–dissipation theorem in the form given above, using the same notation. Consider the following test case: the field f has been on for infinite time and is switched off at t=0 f(t)=f0θ(−t),(t)=f_0θ(-t), where θ(t)θ(t) is the Heaviside function. We can express the expectation value of x by the probability distribution W(x,0) and the transition probability P(x′,t|x,0)(x',t|x,0) ⟨x(t)⟩=∫dx′∫dxx′P(x′,t|x,0)W(x,0).(t)⟩=' x'P(x',t|x,0)W(x,0). The probability distribution function W(x,0) is an equilibrium distribution and hence given by the Boltzmann distribution for the Hamiltonian H(x)=H0(x)−xf0(x)=H_0(x)-xf_0 W(x,0)=exp⁡(−βH(x))∫dx′exp⁡(−βH(x′)),(x,0)=exp(-(x))/' exp(-(x')) , where β−1=kBTβ^-1=k_BT. For a weak field βxf0≪1_0≪1, we can expand the right-hand side W(x,0)≈W0(x)[1+βf0(x(0)−⟨x⟩0)],(x,0)_0(x)[1+_0(x(0)-⟩_0)], here W0(x)_0(x) is the equilibrium distribution in the absence of a field. Plugging this approximation in the formula for ⟨x(t)⟩(t)⟩ yields ⟨x(t)⟩=⟨x⟩0+βf0A(t),(t)⟩=⟩_0+_0A(t), (*) where A(t) is the auto-correlation function of x in the absence of a field: A(t)=⟨[x(t)−⟨x⟩0][x(0)−⟨x⟩0]⟩0.(t)=⟨[x(t)-⟩_0][x(0)-⟩_0]⟩_0. Note that in the absence of a field the system is invariant under time-shifts. We can rewrite ⟨x(t)⟩−⟨x⟩0(t)⟩-⟩_0 using the susceptibility of the system and hence find with the above equation (*) f0∫0∞dτχ(τ)θ(τ−t)=βf0A(t)_0∫_0^∞dτ χ(τ)θ(τ-t)=_0A(t) Consequently, −χ(t)=βdA(t)dtθ(t).-χ(t)=βdA(t)θ(t). (**) To make a statement about frequency dependence, it is necessary to take the Fourier transform of equation (**). By integrating by parts, it is possible to show that −χ^(ω)=iωβ∫0∞e−iωtA(t)dt−βA(0).-χ̂(ω)=iωβ∫_0^∞e^-iA(t) dt-(0). Since A(t)(t) is real and symmetric, it follows that 2Im⁡[χ^(ω)]=−ωβA^(ω).2Im[χ̂(ω)]=-ωβÂ(ω). Finally, for stationary processes, the Wiener–Khinchin theorem states that the two-sided spectral density is equal to the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function: Sx(ω)=A^(ω)._x(ω)=Â(ω). Therefore, it follows that Sx(ω)=−2kBTωIm⁡[χ^(ω)]._x(ω)=-2k_BT/ωIm[χ̂(ω)]. Quantum
