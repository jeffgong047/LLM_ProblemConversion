version: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates the correlation function of the observable of interest ⟨x^(t)x^(0)⟩⟨x̂(t)x̂(0)⟩ (a measure of fluctuation) to the imaginary part of the response function Im[χ(ω)]=[χ(ω)−χ∗(ω)]/2iIm[χ(ω)]=[χ(ω)-χ^*(ω)]/2i in the frequency domain (a measure of dissipation). A link between these quantities can be found through the so-called Kubo formula[6] χ(t−t′)=iℏθ(t−t′)⟨[x^(t),x^(t′)]⟩χ(t-t')=i/ħθ(t-t')⟨[x̂(t),x̂(t')]⟩ which follows, under the assumptions of the linear response theory, from the time evolution of the ensemble average of the observable ⟨x^(t)⟩⟨x̂(t)⟩ in the presence of a perturbing source. Once Fourier transformed, the Kubo formula allows writing the imaginary part of the response function as Im[χ(ω)]=12ℏ∫−∞+∞⟨x^(t)x^(0)−x^(0)x^(t)⟩eiωtdt.Im[χ(ω)]=1/2ħ∫_-∞^+∞⟨x̂(t)x̂(0)-x̂(0)x̂(t)^idt. In the canonical ensemble, the second term can be re-expressed as ⟨x^(0)x^(t)⟩=Tre−βH^x^(0)x^(t)=Trx^(t)e−βH^x^(0)=Tre−βH^eβH^x^(t)e−βH^⏟x^(t−iℏβ)x^(0)=⟨x^(t−iℏβ)x^(0)⟩⟨x̂(0)x̂(t)⟩=Tre^-βĤx̂(0)x̂(t)=Trx̂(t)e^-βĤx̂(0)=Tre^-βĤe^βĤx̂(t)e^-βĤ_x̂(t-iħβ)x̂(0)=⟨x̂(t-iħβ)x̂(0)⟩ where in the second equality we re-positioned x^(t)x̂(t) using the cyclic property of trace. Next, in the third equality, we inserted e−βH^eβH^^-βĤe^βĤ next to the trace and interpreted e−βH^^-βĤ as a time evolution operator e−iℏH^Δt^-i/ħĤ with imaginary time interval Δt=−iℏβ=-iħβ. The imaginary time shift turns into a e−βℏω^-βħω factor after Fourier transform ∫−∞+∞⟨x^(t−iℏβ)x^(0)⟩eiωtdt=e−βℏω∫−∞+∞⟨x^(t)x^(0)⟩eiωtdt∫_-∞^+∞⟨x̂(t-iħβ)x̂(0)^idt=e^-βħω∫_-∞^+∞⟨x̂(t)x̂(0)^idt and thus the expression for Im[χ(ω)]Im[χ(ω)] can be easily rewritten as the quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation [7] Sx(ω)=2ℏ[nBE(ω)+1]Im[χ(ω)]_x(ω)=2ħ[n_BE(ω)+1]Im[χ(ω)] where the power spectral density Sx(ω)_x(ω) is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation ⟨x^(t)x^(0)⟩⟨x̂(t)x̂(0)⟩ and nBE(ω)=(eβℏω−1)−1_BE(ω)=(e^βħω-1)^-1 is the Bose-Einstein distribution function. The same calculation also yields Sx(−ω)=e−βℏωSx(ω)=2ℏ[nBE(ω)]Im[χ(ω)]≠Sx(+ω)_x(-ω)=e^-βħωS_x(ω)=2ħ[n_BE(ω)]Im[χ(ω)]_x(+ω) thus, differently from what obtained in the classical case, the power spectral density is not exactly frequency-symmetric in the quantum limit. Consistently, ⟨x^(t)x^(0)⟩⟨x̂(t)x̂(0)⟩ has an imaginary part originating from the commutation rules of operators.[8] The additional "+1+1" term in the expression of Sx(ω)_x(ω) at positive frequencies can also be thought of as linked to spontaneous emission. An often cited result is also the symmetrized power spectral density Sx(ω)+Sx(−ω)2=2ℏ[nBE(ω)+12]Im[χ(ω)]=ℏcoth⁡(ℏω2kBT)Im[χ(ω)].S_x(ω)+S_x(-ω)/2=2ħ[n_BE(ω)+1/2]Im[χ(ω)]=ħ(ħω/2k_BT)Im[χ(ω)]. The "+1/2+1/2" can be thought of as linked to quantum fluctuations, or to zero-point motion of the observable x^x̂. At high enough temperatures, nBE≈(βℏω)−1≫1_BE≈(βħω)^-1≫1, i.e. the quantum contribution is negligible, and we recover the classical version. Violations in glassy
