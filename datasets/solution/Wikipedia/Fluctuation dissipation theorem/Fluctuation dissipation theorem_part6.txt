formulation: The fluctuation–dissipation theorem can be formulated in many ways; one particularly useful form is the following:[citation needed]. Let x(t)(t) be an observable of a dynamical system with Hamiltonian H0(x)_0(x) subject to thermal fluctuations. The observable x(t)(t) will fluctuate around its mean value ⟨x⟩0⟩_0 with fluctuations characterized by a power spectrum Sx(ω)=⟨x^(ω)x^∗(ω)⟩_x(ω)=⟨x̂(ω)x̂^*(ω)⟩. Suppose that we can switch on a time-varying, spatially constant field f(t)(t) which alters the Hamiltonian to H(x)=H0(x)−f(t)x(x)=H_0(x)-f(t)x. The response of the observable x(t)(t) to a time-dependent field f(t)(t) is characterized to first order by the susceptibility or linear response function χ(t)χ(t) of the system ⟨x(t)⟩=⟨x⟩0+∫−∞tf(τ)χ(t−τ)dτ,(t)⟩=⟩_0+∫_-∞^tf(τ)χ(t-τ) dτ, where the perturbation is adiabatically (very slowly) switched on at τ=−∞τ=-∞. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem relates the two-sided power spectrum (i.e. both positive and negative frequencies) of x to the imaginary part of the Fourier transform χ^(ω)χ̂(ω) of the susceptibility χ(t)χ(t): Sx(ω)=−2kBTωIm⁡χ^(ω)._x(ω)=-2k_BT/ωImχ̂(ω). Which holds under the Fourier transform convention f(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t)e−iωtdt(ω)=∫_-∞^∞f(t)e^-i dt. The left-hand side describes fluctuations in x, the right-hand side is closely related to the energy dissipated by the system when pumped by an oscillatory field f(t)=Fsin⁡(ωt+ϕ)(t)=Fsin(+ϕ). This is the classical form of the theorem; quantum fluctuations are taken into account by replacing 2kBT/ω2k_BT/ω with ℏcoth⁡(ℏω/2kBT)ħ (ħω/2k_BT) (whose limit for ℏ→0ħ→0 is 2kBT/ω2k_BT/ω). A proof can be found by means of the LSZ reduction, an identity from quantum field theory.[citation needed] The fluctuation–dissipation theorem can be generalized in a straightforward way to the case of space-dependent fields, to the case of several variables or to a quantum-mechanics setting.[1] A special case in which the fluctuating quantity is the energy itself is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the frequency-dependent specific heat.[5]
