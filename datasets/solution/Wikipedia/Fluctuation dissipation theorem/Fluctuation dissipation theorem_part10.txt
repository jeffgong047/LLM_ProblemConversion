systems: While the fluctuation–dissipation theorem provides a general relation between the response of systems obeying detailed balance, when detailed balance is violated comparison of fluctuations to dissipation is more complex. Below the so called glass temperature Tg_g, glassy systems are not equilibrated, and slowly approach their equilibrium state. This slow approach to equilibrium is synonymous with the violation of detailed balance. Thus these systems require large time-scales to be studied while they slowly move toward equilibrium. To study the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in glassy systems, particularly spin glasses, Ref.[9] performed numerical simulations of macroscopic systems (i.e. large compared to their correlation lengths) described by the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model using supercomputers. In their simulations, the system is initially prepared at a high temperature, rapidly cooled to a temperature T=0.64Tg=0.64T_g below the glass temperature Tg_g, and left to equilibrate for a very long time tw_w under a magnetic field H. Then, at a later time t+tw+t_w, two dynamical observables are probed, namely the response function χ(t+tw,tw)≡∂m(t+tw)∂H|H=0χ(t+t_w,t_w)≡.(t+t_w)/|_H=0 and the spin-temporal correlation function C(t+tw,tw)≡1V∑x⟨Sx(tw)Sx(t+tw)⟩|H=0(t+t_w,t_w)≡1/V.∑_x_x(t_w)S_x(t+t_w)⟩|_H=0 where Sx=±1_x=±1 is the spin living on the node x of the cubic lattice of volume V, and m(t)≡1V∑x⟨Sx(t)⟩(t)≡1/V∑_x_x(t)⟩ is the magnetization density. The fluctuation-dissipation relation in this system can be written in terms of these observables as Tχ(t+tw,tw)=1−C(t+tw,tw)χ(t+t_w,t_w)=1-C(t+t_w,t_w) Their results confirm the expectation that as the system is left to equilibrate for longer times, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is closer to be satisfied. In the mid-1990s, in the study of dynamics of spin glass models, a generalization of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem was discovered [10] that holds for asymptotic non-stationary states, where the temperature appearing in the equilibrium relation is substituted by an effective temperature with a non-trivial dependence on the time scales. This relation is proposed to hold in glassy systems beyond the models for which it was initially found. See
