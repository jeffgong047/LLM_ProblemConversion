On when a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature in the interval (1, 4] is a sphere This article is about sphere theorem for Riemannian manifolds. For a different result by the same name, see Sphere theorem (3-manifolds). In Riemannian geometry, the sphere theorem, also known as the quarter-pinched sphere theorem, strongly restricts the topology of manifolds admitting metrics with a particular curvature bound. The precise statement of the theorem is as follows. If M is a complete, simply-connected, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature taking values in the interval (1,4](1,4] then M is homeomorphic to the n-sphere. (To be precise, we mean the sectional curvature of every tangent 2-plane at each point must lie in (1,4](1,4].) Another way of stating the result is that if M is not homeomorphic to the sphere, then it is impossible to put a metric on M with quarter-pinched curvature. Note that the conclusion is false if the sectional curvatures are allowed to take values in the closed interval [1,4][1,4]. The standard counterexample is complex projective space with the Fubiniâ€“Study metric; sectional curvatures of this metric take on values between 1 and 4, with endpoints included. Other counterexamples may be found among the rank one symmetric spaces. Differentiable sphere
