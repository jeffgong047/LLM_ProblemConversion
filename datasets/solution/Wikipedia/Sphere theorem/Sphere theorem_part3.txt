theorem: Heinz Hopf conjectured that a simply connected manifold with pinched sectional curvature is a sphere.[citation needed] In 1951, Harry Rauch showed that a simply connected manifold with curvature in [3/4,1] is homeomorphic to a sphere.[citation needed] In 1960, Marcel Berger and Wilhelm Klingenberg proved the topological version of the sphere theorem with the optimal pinching constant.[citation needed]
