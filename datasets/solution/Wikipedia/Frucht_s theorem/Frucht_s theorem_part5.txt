groups: Izbicki extended these results in 1959 and showed that there were uncountably many infinite graphs realizing any finite symmetry group.[13] Finally, Johannes de Groot and Sabidussi in 1959/1960 independently proved that any group (dropping the assumption that the group be finite, but with the assumption of axiom of choice) could be realized as the group of symmetries of an infinite graph.[14][15]
