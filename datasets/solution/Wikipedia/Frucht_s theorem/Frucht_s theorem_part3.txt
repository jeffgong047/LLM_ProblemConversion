size: With three exceptions – the cyclic groups of orders 3, 4, and 5 – every group can be represented as the symmetries of a graph whose vertices have only two orbits. Therefore, the number of vertices in the graph is at most twice the order of the group. With a larger set of exceptions, most finite groups can be represented as the symmetries of a vertex-transitive graph, with a number of vertices equal to the order of the group.[4] Special families of
