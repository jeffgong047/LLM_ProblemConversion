graphs: There are stronger versions of Frucht's theorem that show that certain restricted families of graphs still contain enough graphs to realize any symmetry group. Frucht[5] proved that in fact countably many 3-regular graphs with the desired property exist; for instance, the Frucht graph, a 3-regular graph with 12 vertices and 18 edges, has no nontrivial symmetries, providing a realization of this type for the trivial group. Gert Sabidussi showed that any group can be realized as the symmetry groups of countably many distinct k-regular graphs, k-vertex-connected graphs, or k-chromatic graphs, for all positive integer values k (with k≥3≥3 for regular graphs and k≥2≥2 for k-chromatic graphs).[6] From the facts that every graph can be reconstructed from the containment partial order of its edges and vertices, that every finite partial order is equivalent by Birkhoff's representation theorem to a finite distributive lattice, it follows that every finite group can be realized as the symmetries of a distributive lattice, and of the graph of the lattice, a median graph.[3] It is possible to realize every finite group as the group of symmetries of a strongly regular graph.[7] Every finite group can also be realized as the symmetries of a graph with distinguishing number two: one can (improperly) color the graph with two colors so that none of the symmetries of the graph preserve the coloring.[8] However, some important classes of graphs are incapable of realizing all groups as their symmetries. Camille Jordan characterized the symmetry groups of trees as being the smallest set of finite groups containing the trivial group and closed under direct products with each other and wreath products with symmetric groups;[9] in particular, the cyclic group of order three is not the symmetry group of a tree. Planar graphs are also not capable of realizing all groups as their symmetries; for instance, the only finite simple groups that are symmetries of planar graphs are the cyclic groups and the alternating group A5_5.[10] More generally, every minor-closed graph family is incapable of representing all finite groups by the symmetries of its graphs.[11] László Babai conjectures, more strongly, that each minor-closed family can represent only finitely many non-cyclic finite simple groups.[12] Infinite graphs and
