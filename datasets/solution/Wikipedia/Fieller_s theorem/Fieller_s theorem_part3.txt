methods: One problem is that, when g is not small, the confidence interval can blow up when using Fieller's theorem. Andy Grieve has provided a Bayesian solution where the CIs are still sensible, albeit wide.[2] Bootstrapping provides another alternative that does not require the assumption of normality.[3]
