interval: Variables a and b may be measured in different units, so there is no way to directly combine the standard errors as they may also be in different units. The most complete discussion of this is given by Fieller (1954).[1] Fieller showed that if a and b are (possibly correlated) means of two samples with expectations μaμ_a and μbμ_b, and variances ν11σ2ν_11σ^2 and ν22σ2ν_22σ^2 and covariance ν12σ2ν_12σ^2, and if ν11,ν12,ν22ν_11,ν_12,ν_22 are all known, then a (1 − α) confidence interval (mL, mU) for μa/μbμ_a/μ_b is given by (mL,mU)=1(1−g)[ab−gν12ν22∓tr,αsbν11−2abν12+a2b2ν22−g(ν11−ν122ν22)](m_L,m_U)=1/(1-g)[a/b-gν_12/ν_22∓t_r,αs/b√(ν_11-2a/bν_12+a^2/b^2ν_22-g(ν_11-ν_12^2/ν_22))] where g=tr,α2s2ν22b2.=t_r,α^2s^2ν_22/b^2. Here s2^2 is an unbiased estimator of σ2σ^2 based on r degrees of freedom, and tr,α_r,α is the αα-level deviate from the Student's t-distribution based on r degrees of freedom. Three features of this formula are important in this context: a) The expression inside the square root has to be positive, or else the resulting interval will be imaginary. b) When g is very close to 1, the confidence interval is infinite. c) When g is greater than 1, the overall divisor outside the square brackets is negative and the confidence interval is exclusive.
