statement: A region V bounded by the surface S=∂V= with the surface normal n Suppose V is a subset of Rnℝ^n (in the case of n = 3, V represents a volume in three-dimensional space) which is compact and has a piecewise smooth boundary S (also indicated with ∂V=S=S). If F is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of V, then:[4][5] ∭V(∇⋅F)dV=∭_V(∇·𝐅) dV= S (F⋅n^)dS.(𝐅·𝐧̂) dS. The left side is a volume integral over the volume V, the right side is the surface integral over the boundary of the volume V. The closed manifold ∂V is oriented by outward-pointing normals, and n^𝐧̂ is the outward pointing unit normal at each point on the boundary ∂V. (dSd𝐒 may be used as a shorthand for ndS𝐧dS.) In terms of the intuitive description above, the left-hand side of the equation represents the total of the sources in the volume V, and the right-hand side represents the total flow across the boundary S.
