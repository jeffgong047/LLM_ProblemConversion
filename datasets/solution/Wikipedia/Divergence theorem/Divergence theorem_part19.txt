dimensions: One can use the generalised Stokes' theorem to equate the n-dimensional volume integral of the divergence of a vector field F over a region U to the (n − 1)-dimensional surface integral of F over the boundary of U: ∫⋯∫U⏟n∇⋅FdV=∮⋯∮∂U⏟n−1F⋅ndS∫⋯∫_U_n∇·𝐅 dV=∮_⋯∮__n-1𝐅·𝐧 dS This equation is also known as the divergence theorem. When n = 2, this is equivalent to Green's theorem. When n = 1, it reduces to the fundamental theorem of calculus, part 2. Tensor
