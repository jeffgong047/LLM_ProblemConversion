Corollaries: By replacing F in the divergence theorem with specific forms, other useful identities can be derived (cf. vector identities).[10] With F→Fg𝐅→𝐅g for a scalar function g and a vector field F, ∭V[F⋅(∇g)+g(∇⋅F)]dV=∭_V[𝐅·()+g(∇·𝐅)]dV= S gF⋅ndS.𝐅·𝐧dS. A special case of this is F=∇f𝐅=, in which case the theorem is the basis for Green's identities. With F→F×G𝐅→𝐅×𝐆 for two vector fields F and G, where ×× denotes a cross product, ∭V∇⋅(F×G)dV=∭V[G⋅(∇×F)−F⋅(∇×G)]dV=∭_V∇·(𝐅×𝐆)dV=∭_V[𝐆·(∇×𝐅)-𝐅·(∇×𝐆)] dV= S (F×G)⋅ndS.(𝐅×𝐆)·𝐧dS. With F→F⋅G𝐅→𝐅·𝐆 for two vector fields F and G, where ⋅· denotes a dot product, ∭V∇(F⋅G)dV=∭V[F⋅(∇⋅G)+(∇⋅F)⋅G]dV=∭_V∇(𝐅·𝐆)dV=∭_V[𝐅·(∇·𝐆)+(∇·𝐅)·𝐆] dV= S (F⋅G)⋅ndS.(𝐅·𝐆)·𝐧dS. With F→fc𝐅𝐜 for a scalar function f and vector field c:[11] ∭Vc⋅∇fdV=∭_V𝐜· dV= S (cf)⋅ndS−∭Vf(∇⋅c)dV.(𝐜f)·𝐧dS-∭_Vf(∇·𝐜) dV. The last term on the right vanishes for constant c𝐜 or any divergence free (solenoidal) vector field, e.g. Incompressible flows without sources or sinks such as phase change or chemical reactions etc. In particular, taking c𝐜 to be constant: ∭V∇fdV=∭_V dV= S fndS.𝐧dS. With F→c×F𝐅→𝐜×𝐅 for vector field F and constant vector c:[11] ∭Vc⋅(∇×F)dV=∭_V𝐜·(∇×𝐅) dV= S (F×c)⋅ndS.(𝐅×𝐜)·𝐧dS. By reordering the triple product on the right hand side and taking out the constant vector of the integral, ∭V(∇×F)dV⋅c=∭_V(∇×𝐅) dV·𝐜= S (dS×F)⋅c.(d𝐒×𝐅)·𝐜. Hence, ∭V(∇×F)dV=∭_V(∇×𝐅) dV= S n×FdS.𝐧×𝐅dS.
