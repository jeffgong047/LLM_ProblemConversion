Mathematical theorem In mathematics, Solèr's theorem is a result concerning certain infinite-dimensional vector spaces. It states that any orthomodular form that has an infinite orthonormal sequence is a Hilbert space over the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions.[1][2] Originally proved by Maria Pia Solèr, the result is significant for quantum logic[3][4] and the foundations of quantum mechanics.[5][6] In particular, Solèr's theorem helps to fill a gap in the effort to use Gleason's theorem to rederive quantum mechanics from information-theoretic postulates.[7][8] It is also an important step in the Heunen-Kornell axiomatisation of the category of Hilbert spaces.[9] Physicist John C. Baez notes,Nothing in the assumptions mentions the continuum: the hypotheses are purely algebraic. It therefore seems quite magical that [the division ring over which the Hilbert space is defined] is forced to be the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions.[6]Writing a decade after Solèr's original publication, Pitowsky calls her theorem "celebrated".[7]
