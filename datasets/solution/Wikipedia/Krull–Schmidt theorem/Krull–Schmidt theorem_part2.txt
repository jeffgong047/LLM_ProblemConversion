Definitions: We say that a group G satisfies the ascending chain condition (ACC) on subgroups if every sequence of subgroups of G: 1=G0≤G1≤G2≤⋯1=G_0_1_2≤⋯ is eventually constant, i.e., there exists N such that GN = GN+1 = GN+2 = ... . We say that G satisfies the ACC on normal subgroups if every such sequence of normal subgroups of G eventually becomes constant. Likewise, one can define the descending chain condition on (normal) subgroups, by looking at all decreasing sequences of (normal) subgroups: G=G0≥G1≥G2≥⋯.=G_0_1_2≥⋯. Clearly, all finite groups satisfy both ACC and DCC on subgroups. The infinite cyclic group Z𝐙 satisfies ACC but not DCC, since (2) > (2)2 > (2)3 > ... is an infinite decreasing sequence of subgroups. On the other hand, the p∞^∞-torsion part of Q/Z𝐐/𝐙 (the quasicyclic p-group) satisfies DCC but not ACC. We say a group G is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct product of non-trivial subgroups G = H × K.
