modules: If E≠0≠0 is a module that satisfies the ACC and DCC on submodules (that is, it is both Noetherian and Artinian or – equivalently – of finite length), then E is a direct sum of indecomposable modules. Up to a permutation, the indecomposable components in such a direct sum are uniquely determined up to isomorphism.[4] In general, the theorem fails if one only assumes that the module is Noetherian or Artinian.[5]
