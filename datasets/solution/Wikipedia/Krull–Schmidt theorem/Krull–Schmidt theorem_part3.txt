Statement: If G is a group that satisfies either ACC or DCC on normal subgroups, then there is exactly one way of writing G as a direct product G1×G2×⋯×Gk_1_2×⋯_k of finitely many indecomposable subgroups of G. Here, uniqueness means direct decompositions into indecomposable subgroups have the exchange property. That is: suppose G=H1×H2×⋯×Hl=H_1_2×⋯_l is another expression of G as a product of indecomposable subgroups. Then k=l=l and there is a reindexing of the Hi_i's satisfying Gi_i and Hi_i are isomorphic for each i; G=G1×⋯×Gr×Hr+1×⋯×Hl=G_1×⋯_r_r+1×⋯_l for each r.
