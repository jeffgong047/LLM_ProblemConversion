Examples: Orthographic projections and Schlegel diagrams with Hamiltonian cycles of the vertices of the five platonic solids – only the octahedron has an Eulerian path or cycle, by extending its path with the dotted one vte A complete graph with more than two vertices is Hamiltonian Every cycle graph is Hamiltonian Every tournament has an odd number of Hamiltonian paths (Rédei 1934) Every platonic solid, considered as a graph, is Hamiltonian[5] The Cayley graph of a finite Coxeter group is Hamiltonian (For more information on Hamiltonian paths in Cayley graphs, see the Lovász conjecture.) Cayley graphs on nilpotent groups with cyclic commutator subgroup are Hamiltonian.[6] The flip graph of a convex polygon or equivalently, the rotation graph of binary trees, is Hamiltonian.[7][8]
