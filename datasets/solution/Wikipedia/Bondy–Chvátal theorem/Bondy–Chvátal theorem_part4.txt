Properties: The Herschel graph is the smallest possible polyhedral graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. A possible Hamiltonian path is shown. Any Hamiltonian cycle can be converted to a Hamiltonian path by removing one of its edges, but a Hamiltonian path can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle only if its endpoints are adjacent. All Hamiltonian graphs are biconnected, but a biconnected graph need not be Hamiltonian (see, for example, the Petersen graph).[9] An Eulerian graph G (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree) necessarily has an Euler tour, a closed walk passing through each edge of G exactly once. This tour corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the line graph L(G), so the line graph of every Eulerian graph is Hamiltonian. Line graphs may have other Hamiltonian cycles that do not correspond to Euler tours, and in particular the line graph L(G) of every Hamiltonian graph G is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether the graph G is Eulerian.[10] A tournament (with more than two vertices) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is strongly connected. The number of different Hamiltonian cycles in a complete undirected graph on n vertices is (n – 1)!/2 and in a complete directed graph on n vertices is (n – 1)!. These counts assume that cycles that are the same apart from their starting point are not counted separately. Bondy–Chvátal
