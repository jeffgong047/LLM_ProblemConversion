In mathematics, the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem, proved by Ramanujan and checked by Hardy[1] states  that the normal order of the number ω(n) of distinct prime factors of a number n is log(log(n)).
Roughly speaking, this means that most numbers have about this number of distinct prime factors.


Precise statement[edit]
A more precise version states that for every real-valued function ψ(n) that tends to infinity as n tends to infinity

|ω(n)−log⁡log⁡n|<ψ(n)log⁡log⁡n|ω(n)-log|<ψ(n)√(log)
or more traditionally

|ω(n)−log⁡log⁡n|<(log⁡log⁡n)12+ε|ω(n)-log|<(log)^1/2+ε
for almost all (all but an infinitesimal proportion of) integers.  That is, let g(x) be the number of positive integers n less than x for which the above inequality fails: then g(x)/x converges to zero as x goes to infinity.

History[edit]
A simple proof to the result Turán (1934) was given by Pál Turán, who used the Turán sieve to prove that

∑n≤x|ω(n)−log⁡log⁡x|2≪xlog⁡log⁡x.∑_n|ω(n)-log|^2log
Generalizations[edit]
The same results are true of Ω(n), the number of prime factors of n counted with multiplicity.
This theorem is generalized by the Erdős–Kac theorem, which shows that ω(n) is essentially normally distributed.
