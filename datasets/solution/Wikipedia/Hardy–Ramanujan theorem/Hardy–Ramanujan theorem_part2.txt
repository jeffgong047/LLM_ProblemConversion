statement: A more precise version states that for every real-valued function ψ(n) that tends to infinity as n tends to infinity |ω(n)−log⁡log⁡n|<ψ(n)log⁡log⁡n|ω(n)-log|<ψ(n)√(log) or more traditionally |ω(n)−log⁡log⁡n|<(log⁡log⁡n)12+ε|ω(n)-log|<(log)^1/2+ε for almost all (all but an infinitesimal proportion of) integers. That is, let g(x) be the number of positive integers n less than x for which the above inequality fails: then g(x)/x converges to zero as x goes to infinity.
