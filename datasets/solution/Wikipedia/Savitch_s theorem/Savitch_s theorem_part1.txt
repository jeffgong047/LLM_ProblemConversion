Relation between deterministic and nondeterministic space complexity In computational complexity theory, Savitch's theorem, proved by Walter Savitch in 1970, gives a relationship between deterministic and non-deterministic space complexity. It states that for any function f∈Ω(log⁡(n))∈Ω(log(n)), NSPACE(f(n))⊆DSPACE(f(n)2).𝖭𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(f(n))⊆𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(f(n)^2). In other words, if a nondeterministic Turing machine can solve a problem using f(n)(n) space, a deterministic Turing machine can solve the same problem in the square of that space bound.[1] Although it seems that nondeterminism may produce exponential gains in time (as formalized in the unproven exponential time hypothesis), Savitch's theorem shows that it has a markedly more limited effect on space requirements.[2]
