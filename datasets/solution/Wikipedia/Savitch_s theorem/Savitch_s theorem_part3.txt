Corollaries: Some important corollaries of the theorem include: PSPACE = NPSPACE That is, the languages that can be recognized by deterministic polynomial-space Turing machines and nondeterministic polynomial-space Turing machines are the same. This follows directly from the fact that the square of a polynomial function is still a polynomial function. It is believed that a similar relationship does not exist between the polynomial time complexity classes, P and NP, although this is still an open question. NL ⊆ L2 That is, all languages that can be solved nondeterministically in logarithmic space can be solved deterministically in the complexity class L2=DSPACE((log⁡n)2).𝖫^2=𝖣𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(()^2). This follows from the fact that STCON is NL-complete. See
