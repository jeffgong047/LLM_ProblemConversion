Statement: Hilbert's syzygy theorem states that, if M is a finitely generated module over a polynomial ring k[x1,…,xn][x_1,…,x_n] in n indeterminates over a field k, then the nth syzygy module of M is always a free module. In modern language, this implies that the projective dimension of M is at most n, and thus that there exists a free resolution 0⟶Lk⟶Lk−1⟶⋯⟶L0⟶M⟶00_k_k-1⟶⋯_0⟶0 of length k ≤ n. This upper bound on the projective dimension is sharp, that is, there are modules of projective dimension exactly n. The standard example is the field k, which may be considered as a k[x1,…,xn][x_1,…,x_n]-module by setting xic=0_ic=0 for every i and every c ∈ k. For this module, the nth syzygy module is free, but not the (n − 1)th one (for a proof, see § Koszul complex, below). The theorem is also true for modules that are not finitely generated. As the global dimension of a ring is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules, Hilbert's syzygy theorem may be restated as: the global dimension of k[x1,…,xn][x_1,…,x_n] is n. Low
