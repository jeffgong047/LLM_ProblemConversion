regularity: One might wonder which ring-theoretic property of A=k[x1,…,xn]=k[x_1,…,x_n] causes the Hilbert syzygy theorem to hold. It turns out that this is regularity, which is an algebraic formulation of the fact that affine n-space is a variety without singularities. In fact the following generalization holds: Let A be a Noetherian ring. Then A has finite global dimension if and only if A is regular and the Krull dimension of A is finite; in that case the global dimension of A is equal to the Krull dimension. This result may be proven using Serre's theorem on regular local rings. See
