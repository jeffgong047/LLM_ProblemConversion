(relations): Main article: syzygy (mathematics) Originally, Hilbert defined syzygies for ideals in polynomial rings, but the concept generalizes trivially to (left) modules over any ring. Given a generating set g1,…,gk_1,…,g_k of a module M over a ring R, a relation or first syzygy between the generators is a k-tuple (a1,…,ak)(a_1,…,a_k) of elements of R such that[2] a1g1+⋯+akgk=0._1g_1+⋯+a_kg_k=0. Let L0_0 be a free module with basis (G1,…,Gk).(G_1,…,G_k). The k-tuple (a1,…,ak)(a_1,…,a_k) may be identified with the element a1G1+⋯+akGk,_1G_1+⋯+a_kG_k, and the relations form the kernel R1_1 of the linear map L0→M_0 defined by Gi↦gi._i_i. In other words, one has an exact sequence 0→R1→L0→M→0.0_1_0→0. This first syzygy module R1_1 depends on the choice of a generating set, but, if S1_1 is the module which is obtained with another generating set, there exist two free modules F1_1 and F2_2 such that R1⊕F1≅S1⊕F2_1_1_1_2 where ⊕⊕ denote the direct sum of modules. The second syzygy module is the module of the relations between generators of the first syzygy module. By continuing in this way, one may define the kth syzygy module for every positive integer k. If the kth syzygy module is free for some k, then by taking a basis as a generating set, the next syzygy module (and every subsequent one) is the zero module. If one does not take a basis as a generating set, then all subsequent syzygy modules are free. Let n be the smallest integer, if any, such that the nth syzygy module of a module M is free or projective. The above property of invariance, up to the sum direct with free modules, implies that n does not depend on the choice of generating sets. The projective dimension of M is this integer, if it exists, or ∞ if not. This is equivalent with the existence of an exact sequence 0⟶Rn⟶Ln−1⟶⋯⟶L0⟶M⟶0,0_n_n-1⟶⋯_0⟶0, where the modules Li_i are free and Rn_n is projective. It can be shown that one may always choose the generating sets for Rn_n being free, that is for the above exact sequence to be a free resolution.
