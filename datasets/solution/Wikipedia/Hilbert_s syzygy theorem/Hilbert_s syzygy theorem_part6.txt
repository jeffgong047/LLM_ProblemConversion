complex: The Koszul complex, also called "complex of exterior algebra", allows, in some cases, an explicit description of all syzygy modules. Let g1,…,gk_1,…,g_k be a generating system of an ideal I in a polynomial ring R=k[x1,…,xn]=k[x_1,…,x_n], and let L1_1 be a free module of basis G1,…,Gk._1,…,G_k. The exterior algebra of L1_1 is the direct sum Λ(L1)=⨁t=0kLt,Λ(L_1)=⊕_t=0^kL_t, where Lt_t is the free module, which has, as a basis, the exterior products Gi1∧⋯∧Git,_i_1∧⋯_i_t, such that i1<i2<⋯<it._1<i_2<⋯<i_t. In particular, one has L0=R_0=R (because of the definition of the empty product), the two definitions of L1_1 coincide, and Lt=0_t=0 for t > k. For every positive t, one may define a linear map Lt→Lt−1_t_t-1 by Gi1∧⋯∧Git↦∑j=1t(−1)j+1gijGi1∧⋯∧G^ij∧⋯∧Git,_i_1∧⋯_i_t↦∑_j=1^t(-1)^j+1g_i_jG_i_1∧⋯∧G_i_j∧⋯_i_t, where the hat means that the factor is omitted. A straightforward computation shows that the composition of two consecutive such maps is zero, and thus that one has a complex 0→Lt→Lt−1→⋯→L1→L0→R/I.0_t_t-1→⋯_1_0/I. This is the Koszul complex. In general the Koszul complex is not an exact sequence, but it is an exact sequence if one works with a polynomial ring R=k[x1,…,xn]=k[x_1,…,x_n] and an ideal generated by a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials. In particular, the sequence x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n is regular, and the Koszul complex is thus a projective resolution of k=R/⟨x1,…,xn⟩.=R/_1,…,x_n⟩. In this case, the nth syzygy module is free of dimension one (generated by the product of all Gi_i); the (n − 1)th syzygy module is thus the quotient of a free module of dimension n by the submodule generated by (x1,−x2,…,±xn).(x_1,-x_2,…,_n). This quotient may not be a projective module, as otherwise, there would exist polynomials pi_i such that p1x1+⋯+pnxn=1,_1x_1+⋯+p_nx_n=1, which is impossible (substituting 0 for the xi_i in the latter equality provides 1 = 0). This proves that the projective dimension of k=R/⟨x1,…,xn⟩=R/_1,…,x_n⟩ is exactly n. The same proof applies for proving that the projective dimension of k[x1,…,xn]/⟨g1,…,gt⟩[x_1,…,x_n]/_1,…,g_t⟩ is exactly t if the gi_i form a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.
