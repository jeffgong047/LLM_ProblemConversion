theorem: We generally follow Wesseling (2001). Aside Assume a continuum problem described by a PDE is to be computed using a numerical scheme based upon a uniform computational grid and a one-step, constant step-size, M grid point, integration algorithm, either implicit or explicit. Then if xj=jΔx_j=j and tn=nΔt^n=n , such a scheme can be described by ∑m=1Mβmφj+mn+1=∑m=1Mαmφj+mn.∑_m=1^Mβ_mφ_j+m^n+1=∑_m=1^Mα_mφ_j+m^n. (1) In other words, the solution φjn+1φ_j^n+1 at time n+1+1 and location j is a linear function of the solution at the previous time step n. We assume that βmβ_m determines φjn+1φ_j^n+1 uniquely. Now, since the above equation represents a linear relationship between φjnφ_j^n and φjn+1φ_j^n+1 we can perform a linear transformation to obtain the following equivalent form, φjn+1=∑mMγmφj+mn.φ_j^n+1=∑_m^Mγ_mφ_j+m^n. (2) Theorem 1: Monotonicity preserving The above scheme of equation (2) is monotonicity preserving if and only if γm≥0,∀m.γ_m≥0, . (3) Proof - Godunov (1959) Case 1: (sufficient condition) Assume (3) applies and that φjnφ_j^n is monotonically increasing with j. Then, because φjn≤φj+1n≤⋯≤φj+mnφ_j^n≤φ_j+1^n≤⋯≤φ_j+m^n it therefore follows that φjn+1≤φj+1n+1≤⋯≤φj+mn+1φ_j^n+1≤φ_j+1^n+1≤⋯≤φ_j+m^n+1 because φjn+1−φj−1n+1=∑mMγm(φj+mn−φj+m−1n)≥0.φ_j^n+1-φ_j-1^n+1=∑_m^Mγ_m(φ_j+m^n-φ_j+m-1^n)≥0. (4) This means that monotonicity is preserved for this case. Case 2: (necessary condition) We prove the necessary condition by contradiction. Assume that γp<0γ_p^<0 for some p and choose the following monotonically increasing φjnφ_j^n , φin=0,i<k;φin=1,i≥k.φ_i^n=0,<k; φ_i^n=1,. (5) Then from equation (2) we get φjn+1−φj−1n+1=∑mMγm(φj+mn−φj+m−1n)=0,j+m≠kγm,j+m=kφ_j^n+1-φ_j-1^n+1=∑_m^Mγ_m(φ_j+m^n-φ_j+m-1^n)=0, j+m γ_m, j+m=k (6) Now choose j=k−p=k-p, to give φk−pn+1−φk−p−1n+1=γp(φkn−φk−1n)<0,φ_k-p^n+1-φ_k-p-1^n+1=γ_p(φ_k^n-φ_k-1^n)<0, (7) which implies that φjn+1φ_j^n+1 is NOT increasing, and we have a contradiction. Thus, monotonicity is NOT preserved for γp<0γ_p<0, which completes the proof. Theorem 2: Godunov’s Order Barrier Theorem Linear one-step second-order accurate numerical schemes for the convection equation ∂φ∂t+c∂φ∂x=0,t>0,x∈R∂φ+c∂φ=0,>0,∈ℝ (10) cannot be monotonicity preserving unless σ=|c|ΔtΔx∈N,σ=|c|∈ℕ, (11) where σσ is the signed Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL) number. Proof - Godunov (1959) Assume a numerical scheme of the form described by equation (2) and choose φ(0,x)=(xΔx−12)2−14,φj0=(j−12)2−14.φ(0,x)=(x-12)^2-14, φ_j^0=(j-12)^2-14. (12) The exact solution is φ(t,x)=(x−ctΔx−12)2−14.φ(t,x)=(x-ct-12)^2-14. (13) If we assume the scheme to be at least second-order accurate, it should produce the following solution exactly φj1=(j−σ−12)2−14,φj0=(j−12)2−14.φ_j^1=(j-σ-12)^2-14, φ_j^0=(j-12)^2-14. (14) Substituting into equation (2) gives: (j−σ−12)2−14=∑mMγm(j+m−12)2−14.(j-σ-12)^2-14=∑_m^Mγ_m{(j+m-12)^2-14}. (15) Suppose that the scheme IS monotonicity preserving, then according to the theorem 1 above, γm≥0γ_m≥0. Now, it is clear from equation (15) that (j−σ−12)2−14≥0,∀j.(j-σ-12)^2-14≥0, . (16) Assume σ>0,σ∉Nσ>0, σ∉ℕ and choose j such that j>σ>(j−1)>σ>(j-1). This implies that (j−σ)>0(j-σ)>0 and (j−σ−1)<0(j-σ-1)<0. It therefore follows that, (j−σ−12)2−14=(j−σ)(j−σ−1)<0,(j-σ-12)^2-14=(j-σ)(j-σ-1)<0, (17) which contradicts equation (16) and completes the proof. The exceptional situation whereby σ=|c|ΔtΔx∈Nσ=|c|∈ℕ is only of theoretical interest, since this cannot be realised with variable coefficients. Also, integer CFL numbers greater than unity would not be feasible for practical problems. See
