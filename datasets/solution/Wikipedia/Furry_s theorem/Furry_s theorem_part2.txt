Theory: Quantum electrodynamics has a number of symmetries, one of them being the discrete symmetry of charge conjugation. This acts on fields through a unitary charge conjugation operator C which anticommutes with the photon field Aμ(x)_μ(x) as CAμ(x)C†=−Aμ(x)^μ(x)C^†=-A^μ(x), while leaving the vacuum state invariant C|Ω⟩=|Ω⟩|Ω⟩=|Ω⟩. Considering the simplest case of the correlation function of a single photon operator gives ⟨Ω|Aμ(x)|Ω⟩=⟨Ω|C†CAμ(x)C†C|Ω⟩=−⟨Ω|Aμ(x)|Ω⟩,⟨Ω|A^μ(x)|Ω⟩=⟨Ω|C^†CA^μ(x)C^†C|Ω⟩=-⟨Ω|A^μ(x)|Ω⟩, so this correlation function must vanish.[2] For n photon operators, this argument shows that under charge conjugation this picks up a factor of (−1)n(-1)^n and thus vanishes when n is odd. More generally, since the charge conjugation operator also anticommutes with the vector current jμ(x)^μ(x), Furry's theorem states that the correlation function of any odd number of on-shell or off-shell photon fields and/or currents must vanish in quantum electrodynamics. Since the theorem holds at the non-perturbative level, it must also hold at each order in perturbation theory.[3] At leading order this means that any fermion loop with an odd number of vertices must have a vanishing contribution to the amplitude. An explicit calculation of these diagrams reveals that this is because the diagram with a fermion going clockwise around the loop cancels with the second diagram where the fermion goes anticlockwise. The vanishing of the three vertex loop can also be seen as a consequence of the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics since the bare Lagrangian does not have any counterterms involving three photons.[4] Applications and
