Theorem: The second theorem states that local broadcasting is only possible when the state is a classical probability distribution.[3] This means that a state can only be broadcast locally if it does not have any quantum correlations.[4] Luo reconciled this theorem with the generalized no-broadcast theorem by making the conjecture that when a state is a classical-quantum state, correlations (rather than the state itself) in a bipartite state can be locally broadcast.[3] By mathematically proving that his conjecture and the two theorems all relate to and imply one another, Luo proved that all three statements are logically equivalent.[3] See
