Theorem: The generalized quantum no-broadcasting theorem, originally proven by Barnum, Caves, Fuchs, Jozsa and Schumacher for mixed states of finite-dimensional quantum systems,[1] says that given a pair of quantum states which do not commute, there is no method capable of taking a single copy of either state and succeeding, no matter which state was supplied and without incorporating knowledge of which state has been supplied, in producing a state such that one part of it is the same as the original state and the other part is also the same as the original state. That is, given an initial unknown state ρi,ρ_i, drawn from the set ρii∈1,2{ρ_i}_i∈{1,2} such that [ρ1,ρ2]≠0[ρ_1,ρ_2]≠0, there is no process (using physical means independent of those used to select the state) guaranteed to create a state ρABρ_AB in a Hilbert space HA⊗HB_A_B whose partial traces are TrA⁡ρAB=ρiTr_Aρ_AB=ρ_i and TrB⁡ρAB=ρiTr_Bρ_AB=ρ_i. Such a process was termed broadcasting in that paper. No-Local-Broadcasting
