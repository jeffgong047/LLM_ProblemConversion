theory: The complexity of finding the point guaranteed by Minkowski's theorem, or the closely related Blichfeldt's theorem, have been studied from the perspective of TFNP search problems. In particular, it is known that a computational analogue of Blichfeldt's theorem, a corollary of the proof of Minkowski's theorem, is PPP-complete.[3] It is also known that the computational analogue of Minkowski's theorem is in the class PPP, and it was conjectured to be PPP complete.[4] See
