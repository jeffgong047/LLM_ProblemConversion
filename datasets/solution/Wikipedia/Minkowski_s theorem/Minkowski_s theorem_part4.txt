Proof: The following argument proves Minkowski's theorem for the specific case of L = ℤ2. Proof of the Z2ℤ^2 case: Consider the map f:S→R2/2L,(x,y)↦(xmod2,ymod2):S→ℝ^2/2L, (x,y)↦(x2,y2) Intuitively, this map cuts the plane into 2 by 2 squares, then stacks the squares on top of each other. Clearly f (S) has area less than or equal to 4, because this set lies within a 2 by 2 square. Assume for a contradiction that f could be injective, which means the pieces of S cut out by the squares stack up in a non-overlapping way. Because f is locally area-preserving, this non-overlapping property would make it area-preserving for all of S, so the area of f (S) would be the same as that of S, which is greater than 4. That is not the case, so the assumption must be false: f is not injective, meaning that there exist at least two distinct points p1, p2 in S that are mapped by f to the same point: f (p1) = f (p2). Because of the way f was defined, the only way that f (p1) can equal f (p2) is for p2 to equal p1 + (2i, 2j) for some integers i and j, not both zero. That is, the coordinates of the two points differ by two even integers. Since S is symmetric about the origin, −p1 is also a point in S. Since S is convex, the line segment between −p1 and p2 lies entirely in S, and in particular the midpoint of that segment lies in S. In other words, 12(−p1+p2)=12(−p1+p1+(2i,2j))=(i,j)12(-p_1+p_2)=12(-p_1+p_1+(2i,2j))=(i,j) is a point in S. But this point (i, j) is an integer point, and is not the origin since i and j are not both zero. Therefore, S contains a nonzero integer point. Remarks: The argument above proves the theorem that any set of volume >det(L)>(L) contains two distinct points that differ by a lattice vector. This is a special case of Blichfeldt's theorem.[1] The argument above highlights that the term 2ndet(L)2^n(L) is the covolume of the lattice 2L2L. To obtain a proof for general lattices, it suffices to prove Minkowski's theorem only for Znℤ^n; this is because every full-rank lattice can be written as BZnℤ^n for some linear transformation B, and the properties of being convex and symmetric about the origin are preserved by linear transformations, while the covolume of BZnℤ^n is |det(B)||(B)| and volume of a body scales by exactly 1det(B)1/(B) under an application of B−1^-1.
