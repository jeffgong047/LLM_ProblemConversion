squares: The difficult implication in Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares can be proven using Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector. Theorem: Every prime with p≡1mod4≡14 can be written as a sum of two squares. Proof Since 4|p−14 | p-1 and aa is a quadratic residue modulo a prime p if and only if ap−12=1(modp)a^p-1/2=1 (mod p) (Euler's Criterion) there is a square root of −1-1 in Z/pZℤ/pℤ; choose one and call one representative in Zℤ for it j. Consider the lattice L defined by the vectors (1,j),(0,p)(1,j),(0,p), and let B denote the associated matrix. The determinant of this lattice is p, whence Minkowski's bound tells us that there is a nonzero x=(x1,x2)∈Z2=(x_1,x_2)∈ℤ^2 with 0<‖Bx‖22<2p0<Bx_2^2<2p. We have ‖Bx‖2=‖(x1,jx1+px2)‖2=x12+(jx1+px2)2Bx^2=(x_1,jx_1+px_2)^2=x_1^2+(jx_1+px_2)^2 and we define the integers a=x1,b=(jx1+px2)=x_1,b=(jx_1+px_2). Minkowski's bound tells us that 0<a2+b2<2p0<a^2+b^2<2p, and simple modular arithmetic shows that a2+b2=x12+(jx1+px2)2=0modp^2+b^2=x_1^2+(jx_1+px_2)^2=0, and thus we conclude that a2+b2=p^2+b^2=p. Q.E.D. Additionally, the lattice perspective gives a computationally efficient approach to Fermat's theorem on sums of squares: Algorithm First, recall that finding any nonzero vector with norm less than 2p2p in L, the lattice of the proof, gives a decomposition of p as a sum of two squares. Such vectors can be found efficiently, for instance using LLL-algorithm. In particular, if b1,b2_1,b_2 is a 3/43/4-LLL reduced basis, then, by the property that ‖b1‖≤(1δ−.25)n−14det(B)1/nb_1≤(1/δ-.25)^n-1/4det(B)^1/n, ‖b1‖2≤2p<2pb_1^2≤√(2)p<2p. Thus, by running the LLL-lattice basis reduction algorithm with δ=3/4δ=3/4, we obtain a decomposition of p as a sum of squares. Note that because every vector in L has norm squared a multiple of p, the vector returned by the LLL-algorithm in this case is in fact a shortest vector. Lagrange's four-square
