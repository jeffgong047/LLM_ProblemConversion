vector: Minkowski's theorem gives an upper bound for the length of the shortest nonzero vector. This result has applications in lattice cryptography and number theory. Theorem (Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector): Let L be a lattice. Then there is a x∈L∖0∖{0} with ‖x‖∞≤|det(L)|1/nx_∞≤|(L)|^1/n. In particular, by the standard comparison between l2_2 and l∞_∞ norms, ‖x‖2≤n|det(L)|1/nx_2≤√(n) |(L)|^1/n. Proof Let l=min‖x‖∞:x∈L∖0=min{x_∞:x∖{0}}, and set C=y:‖y‖∞<l={y:y_∞<l}. Then vol(C)=(2l)nvol(C)=(2l)^n. If (2l)n>2n|d(L)|(2l)^n>2^n|d(L)|, then C contains a non-zero lattice point, which is a contradiction. Thus l≤|d(L)|1/n≤|d(L)|^1/n. Q.E.D. Remarks: The constant in the L2^2 bound can be improved, for instance by taking the open ball of radius <l<l as C in the above argument. The optimal constant is known as the Hermite constant. The bound given by the theorem can be very loose, as can be seen by considering the lattice generated by (1,0),(0,n)(1,0),(0,n). Even though Minkowski's theorem guarantees a short lattice vector within a certain magnitude bound, finding this vector is in general a hard computational problem. Finding the vector within a factor guaranteed by Minkowski's bound is referred to as Minkowski's Vector Problem (MVP), and it is known that approximation SVP reduces to it using transference properties of the dual lattice. The computational problem is also sometimes referred to as HermiteSVP.[2] The LLL-basis reduction algorithm can be seen as a weak but efficiently algorithmic version of Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector. This is because a δδ-LLL reduced basis b1,…,bn_1,…,b_n for L has the property that ‖b1‖≤(1δ−.25)n−14det(L)1/nb_1≤(1/δ-.25)^n-1/4(L)^1/n; see these lecture notes of Micciancio for more on this. As explained in,[2] proofs of bounds on the Hermite constant contain some of the key ideas in the LLL-reduction algorithm. Applications to number
