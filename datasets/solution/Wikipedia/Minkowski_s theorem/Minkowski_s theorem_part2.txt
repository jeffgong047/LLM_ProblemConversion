Formulation: Suppose that L is a lattice of determinant d(L) in the n-dimensional real vector space ℝn and S is a convex subset of ℝn that is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning that if x is in S then −x is also in S. Minkowski's theorem states that if the volume of S is strictly greater than 2n d(L), then S must contain at least one lattice point other than the origin. (Since the set S is symmetric, it would then contain at least three lattice points: the origin 0 and a pair of points ± x, where x ∈ L \ 0.)
