In physics, Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and  non-collinear vectors, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding vectors. According to the theorem,

Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γA/sinα=B/sinβ=C/sinγ
where A, B and C are the magnitudes of the three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear vectors, VA,VB,VC_A,V_B,V_C, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and α, β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the vectors.[1]


Lami's theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems.  The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy.[2]


Proof[edit]
As the vectors must balance VA+VB+VC=0_A+V_B+V_C=0, hence by making all the vectors touch its tip and tail the result is a triangle with sides A, B, C and angles 180o−α,180o−β,180o−γ.180^o-α,180^o-β,180^o-γ. By the law of sines then[1]
Asin⁡(180o−α)=Bsin⁡(180o−β)=Csin⁡(180o−γ).A/sin(180^o-α)=B/sin(180^o-β)=C/sin(180^o-γ).
Then by applying that for any angle θθ, sin⁡(180o−θ)=sin⁡θsin(180^o-θ)=sinθ, and the result is
Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γ.A/sinα=B/sinβ=C/sinγ.
