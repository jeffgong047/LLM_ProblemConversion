In physics, Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear vectors, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding vectors. According to the theorem, Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γA/sinα=B/sinβ=C/sinγ where A, B and C are the magnitudes of the three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear vectors, VA,VB,VC_A,V_B,V_C, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and α, β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the vectors.[1] Lami's theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems. The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy.[2]
