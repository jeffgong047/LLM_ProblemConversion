Proof: As the vectors must balance VA+VB+VC=0_A+V_B+V_C=0, hence by making all the vectors touch its tip and tail the result is a triangle with sides A, B, C and angles 180o−α,180o−β,180o−γ.180^o-α,180^o-β,180^o-γ. By the law of sines then[1] Asin⁡(180o−α)=Bsin⁡(180o−β)=Csin⁡(180o−γ).A/sin(180^o-α)=B/sin(180^o-β)=C/sin(180^o-γ). Then by applying that for any angle θθ, sin⁡(180o−θ)=sin⁡θsin(180^o-θ)=sinθ, and the result is Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γ.A/sinα=B/sinβ=C/sinγ. See
