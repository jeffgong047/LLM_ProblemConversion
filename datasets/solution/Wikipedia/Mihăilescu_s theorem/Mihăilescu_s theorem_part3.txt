conjecture: Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does each positive integer occur only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers? (more unsolved problems in mathematics) Pillai's conjecture concerns a general difference of perfect powers (sequence A001597 in the OEIS): it is an open problem initially proposed by S. S. Pillai, who conjectured that the gaps in the sequence of perfect powers tend to infinity. This is equivalent to saying that each positive integer occurs only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers: more generally, in 1931 Pillai conjectured that for fixed positive integers A, B, C the equation Axn−Bym=C^n-By^m=C has only finitely many solutions (x, y, m, n) with (m, n) ≠ (2, 2). Pillai proved that the difference |Axn−Bym|≫xλn|Ax^n-By^m|^ for any λ less than 1, uniformly in m and n.[7] The general conjecture would follow from the ABC conjecture.[7][8] Paul Erdős conjectured[citation needed] that the ascending sequence (an)n∈N(a_n)_n∈ℕ of perfect powers satisfies an+1−an>nc_n+1-a_n>n^c for some positive constant c and all sufficiently large n. Pillai's conjecture means that for every natural number n, there are only finitely many pairs of perfect powers with difference n. The list below shows, for n ≤ 64, all solutions for perfect powers less than 1018, as OEIS: A076427. See also OEIS: A103953 for the smallest solution (> 0). n solutioncount numbers k such that k and k + nare both perfect powers n solutioncount numbers k such that k and k + nare both perfect powers 1 1 8 33 2 16, 256 2 1 25 34 0 none 3 2 1, 125 35 3 1, 289, 1296 4 3 4, 32, 121 36 2 64, 1728 5 2 4, 27 37 3 27, 324, 14348907 6 0 none 38 1 1331 7 5 1, 9, 25, 121, 32761 39 4 25, 361, 961, 10609 8 3 1, 8, 97336 40 4 9, 81, 216, 2704 9 4 16, 27, 216, 64000 41 3 8, 128, 400 10 1 2187 42 0 none 11 4 16, 25, 3125, 3364 43 1 441 12 2 4, 2197 44 3 81, 100, 125 13 3 36, 243, 4900 45 4 4, 36, 484, 9216 14 0 none 46 1 243 15 3 1, 49, 1295029 47 6 81, 169, 196, 529, 1681, 250000 16 3 9, 16, 128 48 4 1, 16, 121, 21904 17 7 8, 32, 64, 512, 79507, 140608, 143384152904 49 3 32, 576, 274576 18 3 9, 225, 343 50 0 none 19 5 8, 81, 125, 324, 503284356 51 2 49, 625 20 2 16, 196 52 1 144 21 2 4, 100 53 2 676, 24336 22 2 27, 2187 54 2 27, 289 23 4 4, 9, 121, 2025 55 3 9, 729, 175561 24 5 1, 8, 25, 1000, 542939080312 56 4 8, 25, 169, 5776 25 2 100, 144 57 3 64, 343, 784 26 3 1, 42849, 6436343 58 0 none 27 3 9, 169, 216 59 1 841 28 7 4, 8, 36, 100, 484, 50625, 131044 60 4 4, 196, 2515396, 2535525316 29 1 196 61 2 64, 900 30 1 6859 62 0 none 31 2 1, 225 63 4 1, 81, 961, 183250369 32 4 4, 32, 49, 7744 64 4 36, 64, 225, 512 See
