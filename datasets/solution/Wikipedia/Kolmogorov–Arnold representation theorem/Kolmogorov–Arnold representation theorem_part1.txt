Multivariate functions can be written using univariate functions and summing In real analysis and approximation theory, the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem (or superposition theorem) states that every multivariate continuous function f:[0,1]n→R[0,1]^n→ℝ can be represented as a superposition of the two-argument addition of continuous functions of one variable. It solved a more constrained, yet more general form of Hilbert's thirteenth problem.[1][2][3] The works of Vladimir Arnold and Andrey Kolmogorov established that if f is a multivariate continuous function, then f can be written as a finite composition of continuous functions of a single variable and the binary operation of addition.[4] More specifically, f(x)=f(x1,…,xn)=∑q=02nΦq(∑p=1nϕq,p(xp))(𝐱)=f(x_1,…,x_n)=∑_q=0^2nΦ_q(∑_p=1^nϕ_q,p(x_p)). where ϕq,p:[0,1]→Rϕ_q,p[0,1]→ℝ and Φq:R→RΦ_qℝ→ℝ. There are proofs with specific constructions.[5] In a sense, they showed that the only true multivariate function is the sum, since every other function can be written using univariate functions and summing.[6]: 180
