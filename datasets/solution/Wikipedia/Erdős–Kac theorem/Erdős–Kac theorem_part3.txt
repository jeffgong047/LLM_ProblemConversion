heuristic: Intuitively, Kac's heuristic for the result says that if n is a randomly chosen large integer, then the number of distinct prime factors of n is approximately normally distributed with mean and variance log log n. This comes from the fact that given a random natural number n, the events "the number n is divisible by some prime p" for each p are mutually independent. Now, denoting the event "the number n is divisible by p" by np_p, consider the following sum of indicator random variables: In2+In3+In5+In7+…_n_2+I_n_3+I_n_5+I_n_7+… This sum counts how many distinct prime factors our random natural number n has. It can be shown that this sum satisfies the Lindeberg condition, and therefore the Lindeberg central limit theorem guarantees that after appropriate rescaling, the above expression will be Gaussian. The actual proof of the theorem, due to Erdős, uses sieve theory to make rigorous the above intuition. Numerical
