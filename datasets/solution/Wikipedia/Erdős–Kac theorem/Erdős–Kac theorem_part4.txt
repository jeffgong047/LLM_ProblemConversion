examples: The Erdős–Kac theorem means that the construction of a number around one billion requires on average three primes. For example, 1,000,000,003 = 23 × 307 × 141623. The following table provides a numerical summary of the growth of the average number of distinct prime factors of a natural number n with increasing n. n Number of digits in n Average number of distinct primes Standard deviation 1,000 4 2 1.4 1,000,000,000 10 3 1.7 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 25 4 2 1065 66 5 2.2 109,566 9,567 10 3.2 10210,704,568 210,704,569 20 4.5 101022 1022 + 1 50 7.1 101044 1044 + 1 100 10 1010434 10434 + 1 1000 31.6 A spreading Gaussian distribution of distinct primes illustrating the Erdos-Kac theorem Around 12.6% of 10,000 digit numbers are constructed from 10 distinct prime numbers and around 68% are constructed from between 7 and 13 primes. A hollow sphere the size of the planet Earth filled with fine sand would have around 1033 grains. A volume the size of the observable universe would have around 1093 grains of sand. There might be room for 10185 quantum strings in such a universe. Numbers of this magnitude—with 186 digits—would require on average only 6 primes for construction. It is very difficult if not impossible to discover the Erdös-Kac theorem empirically, as the Gaussian only shows up when n starts getting to be around 1010010^100. More precisely, Rényi and Turán showed that the best possible uniform asymptotic bound on the error in the approximation to a Gaussian is[1] O(1log⁡log⁡n).(1/√(log)).
