theorem: The Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem applies to any holomorphic vector bundle E on a compact complex manifold X, to calculate the holomorphic Euler characteristic of E in sheaf cohomology, namely the alternating sum χ(X,E)=∑i=0n(−1)idimC⁡Hi(X,E)χ(X,E)=∑_i=0^n(-1)^i_ℂH^i(X,E) of the dimensions as complex vector spaces, where n is the complex dimension of X. Hirzebruch's theorem states that χ(X, E) is computable in terms of the Chern classes ck(E) of E, and the Todd classes tdj⁡(X)td_j(X) of the holomorphic tangent bundle of X. These all lie in the cohomology ring of X; by use of the fundamental class (or, in other words, integration over X) we can obtain numbers from classes in H2n(X).^2n(X). The Hirzebruch formula asserts that χ(X,E)=∑chn−j⁡(E)tdj⁡(X),χ(X,E)=∑ch_n-j(E)td_j(X), where the sum is taken over all relevant j (so 0 ≤ j ≤ n), using the Chern character ch(E) in cohomology. In other words, the products are formed in the cohomology ring of all the 'matching' degrees that add up to 2n. Formulated differently, it gives the equality χ(X,E)=∫Xch⁡(E)td⁡(X)χ(X,E)=∫_Xch(E)td(X) where td⁡(X)td(X) is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of X. Significant special cases are when E is a complex line bundle, and when X is an algebraic surface (Noether's formula). Weil's Riemann–Roch theorem for vector bundles on curves, and the Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic surfaces (see below), are included in its scope. The formula also expresses in a precise way the vague notion that the Todd classes are in some sense reciprocals of characteristic classes. Riemann Roch theorem for
