curves: For curves, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the classical Riemann–Roch theorem. To see this, recall that for each divisor D on a curve there is an invertible sheaf O(D) (which corresponds to a line bundle) such that the linear system of D is more or less the space of sections of O(D). For curves the Todd class is 1+c1(T(X))/2,1+c_1(T(X))/2, and the Chern character of a sheaf O(D) is just 1+c1(O(D)), so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that h0(O(D))−h1(O(D))=c1(O(D))+c1(T(X))/2^0(𝒪(D))-h^1(𝒪(D))=c_1(𝒪(D))+c_1(T(X))/2 } (integrated over X). But h0(O(D)) is just l(D), the dimension of the linear system of D, and by Serre duality h1(O(D)) = h0(O(K − D)) = l(K − D) where K is the canonical divisor. Moreover, c1(O(D)) integrated over X is the degree of D, and c1(T(X)) integrated over X is the Euler class 2 − 2g of the curve X, where g is the genus. So we get the classical Riemann Roch theorem ℓ(D)−ℓ(K−D)=deg(D)+1−g.ℓ(D)-ℓ(K-D)=deg(D)+1-g. For vector bundles V, the Chern character is rank(V) + c1(V), so we get Weil's Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles over curves: h0(V)−h1(V)=c1(V)+rank⁡(V)(1−g).^0(V)-h^1(V)=c_1(V)+rank(V)(1-g).
