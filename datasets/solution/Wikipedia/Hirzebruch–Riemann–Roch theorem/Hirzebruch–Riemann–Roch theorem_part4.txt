surfaces: Main article: Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces For surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces χ(D)=χ(O)+((D.D)−(D.K))/2.χ(D)=χ(𝒪)+((D.D)-(D.K))/2. combined with the Noether formula. If we want, we can use Serre duality to express h2(O(D)) as h0(O(K − D)), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the h1(O(D)) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).
