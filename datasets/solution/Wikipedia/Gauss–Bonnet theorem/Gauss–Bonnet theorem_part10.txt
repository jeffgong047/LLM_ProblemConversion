Generalizations: The Chern theorem (after Shiing-Shen Chern 1945) is the 2n-dimensional generalization of GB (also see Chern–Weil homomorphism). The Riemann–Roch theorem can also be seen as a generalization of GB to complex manifolds. A far-reaching generalization that includes all the abovementioned theorems is the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. A generalization to 2-manifolds that need not be compact is Cohn-Vossen's inequality.
