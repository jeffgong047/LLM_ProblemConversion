Polyhedra: Main article: Descartes' theorem on total angular defect Descartes' theorem on total angular defect of a polyhedron is the polyhedral analog: it states that the sum of the defect at all the vertices of a polyhedron which is homeomorphic to the sphere is 4π. More generally, if the polyhedron has Euler characteristic χ = 2 − 2g (where g is the genus, meaning "number of holes"), then the sum of the defect is 2πχ. This is the special case of Gauss–Bonnet, where the curvature is concentrated at discrete points (the vertices). Thinking of curvature as a measure, rather than as a function, Descartes' theorem is Gauss–Bonnet where the curvature is a discrete measure, and Gauss–Bonnet for measures generalizes both Gauss–Bonnet for smooth manifolds and Descartes' theorem.
