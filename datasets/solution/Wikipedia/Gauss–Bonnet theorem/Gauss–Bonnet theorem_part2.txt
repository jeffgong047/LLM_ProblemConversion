Statement: Suppose M is a compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary ∂M. Let K be the Gaussian curvature of M, and let kg be the geodesic curvature of ∂M. Then[2][3] ∫MKdA+∫∂Mkgds=2πχ(M),∫_MK dA+∫_k_g ds=2πχ(M), where dA is the element of area of the surface, and ds is the line element along the boundary of M. Here, χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M. If the boundary ∂M is piecewise smooth, then we interpret the integral ∫∂M kg ds as the sum of the corresponding integrals along the smooth portions of the boundary, plus the sum of the angles by which the smooth portions turn at the corners of the boundary. Many standard proofs use the theorem of turning tangents, which states roughly that the winding number of a Jordan curve is exactly ±1.[2] A simple
