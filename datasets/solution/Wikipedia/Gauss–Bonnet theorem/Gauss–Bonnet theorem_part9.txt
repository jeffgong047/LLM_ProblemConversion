analog: There are several combinatorial analogs of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. We state the following one. Let M be a finite 2-dimensional pseudo-manifold. Let χ(v) denote the number of triangles containing the vertex v. Then ∑v∈int⁡M(6−χ(v))+∑v∈∂M(3−χ(v))=6χ(M),∑_v ∈ intM(6-χ(v))+∑_v ∈ (3-χ(v))=6χ(M),} where the first sum ranges over the vertices in the interior of M, the second sum is over the boundary vertices, and χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M. Similar formulas can be obtained for 2-dimensional pseudo-manifold when we replace triangles with higher polygons. For polygons of n vertices, we must replace 3 and 6 in the formula above with n/n − 2 and 2n/n − 2, respectively. For example, for quadrilaterals we must replace 3 and 6 in the formula above with 2 and 4, respectively. More specifically, if M is a closed 2-dimensional digital manifold, the genus turns out [5] g=1+M5+2M6−M38,=1+M_5+2M_6-M_3/8, where Mi indicates the number of surface-points each of which has i adjacent points on the surface. This is the simplest formula of Gauss–Bonnet theorem in three-dimensional digital space.
