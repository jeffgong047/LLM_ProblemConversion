example: Suppose M is the northern hemisphere cut out from a sphere of radius R. Its Euler characteristic is 1. On the left hand side of the theorem, we have K=1/R2=1/R^2 and kg=0_g=0, because the boundary is the equator and the equator is a geodesic of the sphere. Then ∫MKdA=2π∫_MKdA=2π. On the other hand, suppose we flatten the hemisphere to make it into a disk. This transformation is a homeomorphism, so the Euler characteristic is still 1. However, on the left hand side of the theorem we now have K=0=0 and kg=1/R_g=1/R, because a circumference is not a geodesic of the plane. Then ∫∂Mkgds=2π∫_k_gds=2π. Finally, take a sphere octant, also homeomorphic to the previous cases. Then ∫MKdA=1R24πR28=π2∫_MKdA=1/R^24^2/8=π/2. Now kg=0_g=0 almost everywhere along the border, which is a geodesic triangle. But we have three right-angle corners, so ∫∂Mkgds=3π2∫_k_gds=3π/2. Interpretation and
