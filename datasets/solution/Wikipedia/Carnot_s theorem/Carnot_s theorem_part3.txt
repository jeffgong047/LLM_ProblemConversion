engines: To see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs at temperatures T1_1 and T2_2 must have the same efficiency, assume that two reversible heat engines have different efficiencies, and let the relatively more efficient engine M drive the relatively less efficient engine L as a heat pump. As the right figure shows, this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without external work, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, both (reversible) heat engines have the same efficiency, and we conclude that: All reversible heat engines that operate between the same two thermal (heat) reservoirs have the same efficiency. The reversible heat engine efficiency can be determined by analyzing a Carnot heat engine as one of reversible heat engine. This conclusion is an important result because it helps establish the Clausius theorem, which implies that the change in entropy S is unique for all reversible processes:[4] ΔS=∫abdQrevT=∫_a^bdQ_rev/T as the entropy change, that is made during a transition from a thermodynamic equilibrium state a to a state b in a V-T (Volume-Temperature) space, is the same over all reversible process paths between these two states. If this integral were not path independent, then entropy would not be a state variable.[5] Irreversible
