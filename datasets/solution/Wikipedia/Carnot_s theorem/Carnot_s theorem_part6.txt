batteries: Since fuel cells and batteries can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature (T=TH=TC=T_H=T_C), they are clearly not limited by Carnot's theorem, which states that no power can be generated when TH=TC_H=T_C. This is because Carnot's theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work, whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work.[7] Nevertheless, the second law of thermodynamics still provides restrictions on fuel cell and battery energy conversion.[8] A Carnot battery is a type of energy storage system that stores electricity in heat storage and converts the stored heat back to electricity through thermodynamic cycles.[9] See
