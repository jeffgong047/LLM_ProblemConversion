engines: Consider two engines, M and L, which are irreversible and reversible respectively. We construct the machine shown in the right figure, with M driving L as a heat pump. Then if M is more efficient than L, the machine will violate the second law of thermodynamics. Since a Carnot heat engine is a reversible heat engine, and all reversible heat engines operate with the same efficiency between the same reservoirs, we have the first part of Carnot's theorem: No irreversible heat engine is more efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same two thermal reservoirs.
