Proof: An impossible situation: A heat engine cannot drive a less-efficient reversible heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics. Quantities in this figure are the absolute values of energy transfers (heat and work). The proof of the Carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum (a method to prove a statement by assuming its falsity and logically deriving a false or contradictory statement from this assumption), based on a situation like the right figure where two heat engines with different efficiencies are operating between two thermal reservoirs at different temperature. The relatively hotter reservoir is called the hot reservoir and the other reservoir is called the cold reservoir. A (not necessarily reversible) heat engine M with a greater efficiency ηMη__M is driving a reversible heat engine L with a less efficiency ηLη__L, causing the latter to act as a heat pump. The requirement for the engine L to be reversible is necessary to explain work W and heat Q associated with it by using its known efficiency. However, since ηM>ηLη__M>η__L, the net heat flow would be backwards, i.e., into the hot reservoir: Qhout=Q<ηMηLQ=Qhin,_h^out=Q<η__M/η__LQ=Q_h^in, where Q represents heat, inin for input to an object denoted by the subscript, outout for output from an object denoted by the subscript, and h for the hot thermal reservoir. If heat Qhout_h^out flows from the hot reservoir then it has the sign of + while if Qhin_h^in flows from the hot reservoir then it has the sign of -. This expression can be easily derived by using the definition of the efficiency of a heat engine, η=W/Qhoutη=W/Q_h^out, where work and heat in this expression are net quantities per engine cycle, and the conservation of energy for each engine as shown below. The sign convention of work W, with which the sign of + for work done by an engine to its surroundings, is employed. The above expression means that heat into the hot reservoir from the engine pair (can be considered as a single engine) is greater than heat into the engine pair from the hot reservoir (i.e., the hot reservoir continuously gets energy). A reversible heat engine with a low efficiency delivers more heat (energy) to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work (energy) to this engine when it is being driven as a heat pump. All these mean that heat can transfer from cold to hot places without external work, and such a heat transfer is impossible by the second law of thermodynamics. It may seem odd that a hypothetical reversible heat pump with a low efficiency is used to violate the second law of thermodynamics, but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not the efficiency, W/Qhout/Q_h^out, but the coefficient of performance (COP),[2] which is Qcout/W_c^out/W where this W has the sign opposite to the above (+ for work done to the engine). Let's find the values of work Wand heat Q depicted in the right figure in which a reversible heat engine L with a less efficiency ηLη__L is driven as a heat pump by a heat engine M with a more efficiency ηMη__M. The definition of the efficiency is η=W/Qhoutη=W/Q_h^out for each engine and the following expressions can be made: ηM=WMQhout,M=ηMQQ=ηM,η_M=W_M/Q_h^out,M=η_MQ/Q=η_M, ηL=WLQhout,L=−ηMQ−ηMηLQ=ηL.η_L=W_L/Q_h^out,L=-η_MQ/-η_M/η_LQ=η_L. The denominator of the second expression, Qhout,L=−ηMηLQ_h^out,L=-η_M/η_LQ, is made to make the expression to be consistent, and it helps to fill the values of work and heat for the engine L. For each engine, the absolute value of the energy entering the engine, Eabsin_abs^in, must be equal to the absolute value of the energy leaving from the engine, Eabsout_abs^out. Otherwise, energy is continuously accumulated in an engine or the conservation of energy is violated by taking more energy from an engine than input energy to the engine: EM,absin=Q=(1−ηM)Q+ηMQ=EM,absout,_M,abs^in=Q=(1-η_M)Q+η_MQ=E_M,abs^out, EL,absin=ηMQ+ηMQ(1ηL−1)=ηMηLQ=EL,absout._L,abs^in=η_MQ+η_MQ(1/η_L-1)=η_M/η_LQ=E_L,abs^out. In the second expression, |Qhout,L|=|−ηMηLQ||Q_h^out,L|=|-η_M/η_LQ| is used to find the term ηMQ(1ηL−1)η_MQ(1/η_L-1) describing the amount of heat taken from the cold reservoir, completing the absolute value expressions of work and heat in the right figure. Having established that the right figure values are correct, Carnot's theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines as shown below.[3] Reversible
