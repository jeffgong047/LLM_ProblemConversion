temperature: Main article: Definition of thermodynamic temperature The efficiency of a heat engine is the work done by the engine divided by the heat introduced to the engine per engine cycle or η=wcyqH=qH−qCqH=1−qCqHη=w_cy/q_H=q_H-q_C/q_H=1-q_C/q_H (1) where wcy_cy is the work done by the engine, qC_C is the heat to the cold reservoir from the engine, and qH_H is the heat to the engine from the hot reservoir, per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on qCqHq_C/q_H.[6] Because all reversible heat engines operating between temperatures T1_1 and T2_2 must have the same efficiency, the efficiency of a reversible heat engine is a function of only the two reservoir temperatures: qCqH=f(TH,TC)q_C/q_H=f(T_H,T_C). (2) In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1_1 and T3_3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T1_1 and another (intermediate) temperature T2_2, and the second between T2_2 and T3_3 (T1<T2<T3_1<T_2<T_3). This can only be the case if f(T1,T3)=q3q1=q2q3q1q2=f(T1,T2)f(T2,T3)(T_1,T_3)=q_3/q_1=q_2q_3/q_1q_2=f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3). (3) Specializing to the case that T1_1 is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water as 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used — the choice here corresponds to the Kelvin scale.) Then for any T2_2 and T3_3, f(T2,T3)=f(T1,T3)f(T1,T2)=273.16⋅f(T1,T3)273.16⋅f(T1,T2).(T_2,T_3)=f(T_1,T_3)/f(T_1,T_2)=273.16(T_1,T_3)/273.16(T_1,T_2). Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by T′=273.16⋅f(T1,T),'=273.16(T_1,T), then the function viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is f(T2,T3)=T3′T2′.(T_2,T_3)=T_3'/T_2'. It follows immediately that qCqH=f(TH,TC)=TC′TH′q_C/q_H=f(T_H,T_C)=T_C'/T_H'. (4) Substituting this equation back into the above equation qCqH=f(TH,TC)q_C/q_H=f(T_H,T_C) gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of thermodynamic temperatures: η=1−qCqH=1−TC′TH′η=1-q_C/q_H=1-T_C'/T_H'.
