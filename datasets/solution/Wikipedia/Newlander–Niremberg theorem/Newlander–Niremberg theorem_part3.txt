Examples: For every integer n, the flat space R2n admits an almost complex structure. An example for such an almost complex structure is (1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2n): Jij=−δi,j−1_ij=-δ_i,j-1 for even i, Jij=δi,j+1_ij=δ_i,j+1 for odd i. The only spheres which admit almost complex structures are S2 and S6 (Borel & Serre (1953)). In particular, S4 cannot be given an almost complex structure (Ehresmann and Hopf). In the case of S2, the almost complex structure comes from an honest complex structure on the Riemann sphere. The 6-sphere, S6, when considered as the set of unit norm imaginary octonions, inherits an almost complex structure from the octonion multiplication; the question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the Hopf problem, after Heinz Hopf.[2] Differential topology of almost complex
