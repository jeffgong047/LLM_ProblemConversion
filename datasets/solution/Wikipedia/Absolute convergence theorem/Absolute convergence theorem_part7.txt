convergent: Suppose that ∑|ak|,ak∈C∑|a_k|,a_k∈ℂ is convergent. Then equivalently, ∑[Re⁡(ak)2+Im⁡(ak)2]1/2∑[Re(a_k)^2+Im(a_k)^2]^1/2 is convergent, which implies that ∑|Re⁡(ak)|∑|Re(a_k)| and ∑|Im⁡(ak)|∑|Im(a_k)| converge by termwise comparison of non-negative terms. It suffices to show that the convergence of these series implies the convergence of ∑Re⁡(ak)∑Re(a_k) and ∑Im⁡(ak),∑Im(a_k), for then, the convergence of ∑ak=∑Re⁡(ak)+i∑Im⁡(ak)_k=∑Re(a_k)+i∑Im(a_k) would follow, by the definition of the convergence of complex-valued series. The preceding discussion shows that we need only prove that convergence of ∑|ak|,ak∈R∑|a_k|,a_k∈ℝ implies the convergence of ∑ak._k. Let ∑|ak|,ak∈R∑|a_k|,a_k∈ℝ be convergent. Since 0≤ak+|ak|≤2|ak|,0_k+|a_k|≤2|a_k|, we have 0≤∑k=1n(ak+|ak|)≤∑k=1n2|ak|.0≤∑_k=1^n(a_k+|a_k|)≤∑_k=1^n2|a_k|. Since ∑2|ak|∑2|a_k| is convergent, sn=∑k=1n(ak+|ak|)_n=∑_k=1^n(a_k+|a_k|) is a bounded monotonic sequence of partial sums, and ∑(ak+|ak|)∑(a_k+|a_k|) must also converge. Noting that ∑ak=∑(ak+|ak|)−∑|ak|_k=∑(a_k+|a_k|)-∑|a_k| is the difference of convergent series, we conclude that it too is a convergent series, as desired.
