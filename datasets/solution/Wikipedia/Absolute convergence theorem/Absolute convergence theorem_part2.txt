Background: In finite sums, the order in which terms are added is both associative and commutative, meaning that grouping and rearranging do not matter. (1 + 2) + 3 is the same as 1 + (2 + 3), and both are the same as (3 + 2) + 1. However, this is not true when adding infinitely many numbers, and wrongly assuming that it is true can lead to apparent paradoxes. One classic example is the alternating sum S=1−1+1−1+1−1...=1-1+1-1+1-1... whose terms alternate between +1 and −1. What is the value of S? One way to evaluate S is to group the first and second term, the third and fourth, and so on: S1=(1−1)+(1−1)+(1−1)....=0+0+0...=0_1=(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)....=0+0+0...=0 But another way to evaluate S is to leave the first term alone and group the second and third term, then the fourth and fifth term, and so on: S2=1+(−1+1)+(−1+1)+(−1+1)....=1+0+0+0...=1_2=1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)....=1+0+0+0...=1 This leads to an apparent paradox: does S=0=0 or S=1=1? The answer is that because S is not absolutely convergent, grouping or rearranging its terms changes the value of the sum. This means S1_1 and S2_2 are not equal. In fact, the series 1−1+1−1+...1-1+1-1+... does not converge, so S does not have a value to find in the first place. A series that is absolutely convergent does not have this problem: grouping or rearranging its terms does not change the value of the sum. Definition for real and complex
