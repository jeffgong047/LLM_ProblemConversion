space: The term unconditional convergence is used to refer to a series where any rearrangement of its terms still converges to the same value. For any series with values in a normed abelian group G, as long as G is complete, every series which converges absolutely also converges unconditionally. Stated more formally: Theorem — Let G be a normed abelian group. Suppose ∑i=1∞ai=A∈G,∑i=1∞‖ai‖<∞.∑_i=1^∞a_i=A, ∑_i=1^∞a_i<∞. If σ:N→Nσ:ℕ→ℕ is any permutation, then ∑i=1∞aσ(i)=A.∑_i=1^∞a_σ(i)=A. For series with more general coefficients, the converse is more complicated. As stated in the previous section, for real-valued and complex-valued series, unconditional convergence always implies absolute convergence. However, in the more general case of a series with values in any normed abelian group G, the converse does not always hold: there can exist series which are not absolutely convergent, yet unconditionally convergent. For example, in the Banach space ℓ∞, one series which is unconditionally convergent but not absolutely convergent is: ∑n=1∞1nen,∑_n=1^∞1ne_n, where enn=1∞{e_n}_n=1^∞ is an orthonormal basis. A theorem of A. Dvoretzky and C. A. Rogers asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an unconditionally convergent series that is not absolutely convergent.[4] Proof of the
