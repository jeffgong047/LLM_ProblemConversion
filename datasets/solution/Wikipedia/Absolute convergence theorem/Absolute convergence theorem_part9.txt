convergent: The above result can be easily generalized to every Banach space (X,‖⋅‖).(X, · ). Let ∑xn_n be an absolutely convergent series in X.. As ∑k=1n‖xk‖∑_k=1^nx_k is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers, for any ε>0ε>0 and large enough natural numbers m>n>n it holds: |∑k=1m‖xk‖−∑k=1n‖xk‖|=∑k=n+1m‖xk‖<ε.|∑_k=1^mx_k-∑_k=1^nx_k|=∑_k=n+1^mx_k<ε. By the triangle inequality for the norm ǁ⋅ǁ, one immediately gets: ‖∑k=1mxk−∑k=1nxk‖=‖∑k=n+1mxk‖≤∑k=n+1m‖xk‖<ε,∑_k=1^mx_k-∑_k=1^nx_k=∑_k=n+1^mx_k≤∑_k=n+1^mx_k<ε, which means that ∑k=1nxk∑_k=1^nx_k is a Cauchy sequence in X,, hence the series is convergent in X..[3] Rearrangements and unconditional
