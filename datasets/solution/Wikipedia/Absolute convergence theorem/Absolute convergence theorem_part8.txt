inequality: By applying the Cauchy criterion for the convergence of a complex series, we can also prove this fact as a simple implication of the triangle inequality.[2] By the Cauchy criterion, ∑|ai|∑|a_i| converges if and only if for any ε>0,ε>0, there exists N such that |∑i=mn|ai||=∑i=mn|ai|<ε|∑_i=m^n|a_i||=∑_i=m^n|a_i|<ε for any n>m≥N.>m. But the triangle inequality implies that |∑i=mnai|≤∑i=mn|ai|,|∑_i=m^na_i|≤∑_i=m^n|a_i|, so that |∑i=mnai|<ε|∑_i=m^na_i|<ε for any n>m≥N,>m, which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for ∑ai._i. Proof that any absolutely convergent series in a Banach space is
