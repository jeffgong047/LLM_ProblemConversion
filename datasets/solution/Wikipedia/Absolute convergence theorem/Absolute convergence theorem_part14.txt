series: The Cauchy product of two series converges to the product of the sums if at least one of the series converges absolutely. That is, suppose that ∑n=0∞an=Aand∑n=0∞bn=B.∑_n=0^∞a_n=A and ∑_n=0^∞b_n=B. The Cauchy product is defined as the sum of terms cn_n where: cn=∑k=0nakbn−k._n=∑_k=0^na_kb_n-k. If either the an_n or bn_n sum converges absolutely then ∑n=0∞cn=AB.∑_n=0^∞c_n=AB. Absolute convergence over
