integrals: The integral ∫Af(x)dx∫_Af(x) dx of a real or complex-valued function is said to converge absolutely if ∫A|f(x)|dx<∞.∫_A|f(x)| dx<∞. One also says that f is absolutely integrable. The issue of absolute integrability is intricate and depends on whether the Riemann, Lebesgue, or Kurzweil-Henstock (gauge) integral is considered; for the Riemann integral, it also depends on whether we only consider integrability in its proper sense (f and A both bounded), or permit the more general case of improper integrals. As a standard property of the Riemann integral, when A=[a,b]=[a,b] is a bounded interval, every continuous function is bounded and (Riemann) integrable, and since f continuous implies |f||f| continuous, every continuous function is absolutely integrable. In fact, since g∘f is Riemann integrable on [a,b][a,b] if f is (properly) integrable and g is continuous, it follows that |f|=|⋅|∘f|f|=|·| is properly Riemann integrable if f is. However, this implication does not hold in the case of improper integrals. For instance, the function f:[1,∞)→R:x↦sin⁡xx:[1,∞)→ℝ:x↦/x is improperly Riemann integrable on its unbounded domain, but it is not absolutely integrable: ∫1∞sin⁡xxdx=12[π−2Si(1)]≈0.62,but∫1∞|sin⁡xx|dx=∞.∫_1^∞/x dx=1/2[π-2 Si(1)]≈0.62,but∫_1^∞|/x|dx=∞. Indeed, more generally, given any series ∑n=0∞an∑_n=0^∞a_n one can consider the associated step function fa:[0,∞)→R_a:[0,∞)→ℝ defined by fa([n,n+1))=an._a([n,n+1))=a_n. Then ∫0∞fadx∫_0^∞f_a dx converges absolutely, converges conditionally or diverges according to the corresponding behavior of ∑n=0∞an.∑_n=0^∞a_n. The situation is different for the Lebesgue integral, which does not handle bounded and unbounded domains of integration separately (see below). The fact that the integral of |f||f| is unbounded in the examples above implies that f is also not integrable in the Lebesgue sense. In fact, in the Lebesgue theory of integration, given that f is measurable, f is (Lebesgue) integrable if and only if |f||f| is (Lebesgue) integrable. However, the hypothesis that f is measurable is crucial; it is not generally true that absolutely integrable functions on [a,b][a,b] are integrable (simply because they may fail to be measurable): let S⊂[a,b]⊂[a,b] be a nonmeasurable subset and consider f=χS−1/2,=χ_S-1/2, where χSχ_S is the characteristic function of S.. Then f is not Lebesgue measurable and thus not integrable, but |f|≡1/2|f|≡1/2 is a constant function and clearly integrable. On the other hand, a function f may be Kurzweil-Henstock integrable (gauge integrable) while |f||f| is not. This includes the case of improperly Riemann integrable functions. In a general sense, on any measure space A,, the Lebesgue integral of a real-valued function is defined in terms of its positive and negative parts, so the facts: f integrable implies |f||f| integrable f measurable, |f||f| integrable implies f integrable are essentially built into the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In particular, applying the theory to the counting measure on a set S,, one recovers the notion of unordered summation of series developed by Moore–Smith using (what are now called) nets. When S=N=ℕ is the set of natural numbers, Lebesgue integrability, unordered summability and absolute convergence all coincide. Finally, all of the above holds for integrals with values in a Banach space. The definition of a Banach-valued Riemann integral is an evident modification of the usual one. For the Lebesgue integral one needs to circumvent the decomposition into positive and negative parts with Daniell's more functional analytic approach, obtaining the Bochner integral. See
