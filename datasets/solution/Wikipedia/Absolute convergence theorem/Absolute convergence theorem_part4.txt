elements: The same definition can be used for series ∑n=0∞an∑_n=0^∞a_n whose terms an_n are not numbers but rather elements of an arbitrary abelian topological group. In that case, instead of using the absolute value, the definition requires the group to have a norm, which is a positive real-valued function ‖⋅‖:G→R+·:G→ℝ_+ on an abelian group G (written additively, with identity element 0) such that: The norm of the identity element of G is zero: ‖0‖=0.0=0. For every x∈G,, ‖x‖=0x=0 implies x=0.=0. For every x∈G,, ‖−x‖=‖x‖.-x=x. For every x,y∈G,,y, ‖x+y‖≤‖x‖+‖y‖.x+y≤x+y. In this case, the function d(x,y)=‖x−y‖(x,y)=x-y induces the structure of a metric space (a type of topology) on G.. Then, a G-valued series is absolutely convergent if ∑n=0∞‖an‖<∞.∑_n=0^∞a_n<∞. In particular, these statements apply using the norm |x||x| (absolute value) in the space of real numbers or complex numbers. In topological vector
