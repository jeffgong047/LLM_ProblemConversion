sets: A generalization of the absolute convergence of a series, is the absolute convergence of a sum of a function over a set. We can first consider a countable set X and a function f:X→R.:X→ℝ. We will give a definition below of the sum of f over X,, written as ∑x∈Xf(x).∑_xf(x). First note that because no particular enumeration (or "indexing") of X has yet been specified, the series ∑x∈Xf(x)∑_xf(x) cannot be understood by the more basic definition of a series. In fact, for certain examples of X and f,, the sum of f over X may not be defined at all, since some indexing may produce a conditionally convergent series. Therefore we define ∑x∈Xf(x)∑_xf(x) only in the case where there exists some bijection g:Z+→X:ℤ^+ such that ∑n=1∞f(g(n))∑_n=1^∞f(g(n)) is absolutely convergent. Note that here, "absolutely convergent" uses the more basic definition, applied to an indexed series. In this case, the value of the sum of f over X[5] is defined by ∑x∈Xf(x):=∑n=1∞f(g(n))∑_xf(x):=∑_n=1^∞f(g(n)) Note that because the series is absolutely convergent, then every rearrangement is identical to a different choice of bijection g.. Since all of these sums have the same value, then the sum of f over X is well-defined. Even more generally we may define the sum of f over X when X is uncountable. But first we define what it means for the sum to be convergent. Let X be any set, countable or uncountable, and f:X→R:X→ℝ a function. We say that the sum of f over X converges absolutely if sup∑x∈A|f(x)|:A⊆X,Aisfinite<∞.sup{∑_x|f(x)|:A,Aisfinite}<∞. There is a theorem which states that, if the sum of f over X is absolutely convergent, then f takes non-zero values on a set that is at most countable. Therefore, the following is a consistent definition of the sum of f over X when the sum is absolutely convergent. ∑x∈Xf(x):=∑x∈X:f(x)≠0f(x).∑_xf(x):=∑_x:f(x)≠0f(x). Note that the final series uses the definition of a series over a countable set. Some authors define an iterated sum ∑m=1∞∑n=1∞am,n∑_m=1^∞∑_n=1^∞a_m,n to be absolutely convergent if the iterated series ∑m=1∞∑n=1∞|am,n|<∞.∑_m=1^∞∑_n=1^∞|a_m,n|<∞.[6] This is in fact equivalent to the absolute convergence of ∑(m,n)∈N×Nam,n.∑_(m,n)∈ℕ×ℕa_m,n. That is to say, if the sum of f over X,, ∑(m,n)∈N×Nam,n,∑_(m,n)∈ℕ×ℕa_m,n, converges absolutely, as defined above, then the iterated sum ∑m=1∞∑n=1∞am,n∑_m=1^∞∑_n=1^∞a_m,n converges absolutely, and vice versa.
