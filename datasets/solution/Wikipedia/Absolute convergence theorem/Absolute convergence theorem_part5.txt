spaces: If X is a topological vector space (TVS) and (xα)α∈A(x_α)_α is a (possibly uncountable) family in X then this family is absolutely summable if[1] (xα)α∈A(x_α)_α is summable in X (that is, if the limit limH∈F(A)xHlim_H∈ℱ(A)x_H of the net (xH)H∈F(A)(x_H)_H∈ℱ(A) converges in X,, where F(A)ℱ(A) is the directed set of all finite subsets of A directed by inclusion ⊆⊆ and xH:=∑i∈Hxi_H:=∑_ix_i), and for every continuous seminorm p on X,, the family (p(xα))α∈A(p(x_α))_α is summable in R.ℝ. If X is a normable space and if (xα)α∈A(x_α)_α is an absolutely summable family in X,, then necessarily all but a countable collection of xα_α's are 0. Absolutely summable families play an important role in the theory of nuclear spaces. Relation to
