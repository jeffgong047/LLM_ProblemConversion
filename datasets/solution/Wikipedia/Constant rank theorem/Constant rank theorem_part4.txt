Counter-example: The function f(x)=x+2x2sin⁡(1x)(x)=x+2x^2sin(1x) is bounded inside a quadratic envelope near the line y=x=x, so f′(0)=1'(0)=1. Nevertheless, it has local max/min points accumulating at x=0=0, so it is not one-to-one on any surrounding interval. If one drops the assumption that the derivative is continuous, the function no longer need be invertible. For example f(x)=x+2x2sin⁡(1x)(x)=x+2x^2sin(1x) and f(0)=0(0)=0 has discontinuous derivative f′(x)=1−2cos⁡(1x)+4xsin⁡(1x)'(x)=1-2cos(1x)+4xsin(1x) and f′(0)=1'(0)=1, which vanishes arbitrarily close to x=0=0. These critical points are local max/min points of f, so f is not one-to-one (and not invertible) on any interval containing x=0=0. Intuitively, the slope f′(0)=1'(0)=1 does not propagate to nearby points, where the slopes are governed by a weak but rapid oscillation. Methods of
