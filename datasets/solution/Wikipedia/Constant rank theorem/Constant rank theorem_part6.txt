approximation: To prove existence, it can be assumed after an affine transformation that f(0)=0(0)=0 and f′(0)=I^'(0)=I, so that a=b=0=b=0. By the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions, for a function u:[0,1]→Rm:[0,1]→ℝ^m, ‖u(1)−u(0)‖≤sup0≤t≤1‖u′(t)‖u(1)-u(0)≤sup_0≤1u^'(t). Setting u(t)=f(x+t(x′−x))−x−t(x′−x)(t)=f(x+t(x^'-x))-x-t(x^'-x), it follows that ‖f(x)−f(x′)−x+x′‖≤‖x−x′‖sup0≤t≤1‖f′(x+t(x′−x))−I‖.f(x)-f(x^')-x+x^'≤x-x^' sup_0≤1f^'(x+t(x^'-x))-I. Now choose δ>0δ>0 so that ‖f′(x)−I‖<12f'(x)-I<12 for ‖x‖<δx<δ. Suppose that ‖y‖<δ/2y<δ/2 and define xn_n inductively by x0=0_0=0 and xn+1=xn+y−f(xn)_n+1=x_n+y-f(x_n). The assumptions show that if ‖x‖,‖x′‖<δx, x^'<δ then ‖f(x)−f(x′)−x+x′‖≤‖x−x′‖/2f(x)-f(x^')-x+x^'≤x-x^'/2. In particular f(x)=f(x′)(x)=f(x^') implies x=x′=x^'. In the inductive scheme ‖xn‖<δx_n<δ and ‖xn+1−xn‖<δ/2nx_n+1-x_n<δ/2^n. Thus (xn)(x_n) is a Cauchy sequence tending to x. By construction f(x)=y(x)=y as required. To check that g=f−1=f^-1 is C1, write g(y+k)=x+h(y+k)=x+h so that f(x+h)=f(x)+k(x+h)=f(x)+k. By the inequalities above, ‖h−k‖<‖h‖/2h-k<h/2 so that ‖h‖/2<‖k‖<2‖h‖h/2<k<2h. On the other hand if A=f′(x)=f^'(x), then ‖A−I‖<1/2A-I<1/2. Using the geometric series for B=I−A=I-A, it follows that ‖A−1‖<2A^-1<2. But then ‖g(y+k)−g(y)−f′(g(y))−1k‖‖k‖=‖h−f′(x)−1[f(x+h)−f(x)]‖‖k‖≤4‖f(x+h)−f(x)−f′(x)h‖‖h‖g(y+k)-g(y)-f^'(g(y))^-1kk=h-f^'(x)^-1[f(x+h)-f(x)]k≤4f(x+h)-f(x)-f^'(x)hh tends to 0 as k and h tend to 0, proving that g is C1 with g′(y)=f′(g(y))−1^'(y)=f^'(g(y))^-1. The proof above is presented for a finite-dimensional space, but applies equally well for Banach spaces. If an invertible function f is Ck with k>1>1, then so too is its inverse. This follows by induction using the fact that the map F(A)=A−1(A)=A^-1 on operators is Ck for any k (in the finite-dimensional case this is an elementary fact because the inverse of a matrix is given as the adjugate matrix divided by its determinant). [1][7] The method of proof here can be found in the books of Henri Cartan, Jean Dieudonné, Serge Lang, Roger Godement and Lars Hörmander. A proof using the contraction mapping
