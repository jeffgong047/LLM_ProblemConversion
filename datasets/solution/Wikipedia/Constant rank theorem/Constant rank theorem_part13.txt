manifolds: The inverse function theorem can be rephrased in terms of differentiable maps between differentiable manifolds. In this context the theorem states that for a differentiable map F:M→N:M (of class C1^1), if the differential of F, dFp:TpM→TF(p)N_p:T_pM_F(p)N is a linear isomorphism at a point p in M then there exists an open neighborhood U of p such that F|U:U→F(U)|_U:U(U) is a diffeomorphism. Note that this implies that the connected components of M and N containing p and F(p) have the same dimension, as is already directly implied from the assumption that dFp is an isomorphism. If the derivative of F is an isomorphism at all points p in M then the map F is a local diffeomorphism.
