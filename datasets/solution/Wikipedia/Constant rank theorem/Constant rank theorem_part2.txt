Statements: For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if f is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point a; then f is injective (or bijective onto the image) in a neighborhood of a, the inverse is continuously differentiable near b=f(a)=f(a), and the derivative of the inverse function at b is the reciprocal of the derivative of f at a: (f−1)′(b)=1f′(a)=1f′(f−1(b)).(f^-1)'(b)=1/f'(a)=1/f'(f^-1(b)). It can happen that a function f may be injective near a point a while f′(a)=0'(a)=0. An example is f(x)=(x−a)3(x)=(x-a)^3. In fact, for such a function, the inverse cannot be differentiable at b=f(a)=f(a), since if f−1^-1 were differentiable at b, then, by the chain rule, 1=(f−1∘f)′(a)=(f−1)′(b)f′(a)1=(f^-1)'(a)=(f^-1)'(b)f'(a), which implies f′(a)≠0'(a)≠0. (The situation is different for holomorphic functions; see #Holomorphic inverse function theorem below.) For functions of more than one variable, the theorem states that if f is a continuously differentiable function from an open subset A of Rnℝ^n into Rnℝ^n, and the derivative f′(a)'(a) is invertible at a point a (that is, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of f at a is non-zero), then there exist neighborhoods U of a in A and V of b=f(a)=f(a) such that f(U)⊂V(U) and f:U→V:U is bijective.[1] Writing f=(f1,…,fn)=(f_1,…,f_n), this means that the system of n equations yi=fi(x1,…,xn)_i=f_i(x_1,…,x_n) has a unique solution for x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n in terms of y1,…,yn_1,…,y_n when x∈U,y∈V,y. Note that the theorem does not say f is bijective onto the image where f′' is invertible but that it is locally bijective where f′' is invertible. Moreover, the theorem says that the inverse function f−1:V→U^-1:V is continuously differentiable, and its derivative at b=f(a)=f(a) is the inverse map of f′(a)'(a); i.e., (f−1)′(b)=f′(a)−1.(f^-1)'(b)=f'(a)^-1. In other words, if Jf−1(b),Jf(a)^-1(b),Jf(a) are the Jacobian matrices representing (f−1)′(b),f′(a)(f^-1)'(b),f'(a), this means: Jf−1(b)=Jf(a)−1.^-1(b)=Jf(a)^-1. The hard part of the theorem is the existence and differentiability of f−1^-1. Assuming this, the inverse derivative formula follows from the chain rule applied to f−1∘f=I^-1=I. (Indeed, I=(f−1∘f)′(a)=(f−1)′(b)∘f′(a).=(f^-1)^'(a)=(f^-1)'(b)'(a).) Since taking the inverse is infinitely differentiable, the formula for the derivative of the inverse shows that if f is continuously k times differentiable, with invertible derivative at the point a, then the inverse is also continuously k times differentiable. Here k is a positive integer or ∞∞. There are two variants of the inverse function theorem.[1] Given a continuously differentiable map f:U→Rm:U→ℝ^m, the first is The derivative f′(a)'(a) is surjective (i.e., the Jacobian matrix representing it has rank m) if and only if there exists a continuously differentiable function g on a neighborhood V of b=f(a)=f(a) such f∘g=I=I near b, and the second is The derivative f′(a)'(a) is injective if and only if there exists a continuously differentiable function g on a neighborhood V of b=f(a)=f(a) such g∘f=I=I near a. In the first case (when f′(a)'(a) is surjective), the point b=f(a)=f(a) is called a regular value. Since m=dim⁡ker⁡(f′(a))+dim⁡im⁡(f′(a))=(f'(a))+im(f'(a)), the first case is equivalent to saying b=f(a)=f(a) is not in the image of critical points a (a critical point is a point a such that the kernel of f′(a)'(a) is nonzero). The statement in the first case is a special case of the submersion theorem. These variants are restatements of the inverse functions theorem. Indeed, in the first case when f′(a)'(a) is surjective, we can find an (injective) linear map T such that f′(a)∘T=I'(a)=I. Define h(x)=a+Tx(x)=a+Tx so that we have: (f∘h)′(0)=f′(a)∘T=I.(f)'(0)=f'(a)=I. Thus, by the inverse function theorem, f∘h has inverse near 00; i.e., f∘h∘(f∘h)−1=I∘(f)^-1=I near b. The second case (f′(a)'(a) is injective) is seen in the similar way.
