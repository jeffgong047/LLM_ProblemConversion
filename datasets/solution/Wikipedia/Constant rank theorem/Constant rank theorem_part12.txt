theorem: There is a version of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic maps. Theorem — [17][18] Let U,V⊂Cn,V⊂ℂ^n be open subsets such that 0∈U0 and f:U→V:U a holomorphic map whose Jacobian matrix in variables zi,z¯i_i,z_i is invertible (the determinant is nonzero) at 00. Then f is injective in some neighborhood W of 00 and the inverse f−1:f(W)→W^-1:f(W) is holomorphic. The theorem follows from the usual inverse function theorem. Indeed, let JR(f)_ℝ(f) denote the Jacobian matrix of f in variables xi,yi_i,y_i and J(f)(f) for that in zj,z¯j_j,z_j. Then we have detJR(f)=|detJ(f)|2_ℝ(f)=|(f)|^2, which is nonzero by assumption. Hence, by the usual inverse function theorem, f is injective near 00 with continuously differentiable inverse. By chain rule, with w=f(z)=f(z), ∂∂z¯j(fj−1∘f)(z)=∑k∂fj−1∂wk(w)∂fk∂z¯j(z)+∑k∂fj−1∂w¯k(w)∂f¯k∂z¯j(z)∂/∂z_j(f_j^-1)(z)=∑_k_j^-1/_k(w)_k/∂z_j(z)+∑_k_j^-1/∂w_k(w)∂f_k/∂z_j(z) where the left-hand side and the first term on the right vanish since fj−1∘f_j^-1 and fk_k are holomorphic. Thus, ∂fj−1∂w¯k(w)=0_j^-1/∂w_k(w)=0 for each k. ◻□ Similarly, there is the implicit function theorem for holomorphic functions.[19] As already noted earlier, it can happen that an injective smooth function has the inverse that is not smooth (e.g., f(x)=x3(x)=x^3 in a real variable). This is not the case for holomorphic functions because of: Proposition — [19] If f:U→V:U is an injective holomorphic map between open subsets of Cnℂ^n, then f−1:f(U)→U^-1:f(U) is holomorphic.
