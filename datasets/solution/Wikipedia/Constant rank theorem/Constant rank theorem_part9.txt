theorem: The inverse function theorem can be used to solve a system of equations f1(x)=y1⋮fn(x)=yn, f_1(x)=y_1 ⋮ f_n(x)=y_n, i.e., expressing y1,…,yn_1,…,y_n as functions of x=(x1,…,xn)=(x_1,…,x_n), provided the Jacobian matrix is invertible. The implicit function theorem allows to solve a more general system of equations: f1(x,y)=0⋮fn(x,y)=0 f_1(x,y)=0 ⋮ f_n(x,y)=0 for y in terms of x. Though more general, the theorem is actually a consequence of the inverse function theorem. First, the precise statement of the implicit function theorem is as follows:[9] given a map f:Rn×Rm→Rm:ℝ^n×ℝ^m→ℝ^m, if f(a,b)=0(a,b)=0, f is continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of (a,b)(a,b) and the derivative of y↦f(a,y)(a,y) at b is invertible, then there exists a differentiable map g:U→V:U for some neighborhoods U,V,V of a,b,b such that f(x,g(x))=0(x,g(x))=0. Moreover, if f(x,y)=0,x∈U,y∈V(x,y)=0,x,y, then y=g(x)=g(x); i.e., g(x)(x) is a unique solution. To see this, consider the map F(x,y)=(x,f(x,y))(x,y)=(x,f(x,y)). By the inverse function theorem, F:U×V→W:U has the inverse G for some neighborhoods U,V,W,V,W. We then have: (x,y)=F(G1(x,y),G2(x,y))=(G1(x,y),f(G1(x,y),G2(x,y)),(x,y)=F(G_1(x,y),G_2(x,y))=(G_1(x,y),f(G_1(x,y),G_2(x,y)), implying x=G1(x,y)=G_1(x,y) and y=f(x,G2(x,y)).=f(x,G_2(x,y)). Thus g(x)=G2(x,0)(x)=G_2(x,0) has the required property. ◻□ Giving a manifold
