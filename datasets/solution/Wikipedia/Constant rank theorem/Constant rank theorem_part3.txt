Example: Consider the vector-valued function F:R2→R2:ℝ^2→ℝ^2 defined by: F(x,y)=[excos⁡yexsin⁡y].(x,y)=[ e^x; e^x; ]. The Jacobian matrix is: JF(x,y)=[excos⁡y−exsin⁡yexsin⁡yexcos⁡y]_F(x,y)=[ e^x -e^x; e^x e^x; ] with Jacobian determinant: detJF(x,y)=e2xcos2⁡y+e2xsin2⁡y=e2x._F(x,y)=e^2xcos^2y+e^2xsin^2y=e^2x. The determinant e2x^2x is nonzero everywhere. Thus the theorem guarantees that, for every point p in R2ℝ^2, there exists a neighborhood about p over which F is invertible. This does not mean F is invertible over its entire domain: in this case F is not even injective since it is periodic: F(x,y)=F(x,y+2π)(x,y)=F(x,y+2π).
