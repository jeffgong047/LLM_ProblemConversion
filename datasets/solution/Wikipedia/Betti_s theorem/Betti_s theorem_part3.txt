Example: For a simple example let m=1 and n=1. Consider a horizontal beam on which two points have been defined: point 1 and point 2. First we apply a vertical force P at point 1 and measure the vertical displacement of point 2, denoted ΔP2Δ_P2. Next we remove force P and apply a vertical force Q at point 2, which produces the vertical displacement at point 1 of ΔQ1Δ_Q1. Betti's reciprocity theorem states that: PΔQ1=QΔP2. Δ_Q1=Q Δ_P2.
