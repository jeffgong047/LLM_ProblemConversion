tours: On an 8 × 8 board, there are exactly 26,534,728,821,064 directed closed tours (i.e. two tours along the same path that travel in opposite directions are counted separately, as are rotations and reflections).[14][15][16] The number of undirected closed tours is half this number, since every tour can be traced in reverse. There are 9,862 undirected closed tours on a 6 × 6 board.[17] n Number of directed tours (open and closed)on an n × n board(sequence A165134 in the OEIS) 1 1 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1,728 6 6,637,920 7 165,575,218,320 8 19,591,828,170,979,904 Finding tours with
