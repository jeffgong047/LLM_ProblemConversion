Theory: Knight's graph showing all possible paths for a knight's tour on a standard 8 Ã— 8 chessboard. The numbers on each node indicate the number of possible moves that can be made from that position. The knight's tour problem is an instance of the more general Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of finding a closed knight's tour is similarly an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, the knight's tour problem can be solved in linear time.[4]
