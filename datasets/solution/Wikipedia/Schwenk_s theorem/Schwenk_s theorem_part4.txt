Existence: A radially symmetric closed knight's tour Schwenk[10] proved that for any m × n board with m ≤ n, a closed knight's tour is always possible unless one or more of these three conditions are met: m and n are both odd m = 1, 2, or 4 m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8. Cull et al. and Conrad et al. proved that on any rectangular board whose smaller dimension is at least 5, there is a (possibly open) knight's tour.[4][11] For any m × n board with m ≤ n, a knight's tour is always possible unless one or more of these three conditions are met: m = 1 or 2 m = 3 and n = 3, 5, or 6[12] m = 4 and n = 4.[13] Number of
