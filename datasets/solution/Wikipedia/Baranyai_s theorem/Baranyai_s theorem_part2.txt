theorem: The statement of the result is that if 2≤r<k2<k are integers and r divides k, then the complete hypergraph Krk_r^k decomposes into 1-factors. Krk_r^k is a hypergraph with k vertices, in which every subset of r vertices forms a hyperedge; a 1-factor of this hypergraph is a set of hyperedges that touches each vertex exactly once, or equivalently a partition of the vertices into subsets of size r. Thus, the theorem states that the k vertices of the hypergraph may be partitioned into subsets of r vertices in (kr)rk=(k−1r−1)krr/k=k-1r-1 different ways, in such a way that each r-element subset appears in exactly one of the partitions. The case
