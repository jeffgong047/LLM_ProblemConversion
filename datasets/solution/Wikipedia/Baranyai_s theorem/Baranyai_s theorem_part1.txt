Theorem that deals with the decompositions of complete hypergraphs A partition of a complete graph on 8 vertices into 7 colors (perfect matchings), the case r = 2 of Baranyai's theorem In combinatorial mathematics, Baranyai's theorem (proved by and named after Zsolt Baranyai) deals with the decompositions of complete hypergraphs. Statement of the
