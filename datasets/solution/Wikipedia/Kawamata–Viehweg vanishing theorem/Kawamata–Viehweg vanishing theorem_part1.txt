In algebraic geometry, the Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem is an extension of the Kodaira vanishing theorem, on the vanishing of coherent cohomology groups, to logarithmic pairs, proved independently by Viehweg[1] and Kawamata[2] in 1982. The theorem states that if L is a big nef line bundle (for example, an ample line bundle) on a complex projective manifold with canonical line bundle K, then the coherent cohomology groups Hi(L⊗K) vanish for all positive i.
