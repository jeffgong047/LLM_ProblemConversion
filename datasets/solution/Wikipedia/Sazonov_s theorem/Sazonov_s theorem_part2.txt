theorem: Let G and H be two Hilbert spaces and let T : G → H be a bounded operator from G to H. Recall that T is said to be γ-radonifying if the push forward of the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on G is a bona fide measure on H. Recall also that T is said to be a Hilbert–Schmidt operator if there is an orthonormal basis { ei : i ∈ I } of G such that ∑i∈I‖T(ei)‖H2<+∞.∑_iT(e_i)_H^2<+∞. Then Sazonov's theorem is that T is γ-radonifying if it is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. The proof uses Prokhorov's theorem.
