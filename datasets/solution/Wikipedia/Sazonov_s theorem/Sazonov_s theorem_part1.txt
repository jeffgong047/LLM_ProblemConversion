In mathematics, Sazonov's theorem, named after Vyacheslav Vasilievich Sazonov (Вячесла́в Васи́льевич Сазо́нов), is a theorem in functional analysis. It states that a bounded linear operator between two Hilbert spaces is γ-radonifying if it is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. The result is also important in the study of stochastic processes and the Malliavin calculus, since results concerning probability measures on infinite-dimensional spaces are of central importance in these fields. Sazonov's theorem also has a converse: if the map is not Hilbert–Schmidt, then it is not γ-radonifying. Statement of the
