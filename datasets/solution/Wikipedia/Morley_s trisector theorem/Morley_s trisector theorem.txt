3 intersections of any triangle's adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle
If each vertex angle of the outer triangle is trisected, Morley's trisector theorem states that the purple triangle will be equilateral.
In plane geometry, Morley's trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the first Morley triangle or simply the Morley triangle. The theorem was discovered in 1899 by Anglo-American mathematician Frank Morley. It has various generalizations; in particular, if all the trisectors are intersected, one obtains four other equilateral triangles.


Proofs[edit]
There are many proofs of Morley's theorem, some of which are very technical.[1]  
Several early proofs were  based on delicate trigonometric calculations. Recent proofs include an algebraic proof by Alain Connes (1998, 2004) extending the theorem to general fields other than characteristic three, and John Conway's elementary geometry proof.[2][3]  The latter starts with an equilateral triangle and shows that a triangle may be built around it which will be similar to any selected triangle.  Morley's theorem does not hold in spherical[4] and hyperbolic geometry.

One proof uses the trigonometric identity




sin⁡(3θ)=4sin⁡θsin⁡(60∘+θ)sin⁡(120∘+θ)sin(3θ)=4sinθsin(60^∘+θ)sin(120^∘+θ)

which, by using of the sum of two angles identity, can be shown to be equal to

sin⁡(3θ)=−4sin3⁡θ+3sin⁡θ.sin(3θ)=-4sin^3θ+3sinθ.
The last equation can be verified by applying the sum of two angles identity to the left side twice and eliminating the cosine.
Points D,E,F,E,F are constructed on BC¯BC as shown. We have 3α+3β+3γ=180∘3α+3β+3γ=180^∘, the sum of any triangle's angles, so α+β+γ=60∘.α+β+γ=60^∘. Therefore, the angles of triangle XEF are α,(60∘+β),α,(60^∘+β), and (60∘+γ).(60^∘+γ).

Express the height of triangle ABC in two ways

h=AB¯sin⁡(3β)=AB¯⋅4sin⁡βsin⁡(60∘+β)sin⁡(120∘+β)=ABsin(3β)=AB·4sinβsin(60^∘+β)sin(120^∘+β)
and

h=AC¯sin⁡(3γ)=AC¯⋅4sin⁡γsin⁡(60∘+γ)sin⁡(120∘+γ).=ACsin(3γ)=AC·4sinγsin(60^∘+γ)sin(120^∘+γ).
where equation (1) was used to replace sin⁡(3β)sin(3β) and sin⁡(3γ)sin(3γ) in these two equations. Substituting equations (2) and (5) in the ββ equation and equations (3) and (6) in the γγ equation gives

h=4AB¯sin⁡β⋅DX¯XE¯⋅AC¯AY¯sin⁡γ=4ABsinβ·DX/XE·AC/AYsinγ
and

h=4AC¯sin⁡γ⋅DX¯XF¯⋅AB¯AZ¯sin⁡β=4ACsinγ·DX/XF·AB/AZsinβ
Since the numerators are equal

XE¯⋅AY¯=XF¯⋅AZ¯XE·AY=XF·AZ
or

XE¯XF¯=AZ¯AY¯.XE/XF=AZ/AY.
Since angle EXF and angle ZAY are equal and the sides forming these angles are in the same ratio, triangles XEF and AZY are similar. 
Similar angles AYZ and XFE equal (60∘+γ)(60^∘+γ), and similar angles AZY and XEF equal (60∘+β).(60^∘+β). Similar arguments yield the base angles of triangles BXZ and CYX..
In particular angle BZX is found to be (60∘+α)(60^∘+α) and from the figure we see that

∠AZY+∠AZB+∠BZX+∠XZY=360∘.∠AZY+∠AZB+∠BZX+∠XZY=360^∘.
Substituting yields

(60∘+β)+(120∘+γ)+(60∘+α)+∠XZY=360∘(60^∘+β)+(120^∘+γ)+(60^∘+α)+∠XZY=360^∘
where equation (4) was used for angle AZB and therefore

∠XZY=60∘.∠XZY=60^∘.
Similarly the other angles of triangle XYZ are found to be 60∘.60^∘.

Side and area[edit]
The first Morley triangle has side lengths[5]
a′=b′=c′=8Rsin⁡13Asin⁡13Bsin⁡13C,^'=b^'=c^'=8R sin13A sin13B sin13C,
where R is the circumradius of the original triangle and A, B, and C are the angles of the original triangle. Since the area of an equilateral triangle is 34a′2,√(3)4a'^2, the area of Morley's triangle can be expressed as
Area=163R2sin213Asin213Bsin213C.Area=16√(3)R^2 sin^213A sin^213B sin^213C.

Morley's triangles[edit]
Morley's theorem entails 18 equilateral triangles.  The triangle described in the trisector theorem above, called the first Morley triangle, has vertices given in trilinear coordinates relative to a triangle ABC as follows:
A-vertex=1:2cos⁡13C:2cos⁡13BB-vertex=2cos⁡13C:1:2cos⁡13AC-vertex=2cos⁡13B:2cos⁡13A:1[ A-vertex        =        1        :  2cos13C        :  2cos13B; B-vertex        =  2cos13C        :        1        :  2cos13A; C-vertex        =  2cos13B        :  2cos13A        :        1 ]
Another of Morley's equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the second Morley triangle and is given by these vertices:
A-vertex=1:2cos⁡13(C−2π):2cos⁡13(B−2π)B-vertex=2cos⁡13(C−2π):1:2cos⁡13(A−2π)C-vertex=2cos⁡13(B−2π):2cos⁡13(A−2π):1[     A-vertex            =            1            : 2cos13(C-2π)            : 2cos13(B-2π);     B-vertex            = 2cos13(C-2π)            :            1            : 2cos13(A-2π);     C-vertex            = 2cos13(B-2π)            : 2cos13(A-2π)            :            1 ]
The third of Morley's 18 equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the third Morley triangle and is given by these vertices:
A-vertex=1:2cos⁡13(C+2π):2cos⁡13(B+2π)B-vertex=2cos⁡13(C+2π):1:2cos⁡13(A+2π)C-vertex=2cos⁡13(B+2π):2cos⁡13(A+2π):1[     A-vertex            =            1            : 2cos13(C+2π)            : 2cos13(B+2π);     B-vertex            = 2cos13(C+2π)            :            1            : 2cos13(A+2π);     C-vertex            = 2cos13(B+2π)            : 2cos13(A+2π)            :            1 ]
The first, second, and third Morley triangles are pairwise homothetic.  Another homothetic triangle is formed by the three points X on the circumcircle of triangle ABC at which the line XX −1 is tangent to the circumcircle, where X −1 denotes the isogonal conjugate of X.  This equilateral triangle, called the circumtangential triangle, has these vertices:
A-vertex=−csc⁡13(C−B):−csc⁡13(2C+B):−csc⁡13(C+2B)B-vertex=−csc⁡13(A+2C):−csc⁡13(A−C):−csc⁡13(2A+C)C-vertex=−csc⁡13(2B+A):−csc⁡13(B+2A):−csc⁡13(B−A)[  A-vertex         =  -13(C-B)         : -13(2C+B)         : -13(C+2B);  B-vertex         = -13(A+2C)         :  -13(A-C)         : -13(2A+C);  C-vertex         = -13(2B+A)         : -13(B+2A)         :  -13(B-A) ]
A fifth equilateral triangle, also homothetic to the others, is obtained by rotating the circumtangential triangle π/6 about its center.  Called the circumnormal triangle, its vertices are as follows:
A-vertex=−sec⁡13(C−B):−sec⁡13(2C+B):−sec⁡13(C+2B)B-vertex=−sec⁡13(A+2C):−sec⁡13(A−C):−sec⁡13(2A+C)C-vertex=−sec⁡13(2B+A):−sec⁡13(B+2A):−sec⁡13(B−A)[  A-vertex         =  -13(C-B)         : -13(2C+B)         : -13(C+2B);  B-vertex         = -13(A+2C)         :  -13(A-C)         : -13(2A+C);  C-vertex         = -13(2B+A)         : -13(B+2A)         :  -13(B-A) ]
An operation called "extraversion" can be used to obtain one of the 18 Morley triangles from another. Each triangle can be extraverted in three different ways; the 18 Morley triangles and 27 extravert pairs of triangles form the 18 vertices and 27 edges of the Pappus graph.[6]

Related triangle centers[edit]
The Morley center, X(356), centroid of the first Morley triangle, is given in trilinear coordinates by
cos⁡13A+2cos⁡13Bcos⁡13C:cos⁡13B+2cos⁡13Ccos⁡13A:cos⁡13C+2cos⁡13Acos⁡13Bcos13A+2cos13B cos13C : cos13B+2cos13C cos13A : cos13C+2cos13A cos13B
