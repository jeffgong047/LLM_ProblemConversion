3 intersections of any triangle's adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle If each vertex angle of the outer triangle is trisected, Morley's trisector theorem states that the purple triangle will be equilateral. In plane geometry, Morley's trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the first Morley triangle or simply the Morley triangle. The theorem was discovered in 1899 by Anglo-American mathematician Frank Morley. It has various generalizations; in particular, if all the trisectors are intersected, one obtains four other equilateral triangles.
