Proofs: There are many proofs of Morley's theorem, some of which are very technical.[1] Several early proofs were based on delicate trigonometric calculations. Recent proofs include an algebraic proof by Alain Connes (1998, 2004) extending the theorem to general fields other than characteristic three, and John Conway's elementary geometry proof.[2][3] The latter starts with an equilateral triangle and shows that a triangle may be built around it which will be similar to any selected triangle. Morley's theorem does not hold in spherical[4] and hyperbolic geometry. Fig 1. Elementary proof of Morley's trisector theorem One proof uses the trigonometric identity sin⁡(3θ)=4sin⁡θsin⁡(60∘+θ)sin⁡(120∘+θ)sin(3θ)=4sinθsin(60^∘+θ)sin(120^∘+θ) (1) which, by using of the sum of two angles identity, can be shown to be equal to sin⁡(3θ)=−4sin3⁡θ+3sin⁡θ.sin(3θ)=-4sin^3θ+3sinθ. The last equation can be verified by applying the sum of two angles identity to the left side twice and eliminating the cosine. Points D,E,F,E,F are constructed on BC¯BC as shown. We have 3α+3β+3γ=180∘3α+3β+3γ=180^∘, the sum of any triangle's angles, so α+β+γ=60∘.α+β+γ=60^∘. Therefore, the angles of triangle XEF are α,(60∘+β),α,(60^∘+β), and (60∘+γ).(60^∘+γ). From the figure sin⁡(60∘+β)=DX¯XE¯sin(60^∘+β)=DX/XE (2) and sin⁡(60∘+γ)=DX¯XF¯.sin(60^∘+γ)=DX/XF. (3) Also from the figure ∠AYC=180∘−α−γ=120∘+β∠AYC=180^∘-α-γ=120^∘+β and ∠AZB=120∘+γ.∠AZB=120^∘+γ. (4) The law of sines applied to triangles AYC and AZB yields sin⁡(120∘+β)=AC¯AY¯sin⁡γsin(120^∘+β)=AC/AYsinγ (5) and sin⁡(120∘+γ)=AB¯AZ¯sin⁡β.sin(120^∘+γ)=AB/AZsinβ. (6) Express the height of triangle ABC in two ways h=AB¯sin⁡(3β)=AB¯⋅4sin⁡βsin⁡(60∘+β)sin⁡(120∘+β)=ABsin(3β)=AB·4sinβsin(60^∘+β)sin(120^∘+β) and h=AC¯sin⁡(3γ)=AC¯⋅4sin⁡γsin⁡(60∘+γ)sin⁡(120∘+γ).=ACsin(3γ)=AC·4sinγsin(60^∘+γ)sin(120^∘+γ). where equation (1) was used to replace sin⁡(3β)sin(3β) and sin⁡(3γ)sin(3γ) in these two equations. Substituting equations (2) and (5) in the ββ equation and equations (3) and (6) in the γγ equation gives h=4AB¯sin⁡β⋅DX¯XE¯⋅AC¯AY¯sin⁡γ=4ABsinβ·DX/XE·AC/AYsinγ and h=4AC¯sin⁡γ⋅DX¯XF¯⋅AB¯AZ¯sin⁡β=4ACsinγ·DX/XF·AB/AZsinβ Since the numerators are equal XE¯⋅AY¯=XF¯⋅AZ¯XE·AY=XF·AZ or XE¯XF¯=AZ¯AY¯.XE/XF=AZ/AY. Since angle EXF and angle ZAY are equal and the sides forming these angles are in the same ratio, triangles XEF and AZY are similar. Similar angles AYZ and XFE equal (60∘+γ)(60^∘+γ), and similar angles AZY and XEF equal (60∘+β).(60^∘+β). Similar arguments yield the base angles of triangles BXZ and CYX.. In particular angle BZX is found to be (60∘+α)(60^∘+α) and from the figure we see that ∠AZY+∠AZB+∠BZX+∠XZY=360∘.∠AZY+∠AZB+∠BZX+∠XZY=360^∘. Substituting yields (60∘+β)+(120∘+γ)+(60∘+α)+∠XZY=360∘(60^∘+β)+(120^∘+γ)+(60^∘+α)+∠XZY=360^∘ where equation (4) was used for angle AZB and therefore ∠XZY=60∘.∠XZY=60^∘. Similarly the other angles of triangle XYZ are found to be 60∘.60^∘. Side and
