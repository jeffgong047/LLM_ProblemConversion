area: The first Morley triangle has side lengths[5] a′=b′=c′=8Rsin⁡13Asin⁡13Bsin⁡13C,^'=b^'=c^'=8R sin13A sin13B sin13C, where R is the circumradius of the original triangle and A, B, and C are the angles of the original triangle. Since the area of an equilateral triangle is 34a′2,√(3)4a'^2, the area of Morley's triangle can be expressed as Area=163R2sin213Asin213Bsin213C.Area=16√(3)R^2 sin^213A sin^213B sin^213C. Morley's
