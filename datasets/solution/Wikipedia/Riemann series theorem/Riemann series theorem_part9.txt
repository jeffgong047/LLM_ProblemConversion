M: Riemann's description of the theorem and its proof reads in full:[9] … infinite series fall into two distinct classes, depending on whether or not they remain convergent when all the terms are made positive. In the first class the terms can be arbitrarily rearranged; in the second, on the other hand, the value is dependent on the ordering of the terms. Indeed, if we denote the positive terms of a series in the second class by a1, a2, a3, ... and the negative terms by −b1, −b2, −b3, ... then it is clear that Σa as well as Σb must be infinite. For if they were both finite, the series would still be convergent after making all the signs the same. If only one were infinite, then the series would diverge. Clearly now an arbitrarily given value C can be obtained by a suitable reordering of the terms. We take alternately the positive terms of the series until the sum is greater than C, and then the negative terms until the sum is less than C. The deviation from C never amounts to more than the size of the term at the last place the signs were switched. Now, since the number a as well as the numbers b become infinitely small with increasing index, so also are the deviations from C. If we proceed sufficiently far in the series, the deviation becomes arbitrarily small, that is, the series converges to C. This can be given more detail as follows.[10] Recall that a conditionally convergent series of real terms has both infinitely many negative terms and infinitely many positive terms. First, define two quantities, an+_n^+ and an−_n^- by: an+=anifan≥00ifan<0,an−=0ifan≥0anifan<0._n^+=a_n ifa_n≥0 0 ifa_n<0,_n^-=0 ifa_n≥0 a_n ifa_n<0. That is, the series ∑n=1∞an+∑_n=1^∞a_n^+ includes all an positive, with all negative terms replaced by zeroes, and the series ∑n=1∞an−∑_n=1^∞a_n^- includes all an negative, with all positive terms replaced by zeroes. Since ∑n=1∞an∑_n=1^∞a_n is conditionally convergent, both the 'positive' and the 'negative' series diverge. Let M be any real number. Take just enough of the positive terms an+_n^+ so that their sum exceeds M. That is, let p1 be the smallest positive integer such that M<∑n=1p1an+.<∑_n=1^p_1a_n^+. This is possible because the partial sums of the an+_n^+ series tend to +∞+∞. Now let q1 be the smallest positive integer such that M>∑n=1p1an++∑n=1q1an−.>∑_n=1^p_1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_1a_n^-. This number exists because the partial sums of an−_n^- tend to −∞-∞. Now continue inductively, defining p2 as the smallest integer larger than p1 such that M<∑n=1p2an++∑n=1q1an−,<∑_n=1^p_2a_n^++∑_n=1^q_1a_n^-, and so on. The result may be viewed as a new sequence a1+,…,ap1+,a1−,…,aq1−,ap1+1+,…,ap2+,aq1+1−,…,aq2−,ap2+1+,…._1^+,…,a_p_1^+,a_1^-,…,a_q_1^-,a_p_1+1^+,…,a_p_2^+,a_q_1+1^-,…,a_q_2^-,a_p_2+1^+,…. Furthermore the partial sums of this new sequence converge to M. This can be seen from the fact that for any i, ∑n=1pi+1−1an++∑n=1qian−≤M<∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qian−,∑_n=1^p_i+1-1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_ia_n^-<∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_ia_n^-, with the first inequality holding due to the fact that pi+1 has been defined as the smallest number larger than pi which makes the second inequality true; as a consequence, it holds that 0<(∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qian−)−M≤api+1+.0<(∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_ia_n^-)-M_p_i+1^+. Since the right-hand side converges to zero due to the assumption of conditional convergence, this shows that the (pi+1 + qi)'th partial sum of the new sequence converges to M as i increases. Similarly, the (pi+1 + qi+1)'th partial sum also converges to M. Since the (pi+1 + qi + 1)'th, (pi+1 + qi + 2)'th, ... (pi+1 + qi+1 − 1)'th partial sums are valued between the (pi+1 + qi)'th and (pi+1 + qi+1)'th partial sums, it follows that the whole sequence of partial sums converges to M. Every entry in the original sequence an appears in this new sequence whose partial sums converge to M. Those entries of the original sequence which are zero will appear twice in the new sequence (once in the 'positive' sequence and once in the 'negative' sequence), and every second such appearance can be removed, which does not affect the summation in any way. The new sequence is thus a permutation of the original sequence. Existence of a rearrangement that diverges to
