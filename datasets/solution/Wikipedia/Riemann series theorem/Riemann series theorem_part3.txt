Definitions: A series ∑n=1∞an∑_n=1^∞a_n converges if there exists a value ℓℓ such that the sequence of the partial sums (S1,S2,S3,…),Sn=∑k=1nak,(S_1,S_2,S_3,…),_n=∑_k=1^na_k, converges to ℓℓ. That is, for any ε > 0, there exists an integer N such that if n ≥ N, then |Sn−ℓ|≤ε._n-ℓ|≤ε. A series converges conditionally if the series ∑n=1∞an∑_n=1^∞a_n converges but the series ∑n=1∞|an|∑_n=1^∞_n| diverges. A permutation is simply a bijection from the set of positive integers to itself. This means that if σσ is a permutation, then for any positive integer b,, there exists exactly one positive integer a such that σ(a)=b.σ(a)=b. In particular, if x≠y, then σ(x)≠σ(y)σ(x)≠σ(y).
