theorem: Given an infinite series a=(a1,a2,...)=(a_1,a_2,...), we may consider a set of "fixed points" I⊂N⊂ℕ, and study the real numbers that the series can sum to if we are only allowed to permute indices in I. That is, we letS(a,I)=∑n∈Naπ(n):πisapermutationonN,suchthat∀n∉I,π(n)=n,andthesummationconverges.(a,I)={∑_n∈ℕa_π(n):πisapermutationonℕ,suchthat,π(n)=n,andthesummationconverges.}With this notation, we have: If IΔI′' is finite, then S(a,I)=S(a,I′)(a,I)=S(a,I'). Here ΔΔ means symmetric difference. If I⊂I′' then S(a,I)⊂S(a,I′)(a,I)(a,I'). If the series is an absolutely convergent sum, then S(a,I)=∑n∈Nan(a,I)={∑_n∈ℕa_n} for any I. If the series is a conditionally convergent sum, then by Riemann series theorem, S(a,N)=[−∞,+∞](a,ℕ)=[-∞,+∞]. Sierpiński proved that rearranging only the positive terms one can obtain a series converging to any prescribed value less than or equal to the sum of the original series, but larger values in general can not be attained.[11][12][13] That is, let a be a conditionally convergent sum, then S(a,n∈N:an>0)(a,{n∈ℕ:a_n>0}) contains [−∞,∑n∈Nan][-∞,∑_n∈ℕa_n], but there is no guarantee that it contains any other number. More generally, let J be an ideal of Nℕ, then we can define S(a,J)=∪I∈JS(a,I)(a,J)=∪_IS(a,I). Let Jd_d be the set of all asymptotic density zero sets I⊂N⊂ℕ, that is, limn→∞|[0,n]∩I|n=0lim_n→∞|[0,n]|/n=0. It's clear that Jd_d is an ideal of Nℕ. (Władysław, 2007)[14] — If a is a conditionally convergent sum, then S(a,Jd)=[−∞,−∞](a,J_d)=[-∞,-∞] (that is, it is sufficient to rearrange a set of indices of asymptotic density zero). Proof sketch: Given a, a conditionally convergent sum, construct some I∈Jd_d such that ∑n∈Ian∑_na_n and ∑n∉Ian∑_na_n are both conditionally convergent. Then, rearranging ∑n∈Ian∑_na_n suffices to converge to any number in [−∞,+∞][-∞,+∞]. Filipów and Szuca proved that other ideals also have this property.[15] Steinitz's
