theorem: Main article: Lévy–Steinitz theorem Given a converging series ∑an_nof complex numbers, several cases can occur when considering the set of possible sums for all series ∑aσ(n)_σ(n) obtained by rearranging (permuting) the terms of that series: the series ∑an_n may converge unconditionally; then, all rearranged series converge, and have the same sum: the set of sums of the rearranged series reduces to one point; the series ∑an_n may fail to converge unconditionally; if S denotes the set of sums of those rearranged series that converge, then, either the set S is a line L in the complex plane C, of the form L=a+tb:t∈R,a,b∈C,b≠0,={a+tb:t∈ℝ},,b∈ℂ,≠̱0, or the set S is the whole complex plane C. More generally, given a converging series of vectors in a finite-dimensional real vector space E, the set of sums of converging rearranged series is an affine subspace of E. See
