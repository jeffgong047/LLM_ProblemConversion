sum: The alternating harmonic series is a classic example of a conditionally convergent series:∑n=1∞(−1)n+1n∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n+1/nis convergent, whereas∑n=1∞|(−1)n+1n|=∑n=1∞1n∑_n=1^∞|(-1)^n+1/n|=∑_n=1^∞1/nis the ordinary harmonic series, which diverges. Although in standard presentation the alternating harmonic series converges to ln(2), its terms can be arranged to converge to any number, or even to diverge. One instance of this is as follows. Begin with the series written in the usual order, ln⁡(2)=1−12+13−14+15−16+17−18+19⋯ln(2)=1-1/2+1/3-1/4+1/5-1/6+1/7-1/8+1/9⋯ and rearrange and regroup the terms as: 1−12−14+13−16−18+15−110−112+⋯=(1−12)−14+(13−16)−18+(15−110)−112+⋯ 1-1/2-1/4+1/3-1/6-1/8+1/5-1/10-1/12+⋯ = (1-1/2)-1/4+(1/3-1/6)-1/8+(1/5-1/10)-1/12+⋯ where the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and −1/2, whose sum is 1/2. The next term is −1/4. The next two terms are 1/3 and −1/6, whose sum is 1/6. The next term is −1/8. The next two terms are 1/5 and −1/10, whose sum is 1/10. In general, since every odd integer occurs once positively and every even integers occur once negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers), the sum is composed of blocks of three which can be simplified as: (12k−1−12(2k−1))−14k=(12(2k−1))−14k,k=1,2,….(1/2k-1-1/2(2k-1))-1/4k=(1/2(2k-1))-1/4k,=1,2,…. Hence, the above series can in fact be written as: 12−14+16−18+110+⋯+12(2k−1)−12(2k)+⋯=12(1−12+13−⋯)=12ln⁡(2) 1/2-1/4+1/6-1/8+1/10+⋯+1/2(2k-1)-1/2(2k)+⋯ = 1/2(1-1/2+1/3-⋯)=1/2ln(2) which is half the sum originally, and can only equate to the original sequence if the value were zero. This series can be demonstrated to be greater than zero by the proof of Leibniz's theorem using that the second partial sum is half.[7] Alternatively, the value of ln⁡(2)ln(2) which it converges to, cannot be zero. Hence, the value of the sequence is shown to depend on the order in which series is computed. It is true that the sequence: bn=1,−12,−14,13,−16,−18,15,−110,−112,17,−114,−116,⋯{b_n}=1,-1/2,-1/4,1/3,-1/6,-1/8,1/5,-1/10,-1/12,1/7,-1/14,-1/16,⋯ contains all elements in the sequence: an=1,−12,13,−14,15,−16,17,−18,19,−110,111,−112,113,−114,115,⋯{a_n}=1,-1/2,1/3,-1/4,1/5,-1/6,1/7,-1/8,1/9,-1/10,1/11,-1/12,1/13,-1/14,1/15,⋯ However, since the summation is defined as ∑n=1∞an:=limn→∞(a1+a2+⋯+an)∑_n=1^∞a_n:=lim_n→∞(a_1+a_2+⋯+a_n) and ∑n=1∞bn:=limn→∞(b1+b2+⋯+bn)∑_n=1^∞b_n:=lim_n→∞(b_1+b_2+⋯+b_n), the order of the terms can influence the limit.[7] Getting an arbitrary
