infinity: Let ∑i=1∞ai∑_i=1^∞a_i be a conditionally convergent series. The following is a proof that there exists a rearrangement of this series that tends to ∞∞ (a similar argument can be used to show that −∞-∞ can also be attained). The above proof of Riemann's original formulation only needs to be modified so that pi+1 is selected as the smallest integer larger than pi such that i+1<∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qian−,+1<∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_ia_n^-, and with qi+1 selected as the smallest integer larger than qi such that i+1>∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qi+1an−.+1>∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_i+1a_n^-. The choice of i+1 on the left-hand sides is immaterial, as it could be replaced by any sequence increasing to infinity. Since an−_n^- converges to zero as n increases, for sufficiently large i there is ∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qi+1an−>i,∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_i+1a_n^->i, and this proves (just as with the analysis of convergence above) that the sequence of partial sums of the new sequence diverge to infinity. Existence of a rearrangement that fails to approach any limit, finite or
