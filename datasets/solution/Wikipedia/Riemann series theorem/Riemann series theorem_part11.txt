infinite: The above proof only needs to be modified so that pi+1 is selected as the smallest integer larger than pi such that 1<∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qian−,1<∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_ia_n^-, and with qi+1 selected as the smallest integer larger than qi such that −1>∑n=1pi+1an++∑n=1qi+1an−.-1>∑_n=1^p_i+1a_n^++∑_n=1^q_i+1a_n^-. This directly shows that the sequence of partial sums contains infinitely many entries which are larger than 1, and also infinitely many entries which are less than −1, so that the sequence of partial sums cannot converge.
