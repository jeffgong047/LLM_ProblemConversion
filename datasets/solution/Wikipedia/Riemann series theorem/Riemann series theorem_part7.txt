sum: An efficient way to recover and generalize the result of the previous section is to use the fact that 1+12+13+⋯+1n=γ+ln⁡n+o(1),1+12+13+⋯+1=γ++o(1), where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, and where the notation o(1) denotes a quantity that depends upon the current variable (here, the variable is n) in such a way that this quantity goes to 0 when the variable tends to infinity. It follows that the sum of q even terms satisfies 12+14+16+⋯+12q=12γ+12ln⁡q+o(1),12+14+16+⋯+12q=12 γ+12+o(1), and by taking the difference, one sees that the sum of p odd terms satisfies 1+13+15+⋯+12p−1=12γ+12ln⁡p+ln⁡2+o(1).1+13+15+⋯+12p-1=12 γ+12+ln2+o(1). Suppose that two positive integers a and b are given, and that a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series is formed by taking, in order, a positive terms from the alternating harmonic series, followed by b negative terms, and repeating this pattern at infinity (the alternating series itself corresponds to a = b = 1, the example in the preceding section corresponds to a = 1, b = 2): 1+13+⋯+12a−1−12−14−⋯−12b+12a+1+⋯+14a−1−12b+2−⋯1+13+⋯+12a-1-12-14-⋯-12b+12a+1+⋯+14a-1-12b+2-⋯ Then the partial sum of order (a + b)n of this rearranged series contains p = an positive odd terms and q = bn negative even terms, hence S(a+b)n=12ln⁡p+ln⁡2−12ln⁡q+o(1)=12ln⁡(ab)+ln⁡2+o(1)._(a+b)n=12+ln2-12+o(1)=12ln(a/b)+ln2+o(1). It follows that the sum of this rearranged series is[8] 12ln⁡(ab)+ln⁡2=ln⁡(2ab).12ln(a/b)+ln2=ln(2√(a/b)). Suppose now that, more generally, a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series is organized in such a way that the ratio pn/qn between the number of positive and negative terms in the partial sum of order n tends to a positive limit r. Then, the sum of such a rearrangement will be ln⁡(2r),ln(2√(r)), and this explains that any real number x can be obtained as sum of a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series: it suffices to form a rearrangement for which the limit r is equal to e2x/ 4.
