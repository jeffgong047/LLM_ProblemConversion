theorem: Suppose that (a1,a2,a3,…)(a_1,a_2,a_3,…) is a sequence of real numbers, and that ∑n=1∞an∑_n=1^∞a_n is conditionally convergent. Let M be a real number. Then there exists a permutation σσ such that ∑n=1∞aσ(n)=M.∑_n=1^∞a_σ(n)=M. There also exists a permutation σσ such that ∑n=1∞aσ(n)=∞.∑_n=1^∞a_σ(n)=∞. The sum can also be rearranged to diverge to −∞-∞ or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite. Alternating harmonic
