Proof: Newton's theorem can easily be derived from Anne's theorem considering that in tangential quadrilaterals the combined lengths of opposite sides are equal (Pitot theorem: a + c = b + d). According to Anne's theorem, showing that the combined areas of opposite triangles PAD and PBC and the combined areas of triangles PAB and PCD are equal is sufficient to ensure that P lies on EF. Let r be the radius of the incircle, then r is also the altitude of all four triangles.[1] A(△PAB)+A(△PCD)=12ra+12rc=12r(a+c)=12r(b+d)=12rb+12rd=A(△PBC)+A(△PAD).A()+A() =1/2ra+1/2rc=1/2r(a+c) =1/2r(b+d)=1/2rb+1/2rd =A()+A().
