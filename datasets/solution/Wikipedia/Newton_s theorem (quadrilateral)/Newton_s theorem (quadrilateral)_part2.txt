Statement: Let ABCD be a tangential quadrilateral with at most one pair of parallel sides. Furthermore, let E and F the midpoints of its diagonals AC and BD and P be the center of its incircle. Given such a configuration the point P is located on the Newton line, that is line EF connecting the midpoints of the diagonals.[1] A tangential quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides is a rhombus. In this case, both midpoints and the center of the incircle coincide, and by definition, no Newton line exists.
