spaces: The inverse function theorem can also be generalized to differentiable maps between Banach spaces X and Y.[20] Let U be an open neighbourhood of the origin in X and F:U→Y:U a continuously differentiable function, and assume that the Fréchet derivative dF0:X→Y_0:X of F at 0 is a bounded linear isomorphism of X onto Y. Then there exists an open neighbourhood V of F(0)(0) in Y and a continuously differentiable map G:V→X:V such that F(G(y))=y(G(y))=y for all y in V. Moreover, G(y)(y) is the only sufficiently small solution x of the equation F(x)=y(x)=y. There is also the inverse function theorem for Banach manifolds.[21] Constant rank
