theorem: The inverse function theorem (and the implicit function theorem) can be seen as a special case of the constant rank theorem, which states that a smooth map with constant rank near a point can be put in a particular normal form near that point.[22] Specifically, if F:M→N:M has constant rank near a point p∈M, then there are open neighborhoods U of p and V of F(p)(p) and there are diffeomorphisms u:TpM→U:T_pM and v:TF(p)N→V:T_F(p)N such that F(U)⊆V(U) and such that the derivative dFp:TpM→TF(p)N_p:T_pM_F(p)N is equal to v−1∘F∘u^-1. That is, F "looks like" its derivative near p. The set of points p∈M such that the rank is constant in a neighborhood of p is an open dense subset of M; this is a consequence of semicontinuity of the rank function. Thus the constant rank theorem applies to a generic point of the domain. When the derivative of F is injective (resp. surjective) at a point p, it is also injective (resp. surjective) in a neighborhood of p, and hence the rank of F is constant on that neighborhood, and the constant rank theorem applies.
