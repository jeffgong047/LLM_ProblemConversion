principle: Here is a proof based on the contraction mapping theorem. Specifically, following T. Tao,[8] it uses the following consequence of the contraction mapping theorem. Lemma — Let B(0,r)(0,r) denote an open ball of radius r in Rnℝ^n with center 0. If g:B(0,r)→Rn:B(0,r)→ℝ^n is a map such that g(0)=0(0)=0 and there exists a constant 0<c<10<c<1 such that |g(y)−g(x)|≤c|y−x||g(y)-g(x)||y-x| for all x,y,y in B(0,r)(0,r), then f=I+g=I+g is injective on B(0,r)(0,r) and B(0,(1−c)r)⊂f(B(0,r))⊂B(0,(1+c)r)(0,(1-c)r)(B(0,r))(0,(1+c)r). (More generally, the statement remains true if Rnℝ^n is replaced by a Banach space.) Basically, the lemma says that a small perturbation of the identity map by a contraction map is injective and preserves a ball in some sense. Assuming the lemma for a moment, we prove the theorem first. As in the above proof, it is enough to prove the special case when a=0,b=f(a)=0=0,b=f(a)=0 and f′(0)=I'(0)=I. Let g=f−I=f-I. The mean value inequality applied to t↦g(x+t(y−x))(x+t(y-x)) says: |g(y)−g(x)|≤|y−x|sup0<t<1|g′(x+t(y−x))|.|g(y)-g(x)|≤|y-x|sup_0<t<1|g'(x+t(y-x))|. Since g′(0)=I−I=0'(0)=I-I=0 and g′' is continuous, we can find an r>0>0 such that |g(y)−g(x)|≤2−1|y−x||g(y)-g(x)|≤2^-1|y-x| for all x,y,y in B(0,r)(0,r). Then the early lemma says that f=g+I=g+I is injective on B(0,r)(0,r) and B(0,r/2)⊂f(B(0,r))(0,r/2)(B(0,r)). Then f:U=B(0,r)∩f−1(B(0,r/2))→V=B(0,r/2):U=B(0,r)^-1(B(0,r/2))=B(0,r/2) is bijective and thus has an inverse. Next, we show the inverse f−1^-1 is continuously differentiable (this part of the argument is the same as that in the previous proof). This time, let g=f−1=f^-1 denote the inverse of f and A=f′(x)=f'(x). For x=g(y)=g(y), we write g(y+k)=x+h(y+k)=x+h or y+k=f(x+h)+k=f(x+h). Now, by the early estimate, we have |h−k|=|f(x+h)−f(x)−h|≤|h|/2|h-k|=|f(x+h)-f(x)-h|≤|h|/2 and so |h|/2≤|k||h|/2≤|k|. Writing ‖⋅‖· for the operator norm, |g(y+k)−g(y)−A−1k|=|h−A−1(f(x+h)−f(x))|≤‖A−1‖|Ah−f(x+h)+f(x)|.|g(y+k)-g(y)-A^-1k|=|h-A^-1(f(x+h)-f(x))|≤A^-1|Ah-f(x+h)+f(x)|. As k→0→0, we have h→0→0 and |h|/|k||h|/|k| is bounded. Hence, g is differentiable at y with the derivative g′(y)=f′(g(y))−1'(y)=f'(g(y))^-1. Also, g′' is the same as the composition ι∘f′∘gι' where ι:T↦T−1ι:T^-1; so g′' is continuous. It remains to show the lemma. First, the map f is injective on B(0,r)(0,r) since if f(x)=f(y)(x)=f(y), then g(y)−g(x)=x−y(y)-g(x)=x-y and so |g(y)−g(x)|=|y−x||g(y)-g(x)|=|y-x|, which is a contradiction unless y=x=x. (This part does not need the assumption g(0)=0(0)=0.) Next we show f(B(0,r))⊃B(0,(1−c)r)(B(0,r))(0,(1-c)r). The idea is to note that this is equivalent to, given a point y in B(0,(1−c)r)(0,(1-c)r), find a fixed point of the map F:B¯(0,r′)→B¯(0,r′),x↦y−g(x):B(0,r')→B(0,r'), x-g(x) where 0<r′<r0<r'<r such that |y|≤(1−c)r′|y|≤(1-c)r' and the bar means a closed ball. To find a fixed point, we use the contraction mapping theorem and checking that F is a well-defined strict-contraction mapping is straightforward. Finally, we have: f(B(0,r))⊂B(0,(1+c)r)(B(0,r))(0,(1+c)r) since |f(x)|=|x+g(x)−g(0)|≤(1+c)|x|.◻|f(x)|=|x+g(x)-g(0)|≤(1+c)|x|.□ As might be clear, this proof is not substantially different from the previous one, as the proof of the contraction mapping theorem is by successive approximation.
