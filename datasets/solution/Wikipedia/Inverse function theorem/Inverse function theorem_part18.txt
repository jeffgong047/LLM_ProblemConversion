Selections: When f:Rn→Rm:ℝ^n→ℝ^m with m≤n, f is k times continuously differentiable, and the Jacobian A=∇f(x¯)=(x) at a point x¯x is of rank m, the inverse of f may not be unique. However, there exists a local selection function s such that f(s(y))=y(s(y))=y for all y in a neighborhood of y¯=f(x¯)y=f(x), s(y¯)=x¯(y)=x, s is k times continuously differentiable in this neighborhood, and ∇s(y¯)=AT(AAT)−1(y)=A^T(AA^T)^-1 (∇s(y¯)(y) is the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of A).[23] See
