version: The inverse function theorem is a local result; it applies to each point. A priori, the theorem thus only shows the function f is locally bijective (or locally diffeomorphic of some class). The next topological lemma can be used to upgrade local injectivity to injectivity that is global to some extent. Lemma — [12][full citation needed][13] If A is a closed subset of a (second-countable) topological manifold X (or, more generally, a topological space admitting an exhaustion by compact subsets) and f:X→Z:X, Z some topological space, is a local homeomorphism that is injective on A, then f is injective on some neighborhood of A. Proof:[14] First assume X is compact. If the conclusion of the theorem is false, we can find two sequences xi≠yi_i_i such that f(xi)=f(yi)(x_i)=f(y_i) and xi,yi_i,y_i each converge to some points x,y,y in A. Since f is injective on A, x=y=y. Now, if i is large enough, xi,yi_i,y_i are in a neighborhood of x=y=y where f is injective; thus, xi=yi_i=y_i, a contradiction. In general, consider the set E=(x,y)∈X2∣x≠y,f(x)=f(y)={(x,y)^2,f(x)=f(y)}. It is disjoint from S×S for any subset S⊂X where f is injective. Let X1⊂X2⊂⋯_1_2⊂⋯ be an increasing sequence of compact subsets with union X and with Xi_i contained in the interior of Xi+1_i+1. Then, by the first part of the proof, for each i, we can find a neighborhood Ui_i of A∩Xi_i such that Ui2⊂X2−E_i^2^2-E. Then U=⋃iUi=⋃_iU_i has the required property. ◻□ (See also [15] for an alternative approach.) The lemma implies the following (a sort of) global version of the inverse function theorem: Inverse function theorem — [16] Let f:U→V:U be a map between open subsets of Rn,Rmℝ^n,ℝ^m or more generally of manifolds. Assume f is continuously differentiable (or is Ck^k). If f is injective on a closed subset A⊂U and if the Jacobian matrix of f is invertible at each point of A, then f is injective in a neighborhood A′' of A and f−1:f(A′)→A′^-1:f(A')' is continuously differentiable (or is Ck^k). Note that if A is a point, then the above is the usual inverse function theorem. Holomorphic inverse function
