In mathematics, the Herzog–Schönheim conjecture is a combinatorial problem in the area of group theory, posed by Marcel Herzog and Jochanan Schönheim in 1974.[1] Let G be a group, and let A=a1G1,…,akGk={a_1G_1, ldots,_kG_k} be a finite system of left cosets of subgroups G1,…,Gk_1,…,G_k of G. Herzog and Schönheim conjectured that if A forms a partition of G with k>1>1, then the (finite) indices [G:G1],…,[G:Gk][G:G_1],…,[G:G_k] cannot be distinct. In contrast, if repeated indices are allowed, then partitioning a group into cosets is easy: if H is any subgroup of G with index k=[G:H]<∞=[G:H]<∞ then G can be partitioned into k left cosets of H.
