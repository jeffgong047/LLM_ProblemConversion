In mathematics, the identity theorem for Riemann surfaces is a theorem that states that a holomorphic function is completely determined by its values  on any subset of its domain that has a limit point.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let X and Y be Riemann surfaces, let X be connected, and let f,g:X→Y,g:X be holomorphic. Suppose that f|A=g|A|_A=g|_A for some subset A⊆X that has a limit point, where f|A:A→Y|_A:A denotes the restriction of f to A. Then f=g=g (on the whole of X).
