theorem: While the second recursion theorem is about fixed points of computable functions, the first recursion theorem is related to fixed points determined by enumeration operators, which are a computable analogue of inductive definitions. An enumeration operator is a set of pairs (A,n) where A is a (code for a) finite set of numbers and n is a single natural number. Often, n will be viewed as a code for an ordered pair of natural numbers, particularly when functions are defined via enumeration operators. Enumeration operators are of central importance in the study of enumeration reducibility. Each enumeration operator Φ determines a function from sets of naturals to sets of naturals given by Φ(X)=n∣∃A⊆X[(A,n)∈Φ].Φ(X)={n|[(A,n)∈Φ]}. A recursive operator is an enumeration operator that, when given the graph of a partial recursive function, always returns the graph of a partial recursive function. A fixed point of an enumeration operator Φ is a set F such that Φ(F) = F. The first enumeration theorem shows that fixed points can be effectively obtained if the enumeration operator itself is computable. First recursion theorem. The following statements hold. For any computable enumeration operator Φ there is a recursively enumerable set F such that Φ(F) = F and F is the smallest set with this property. For any recursive operator Ψ there is a partial computable function φ such that Ψ(φ) = φ and φ is the smallest partial computable function with this property.
