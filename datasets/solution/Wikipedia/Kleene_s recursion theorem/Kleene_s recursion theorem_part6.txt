theorem: The second recursion theorem is a generalization of Rogers's theorem with a second input in the function. One informal interpretation of the second recursion theorem is that it is possible to construct self-referential programs; see "Application to quines" below. The second recursion theorem. For any partial recursive function Q(x,y)(x,y) there is an index p such that φp≃λy.Q(p,y)φ_p≃.Q(p,y). The theorem can be proved from Rogers's theorem by letting F(p)(p) be a function such that φF(p)(y)=Q(p,y)φ_F(p)(y)=Q(p,y) (a construction described by the S-m-n theorem). One can then verify that a fixed-point of this F is an index p as required. The theorem is constructive in the sense that a fixed computable function maps an index for Q into the index p.
