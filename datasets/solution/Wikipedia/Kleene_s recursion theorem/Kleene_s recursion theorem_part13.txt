theorem: The proof of part 1 of the first recursion theorem is obtained by iterating the enumeration operator Φ beginning with the empty set. First, a sequence Fk is constructed, for k=0,1,…=0,1,…. Let F0 be the empty set. Proceeding inductively, for each k, let Fk + 1 be Fk∪Φ(Fk)_k∪Φ(F_k). Finally, F is taken to be ⋃Fk_k. The remainder of the proof consists of a verification that F is recursively enumerable and is the least fixed point of Φ. The sequence Fk used in this proof corresponds to the Kleene chain in the proof of the Kleene fixed-point theorem. The second part of the first recursion theorem follows from the first part. The assumption that Φ is a recursive operator is used to show that the fixed point of Φ is the graph of a partial function. The key point is that if the fixed point F is not the graph of a function, then there is some k such that Fk is not the graph of a function. Comparison to the second recursion
