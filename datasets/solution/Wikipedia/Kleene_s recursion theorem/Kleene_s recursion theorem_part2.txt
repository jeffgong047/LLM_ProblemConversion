Notation: The statement of the theorems refers to an admissible numbering φφ of the partial recursive functions, such that the function corresponding to index e is φeφ_e. If F and G are partial functions on the natural numbers, the notation F≃G indicates that, for each n, either F(n)(n) and G(n)(n) are both defined and are equal, or else F(n)(n) and G(n)(n) are both undefined.
