quines: A classic example using the second recursion theorem is the function Q(x,y)=x(x,y)=x. The corresponding index p in this case yields a computable function that outputs its own index when applied to any value.[8] When expressed as computer programs, such indices are known as quines. The following example in Lisp illustrates how the p in the corollary can be effectively produced from the function Q. The function s11 in the code is the function of that name produced by the S-m-n theorem. Q can be changed to any two-argument function. (setq Q '(lambda (x y) x)) (setq s11 '(lambda (f x) (list 'lambda '(y) (list f x 'y)))) (setq n (list 'lambda '(x y) (list Q (list s11 'x 'x) 'y))) (setq p (eval (list s11 n n))) The results of the following expressions should be the same. φφ p(nil) (eval (list p nil)) Q(p, nil) (eval (list Q p nil)) Application to elimination of
