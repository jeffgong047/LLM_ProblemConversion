theorem: In the context of his theory of numberings, Ershov showed that Kleene's recursion theorem holds for any precomplete numbering.[10] A Gödel numbering is a precomplete numbering on the set of computable functions so the generalized theorem yields the Kleene recursion theorem as a special case.[11] Given a precomplete numbering νν, then for any partial computable function f with two parameters there exists a total computable function t with one parameter such that ∀n∈N:ν∘f(n,t(n))=ν∘t(n).∈ℕ:ν(n,t(n))=ν(n).
