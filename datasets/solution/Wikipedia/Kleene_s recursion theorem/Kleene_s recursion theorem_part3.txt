theorem: Given a function F, a fixed point of F is an index e such that φe≃φF(e)φ_e≃φ_F(e). Note that the comparison of in- and outputs here is not in terms of numerical values, but in terms of their associated functions. Rogers describes the following result as "a simpler version" of Kleene's (second) recursion theorem.[4] Rogers's fixed-point theorem — If F is a total computable function, it has a fixed point in the above sense. Proof of the fixed-point
