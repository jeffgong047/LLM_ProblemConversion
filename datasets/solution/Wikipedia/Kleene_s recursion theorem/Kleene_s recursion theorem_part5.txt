functions: A function F such that φe≄φF(e)φ_e≄φ_F(e) for all e is called fixed-point free. The fixed-point theorem shows that no total computable function is fixed-point free, but there are many non-computable fixed-point-free functions. Arslanov's completeness criterion states that the only recursively enumerable Turing degree that computes a fixed-point-free function is 0′, the degree of the halting problem.[5] Kleene's second recursion
