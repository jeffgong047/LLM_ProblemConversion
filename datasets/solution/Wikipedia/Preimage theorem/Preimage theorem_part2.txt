Theorem: Definition. Let f:X→Y:X be a smooth map between manifolds. We say that a point y∈Y is a regular value of f if for all x∈f−1(y)inf^-1(y) the map dfx:TxX→TyY_x:T_xX_yY is surjective. Here, TxX_xX and TyY_yY are the tangent spaces of X and Y at the points x and y.. Theorem. Let f:X→Y:X be a smooth map, and let y∈Y be a regular value of f.. Then f−1(y)^-1(y) is a submanifold of X.. If y∈im(f),∈im(f), then the codimension of f−1(y)^-1(y) is equal to the dimension of Y.. Also, the tangent space of f−1(y)^-1(y) at x is equal to ker⁡(dfx).(df_x). There is also a complex version of this theorem:[3] Theorem. Let Xn^n and Ym^m be two complex manifolds of complex dimensions n>m.>m. Let g:X→Y:X be a holomorphic map and let y∈im(g)∈im(g) be such that rank(dgx)=mrank(dg_x)=m for all x∈g−1(y).^-1(y). Then g−1(y)^-1(y) is a complex submanifold of X of complex dimension n−m.-m. See
