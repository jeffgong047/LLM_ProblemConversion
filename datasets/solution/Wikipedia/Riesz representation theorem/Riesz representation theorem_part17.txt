operators: Assume Z=H=H and let Φ:=ΦH=ΦZ.Φ:=Φ_H=Φ_Z. Let A:H→H:H be a continuous (that is, bounded) linear operator. Whether or not A:H→H:H is self-adjoint, normal, or unitary depends entirely on whether or not A satisfies certain defining conditions related to its adjoint, which was shown by (Adjoint-transpose) to essentially be just the transpose tA:H∗→H∗.^tA:H^*^*. Because the transpose of A is a map between continuous linear functionals, these defining conditions can consequently be re-expressed entirely in terms of linear functionals, as the remainder of subsection will now describe in detail. The linear functionals that are involved are the simplest possible continuous linear functionals on H that can be defined entirely in terms of A,, the inner product ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩⟨ ·|· ⟩ on H,, and some given vector h∈H.. Specifically, these are ⟨Ah∣⋅⟩|· ⟩ and ⟨h∣A(⋅)⟩(·)⟩[note 7] where ⟨Ah∣⋅⟩=Φ(Ah)=(Φ∘A)hand⟨h∣A(⋅)⟩=(tA∘Φ)h.|· ⟩=Φ(Ah)=(Φ)h and (·)⟩=(^tA∘Φ)h. Self-adjoint operators See also: Self-adjoint operator, Hermitian matrix, and Symmetric matrix A continuous linear operator A:H→H:H is called self-adjoint it is equal to its own adjoint; that is, if A=A∗.=A^*. Using (Adjoint-transpose), this happens if and only if: Φ∘A=tA∘ΦΦ=^tA∘Φ where this equality can be rewritten in the following two equivalent forms: A=Φ−1∘tA∘ΦortA=Φ∘A∘Φ−1.=Φ^-1∘^tA∘Φ or ^tA=Φ∘Φ^-1. Unraveling notation and definitions produces the following characterization of self-adjoint operators in terms of the aforementioned continuous linear functionals: A is self-adjoint if and only if for all z∈H,, the linear functional ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩(·)⟩[note 7] is equal to the linear functional ⟨Az∣⋅⟩|· ⟩; that is, if and only if ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩=⟨Az∣⋅⟩forallz∈H(·)⟩=|· ⟩ forallz (Self-adjointness functionals) where if bra-ket notation is used, this is ⟨z∣A=⟨Az∣forallz∈H. = | forallz. Normal operators See also: Normal operator and Normal matrix A continuous linear operator A:H→H:H is called normal if AA∗=A∗A,^*=A^*A, which happens if and only if for all z,h∈H,,h, ⟨AA∗z∣h⟩=⟨A∗Az∣h⟩.^*z⟩=^*Az⟩. Using (Adjoint-transpose) and unraveling notation and definitions produces[proof 2] the following characterization of normal operators in terms of inner products of continuous linear functionals: A is a normal operator if and only if ⟨⟨Ah∣⋅⟩∣⟨Az∣⋅⟩⟩H∗=⟨⟨h|A(⋅)⟩∣⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩⟩H∗forallz,h∈H⟨ |· ⟩||· ⟩ ⟩_H^* = ⟨ |A(·)⟩|(·)⟩ ⟩_H^* forallz,h (Normality functionals) where the left hand side is also equal to ⟨Ah∣Az⟩¯H=⟨Az∣Ah⟩H.⟩_H=⟩_H. The left hand side of this characterization involves only linear functionals of the form ⟨Ah∣⋅⟩|· ⟩ while the right hand side involves only linear functions of the form ⟨h∣A(⋅)⟩(·)⟩ (defined as above[note 7]). So in plain English, characterization (Normality functionals) says that an operator is normal when the inner product of any two linear functions of the first form is equal to the inner product of their second form (using the same vectors z,h∈H,h for both forms). In other words, if it happens to be the case (and when A is injective or self-adjoint, it is) that the assignment of linear functionals ⟨Ah∣⋅⟩↦⟨h|A(⋅)⟩|· ⟩ ↦ |A(·)⟩ is well-defined (or alternatively, if ⟨h|A(⋅)⟩↦⟨Ah∣⋅⟩|A(·)⟩ ↦ |· ⟩ is well-defined) where h ranges over H,, then A is a normal operator if and only if this assignment preserves the inner product on H∗.^*. The fact that every self-adjoint bounded linear operator is normal follows readily by direct substitution of A∗=A^*=A into either side of A∗A=AA∗.^*A=AA^*. This same fact also follows immediately from the direct substitution of the equalities (Self-adjointness functionals) into either side of (Normality functionals). Alternatively, for a complex Hilbert space, the continuous linear operator A is a normal operator if and only if ‖Az‖=‖A∗z‖Az=A^*z for every z∈H,,[2] which happens if and only if ‖Az‖H=‖⟨z|A(⋅)⟩‖H∗foreveryz∈H.Az_H= | A(·)⟩_H^* foreveryz. Unitary operators See also: Unitary transformation and Unitary matrix An invertible bounded linear operator A:H→H:H is said to be unitary if its inverse is its adjoint: A−1=A∗.^-1=A^*. By using (Adjoint-transpose), this is seen to be equivalent to Φ∘A−1=tA∘Φ.Φ^-1=^tA∘Φ. Unraveling notation and definitions, it follows that A is unitary if and only if ⟨A−1z∣⋅⟩=⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩forallz∈H.^-1z|· ⟩=(·)⟩ forallz. The fact that a bounded invertible linear operator A:H→H:H is unitary if and only if A∗A=IdH^*A=Id_H (or equivalently, tA∘Φ∘A=Φ^tA∘Φ=Φ) produces another (well-known) characterization: an invertible bounded linear map A is unitary if and only if ⟨Az∣A(⋅)⟩=⟨z∣⋅⟩forallz∈H.(·) ⟩=|· ⟩ forallz. Because A:H→H:H is invertible (and so in particular a bijection), this is also true of the transpose tA:H∗→H∗.^tA:H^*^*. This fact also allows the vector z∈H in the above characterizations to be replaced with Az or A−1z,^-1z, thereby producing many more equalities. Similarly, ⋅ · can be replaced with A(⋅)(·) or A−1(⋅).^-1(·). See
