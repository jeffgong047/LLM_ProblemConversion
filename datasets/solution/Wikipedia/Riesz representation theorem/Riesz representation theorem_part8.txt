Observations: If φ∈H∗φ^* then φ(fφ)=⟨fφ,fφ⟩=‖fφ‖2=‖φ‖2.φ(f_φ)=_φ,f_φ⟩=f_φ^2=φ^2. So in particular, φ(fφ)≥0φ(f_φ)≥0 is always real and furthermore, φ(fφ)=0φ(f_φ)=0 if and only if fφ=0_φ=0 if and only if φ=0.φ=0. Linear functionals as affine hyperplanes A non-trivial continuous linear functional φφ is often interpreted geometrically by identifying it with the affine hyperplane A:=φ−1(1):=φ^-1(1) (the kernel ker⁡φ=φ−1(0)φ=φ^-1(0) is also often visualized alongside A:=φ−1(1):=φ^-1(1) although knowing A is enough to reconstruct ker⁡φφ because if A=∅=∅ then ker⁡φ=Hφ=H and otherwise ker⁡φ=A−Aφ=A-A). In particular, the norm of φφ should somehow be interpretable as the "norm of the hyperplane A". When φ≠0φ≠0 then the Riesz representation theorem provides such an interpretation of ‖φ‖φ in terms of the affine hyperplane[note 3] A:=φ−1(1):=φ^-1(1) as follows: using the notation from the theorem's statement, from ‖φ‖2≠0φ^2≠0 it follows that C:=φ−1(‖φ‖2)=‖φ‖2φ−1(1)=‖φ‖2A:=φ^-1(φ^2)=φ^2φ^-1(1)=φ^2A and so ‖φ‖=‖fφ‖=infc∈C‖c‖φ=f_φ=inf_cc implies ‖φ‖=infa∈A‖φ‖2‖a‖φ=inf_aφ^2a and thus ‖φ‖=1infa∈A‖a‖.φ=1/inf_aa. This can also be seen by applying the Hilbert projection theorem to A and concluding that the global minimum point of the map A→[0,∞)→[0,∞) defined by a↦‖a‖↦a is fφ‖φ‖2∈A.f_φ/φ^2. The formulas 1infa∈A‖a‖=supa∈A1‖a‖1/inf_aa=sup_a1/a provide the promised interpretation of the linear functional's norm ‖φ‖φ entirely in terms of its associated affine hyperplane A=φ−1(1)=φ^-1(1) (because with this formula, knowing only the set A is enough to describe the norm of its associated linear functional). Defining 1∞:=0,1/∞:=0, the infimum formula ‖φ‖=1infa∈φ−1(1)‖a‖φ=1/inf_a∈φ^-1(1)a will also hold when φ=0.φ=0. When the supremum is taken in Rℝ (as is typically assumed), then the supremum of the empty set is sup∅=−∞sup∅=-∞ but if the supremum is taken in the non-negative reals [0,∞)[0,∞) (which is the image/range of the norm ‖⋅‖ · when dim⁡H>0>0) then this supremum is instead sup∅=0,sup∅=0, in which case the supremum formula ‖φ‖=supa∈φ−1(1)1‖a‖φ=sup_a∈φ^-1(1)1/a will also hold when φ=0φ=0 (although the atypical equality sup∅=0sup∅=0 is usually unexpected and so risks causing confusion).
