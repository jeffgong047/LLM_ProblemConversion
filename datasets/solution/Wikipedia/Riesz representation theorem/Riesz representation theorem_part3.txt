maps: By definition, an antilinear map (also called a conjugate-linear map) f:H→Y:H is a map between vector spaces that is additive: f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)forallx,y∈H,(x+y)=f(x)+f(y) forallx,y, and antilinear (also called conjugate-linear or conjugate-homogeneous): f(cx)=c¯f(x)forallx∈Handallscalarc∈F.(cx)=cf(x) forallxandallscalarc∈𝔽. In contrast, a map f:H→Y:H is linear if it is additive and homogeneous: f(cx)=cf(x)forallx∈Handallscalarsc∈F.(cx)=cf(x) forallx andallscalarsc∈𝔽. Every constant 00 map is always both linear and antilinear. If F=R𝔽=ℝ then the definitions of linear maps and antilinear maps are completely identical. A linear map from a Hilbert space into a Banach space (or more generally, from any Banach space into any topological vector space) is continuous if and only if it is bounded; the same is true of antilinear maps. The inverse of any antilinear (resp. linear) bijection is again an antilinear (resp. linear) bijection. The composition of two antilinear maps is a linear map. Continuous dual and anti-dual spaces A functional on H is a function H→F→𝔽 whose codomain is the underlying scalar field F.𝔽. Denote by H∗^* (resp. by H¯∗)H^*) the set of all continuous linear (resp. continuous antilinear) functionals on H,, which is called the (continuous) dual space (resp. the (continuous) anti-dual space) of H..[1] If F=R𝔽=ℝ then linear functionals on H are the same as antilinear functionals and consequently, the same is true for such continuous maps: that is, H∗=H¯∗.^*=H^*. One-to-one correspondence between linear and antilinear functionals Given any functional f:H→F, : H→𝔽, the conjugate of f is the functional f¯:H→Fh↦f(h)¯.4f: H → 𝔽 h ↦ f(h). This assignment is most useful when F=C𝔽=ℂ because if F=R𝔽=ℝ then f=f¯=f and the assignment f↦f¯↦f reduces down to the identity map. The assignment f↦f¯↦f defines an antilinear bijective correspondence from the set of all functionals (resp. all linear functionals, all continuous linear functionals H∗^*) on H,, onto the set of all functionals (resp. all antilinear functionals, all continuous antilinear functionals H¯∗H^*) on H..
