Notes: ^ If F=R𝔽=ℝ then the inner product will be symmetric so it does not matter which coordinate of the inner product the element y is placed into because the same map will result. But if F=C𝔽=ℂ then except for the constant 00 map, antilinear functionals on H are completely distinct from linear functionals on H,, which makes the coordinate that y is placed into is very important. For a non-zero y∈H to induce a linear functional (rather than an antilinear functional), y must be placed into the antilinear coordinate of the inner product. If it is incorrectly placed into the linear coordinate instead of the antilinear coordinate then the resulting map will be the antilinear map h↦⟨y,h⟩=⟨h∣y⟩,↦,h⟩=⟩, which is not a linear functional on H and so it will not be an element of the continuous dual space H∗.^*. ^ This means that for all vectors y∈H:: (1) Φ:H→H∗Φ:H^* is injective. (2) The norms of y and Φ(y)Φ(y) are the same: ‖Φ(y)‖=‖y‖.Φ(y)=y. (3) ΦΦ is an additive map, meaning that Φ(x+y)=Φ(x)+Φ(y)Φ(x+y)=Φ(x)+Φ(y) for all x,y∈H.,y. (4) ΦΦ is conjugate homogeneous: Φ(sy)=s¯Φ(y)Φ(sy)=sΦ(y) for all scalars s.. (5) ΦΦ is real homogeneous: Φ(ry)=rΦ(y)Φ(ry)=rΦ(y) for all real numbers r∈R.∈ℝ. ^ a b This footnote explains how to define - using only H's operations - addition and scalar multiplication of affine hyperplanes so that these operations correspond to addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals. Let H be any vector space and let H#^# denote its algebraic dual space. Let A:=φ−1(1):φ∈H#𝒜:={φ^-1(1):φ^#} and let ⋅^ ·̂ and +^ +̂ denote the (unique) vector space operations on A𝒜 that make the bijection I:H#→A:H^#→𝒜 defined by φ↦φ−1(1)φ↦φ^-1(1) into a vector space isomorphism. Note that φ−1(1)=∅φ^-1(1)=∅ if and only if φ=0,φ=0, so ∅∅ is the additive identity of (A,+^,⋅^)(𝒜,+̂,·̂) (because this is true of I−1(∅)=0^-1(∅)=0 in H#^# and I is a vector space isomorphism). For every A∈A,∈𝒜, let ker⁡A=H=H if A=∅=∅ and let ker⁡A=A−A=A-A otherwise; if A=I(φ)=φ−1(1)=I(φ)=φ^-1(1) then ker⁡A=ker⁡φ=φ so this definition is consistent with the usual definition of the kernel of a linear functional. Say that A,B∈A,B∈𝒜 are parallel if ker⁡A=ker⁡B,=, where if A and B are not empty then this happens if and only if the linear functionals I−1(A)^-1(A) and I−1(B)^-1(B) are non-zero scalar multiples of each other. The vector space operations on the vector space of affine hyperplanes A𝒜 are now described in a way that involves only the vector space operations on H; this results in an interpretation of the vector space operations on the algebraic dual space H#^# that is entirely in terms of affine hyperplanes. Fix hyperplanes A,B∈A.,B∈𝒜. If s is a scalar then s⋅^A=h∈H:sh∈A.·̂A={h:sh}. Describing the operation A+^B+̂B in terms of only the sets A=φ−1(1)=φ^-1(1) and B=ψ−1(1)=ψ^-1(1) is more complicated because by definition, A+^B=I(φ)+^I(ψ):=I(φ+ψ)=(φ+ψ)−1(1).+̂B=I(φ)+̂I(ψ):=I(φ+ψ)=(φ+ψ)^-1(1). If A=∅=∅ (respectively, if B=∅=∅) then A+^B+̂B is equal to B (resp. is equal to A) so assume A≠∅≠∅ and B≠∅.≠∅. The hyperplanes A and B are parallel if and only if there exists some scalar r (necessarily non-0) such that A=rB,=rB, in which case A+^B=h∈H:(1+r)h∈B;+̂B={h:(1+r)h}; this can optionally be subdivided into two cases: if r=−1=-1 (which happens if and only if the linear functionals I−1(A)^-1(A) and I−1(B)^-1(B) are negatives of each) then A+^B=∅+̂B=∅ while if r≠−1≠-1 then A+^B=11+rB=r1+rA.+̂B=1/1+rB=r/1+rA. Finally, assume now that ker⁡A≠ker⁡B.≠. Then A+^B+̂B is the unique affine hyperplane containing both A∩ker⁡B∩ and B∩ker⁡A∩ as subsets; explicitly, ker⁡(A+^B)=span⁡(A∩ker⁡B−B∩ker⁡A)(A+̂B)=span(A∩-B∩) and A+^B=A∩ker⁡B+ker⁡(A+^B)=B∩ker⁡A+ker⁡(A+^B).+̂B=A∩+(A+̂B)=B∩+(A+̂B). To see why this formula for A+^B+̂B should hold, consider H:=R3,:=ℝ^3, A:=φ−1(1),:=φ^-1(1), and B:=ψ−1(1),:=ψ^-1(1), where φ(x,y,z):=xφ(x,y,z):=x and ψ(x,y,z):=x+yψ(x,y,z):=x+y (or alternatively, ψ(x,y,z):=yψ(x,y,z):=y). Then by definition, A+^B:=(φ+ψ)−1(1)+̂B:=(φ+ψ)^-1(1) and ker⁡(A+^B):=(φ+ψ)−1(0).(A+̂B):=(φ+ψ)^-1(0). Now A∩ker⁡B=φ−1(1)∩ψ−1(0)⊆(φ+ψ)−1(1)∩ = φ^-1(1)∩ψ^-1(0) ⊆ (φ+ψ)^-1(1) is an affine subspace of codimension 22 in H (it is equal to a translation of the z-axis (0,0)×R{(0,0)}×ℝ). The same is true of B∩ker⁡A.∩. Plotting an x-y-plane cross section (that is, setting z== constant) of the sets ker⁡A,ker⁡B,A,,A and B (each of which will be plotted as a line), the set (φ+ψ)−1(1)(φ+ψ)^-1(1) will then be plotted as the (unique) line passing through the A∩ker⁡B∩ and B∩ker⁡A∩ (which will be plotted as two distinct points) while (φ+ψ)−1(0)=ker⁡(A+^B)(φ+ψ)^-1(0)=(A+̂B) will be plotted the line through the origin that is parallel to A+^B=(φ+ψ)−1(1).+̂B=(φ+ψ)^-1(1). The above formulas for ker⁡(A+^B):=(φ+ψ)−1(0)(A+̂B):=(φ+ψ)^-1(0) and A+^B:=(φ+ψ)−1(1)+̂B:=(φ+ψ)^-1(1) follow naturally from the plot and they also hold in general. ^ Showing that there is a non-zero vector v in K⊥^ relies on the continuity of ϕϕ and the Cauchy completeness of H.. This is the only place in the proof in which these properties are used. ^ Technically, H=K⊕K⊥=K^ means that the addition map K×K⊥→H^ defined by (k,p)↦k+p(k,p)+p is a surjective linear isomorphism and homeomorphism. See the article on complemented subspaces for more details. ^ The usual notation for plugging an element g into a linear map F is F(g)(g) and sometimes Fg.. Replacing F with ⟨h∣:=Φh|:= produces ⟨h∣(g)|(g) or ⟨h∣g,, which is unsightly (despite being consistent with the usual notation used with functions). Consequently, the symbol ⟩ ⟩ is appended to the end, so that the notation ⟨h∣g⟩⟩ is used instead to denote this value (Φh)g.()g. ^ a b c d e The notation ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Z(·)⟩_Z denotes the continuous linear functional defined by g↦⟨z∣Ag⟩Z.↦⟩_Z. Proofs ^ This is because xK=x−⟨x,fφ⟩‖fφ‖2fφ._K=x-,f_φ⟩/f_φ^2f_φ. Now use ‖fφ‖2=‖φ‖2f_φ^2=φ^2 and ⟨x,fφ⟩=φ(x),f_φ⟩=φ(x) and solve for fφ._φ. ◼▪ ^ ⟨A∗Az∣h⟩=⟨Az∣Ah⟩H=⟨ΦAh∣ΦAz⟩H∗^*Az⟩=⟨ Az ⟩_H=⟨ | ⟩_H^* where ΦAh:=⟨Ah∣⋅⟩:=|· ⟩ and ΦAz:=⟨Az∣⋅⟩.:=|· ⟩. By definition of the adjoint, ⟨A∗h∣A∗z⟩=⟨h∣AA∗z⟩^*h^*z ⟩=^*z ⟩ so taking the complex conjugate of both sides proves that ⟨AA∗z∣h⟩=⟨A∗z∣A∗h⟩.^*z⟩=^*z^*h⟩. From A∗=Φ−1∘tA∘Φ,^*=Φ^-1∘^tA∘Φ, it follows that ⟨AA∗z|h⟩H=⟨A∗z∣A∗h⟩H=⟨Φ−1∘tA∘Φz∣Φ−1∘tA∘Φh⟩H=⟨tA∘Φh∣tA∘Φz⟩H∗^*z | h⟩_H=^*z^*h⟩_H=⟨Φ^-1∘^tA∘|Φ^-1∘^tA∘⟩_H=⟨ ^tA∘|^tA∘⟩_H^* where (tA∘Φ)h=⟨h|A(⋅)⟩(^tA∘Φ)h= | A(·)⟩ and (tA∘Φ)z=⟨z|A(⋅)⟩.(^tA∘Φ)z= | A(·)⟩. ◼▪
