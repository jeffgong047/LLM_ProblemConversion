kets: Main article: Bra–ket notation Let (H,⟨⋅,⋅⟩H)(H,⟨·,·⟩_H) be a Hilbert space and as before, let ⟨y|x⟩H:=⟨x,y⟩H. | x⟩_H:=,y⟩_H. Let Φ:H→H∗g↦⟨g∣⋅⟩H=⟨⋅,g⟩H4Φ: H → H^* g ↦ ⟨ g|· ⟩_H=⟨ ·,g ⟩_H which is a bijective antilinear isometry that satisfies (Φh)g=⟨h∣g⟩H=⟨g,h⟩Hforallg,h∈H.()g=⟩_H=,h⟩_H forallg,h. Bras Given a vector h∈H,, let ⟨h| | denote the continuous linear functional Φh; that is, ⟨h|:=Φh | := so that this functional ⟨h| | is defined by g↦⟨h∣g⟩H.↦⟨ h ⟩_H. This map was denoted by ⟨h∣⋅⟩|· ⟩ earlier in this article. The assignment h↦⟨h|↦| is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism Φ:H→H∗,Φ : H^*, which is why ⟨cg+h|=c¯⟨g∣+⟨h| +h | = c| + | holds for all g,h∈H,h and all scalars c.. The result of plugging some given g∈H into the functional ⟨h| | is the scalar ⟨h|g⟩H=⟨g,h⟩H, | g⟩_H=,h⟩_H, which may be denoted by ⟨h∣g⟩.⟩.[note 6] Bra of a linear functional Given a continuous linear functional ψ∈H∗,ψ^*, let ⟨ψ∣⟨ψ| denote the vector Φ−1ψ∈HΦ^-1ψ; that is, ⟨ψ∣:=Φ−1ψ.⟨ψ| := Φ^-1ψ. The assignment ψ↦⟨ψ∣ψ↦⟨ψ| is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism Φ−1:H∗→H,Φ^-1 : H^*, which is why ⟨cψ+ϕ∣=c¯⟨ψ∣+⟨ϕ∣ ψ+ϕ| = c⟨ψ| + ⟨ϕ| holds for all ϕ,ψ∈H∗ϕ,ψ^* and all scalars c.. The defining condition of the vector ⟨ψ|∈H⟨ψ| is the technically correct but unsightly equality ⟨⟨ψ∣∣g⟩H=ψgforallg∈H,⟨ ⟨ψ| ⟩_H = forallg, which is why the notation ⟨ψ∣g⟩⟨ψ⟩ is used in place of ⟨⟨ψ∣∣g⟩H=⟨g,⟨ψ∣⟩H.⟨ ⟨ψ| ⟩_H=, ⟨ψ|⟩_H. With this notation, the defining condition becomes ⟨ψ∣g⟩=ψgforallg∈H.⟨ψ⟩ = forallg. Kets For any given vector g∈H,, the notation |g⟩| g⟩ is used to denote g; that is, ∣g⟩:=g.⟩:=g. The assignment g↦|g⟩↦| g⟩ is just the identity map IdH:H→H,Id_H:H, which is why ∣cg+h⟩=c∣g⟩+∣h⟩ +h⟩ = c⟩ + ⟩ holds for all g,h∈H,h and all scalars c.. The notation ⟨h∣g⟩⟩ and ⟨ψ∣g⟩⟨ψ⟩ is used in place of ⟨h∣∣g⟩⟩H=⟨∣g⟩,h⟩H| ⟩ ⟩_H = ⟨⟩,h⟩_H and ⟨ψ∣∣g⟩⟩H=⟨g,⟨ψ∣⟩H,⟨ψ| ⟩ ⟩_H = , ⟨ψ|⟩_H, respectively. As expected, ⟨ψ∣g⟩=ψg ⟨ψ⟩= and ⟨h∣g⟩ ⟩ really is just the scalar ⟨h∣g⟩H=⟨g,h⟩H. ⟩_H = ,h⟩_H. Adjoints and
