product: The Hilbert space H has an associated inner product H×H→F→𝔽 valued in H's underlying scalar field F𝔽 that is linear in one coordinate and antilinear in the other (as described in detail below). If H is a complex Hilbert space (meaning, if F=C𝔽=ℂ), which is very often the case, then which coordinate is antilinear and which is linear becomes a very important technicality. However, if F=R𝔽=ℝ then the inner product is a symmetric map that is simultaneously linear in each coordinate (that is, bilinear) and antilinear in each coordinate. Consequently, the question of which coordinate is linear and which is antilinear is irrelevant for real Hilbert spaces. Notation for the inner product In mathematics, the inner product on a Hilbert space H is often denoted by ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ or ⟨⋅,⋅⟩H⟨·,·⟩_H while in physics, the bra–ket notation ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩⟨·|·⟩ or ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩H⟨·|·⟩_H is typically used instead. In this article, these two notations will be related by the equality: ⟨x,y⟩:=⟨y∣x⟩forallx,y∈H.,y⟩:=⟩ forallx,y. Competing definitions of the inner product The maps ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ and ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩⟨·|·⟩ are assumed to have the following two properties: The map ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ is linear in its first coordinate; equivalently, the map ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩⟨·|·⟩ is linear in its second coordinate. Explicitly, this means that for every fixed y∈H,, the map that is denoted by ⟨y∣⋅⟩=⟨⋅,y⟩:H→F⟨ y|· ⟩=⟨ ·,y ⟩:H→𝔽 and defined by h↦⟨y∣h⟩=⟨h,y⟩forallh∈H↦⟨ y ⟩=⟨ h,y ⟩ forallh is a linear functional on H.. In fact, this linear functional is continuous, so ⟨y∣⋅⟩=⟨⋅,y⟩∈H∗.⟨ y|· ⟩=⟨ ·,y ⟩^*. The map ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ is antilinear in its second coordinate; equivalently, the map ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩⟨·|·⟩ is antilinear in its first coordinate. Explicitly, this means that for every fixed y∈H,, the map that is denoted by ⟨⋅∣y⟩=⟨y,⋅⟩:H→F⟨ · ⟩=⟨ y,· ⟩:H→𝔽 and defined by h↦⟨h∣y⟩=⟨y,h⟩forallh∈H↦⟨ h ⟩=⟨ y,h ⟩ forallh is an antilinear functional on H.. In fact, this antilinear functional is continuous, so ⟨⋅∣y⟩=⟨y,⋅⟩∈H¯∗.⟨ · ⟩=⟨ y,· ⟩∈H^*. In mathematics, the prevailing convention (i.e. the definition of an inner product) is that the inner product is linear in the first coordinate and antilinear in the other coordinate. In physics, the convention/definition is unfortunately the opposite, meaning that the inner product is linear in the second coordinate and antilinear in the other coordinate. This article will not choose one definition over the other. Instead, the assumptions made above make it so that the mathematics notation ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ satisfies the mathematical convention/definition for the inner product (that is, linear in the first coordinate and antilinear in the other), while the physics bra–ket notation ⟨⋅|⋅⟩⟨·|·⟩ satisfies the physics convention/definition for the inner product (that is, linear in the second coordinate and antilinear in the other). Consequently, the above two assumptions makes the notation used in each field consistent with that field's convention/definition for which coordinate is linear and which is antilinear.
