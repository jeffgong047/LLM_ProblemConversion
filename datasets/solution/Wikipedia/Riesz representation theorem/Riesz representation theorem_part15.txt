adjoint: Main articles: Hermitian adjoint and Conjugate transpose For every z∈Z,, the scalar-valued map ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Z(·)⟩_Z[note 7] on H defined by h↦⟨z∣Ah⟩Z=⟨Ah,z⟩Z↦⟩_Z=,z⟩_Z is a continuous linear functional on H and so by the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector in H,, denoted by A∗z,^*z, such that ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Z=⟨A∗z∣⋅⟩H,(·)⟩_Z=^*z|· ⟩_H, or equivalently, such that ⟨z∣Ah⟩Z=⟨A∗z∣h⟩Hforallh∈H.⟩_Z=^*z⟩_H forallh. The assignment z↦A∗z^*z thus induces a function A∗:Z→H^*:Z called the adjoint of A:H→Z:H whose defining condition is ⟨z∣Ah⟩Z=⟨A∗z∣h⟩Hforallh∈Handallz∈Z.⟩_Z=^*z⟩_H forallhandallz. The adjoint A∗:Z→H^*:Z is necessarily a continuous (equivalently, a bounded) linear operator. If H is finite dimensional with the standard inner product and if M is the transformation matrix of A with respect to the standard orthonormal basis then M's conjugate transpose MT¯M^T is the transformation matrix of the adjoint A∗.^*.
