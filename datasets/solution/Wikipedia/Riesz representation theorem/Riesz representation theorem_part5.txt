space: If x=y=y then ⟨x∣x⟩=⟨x,x⟩⟨ x ⟩=⟨ x,x ⟩ is a non-negative real number and the map ‖x‖:=⟨x,x⟩=⟨x∣x⟩x:=√(,x⟩)=√(⟩) defines a canonical norm on H that makes H into a normed space.[1] As with all normed spaces, the (continuous) dual space H∗^* carries a canonical norm, called the dual norm, that is defined by[1] ‖f‖H∗:=sup‖x‖≤1,x∈H|f(x)|foreveryf∈H∗.f_H^* := sup_x≤1,x|f(x)| foreveryf^*. The canonical norm on the (continuous) anti-dual space H¯∗,H^*, denoted by ‖f‖H¯∗,f_H^*, is defined by using this same equation:[1] ‖f‖H¯∗:=sup‖x‖≤1,x∈H|f(x)|foreveryf∈H¯∗.f_H^* := sup_x≤1,x|f(x)| foreveryf∈H^*. This canonical norm on H∗^* satisfies the parallelogram law, which means that the polarization identity can be used to define a canonical inner product on H∗,^*, which this article will denote by the notations ⟨f,g⟩H∗:=⟨g∣f⟩H∗,,g⟩_H^*:=⟩_H^*, where this inner product turns H∗^* into a Hilbert space. There are now two ways of defining a norm on H∗:^*: the norm induced by this inner product (that is, the norm defined by f↦⟨f,f⟩H∗↦√(,f⟩_H^*)) and the usual dual norm (defined as the supremum over the closed unit ball). These norms are the same; explicitly, this means that the following holds for every f∈H∗:^*: sup‖x‖≤1,x∈H|f(x)|=‖f‖H∗=⟨f,f⟩H∗=⟨f∣f⟩H∗.sup_x≤1,x|f(x)|=f_H^* = √(,f⟩_H^*) = √(⟩_H^*). As will be described later, the Riesz representation theorem can be used to give an equivalent definition of the canonical norm and the canonical inner product on H∗.^*. The same equations that were used above can also be used to define a norm and inner product on H's anti-dual space H¯∗.H^*.[1] Canonical isometry between the dual and antidual The complex conjugate f¯f of a functional f,, which was defined above, satisfies ‖f‖H∗=‖f¯‖H¯∗and‖g¯‖H∗=‖g‖H¯∗f_H^* = f_H^* and g_H^* = g_H^* for every f∈H∗^* and every g∈H¯∗.∈H^*. This says exactly that the canonical antilinear bijection defined by Cong:H∗→H¯∗f↦f¯4Cong: H^* → H^* f ↦ f as well as its inverse Cong−1⁡:H¯∗→H∗Cong^-1 : H^*^* are antilinear isometries and consequently also homeomorphisms. The inner products on the dual space H∗^* and the anti-dual space H¯∗,H^*, denoted respectively by ⟨⋅,⋅⟩H∗⟨ · , · ⟩_H^* and ⟨⋅,⋅⟩H¯∗,⟨ · , · ⟩_H^*, are related by ⟨f¯|g¯⟩H¯∗=⟨f|g⟩H∗¯=⟨g|f⟩H∗forallf,g∈H∗⟨ f | g ⟩_H^*=⟨ f | g ⟩_H^*=⟨ g | f ⟩_H^* forallf,g^* and ⟨f¯|g¯⟩H∗=⟨f|g⟩H¯∗¯=⟨g|f⟩H¯∗forallf,g∈H¯∗.⟨ f | g ⟩_H^*=⟨ f | g ⟩_H^*=⟨ g | f ⟩_H^* forallf,g∈H^*. If F=R𝔽=ℝ then H∗=H¯∗^*=H^* and this canonical map Cong:H∗→H¯∗Cong:H^*→H^* reduces down to the identity map. Riesz representation
