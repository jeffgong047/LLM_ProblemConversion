theorem: Two vectors x and y are orthogonal if ⟨x,y⟩=0,,y⟩=0, which happens if and only if ‖y‖≤‖y+sx‖y≤y+sx for all scalars s..[2] The orthogonal complement of a subset C⊆H is C⊥:=y∈H:⟨y,c⟩=0forallc∈C,^:={ y:,c⟩=0forallc }, which is always a closed vector subspace of H.. The Hilbert projection theorem guarantees that for any nonempty closed convex subset C of a Hilbert space there exists a unique vector m∈C such that ‖m‖=infc∈C‖c‖;m=inf_cc; that is, m∈C is the (unique) global minimum point of the function C→[0,∞)→[0,∞) defined by c↦‖c‖.↦c.
