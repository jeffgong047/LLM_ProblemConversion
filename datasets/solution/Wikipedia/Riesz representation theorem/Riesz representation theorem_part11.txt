space: See also: Complexification Assume that H is a complex Hilbert space with inner product ⟨⋅∣⋅⟩.⟨ ·|· ⟩. When the Hilbert space H is reinterpreted as a real Hilbert space then it will be denoted by HR,_ℝ, where the (real) inner-product on HR_ℝ is the real part of H's inner product; that is: ⟨x,y⟩R:=re⁡⟨x,y⟩.,y⟩_ℝ:=re,y⟩. The norm on HR_ℝ induced by ⟨⋅,⋅⟩R⟨ · , · ⟩_ℝ is equal to the original norm on H and the continuous dual space of HR_ℝ is the set of all real-valued bounded Rℝ-linear functionals on HR_ℝ (see the article about the polarization identity for additional details about this relationship). Let ψR:=re⁡ψψ_ℝ:=reψ and ψi:=im⁡ψψ_i:=imψ denote the real and imaginary parts of a linear functional ψ,ψ, so that ψ=re⁡ψ+iim⁡ψ=ψR+iψi.ψ=reψ+iimψ=ψ_ℝ+iψ_i. The formula expressing a linear functional in terms of its real part is ψ(h)=ψR(h)−iψR(ih)forh∈H,ψ(h)=ψ_ℝ(h)-iψ_ℝ(ih) forh, where ψi(h)=−iψR(ih)ψ_i(h)=-iψ_ℝ(ih) for all h∈H.. It follows that ker⁡ψR=ψ−1(iR),ψ_ℝ=ψ^-1(iℝ), and that ψ=0ψ=0 if and only if ψR=0.ψ_ℝ=0. It can also be shown that ‖ψ‖=‖ψR‖=‖ψi‖ψ=ψ_ℝ=ψ_i where ‖ψR‖:=sup‖h‖≤1|ψR(h)|ψ_ℝ:=sup_h≤1|ψ_ℝ(h)| and ‖ψi‖:=sup‖h‖≤1|ψi(h)|ψ_i:=sup_h≤1|ψ_i(h)| are the usual operator norms. In particular, a linear functional ψψ is bounded if and only if its real part ψRψ_ℝ is bounded. Representing a functional and its real part The Riesz representation of a continuous linear function φφ on a complex Hilbert space is equal to the Riesz representation of its real part re⁡φreφ on its associated real Hilbert space. Explicitly, let φ∈H∗φ^* and as above, let fφ∈H_φ be the Riesz representation of φφ obtained in (H,⟨,⋅,⋅⟩),(H,⟨,·,·⟩), so it is the unique vector that satisfies φ(x)=⟨fφ∣x⟩φ(x)=_φ⟩ for all x∈H.. The real part of φφ is a continuous real linear functional on HR_ℝ and so the Riesz representation theorem may be applied to φR:=re⁡φφ_ℝ:=reφ and the associated real Hilbert space (HR,⟨,⋅,⋅⟩R)(H_ℝ,⟨,·,·⟩_ℝ) to produce its Riesz representation, which will be denoted by fφR._φ_ℝ. That is, fφR_φ_ℝ is the unique vector in HR_ℝ that satisfies φR(x)=⟨fφR∣x⟩Rφ_ℝ(x)=_φ_ℝ⟩_ℝ for all x∈H.. The conclusion is fφR=fφ._φ_ℝ=f_φ. This follows from the main theorem because ker⁡φR=φ−1(iR)φ_ℝ=φ^-1(iℝ) and if x∈H then ⟨fφ∣x⟩R=re⁡⟨fφ∣x⟩=re⁡φ(x)=φR(x)_φ⟩_ℝ=re_φ⟩=reφ(x)=φ_ℝ(x) and consequently, if m∈ker⁡φR∈φ_ℝ then ⟨fφ∣m⟩R=0,_φ⟩_ℝ=0, which shows that fφ∈(ker⁡φR)⊥R._φ∈(φ_ℝ)^⊥_ℝ. Moreover, φ(fφ)=‖φ‖2φ(f_φ)=φ^2 being a real number implies that φR(fφ)=re⁡φ(fφ)=‖φ‖2.φ_ℝ(f_φ)=reφ(f_φ)=φ^2. In other words, in the theorem and constructions above, if H is replaced with its real Hilbert space counterpart HR_ℝ and if φφ is replaced with re⁡φreφ then fφ=fre⁡φ._φ=f_reφ. This means that vector fφ_φ obtained by using (HR,⟨,⋅,⋅⟩R)(H_ℝ,⟨,·,·⟩_ℝ) and the real linear functional re⁡φreφ is the equal to the vector obtained by using the origin complex Hilbert space (H,⟨,⋅,⋅⟩)(H,⟨,·,·⟩) and original complex linear functional φφ (with identical norm values as well). Furthermore, if φ≠0φ≠0 then fφ_φ is perpendicular to ker⁡φRφ_ℝ with respect to ⟨⋅,⋅⟩R⟨·,·⟩_ℝ where the kernel of φφ is be a proper subspace of the kernel of its real part φR.φ_ℝ. Assume now that φ≠0.φ≠0. Then fφ∉ker⁡φR_φ∉φ_ℝ because φR(fφ)=φ(fφ)=‖φ‖2≠0φ_ℝ(f_φ)=φ(f_φ)=φ^2≠0 and ker⁡φφ is a proper subset of ker⁡φR.φ_ℝ. The vector subspace ker⁡φφ has real codimension 11 in ker⁡φR,φ_ℝ, while ker⁡φRφ_ℝ has real codimension 11 in HR,_ℝ, and ⟨fφ,ker⁡φR⟩R=0._φ,φ_ℝ⟩_ℝ=0. That is, fφ_φ is perpendicular to ker⁡φRφ_ℝ with respect to ⟨⋅,⋅⟩R.⟨·,·⟩_ℝ. Canonical injections into the dual and
