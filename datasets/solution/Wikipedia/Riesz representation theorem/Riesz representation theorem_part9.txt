vector: Using the notation from the theorem above, several ways of constructing fφ_φ from φ∈H∗φ^* are now described. If φ=0φ=0 then fφ:=0_φ:=0; in other words, f0=0._0=0. This special case of φ=0φ=0 is henceforth assumed to be known, which is why some of the constructions given below start by assuming φ≠0.φ≠0. Orthogonal complement of kernel If φ≠0φ≠0 then for any 0≠u∈(ker⁡φ)⊥,0∈(φ)^, fφ:=φ(u)¯u‖u‖2._φ:=φ(u)u/u^2. If u∈(ker⁡φ)⊥∈(φ)^ is a unit vector (meaning ‖u‖=1u=1) then fφ:=φ(u)¯u_φ:=φ(u)u (this is true even if φ=0φ=0 because in this case fφ=φ(u)¯u=0¯u=0_φ=φ(u)u=0u=0). If u is a unit vector satisfying the above condition then the same is true of −u,-u, which is also a unit vector in (ker⁡φ)⊥.(φ)^. However, φ(−u)¯(−u)=φ(u)¯u=fφφ(-u)(-u)=φ(u)u=f_φ so both these vectors result in the same fφ._φ. Orthogonal projection onto kernel If x∈H is such that φ(x)≠0φ(x)≠0 and if xK_K is the orthogonal projection of x onto ker⁡φφ then[proof 1] fφ=‖φ‖2φ(x)(x−xK)._φ=φ^2/φ(x)(x-x_K). Orthonormal basis Given an orthonormal basis eii∈I{e_i}_i of H and a continuous linear functional φ∈H∗,φ^*, the vector fφ∈H_φ can be constructed uniquely by fφ=∑i∈Iφ(ei)¯ei_φ=∑_iφ(e_i)e_i where all but at most countably many φ(ei)φ(e_i) will be equal to 00 and where the value of fφ_φ does not actually depend on choice of orthonormal basis (that is, using any other orthonormal basis for H will result in the same vector). If y∈H is written as y=∑i∈Iaiei=∑_ia_ie_i then φ(y)=∑i∈Iφ(ei)ai=⟨fφ|y⟩φ(y)=∑_iφ(e_i)a_i=_φ|y⟩ and ‖fφ‖2=φ(fφ)=∑i∈Iφ(ei)φ(ei)¯=∑i∈I|φ(ei)|2=‖φ‖2.f_φ^2=φ(f_φ)=∑_iφ(e_i)φ(e_i)=∑_i|φ(e_i)|^2=φ^2. If the orthonormal basis eii∈I=eii=1∞{e_i}_i={e_i}_i=1^∞ is a sequence then this becomes fφ=φ(e1)¯e1+φ(e2)¯e2+⋯_φ=φ(e_1)e_1+φ(e_2)e_2+⋯ and if y∈H is written as y=∑i∈Iaiei=a1e1+a2e2+⋯=∑_ia_ie_i=a_1e_1+a_2e_2+⋯ then φ(y)=φ(e1)a1+φ(e2)a2+⋯=⟨fφ|y⟩.φ(y)=φ(e_1)a_1+φ(e_2)a_2+⋯=_φ|y⟩.
