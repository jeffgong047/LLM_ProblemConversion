transposes: Main article: Transpose of a linear map See also: Transpose It is also possible to define the transpose or algebraic adjoint of A:H→Z,:H, which is the map tA:Z∗→H∗^tA:Z^*^* defined by sending a continuous linear functionals ψ∈Z∗ψ^* to tA(ψ):=ψ∘A,^tA(ψ):=ψ, where the composition ψ∘Aψ is always a continuous linear functional on H and it satisfies ‖A‖=‖tA‖A=^tA (this is true more generally, when H and Z are merely normed spaces).[5] So for example, if z∈Z then tA^tA sends the continuous linear functional ⟨z∣⋅⟩Z∈Z∗|·⟩_Z^* (defined on Z by g↦⟨z∣g⟩Z↦⟩_Z) to the continuous linear functional ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Z∈H∗(·)⟩_Z^* (defined on H by h↦⟨z∣A(h)⟩Z↦(h)⟩_Z);[note 7] using bra-ket notation, this can be written as tA⟨z∣=⟨z∣A^tA| = where the juxtaposition of ⟨z∣| with A on the right hand side denotes function composition: H→AZ→⟨z∣C.Zℂ. The adjoint A∗:Z→H^*:Z is actually just to the transpose tA:Z∗→H∗^tA:Z^*^*[2] when the Riesz representation theorem is used to identify Z with Z∗^* and H with H∗.^*. Explicitly, the relationship between the adjoint and transpose is: tA∘ΦZ=ΦH∘A∗^tA ∘ Φ_Z = Φ_H ∘ A^* (Adjoint-transpose) which can be rewritten as: A∗=ΦH−1∘tA∘ΦZandtA=ΦH∘A∗∘ΦZ−1.^* = Φ_H^-1 ∘ ^tA ∘ Φ_Z and ^tA = Φ_H ∘ A^* ∘ Φ_Z^-1. Proof To show that tA∘ΦZ=ΦH∘A∗,^tA ∘ Φ_Z = Φ_H ∘ A^*, fix z∈Z.. The definition of tA^tA implies (tA∘ΦZ)z=tA(ΦZz)=(ΦZz)∘A(^tA∘Φ_Z)z=^tA(Φ_Zz)=(Φ_Zz) so it remains to show that (ΦZz)∘A=ΦH(A∗z).(Φ_Zz)=Φ_H(A^*z). If h∈H then ((ΦZz)∘A)h=(ΦZz)(Ah)=⟨z∣Ah⟩Z=⟨A∗z∣h⟩H=(ΦH(A∗z))h,((Φ_Zz))h=(Φ_Zz)(Ah)=⟩_Z=^*z⟩_H=(Φ_H(A^*z))h, as desired. ◼▪ Alternatively, the value of the left and right hand sides of (Adjoint-transpose) at any given z∈Z can be rewritten in terms of the inner products as: (tA∘ΦZ)z=⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Zand(ΦH∘A∗)z=⟨A∗z∣⋅⟩H(^tA ∘ Φ_Z)z=(·)⟩_Z and (Φ_H ∘ A^*)z=^*z|· ⟩_H so that tA∘ΦZ=ΦH∘A∗^tA ∘ Φ_Z = Φ_H ∘ A^* holds if and only if ⟨z∣A(⋅)⟩Z=⟨A∗z∣⋅⟩H(·)⟩_Z=^*z|· ⟩_H holds; but the equality on the right holds by definition of A∗z.^*z. The defining condition of A∗z^*z can also be written ⟨z∣A=⟨A∗z∣ = ^*z| if bra-ket notation is used. Descriptions of self-adjoint, normal, and unitary
