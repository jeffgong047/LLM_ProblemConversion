Statement: Riesz representation theorem — Let H be a Hilbert space whose inner product ⟨x,y⟩,y⟩ is linear in its first argument and antilinear in its second argument and let ⟨y∣x⟩:=⟨x,y⟩⟩:=,y⟩ be the corresponding physics notation. For every continuous linear functional φ∈H∗,φ^*, there exists a unique vector fφ∈H,_φ, called the Riesz representation of φ,φ, such that[3] φ(x)=⟨x,fφ⟩=⟨fφ∣x⟩forallx∈H.φ(x)=,f_φ⟩=_φ⟩ forallx. Importantly for complex Hilbert spaces, fφ_φ is always located in the antilinear coordinate of the inner product.[note 1] Furthermore, the length of the representation vector is equal to the norm of the functional: ‖fφ‖H=‖φ‖H∗,f_φ_H=φ_H^*, and fφ_φ is the unique vector fφ∈(ker⁡φ)⊥_φ∈(φ)^ with φ(fφ)=‖φ‖2.φ(f_φ)=φ^2. It is also the unique element of minimum norm in C:=φ−1(‖φ‖2):=φ^-1(φ^2); that is to say, fφ_φ is the unique element of C satisfying ‖fφ‖=infc∈C‖c‖.f_φ=inf_cc. Moreover, any non-zero q∈(ker⁡φ)⊥∈(φ)^ can be written as q=(‖q‖2/φ(q)¯)fφ.=(q^2/ φ(q))_φ. Corollary — The canonical map from H into its dual H∗^*[1] is the injective antilinear operator isometry[note 2][1] Φ:H→H∗y↦⟨⋅,y⟩=⟨y|⋅⟩4Φ: H → H^* y ↦ ⟨ · ,y⟩=| · ⟩ The Riesz representation theorem states that this map is surjective (and thus bijective) when H is complete and that its inverse is the bijective isometric antilinear isomorphism Φ−1:H∗→Hφ↦fφ.4Φ^-1: H^* → H φ ↦ f_φ . Consequently, every continuous linear functional on the Hilbert space H can be written uniquely in the form ⟨y|⋅⟩ | · ⟩[1] where ‖⟨y|⋅⟩‖H∗=‖y‖H |·⟩_H^*=y_H for every y∈H.. The assignment y↦⟨y,⋅⟩=⟨⋅|y⟩↦,·⟩=⟨· | y⟩ can also be viewed as a bijective linear isometry H→H¯∗→H^* into the anti-dual space of H,,[1] which is the complex conjugate vector space of the continuous dual space H∗.^*. The inner products on H and H∗^* are related by ⟨Φh,Φk⟩H∗=⟨h,k⟩¯H=⟨k,h⟩Hforallh,k∈H⟨,⟩_H^*=,k⟩_H=,h⟩_H forallh,k and similarly, ⟨Φ−1φ,Φ−1ψ⟩H=⟨φ,ψ⟩¯H∗=⟨ψ,φ⟩H∗forallφ,ψ∈H∗.⟨Φ^-1φ,Φ^-1ψ⟩_H=⟨φ,ψ⟩_H^*=⟨ψ,φ⟩_H^* forallφ,ψ^*. The set C:=φ−1(‖φ‖2):=φ^-1(φ^2) satisfies C=fφ+ker⁡φ=f_φ+φ and C−fφ=ker⁡φ-f_φ=φ so when fφ≠0_φ≠0 then C can be interpreted as being the affine hyperplane[note 3] that is parallel to the vector subspace ker⁡φφ and contains fφ._φ. For y∈H,, the physics notation for the functional Φ(y)∈H∗Φ(y)^* is the bra ⟨y|,|, where explicitly this means that ⟨y|:=Φ(y),|:=Φ(y), which complements the ket notation |y⟩|y⟩ defined by |y⟩:=y.|y⟩:=y. In the mathematical treatment of quantum mechanics, the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular bra–ket notation. The theorem says that, every bra ⟨ψ|⟨ψ | has a corresponding ket |ψ⟩,| ψ⟩, and the latter is unique. Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to Riesz and Fréchet in 1907 (see references). Proof[4] Let F𝔽 denote the underlying scalar field of H.. Proof of norm formula: Fix y∈H.. Define Λ:H→FΛ:H→𝔽 by Λ(z):=⟨y|z⟩,Λ(z):=⟨ y | z ⟩, which is a linear functional on H since z is in the linear argument. By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, |Λ(z)|=|⟨y|z⟩|≤‖y‖‖z‖|Λ(z)|=|⟨ y | z ⟩|≤yz which shows that ΛΛ is bounded (equivalently, continuous) and that ‖Λ‖≤‖y‖.Λ≤y. It remains to show that ‖y‖≤‖Λ‖.y≤Λ. By using y in place of z,, it follows that ‖y‖2=⟨y|y⟩=Λy=|Λ(y)|≤‖Λ‖‖y‖y^2=⟨ y | y ⟩==|Λ(y)|≤Λy (the equality Λy=|Λ(y)|=|Λ(y)| holds because Λy=‖y‖2≥0=y^2≥0 is real and non-negative). Thus that ‖Λ‖=‖y‖.Λ=y. ◼▪ The proof above did not use the fact that H is complete, which shows that the formula for the norm ‖⟨y|⋅⟩‖H∗=‖y‖H⟨ y | · ⟩_H^*=y_H holds more generally for all inner product spaces. Proof that a Riesz representation of φφ is unique: Suppose f,g∈H,g are such that φ(z)=⟨f|z⟩φ(z)=⟨ f | z ⟩ and φ(z)=⟨g|z⟩φ(z)=⟨ g | z ⟩ for all z∈H.. Then ⟨f−g|z⟩=⟨f|z⟩−⟨g|z⟩=φ(z)−φ(z)=0forallz∈H⟨ f-g | z ⟩=⟨ f | z ⟩-⟨ g | z ⟩=φ(z)-φ(z)=0 forallz which shows that Λ:=⟨f−g|⋅⟩Λ:=⟨ f-g | · ⟩ is the constant 00 linear functional. Consequently 0=‖⟨f−g|⋅⟩‖=‖f−g‖,0=⟨ f-g | · ⟩=f-g, which implies that f−g=0.-g=0. ◼▪ Proof that a vector fφ_φ representing φφ exists: Let K:=ker⁡φ:=m∈H:φ(m)=0.:=φ:={m:φ(m)=0}. If K=H=H (or equivalently, if φ=0φ=0) then taking fφ:=0_φ:=0 completes the proof so assume that K≠H and φ≠0.φ≠0. The continuity of φφ implies that K is a closed subspace of H (because K=φ−1(0)=φ^-1({0}) and 0{0} is a closed subset of F𝔽). Let K⊥:=v∈H:⟨v|k⟩=0forallk∈K^:={v : ⟨ v | k ⟩=0 forallk} denote the orthogonal complement of K in H.. Because K is closed and H is a Hilbert space,[note 4] H can be written as the direct sum H=K⊕K⊥=K^[note 5] (a proof of this is given in the article on the Hilbert projection theorem). Because K≠H,, there exists some non-zero p∈K⊥.^. For any h∈H,, φ[(φh)p−(φp)h]=φ[(φh)p]−φ[(φp)h]=(φh)φp−(φp)φh=0,φ[()p-()h] = φ[()p]-φ[()h] = ()-()=0, which shows that (φh)p−(φp)h∈ker⁡φ=K,()p-()h ∈ φ=K, where now p∈K⊥^ implies 0=⟨p|(φh)p−(φp)h⟩=⟨p|(φh)p⟩−⟨p|(φp)h⟩=(φh)⟨p|p⟩−(φp)⟨p|h⟩.0=⟨ p | ()p-()h ⟩ = ⟨ p | ()p ⟩-⟨ p | ()h ⟩ = ()⟨ p | p ⟩-()⟨ p | h ⟩. Solving for φh shows that φh=(φp)⟨p|h⟩‖p‖2=⟨φp¯‖p‖2p|h⟩foreveryh∈H,=()⟨ p | h ⟩/p^2=⟨ /p^2p | h ⟩ foreveryh, which proves that the vector fφ:=φp¯‖p‖2p_φ:=/p^2p satisfies φh=⟨fφ|h⟩foreveryh∈H.=⟨ f_φ | h ⟩foreveryh. Applying the norm formula that was proved above with y:=fφ:=f_φ shows that ‖φ‖H∗=‖⟨fφ|⋅⟩‖H∗=‖fφ‖H.φ_H^*=⟨ f_φ | · ⟩_H^*=f_φ_H. Also, the vector u:=p‖p‖:=p/p has norm ‖u‖=1u=1 and satisfies fφ:=φ(u)¯u._φ:=φ(u)u. ◼▪ It can now be deduced that K⊥^ is 11-dimensional when φ≠0.φ≠0. Let q∈K⊥^ be any non-zero vector. Replacing p with q in the proof above shows that the vector g:=φq¯‖q‖2q:=/q^2q satisfies φ(h)=⟨g|h⟩φ(h)=⟨ g | h ⟩ for every h∈H.. The uniqueness of the (non-zero) vector fφ_φ representing φφ implies that fφ=g,_φ=g, which in turn implies that φq¯≠0≠0 and q=‖q‖2φq¯fφ.=q^2/f_φ. Thus every vector in K⊥^ is a scalar multiple of fφ._φ. ◼▪ The formulas for the inner products follow from the polarization identity.
