anti-dual: Induced linear map into anti-dual The map defined by placing y into the linear coordinate of the inner product and letting the variable h∈H vary over the antilinear coordinate results in an antilinear functional: ⟨⋅∣y⟩=⟨y,⋅⟩:H→Fdefinedbyh↦⟨h∣y⟩=⟨y,h⟩.⟨ · ⟩=⟨ y,· ⟩:H→𝔽 definedby↦⟨ h ⟩=⟨ y,h ⟩. This map is an element of H¯∗,H^*, which is the continuous anti-dual space of H.. The canonical map from H into its anti-dual H¯∗H^*[1] is the linear operator InHH¯∗:H→H¯∗y↦⟨⋅∣y⟩=⟨y,⋅⟩4In_H^H^*: H → H^* y ↦ ⟨ · ⟩=⟨ y,· ⟩ which is also an injective isometry.[1] The Fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces, which is related to Riesz representation theorem, states that this map is surjective (and thus bijective). Consequently, every antilinear functional on H can be written (uniquely) in this form.[1] If Cong:H∗→H¯∗Cong:H^*→H^* is the canonical antilinear bijective isometry f↦f¯↦f that was defined above, then the following equality holds: Cong⁡∘InHH∗⁡=InHH¯∗.Cong ∘ In_H^H^* = In_H^H^*.
