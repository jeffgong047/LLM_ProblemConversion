transformations: Consider the special case of H=Cn=ℂ^n (where n>0>0 is an integer) with the standard inner product ⟨z∣w⟩:=z→¯Tw→forallw,z∈H⟩:= z⃗ ^Tw⃗ forall w,z where wandzandz are represented as column matrices w→:=[w1⋮wn]w⃗:=[ w_1; ⋮; w_n ] and z→:=[z1⋮zn]z⃗:=[ z_1; ⋮; z_n ] with respect to the standard orthonormal basis e1,…,en_1,…,e_n on H (here, ei_i is 11 at its ith coordinate and 00 everywhere else; as usual, H∗^* will now be associated with the dual basis) and where z→¯T:=[z1¯,…,zn¯] z⃗ ^T:=[z_1,…,z_n] denotes the conjugate transpose of z→.z⃗. Let φ∈H∗φ^* be any linear functional and let φ1,…,φn∈Cφ_1,…,φ_n∈ℂ be the unique scalars such that φ(w1,…,wn)=φ1w1+⋯+φnwnforallw:=(w1,…,wn)∈H,φ(w_1,…,w_n)=φ_1w_1+⋯+φ_nw_n forall w:=(w_1,…,w_n), where it can be shown that φi=φ(ei)φ_i=φ(e_i) for all i=1,…,n.=1,…,n. Then the Riesz representation of φφ is the vector fφ:=φ1¯e1+⋯+φn¯en=(φ1¯,…,φn¯)∈H._φ := φ_1e_1+⋯+φ_ne_n = (φ_1,…,φ_n). To see why, identify every vector w=(w1,…,wn)=(w_1,…,w_n) in H with the column matrix w→:=[w1⋮wn]w⃗:=[ w_1; ⋮; w_n ] so that fφ_φ is identified with fφ→:=[φ1¯⋮φn¯]=[φ(e1)¯⋮φ(en)¯].f⃗_⃗φ⃗:=[ φ_1; ⋮; φ_n ]=[ φ(e_1); ⋮; φ(e_n) ]. As usual, also identify the linear functional φφ with its transformation matrix, which is the row matrix φ→:=[φ1,…,φn]φ⃗:=[φ_1,…,φ_n] so that fφ→:=φ→¯Tf⃗_⃗φ⃗:= φ⃗ ^T and the function φφ is the assignment w→↦φ→w→,w⃗↦φ⃗ w⃗, where the right hand side is matrix multiplication. Then for all w=(w1,…,wn)∈H,=(w_1,…,w_n), φ(w)=φ1w1+⋯+φnwn=[φ1,…,φn][w1⋮wn]=[φ1¯⋮φn¯]¯Tw→=fφ→¯Tw→=⟨fφ∣w⟩,φ(w)=φ_1w_1+⋯+φ_nw_n=[φ_1,…,φ_n][ w_1; ⋮; w_n ]=[ φ_1; ⋮; φ_n ]^Tw⃗= f⃗_⃗φ⃗ ^Tw⃗=⟨ f_φ | w ⟩, which shows that fφ_φ satisfies the defining condition of the Riesz representation of φ.φ. The bijective antilinear isometry Φ:H→H∗Φ:H^* defined in the corollary to the Riesz representation theorem is the assignment that sends z=(z1,…,zn)∈H=(z_1,…,z_n) to the linear functional Φ(z)∈H∗Φ(z)^* on H defined by w=(w1,…,wn)↦⟨z∣w⟩=z1¯w1+⋯+zn¯wn,=(w_1,…,w_n) ↦ ⟨ z | w ⟩=z_1w_1+⋯+z_nw_n, where under the identification of vectors in H with column matrices and vector in H∗^* with row matrices, ΦΦ is just the assignment z→=[z1⋮zn]↦z→¯T=[z1¯,…,zn¯].z⃗=[ z_1; ⋮; z_n ] ↦ z⃗ ^T=[z_1,…,z_n]. As described in the corollary, ΦΦ's inverse Φ−1:H∗→HΦ^-1:H^* is the antilinear isometry φ↦fφ,φ_φ, which was just shown above to be: φ↦fφ:=(φ(e1)¯,…,φ(en)¯);φ ↦ f_φ := (φ(e_1),…,φ(e_n)); where in terms of matrices, Φ−1Φ^-1 is the assignment φ→=[φ1,…,φn]↦φ→¯T=[φ1¯⋮φn¯].φ⃗=[φ_1,…,φ_n] ↦ φ⃗ ^T=[ φ_1; ⋮; φ_n ]. Thus in terms of matrices, each of Φ:H→H∗Φ:H^* and Φ−1:H∗→HΦ^-1:H^* is just the operation of conjugate transposition v→↦v→¯Tv⃗↦ v⃗ ^T (although between different spaces of matrices: if H is identified with the space of all column (respectively, row) matrices then H∗^* is identified with the space of all row (respectively, column matrices). This example used the standard inner product, which is the map ⟨z∣w⟩:=z→¯Tw→,⟩:= z⃗ ^Tw⃗, but if a different inner product is used, such as ⟨z∣w⟩M:=z→¯TMw→⟩_M:= z⃗ ^T M w⃗ where M is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix, or if a different orthonormal basis is used then the transformation matrices, and thus also the above formulas, will be different.
