In modal logic, Sahlqvist formulas are a certain kind of modal formula with remarkable properties. The Sahlqvist correspondence theorem states that every Sahlqvist formula is canonical, and corresponds to a first-order definable class of Kripke frames. 
Sahlqvist's definition characterizes a decidable set of modal formulas with first-order correspondents. Since it is undecidable, by Chagrova's theorem, whether an arbitrary modal formula has a first-order correspondent, there are formulas with first-order frame conditions that are not Sahlqvist [Chagrova 1991] (see the examples below). Hence Sahlqvist formulas define only a (decidable) subset of modal formulas with first-order correspondents.


Definition[edit]
Sahlqvist formulas are built up from implications, where the consequent is positive and the antecedent is of a restricted form.

A boxed atom is a propositional atom preceded by a number (possibly 0) of boxes, i.e. a formula of the form ◻⋯◻p⋯ (often abbreviated as ◻ip^ip for 0≤i<ω0<ω).
A Sahlqvist antecedent is a formula constructed using ∧, ∨, and ◊ from boxed atoms, and negative formulas (including the constants ⊥, ⊤).
A Sahlqvist implication is a formula A → B, where A is a Sahlqvist antecedent, and B is a positive formula.
A Sahlqvist formula is constructed from Sahlqvist implications using ∧ and ◻ (unrestricted), and using ∨ on formulas with no common variables.
Examples of Sahlqvist formulas[edit]
p→◊p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀xRxx Rxx, and it defines all reflexive frames
p→◻◊p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀x∀y[Rxy→Ryx][Rxy], and it defines all symmetric frames
◊◊p→◊p→ or ◻p→◻◻p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀x∀y∀z[(Rxy∧Ryz)→Rxz][(Rxy)], and it defines all transitive frames
◊p→◊◊p→ or ◻◻p→◻p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀x∀y[Rxy→∃z(Rxz∧Rzy)][Rxy→(Rxz)], and it defines all dense frames
◻p→◊p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀x∃yRxy Rxy, and it defines all right-unbounded frames (also called serial)
◊◻p→◻◊p→
Its first-order corresponding formula is ∀x∀x1∀z0[Rxx1∧Rxz0→∃z1(Rx1z1∧Rz0z1)]_1_0[Rxx_1_0→_1(Rx_1z_1_0z_1)], and it is the Church-Rosser property.
Examples of non-Sahlqvist formulas[edit]
◻◊p→◊◻p→
This is the McKinsey formula; it does not have a first-order frame condition.
◻(◻p→p)→◻p()→
The Löb axiom is not Sahlqvist; again, it does not have a first-order frame condition.
(◻◊p→◊◻p)∧(◊◊q→◊q)(→)(→)
The conjunction of the McKinsey formula and the (4) axiom has a first-order frame condition (the conjunction of the transitivity property with the property ∀x[∀y(Rxy→∃z[Ryz])→∃y(Rxy∧∀z[Ryz→z=y])][(Rxy→[Ryz])→(Rxy∧[Ryz=y])]) but is not equivalent to any Sahlqvist formula.
Kracht's theorem[edit]
When a Sahlqvist formula is used as an axiom in a normal modal logic, the logic is guaranteed to be complete with respect to the elementary class of frames the axiom defines. This result comes from the Sahlqvist completeness theorem [Modal Logic, Blackburn et al., Theorem 4.42]. But there is also a converse theorem, namely a theorem that states which first-order conditions are the correspondents of Sahlqvist formulas. Kracht's theorem states that any Sahlqvist formula locally corresponds to a Kracht formula; and conversely, every Kracht formula is a local first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist formula which can be effectively obtained from the Kracht formula [Modal Logic, Blackburn et al., Theorem 3.59].
