formulas: ◻◊p→◊◻p→ This is the McKinsey formula; it does not have a first-order frame condition. ◻(◻p→p)→◻p()→ The Löb axiom is not Sahlqvist; again, it does not have a first-order frame condition. (◻◊p→◊◻p)∧(◊◊q→◊q)(→)(→) The conjunction of the McKinsey formula and the (4) axiom has a first-order frame condition (the conjunction of the transitivity property with the property ∀x[∀y(Rxy→∃z[Ryz])→∃y(Rxy∧∀z[Ryz→z=y])][(Rxy→[Ryz])→(Rxy∧[Ryz=y])]) but is not equivalent to any Sahlqvist formula.
