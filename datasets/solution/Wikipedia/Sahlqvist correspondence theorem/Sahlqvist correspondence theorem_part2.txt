Definition: Sahlqvist formulas are built up from implications, where the consequent is positive and the antecedent is of a restricted form. A boxed atom is a propositional atom preceded by a number (possibly 0) of boxes, i.e. a formula of the form ◻⋯◻p⋯ (often abbreviated as ◻ip^ip for 0≤i<ω0<ω). A Sahlqvist antecedent is a formula constructed using ∧, ∨, and ◊ from boxed atoms, and negative formulas (including the constants ⊥, ⊤). A Sahlqvist implication is a formula A → B, where A is a Sahlqvist antecedent, and B is a positive formula. A Sahlqvist formula is constructed from Sahlqvist implications using ∧ and ◻ (unrestricted), and using ∨ on formulas with no common variables. Examples of Sahlqvist
