distributions: The Fourier transform may be defined on the space of tempered distributions S′(Rn)𝒮'(ℝ^n) by duality of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions. Specifically for f∈S′(Rn)∈𝒮'(ℝ^n) and for all test functions φ∈S(Rn)φ∈𝒮(ℝ^n) we set ⟨Ff,φ⟩:=⟨f,Fφ⟩,⟨ℱf,φ⟩:=,ℱφ⟩, where Fφℱφ is defined using the integral formula. If f∈L1(Rn)∩L2(Rn)^1(ℝ^n)^2(ℝ^n) then this agrees with the usual definition. We may define the inverse transform F−1:S′(Rn)→S′(Rn)ℱ^-1𝒮'(ℝ^n)→𝒮'(ℝ^n), either by duality from the inverse transform on Schwartz functions in the same way, or by defining it in terms of the flip operator (where the flip operator is defined by duality). We then have FF−1=F−1F=IdS′(Rn).ℱℱ^-1=ℱ^-1ℱ=Id_𝒮'(ℝ^n). Relation to Fourier
