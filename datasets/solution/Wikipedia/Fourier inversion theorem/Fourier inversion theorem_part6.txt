inverse: The form of the Fourier inversion theorem stated above, as is common, is that F−1(Ff)(x)=f(x).ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=f(x). In other words, F−1ℱ^-1 is a left inverse for the Fourier transform. However it is also a right inverse for the Fourier transform i.e. F(F−1f)(ξ)=f(ξ).ℱ(ℱ^-1f)(ξ)=f(ξ). Since F−1ℱ^-1 is so similar to Fℱ, this follows very easily from the Fourier inversion theorem (changing variables ζ:=−ζζ:=-ζ): f=F−1(Ff)(x)=∫Rn∫Rne2πix⋅ξe−2πiy⋅ξf(y)dydξ=∫Rn∫Rne−2πix⋅ζe2πiy⋅ζf(y)dydζ=F(F−1f)(x).f =ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x) =∫_ℝ^n∫_ℝ^ne^2·ξ e^-2·ξ f(y) dy dξ =∫_ℝ^n∫_ℝ^ne^-2·ζ e^2·ζ f(y) dy dζ =ℱ(ℱ^-1f)(x). Alternatively, this can be seen from the relation between F−1fℱ^-1f and the flip operator and the associativity of function composition, since f=F−1(Ff)=FRFf=F(F−1f).=ℱ^-1(ℱf)=ℱRℱf=ℱ(ℱ^-1f).
