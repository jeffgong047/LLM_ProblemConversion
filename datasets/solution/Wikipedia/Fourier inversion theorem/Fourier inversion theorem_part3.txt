integral: The most common statement of the Fourier inversion theorem is to state the inverse transform as an integral. For any integrable function g and all x∈Rn∈ℝ^n set F−1g(x):=∫Rne2πix⋅ξg(ξ)dξ.ℱ^-1g(x):=∫_ℝ^ne^2·ξ g(ξ) dξ. Then for all x∈Rn∈ℝ^n we have F−1(Ff)(x)=f(x).ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=f(x). Fourier integral
