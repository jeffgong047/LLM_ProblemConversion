transform: The Fourier inversion theorem holds for all continuous functions that are absolutely integrable (i.e. L1(Rn)^1(ℝ^n)) with absolutely integrable Fourier transform. This includes all Schwartz functions, so is a strictly stronger form of the theorem than the previous one mentioned. This condition is the one used above in the statement section. A slight variant is to drop the condition that the function f be continuous but still require that it and its Fourier transform be absolutely integrable. Then f=g=g almost everywhere where g is a continuous function, and F−1(Ff)(x)=g(x)ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=g(x) for every x∈Rn∈ℝ^n. Integrable functions in one
