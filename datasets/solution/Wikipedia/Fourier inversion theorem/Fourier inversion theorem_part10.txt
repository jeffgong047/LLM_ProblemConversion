dimension: Piecewise smooth; one dimension If the function is absolutely integrable in one dimension (i.e. f∈L1(R)^1(ℝ)) and is piecewise smooth then a version of the Fourier inversion theorem holds. In this case we define F−1g(x):=limR→∞∫−RRe2πixξg(ξ)dξ.ℱ^-1g(x):=lim_R→∞∫_-R^Re^2ξ g(ξ) dξ. Then for all x∈R∈ℝ F−1(Ff)(x)=12(f(x−)+f(x+)),ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=1/2(f(x_-)+f(x_+)), i.e. F−1(Ff)(x)ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x) equals the average of the left and right limits of f at x. At points where f is continuous this simply equals f(x)(x). A higher-dimensional analogue of this form of the theorem also holds, but according to Folland (1992) is "rather delicate and not terribly useful". Piecewise continuous; one dimension If the function is absolutely integrable in one dimension (i.e. f∈L1(R)^1(ℝ)) but merely piecewise continuous then a version of the Fourier inversion theorem still holds. In this case the integral in the inverse Fourier transform is defined with the aid of a smooth rather than a sharp cut off function; specifically we define F−1g(x):=limR→∞∫Rφ(ξ/R)e2πixξg(ξ)dξ,φ(ξ):=e−ξ2.ℱ^-1g(x):=lim_R→∞∫_ℝφ(ξ/R) e^2ξ g(ξ) dξ, φ(ξ):=e^-ξ^2. The conclusion of the theorem is then the same as for the piecewise smooth case discussed above. Continuous; any number of dimensions If f is continuous and absolutely integrable on Rnℝ^n then the Fourier inversion theorem still holds so long as we again define the inverse transform with a smooth cut off function i.e. F−1g(x):=limR→∞∫Rnφ(ξ/R)e2πix⋅ξg(ξ)dξ,φ(ξ):=e−|ξ|2.ℱ^-1g(x):=lim_R→∞∫_ℝ^nφ(ξ/R) e^2·ξ g(ξ) dξ, φ(ξ):=e^-|ξ|^2. The conclusion is now simply that for all x∈Rn∈ℝ^n F−1(Ff)(x)=f(x).ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=f(x). No regularity condition; any number of dimensions If we drop all assumptions about the (piecewise) continuity of f and assume merely that it is absolutely integrable, then a version of the theorem still holds. The inverse transform is again defined with the smooth cut off, but with the conclusion that F−1(Ff)(x)=f(x)ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=f(x) for almost every x∈Rn.∈ℝ^n. [2] Square integrable
