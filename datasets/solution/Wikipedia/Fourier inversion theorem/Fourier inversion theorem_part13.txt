series: When considering the Fourier series of a function it is conventional to rescale it so that it acts on [0,2π][0,2π] (or is 2π2π-periodic). In this section we instead use the somewhat unusual convention taking f to act on [0,1][0,1], since that matches the convention of the Fourier transform used here. The Fourier inversion theorem is analogous to the convergence of Fourier series. In the Fourier transform case we have f:Rn→C,f^:Rn→C,ℝ^n→ℂ, f̂ℝ^n→ℂ, f^(ξ):=∫Rne−2πiy⋅ξf(y)dy,f̂(ξ):=∫_ℝ^ne^-2·ξ f(y) dy, f(x)=∫Rne2πix⋅ξf^(ξ)dξ.(x)=∫_ℝ^ne^2·ξ f̂(ξ) dξ. In the Fourier series case we instead have f:[0,1]n→C,f^:Zn→C,[0,1]^n→ℂ, f̂ℤ^n→ℂ, f^(k):=∫[0,1]ne−2πiy⋅kf(y)dy,f̂(k):=∫_[0,1]^ne^-2 f(y) dy, f(x)=∑k∈Zne2πix⋅kf^(k).(x)=∑_k∈ℤ^ne^2 f̂(k). In particular, in one dimension k∈Z∈ℤ and the sum runs from −∞-∞ to ∞∞.
