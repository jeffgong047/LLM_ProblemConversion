functions: In this case the Fourier transform cannot be defined directly as an integral since it may not be absolutely convergent, so it is instead defined by a density argument (see the Fourier transform article). For example, putting gk(ξ):=∫y∈Rn:|y|≤ke−2πiy⋅ξf(y)dy,k∈N,_k(ξ):=∫_{y∈ℝ^n:|}e^-2·ξ f(y) dy,∈ℕ, we can set Ff:=limk→∞gkℱf:=lim_k→∞g_k where the limit is taken in the L2^2-norm. The inverse transform may be defined by density in the same way or by defining it in terms of the Fourier transform and the flip operator. We then have f(x)=F(F−1f)(x)=F−1(Ff)(x)(x)=ℱ(ℱ^-1f)(x)=ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x) in the mean squared norm. In one dimension (and one dimension only), it can also be shown that it converges for almost every x∈ℝ- this is Carleson's theorem, but is much harder to prove than convergence in the mean squared norm.
