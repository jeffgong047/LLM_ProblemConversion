transform: The inverse Fourier transform is extremely similar to the original Fourier transform: as discussed above, it differs only in the application of a flip operator. For this reason the properties of the Fourier transform hold for the inverse Fourier transform, such as the Convolution theorem and the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma. Tables of Fourier transforms may easily be used for the inverse Fourier transform by composing the looked-up function with the flip operator. For example, looking up the Fourier transform of the rect function we see that f(x)=rect⁡(ax)⇒(Ff)(ξ)=1|a|sinc⁡(ξa),(x)=rect(ax) ⇒ (ℱf)(ξ)=1/|a|sinc(ξ/a), so the corresponding fact for the inverse transform is g(ξ)=rect⁡(aξ)⇒(F−1g)(x)=1|a|sinc⁡(−xa).(ξ)=rect(aξ) ⇒ (ℱ^-1g)(x)=1/|a|sinc(-x/a).
