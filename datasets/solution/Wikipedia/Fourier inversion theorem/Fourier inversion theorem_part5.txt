operator: For any function g define the flip operator[note 1] R by Rg(x):=g(−x).(x):=g(-x). Then we may instead define F−1f:=RFf=FRf.ℱ^-1f:=Rℱf=ℱRf. It is immediate from the definition of the Fourier transform and the flip operator that both RFfℱf and FRfℱRf match the integral definition of F−1fℱ^-1f, and in particular are equal to each other and satisfy F−1(Ff)(x)=f(x)ℱ^-1(ℱf)(x)=f(x). Since Rf=RF−1Ff=RRFFf=Rℱ^-1ℱf=RRℱℱf we have R=F2=ℱ^2 and F−1=F3.ℱ^-1=ℱ^3. Two-sided
