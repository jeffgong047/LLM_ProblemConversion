In a quadrilateral with all sides tangent to a circle, sums of opposite sides are equal |PA|=|PB||PA|=|PB| |AB|+|CD|=(a+b)+(c+d)=(b+c)+(a+d)=|BC|+|DA| |AB|+|CD| = (a+b)+(c+d) = (b+c)+(a+d) = |BC|+|DA| The Pitot theorem in geometry states that in a tangential quadrilateral the two pairs of opposite sides have the same total length. It is named after French engineer Henri Pitot.[1] Statement and
