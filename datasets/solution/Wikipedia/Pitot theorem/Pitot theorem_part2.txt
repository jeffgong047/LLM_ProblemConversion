converse: A tangential quadrilateral is usually defined as a convex quadrilateral for which all four sides are tangent to the same inscribed circle. Pitot's theorem states that, for these quadrilaterals, the two sums of lengths of opposite sides are the same. Both sums of lengths equal the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral.[2] The converse implication is also true: whenever a convex quadrilateral has pairs of opposite sides with the same sums of lengths, it has an inscribed circle. Therefore, this is an exact characterization: the tangential quadrilaterals are exactly the quadrilaterals with equal sums of opposite side lengths.[2] Proof
