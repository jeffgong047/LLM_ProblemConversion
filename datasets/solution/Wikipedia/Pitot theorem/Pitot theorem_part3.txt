idea: One way to prove the Pitot theorem is to divide the sides of any given tangential quadrilateral at the points where its inscribed circle touches each side. This divides the four sides into eight segments, between a vertex of the quadrilateral and a point of tangency with the circle. Any two of these segments that meet at the same vertex have the same length, forming a pair of equal-length segments. Any two opposite sides have one segment from each of these pairs. Therefore, the four segments in two opposite sides have the same lengths, and the same sum of lengths, as the four segments in the other two opposite sides.
