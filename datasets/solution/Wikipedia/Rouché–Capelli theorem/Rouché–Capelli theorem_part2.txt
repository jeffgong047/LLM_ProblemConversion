statement: A system of linear equations with n variables has a solution if and only if the rank of its coefficient matrix A is equal to the rank of its augmented matrix [A|b].[1] If there are solutions, they form an affine subspace of Rnℝ^n of dimension n − rank(A). In particular: if n = rank(A), the solution is unique, otherwise there are infinitely many solutions.
