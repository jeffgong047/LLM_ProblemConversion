Existence of solutions for a system of linear equations in terms of matrix ranks Not to be confused with Rouché's theorem. In linear algebra, the Rouché–Capelli theorem determines the number of solutions for a system of linear equations, given the rank of its augmented matrix and coefficient matrix. The theorem is variously known as the: Rouché–Capelli theorem in English speaking countries, Italy and Brazil; Kronecker–Capelli theorem in Austria, Poland, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Russia; Rouché–Fontené theorem in France; Rouché–Frobenius theorem in Spain and many countries in Latin America; Frobenius theorem in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.
