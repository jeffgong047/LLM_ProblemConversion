Existence of solutions for a system of linear equations in terms of matrix ranks
Not to be confused with Rouché's theorem.
In linear algebra, the Rouché–Capelli theorem determines the number of solutions for a system of linear equations, given the rank of its augmented matrix and coefficient matrix. The theorem is variously known as the:

Rouché–Capelli theorem in English speaking countries, Italy and Brazil;
Kronecker–Capelli theorem in Austria, Poland, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Russia;
Rouché–Fontené theorem in France;
Rouché–Frobenius theorem in Spain and many countries in Latin America;
Frobenius theorem in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.

Formal statement[edit]
A system of linear equations with n variables has a solution if and only if the rank of its coefficient matrix A is equal to the rank of its augmented matrix [A|b].[1] If there are solutions, they form an affine subspace of Rnℝ^n of dimension n − rank(A). In particular:

if n = rank(A), the solution is unique,
otherwise there are infinitely many solutions.
Example[edit]
Consider the system of equations

x + y + 2z = 3,
x + y + z = 1,
2x + 2y + 2z = 2.
The coefficient matrix is

A=[112111222],=[ 1 1 2; 1 1 1; 2 2 2;  ],
and the augmented matrix is

(A|B)=[112311112222].(A|B)=[[ 1 1 2 3; 1 1 1 1; 2 2 2 2 ]].
Since both of these have the same rank, namely 2, there exists at least one solution; and since their rank is less than the number of unknowns, the latter being 3, there are infinitely many solutions.
In contrast, consider the system

x + y + 2z = 3,
x + y + z = 1,
2x + 2y + 2z = 5.
The coefficient matrix is

A=[112111222],=[ 1 1 2; 1 1 1; 2 2 2;  ],
and the augmented matrix is

(A|B)=[112311112225].(A|B)=[[ 1 1 2 3; 1 1 1 1; 2 2 2 5 ]].
In this example the coefficient matrix has rank 2, while the augmented matrix has rank 3; so this system of equations has no solution. Indeed, an increase in the number of linearly independent columns has made the system of equations inconsistent.
