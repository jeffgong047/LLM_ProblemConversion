Example: Consider the system of equations x + y + 2z = 3, x + y + z = 1, 2x + 2y + 2z = 2. The coefficient matrix is A=[112111222],=[ 1 1 2; 1 1 1; 2 2 2; ], and the augmented matrix is (A|B)=[112311112222].(A|B)=[[ 1 1 2 3; 1 1 1 1; 2 2 2 2 ]]. Since both of these have the same rank, namely 2, there exists at least one solution; and since their rank is less than the number of unknowns, the latter being 3, there are infinitely many solutions. In contrast, consider the system x + y + 2z = 3, x + y + z = 1, 2x + 2y + 2z = 5. The coefficient matrix is A=[112111222],=[ 1 1 2; 1 1 1; 2 2 2; ], and the augmented matrix is (A|B)=[112311112225].(A|B)=[[ 1 1 2 3; 1 1 1 1; 2 2 2 5 ]]. In this example the coefficient matrix has rank 2, while the augmented matrix has rank 3; so this system of equations has no solution. Indeed, an increase in the number of linearly independent columns has made the system of equations inconsistent. See
