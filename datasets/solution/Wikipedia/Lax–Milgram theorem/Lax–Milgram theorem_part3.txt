equations: Now, let V=Rn=ℝ^n and A:V→V:V be a linear mapping. Then, the weak formulation of the equation Au=f=f involves finding u∈V such that for all v∈V the following equation holds: ⟨Au,v⟩=⟨f,v⟩,,v⟩=,v⟩, where ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ denotes an inner product. Since A is a linear mapping, it is sufficient to test with basis vectors, and we get ⟨Au,ei⟩=⟨f,ei⟩,i=1,…,n.,e_i⟩=,e_i⟩,=1,…,n. Actually, expanding u=∑j=1nujej=∑_j=1^nu_je_j, we obtain the matrix form of the equation Au=f,𝐀𝐮=𝐟, where aij=⟨Aej,ei⟩_ij=_j,e_i⟩ and fi=⟨f,ei⟩_i=,e_i⟩. The bilinear form associated to this weak formulation is a(u,v)=vTAu.(u,v)=𝐯^T𝐀𝐮. Example 2: Poisson's
