concept: Let V be a Banach space, let V′' be the dual space of V, let A:V→V′',[clarification needed] and let f∈V′'. A vector u∈V is a solution of the equation Au=f=f if and only if for all v∈V, [Au](v)=f(v).[Au](v)=f(v). Here, v is called a test vector (in general) or a test function (if V is a function space). To bring this into the generic form of a weak formulation, find u∈V such that a(u,v)=f(v)∀v∈V,(u,v)=f(v) , by defining the bilinear form a(u,v):=[Au](v).(u,v):=[Au](v). Example 1: linear system of
