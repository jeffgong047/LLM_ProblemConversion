1: Here, application of the Lax–Milgram theorem is a stronger result than is needed. Boundedness: all bilinear forms on Rnℝ^n are bounded. In particular, we have |a(u,v)|≤‖A‖‖u‖‖v‖|a(u,v)|≤A u v Coercivity: this actually means that the real parts of the eigenvalues of A are not smaller than c. Since this implies in particular that no eigenvalue is zero, the system is solvable. Additionally, this yields the estimate ‖u‖≤1c‖f‖,u≤1/cf, where c is the minimal real part of an eigenvalue of A. Application to example
