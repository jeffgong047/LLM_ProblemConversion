2: Here, choose V=H01(Ω)=H_0^1(Ω) with the norm ‖v‖V:=‖∇v‖,v_V:=, where the norm on the right is the L2^2-norm on ΩΩ (this provides a true norm on V by the Poincaré inequality). But, we see that |a(u,u)|=‖∇u‖2|a(u,u)|=^2 and by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, |a(u,v)|≤‖∇u‖‖∇v‖|a(u,v)|≤ . Therefore, for any f∈[H01(Ω)]′∈[H_0^1(Ω)]', there is a unique solution u∈V of Poisson's equation and we have the estimate ‖∇u‖≤‖f‖[H01(Ω)]′.≤f_[H_0^1(Ω)]'. See
