equation: To solve Poisson's equation −∇2u=f,-∇^2u=f, on a domain Ω⊂RdΩ⊂ℝ^d with u=0=0 on its boundary, and to specify the solution space V later, one can use the L2^2-scalar product ⟨u,v⟩=∫Ωuvdx,v⟩=∫_Ωuv dx to derive the weak formulation. Then, testing with differentiable functions v yields −∫Ω(∇2u)vdx=∫Ωfvdx.-∫_Ω(∇^2u)v dx=∫_Ωfv dx. The left side of this equation can be made more symmetric by integration by parts using Green's identity and assuming that v=0=0 on ∂Ω∂Ω: ∫Ω∇u⋅∇vdx=∫Ωfvdx.∫_Ω· dx=∫_Ωfv dx. This is what is usually called the weak formulation of Poisson's equation. Functions in the solution space V must be zero on the boundary, and have square-integrable derivatives. The appropriate space to satisfy these requirements is the Sobolev space H01(Ω)_0^1(Ω) of functions with weak derivatives in L2(Ω)^2(Ω) and with zero boundary conditions, so V=H01(Ω)=H_0^1(Ω). The generic form is obtained by assigning a(u,v)=∫Ω∇u⋅∇vdx(u,v)=∫_Ω· dx and f(v)=∫Ωfvdx.(v)=∫_Ωfv dx. The Lax–Milgram
