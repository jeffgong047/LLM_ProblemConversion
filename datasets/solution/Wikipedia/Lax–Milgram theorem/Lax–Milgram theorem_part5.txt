theorem: This is a formulation of the Lax–Milgram theorem which relies on properties of the symmetric part of the bilinear form. It is not the most general form. Let V be a Hilbert space and a(⋅,⋅)(·,·) a bilinear form on V, which is bounded: |a(u,v)|≤C‖u‖‖v‖;|a(u,v)|uv ; and coercive: a(u,u)≥c‖u‖2.(u,u)u^2 . Then, for any f∈V′', there is a unique solution u∈V to the equation a(u,v)=f(v)∀v∈V(u,v)=f(v) and it holds ‖u‖≤1c‖f‖V′.u≤1/cf_V' . Application to example
