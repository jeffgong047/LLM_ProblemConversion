The Schauder fixed-point theorem is an extension of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to topological vector spaces, which may be of infinite dimension. It asserts that if K is a nonempty convex closed subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space V and f is a continuous mapping of K into itself such that f(K)(K) is contained in a compact subset of K, then f has a fixed point. A consequence, called Schaefer's fixed-point theorem, is particularly useful for proving existence of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations. Schaefer's theorem is in fact a special case of the far reaching Leray–Schauder theorem which was proved earlier by Juliusz Schauder and Jean Leray. The statement is as follows: Let f be a continuous and compact mapping of a Banach space X into itself, such that the set x∈X:x=λf(x)forsome0≤λ≤1{x:x=(x)0≤λ≤1} is bounded. Then f has a fixed point. (A compact mapping in this context is one for which the image of every bounded set is relatively compact.)
