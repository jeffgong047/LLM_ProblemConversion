Theorem in statistics In statistics, Basu's theorem states that any boundedly complete minimal sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic. This is a 1955 result of Debabrata Basu.[1] It is often used in statistics as a tool to prove independence of two statistics, by first demonstrating one is complete sufficient and the other is ancillary, then appealing to the theorem.[2] An example of this is to show that the sample mean and sample variance of a normal distribution are independent statistics, which is done in the Example section below. This property (independence of sample mean and sample variance) characterizes normal distributions.
