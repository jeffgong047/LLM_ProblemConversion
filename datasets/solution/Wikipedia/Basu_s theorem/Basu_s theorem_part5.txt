distribution: Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be independent, identically distributed normal random variables with mean μ and variance σ2. Then with respect to the parameter μ, one can show that μ^=∑Xin,μ=_i/n, the sample mean, is a complete and sufficient statistic – it is all the information one can derive to estimate μ, and no more – and σ^2=∑(Xi−X¯)2n−1,σ^2=∑(X_i-X̅)^2/n-1, the sample variance, is an ancillary statistic – its distribution does not depend on μ. Therefore, from Basu's theorem it follows that these statistics are independent conditional on μμ, conditional on σ2σ^2. This independence result can also be proven by Cochran's theorem. Further, this property (that the sample mean and sample variance of the normal distribution are independent) characterizes the normal distribution – no other distribution has this property.[3]
