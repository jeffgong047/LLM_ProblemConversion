Proof: Let PθT_θ^T and PθA_θ^A be the marginal distributions of T and A respectively. Denote by A−1(B)^-1(B) the preimage of a set B under the map A. For any measurable set B∈B∈ℬ we have PθA(B)=Pθ(A−1(B))=∫YPθ(A−1(B)∣T=t)PθT(dt)._θ^A(B)=P_θ(A^-1(B))=∫_YP_θ(A^-1(B)=t)_θ^T(dt). The distribution PθA_θ^A does not depend on θθ because A is ancillary. Likewise, Pθ(⋅∣T=t)_θ(·=t) does not depend on θθ because T is sufficient. Therefore ∫Y[P(A−1(B)∣T=t)−PA(B)]PθT(dt)=0.∫_Y[P(A^-1(B)=t)-P^A(B)]_θ^T(dt)=0. Note the integrand (the function inside the integral) is a function of t and not θθ. Therefore, since T is boundedly complete the function g(t)=P(A−1(B)∣T=t)−PA(B)(t)=P(A^-1(B)=t)-P^A(B) is zero for PθT_θ^T almost all values of t and thus P(A−1(B)∣T=t)=PA(B)(A^-1(B)=t)=P^A(B) for almost all t. Therefore, A is independent of T.
