Statement: Let (Pθ;θ∈Θ)(P_θ;θ∈Θ) be a family of distributions on a measurable space (X,A)(X,𝒜) and a statistic T maps from (X,A)(X,𝒜) to some measurable space (Y,B)(Y,ℬ). If T is a boundedly complete sufficient statistic for θθ, and A is ancillary to θθ, then conditional on θθ, T is independent of A. That is, T⊥⊥A|θ⊥|θ.
