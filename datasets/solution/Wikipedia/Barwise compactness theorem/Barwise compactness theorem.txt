In mathematical logic, the Barwise compactness theorem, named after Jon Barwise, is a generalization of the usual compactness theorem for first-order logic to a certain class of infinitary languages.  It was stated and proved by Barwise in 1967.

Statement[edit]
Let A be a countable admissible set. Let L be an A-finite relational language. Suppose ΓΓ is a set of LA_A-sentences, where ΓΓ is a Σ1Σ_1 set with parameters from A, and every A-finite subset of ΓΓ is satisfiable. Then ΓΓ is satisfiable.
