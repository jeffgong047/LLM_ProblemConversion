In mathematics, the Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem characterizes the  finite simple groups with quasidihedral or wreathed[1] Sylow 2-subgroups. These are isomorphic either to three-dimensional projective special linear groups or projective special unitary groups over a finite field of odd order, depending on a certain congruence, or to the Mathieu group M11_11.  Alperin, Brauer & Gorenstein (1970) proved this in the course of 261 pages.  The subdivision by 2-fusion is sketched there, given as an exercise in Gorenstein (1968, Ch. 7), and presented in some detail in Kwon et al. (1980).

Notes[edit]

^ A 2-group is wreathed if it is a nonabelian semidirect product of a maximal subgroup that is a direct product of two cyclic groups of the same order, that is, if it is the wreath product of a cyclic 2-group with the symmetric group on 2 points.
