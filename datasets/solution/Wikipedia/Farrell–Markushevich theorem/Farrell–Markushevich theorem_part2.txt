Proof: Let Ω be the bounded Jordan domain and let Ωn be bounded Jordan domains decreasing to Ω, with Ωn containing the closure of Ωn + 1. By the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping fn of Ωn onto Ω, normalised to fix a given point in Ω with positive derivative there. By the Carathéodory kernel theorem fn(z) converges uniformly on compacta in Ω to z.[2] In fact Carathéodory's theorem implies that the inverse maps tend uniformly on compacta to z. Given a subsequence of fn, it has a subsequence, convergent on compacta in Ω. Since the inverse functions converge to z, it follows that the subsequence converges to z on compacta. Hence fn converges to z on compacta in Ω. As a consequence the derivative of fn tends to 1 uniformly on compacta. Let g be a square integrable holomorphic function on Ω, i.e. an element of the Bergman space A2(Ω). Define gn on Ωn by gn(z) = g(fn(z))fn'(z). By change of variable ‖gn‖Ωn2=‖g‖Ω2.g_n_Ω_n^2=g_Ω^2. Let hn be the restriction of gn to Ω. Then the norm of hn is less than that of gn. Thus these norms are uniformly bounded. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can therefore be assumed that hn has a weak limit in A2(Ω). On the other hand, hn tends uniformly on compacta to g. Since the evaluation maps are continuous linear functions on A2(Ω), g is the weak limit of hn. On the other hand, by Runge's theorem, hn lies in the closed subspace K of A2(Ω) generated by complex polynomials. Hence g lies in the weak closure of K, which is K itself.[3] See
