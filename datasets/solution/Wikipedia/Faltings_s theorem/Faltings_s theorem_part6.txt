Generalizations: Because of the Mordell–Weil theorem, Faltings's theorem can be reformulated as a statement about the intersection of a curve C with a finitely generated subgroup ΓΓ of an abelian variety A. Generalizing by replacing A by a semiabelian variety, C by an arbitrary subvariety of A, and ΓΓ by an arbitrary finite-rank subgroup of A leads to the Mordell–Lang conjecture, which was proved in 1995 by McQuillan[9] following work of Laurent, Raynaud, Hindry, Vojta, and Faltings. Another higher-dimensional generalization of Faltings's theorem is the Bombieri–Lang conjecture that if X is a pseudo-canonical variety (i.e., a variety of general type) over a number field k, then X(k)(k) is not Zariski dense in X. Even more general conjectures have been put forth by Paul Vojta. The Mordell conjecture for function fields was proved by Yuri Ivanovich Manin[10] and by Hans Grauert.[11] In 1990, Robert F. Coleman found and fixed a gap in Manin's proof.[12]
