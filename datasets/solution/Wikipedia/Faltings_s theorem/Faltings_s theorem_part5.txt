Consequences: Faltings's 1983 paper had as consequences a number of statements which had previously been conjectured: The Mordell conjecture that a curve of genus greater than 1 over a number field has only finitely many rational points; The Isogeny theorem that abelian varieties with isomorphic Tate modules (as Qℓℚ_ℓ-modules with Galois action) are isogenous. A sample application of Faltings's theorem is to a weak form of Fermat's Last Theorem: for any fixed n≥4≥4 there are at most finitely many primitive integer solutions (pairwise coprime solutions) to an+bn=cn^n+b^n=c^n, since for such n the Fermat curve xn+yn=1^n+y^n=1 has genus greater than 1.
