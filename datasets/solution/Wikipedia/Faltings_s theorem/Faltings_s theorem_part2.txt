Background: Let C be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g over Qℚ. Then the set of rational points on C may be determined as follows: When g=0=0, there are either no points or infinitely many. In such cases, C may be handled as a conic section. When g=1=1, if there are any points, then C is an elliptic curve and its rational points form a finitely generated abelian group. (This is Mordell's Theorem, later generalized to the Mordell–Weil theorem.) Moreover, Mazur's torsion theorem restricts the structure of the torsion subgroup. When g>1>1, according to Faltings's theorem, C has only a finite number of rational points.
