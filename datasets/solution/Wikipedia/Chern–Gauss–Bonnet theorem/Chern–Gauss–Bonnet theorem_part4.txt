Applications: The Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem can be seen as a special instance in the theory of characteristic classes. The Chern integrand is the Euler class. Since it is a top-dimensional differential form, it is closed. The naturality of the Euler class means that when changing the Riemannian metric, one stays in the same cohomology class. That means that the integral of the Euler class remains constant as the metric is varied and is thus a global invariant of the smooth structure.[6] The theorem has also found numerous applications in physics, including:[6] adiabatic phase or Berry's phase, string theory, condensed matter physics, topological quantum field theory, topological phases of matter (see the 2016 Nobel Prize in physics by Duncan Haldane et al.).
