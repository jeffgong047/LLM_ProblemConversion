theorem: Main article: Gauss–Bonnet theorem The Gauss–Bonnet theorem is a special case when M is a 2-dimensional manifold. It arises as the special case where the topological index is defined in terms of Betti numbers and the analytical index is defined in terms of the Gauss–Bonnet integrand. As with the two-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theorem, there are generalizations when M is a manifold with boundary. Further
