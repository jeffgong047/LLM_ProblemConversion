manifolds: In dimension 2n=42n=4, for a compact oriented manifold, we get χ(M)=132π2∫M(|Riem|2−4|Ric|2+R2)dμχ(M)=1/32π^2∫_M(|Riem|^2-4|Ric|^2+R^2) dμ where RiemRiem is the full Riemann curvature tensor, RicRic is the Ricci curvature tensor, and R is the scalar curvature. This is particularly important in general relativity, where spacetime is viewed as a 4-dimensional manifold. In terms of the orthogonal Ricci decomposition of the Riemann curvature tensor, this formula can also be written as χ(M)=18π2∫M(14|W|2−12|Z|2+124R2)dμχ(M)=1/8π^2∫_M(1/4|W|^2-1/2|Z|^2+1/24R^2) dμ where W is the Weyl tensor and Z is the traceless Ricci tensor.
