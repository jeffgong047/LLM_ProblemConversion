Statement: One useful form of the Chern theorem is that[5][6] χ(M)=∫Me(Ω)χ(M)=∫_Me(Ω) where χ(M)χ(M) denotes the Euler characteristic of M. The Euler class is defined as e(Ω)=1(2π)nPf⁡(Ω).(Ω)=1/(2π)^nPf(Ω). where we have the Pfaffian Pf⁡(Ω)Pf(Ω). Here M is a compact orientable 2n-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary, and ΩΩ is the associated curvature form of the Levi-Civita connection. In fact, the statement holds with ΩΩ the curvature form of any metric connection on the tangent bundle, as well as for other vector bundles over M.[7] Since the dimension is 2n, we have that ΩΩ is an so(2n)𝔰𝔬(2n)-valued 2-differential form on M (see special orthogonal group). So ΩΩ can be regarded as a skew-symmetric 2n × 2n matrix whose entries are 2-forms, so it is a matrix over the commutative ring ⋀evenT∗M⋀^even T^*M. Hence the Pfaffian is a 2n-form. It is also an invariant polynomial. However, Chern's theorem in general is that for any closed C∞^∞ orientable n-dimensional M,[5] χ(M)=(e(TM),[M])χ(M)=(e(TM),[M]) where the above pairing (,) denotes the cap product with the Euler class of the tangent bundle TM.
