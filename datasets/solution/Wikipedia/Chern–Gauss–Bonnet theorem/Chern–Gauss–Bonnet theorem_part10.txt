Atiyah–Singer: Main article: Atiyah–Singer index theorem A far-reaching generalization of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem is the Atiyah–Singer Index Theorem.[6] Let D be a weakly elliptic differential operator between vector bundles. That means that the principal symbol is an isomorphism. Strong ellipticity would furthermore require the symbol to be positive-definite. Let D∗^* be its adjoint operator. Then the analytical index is defined as dim⁡(ker⁡(D))−dim⁡(ker⁡(D∗))((D))-((D^*)) By ellipticity this is always finite. The index theorem says that this is constant as the elliptic operator is varied smoothly. It is equal to a topological index, which can be expressed in terms of characteristic classes like the Euler class. The Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem is derived by considering the Dirac operator D=d+d∗=d+d^* Odd
