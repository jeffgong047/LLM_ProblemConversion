Ties Euler characteristic of a closed even-dimensional Riemannian manifold to curvature In mathematics, the Chern theorem (or the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem[1][2][3] after Shiing-Shen Chern, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet) states that the Euler–Poincaré characteristic (a topological invariant defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers of a topological space) of a closed even-dimensional Riemannian manifold is equal to the integral of a certain polynomial (the Euler class) of its curvature form (an analytical invariant). It is a highly non-trivial generalization of the classic Gauss–Bonnet theorem (for 2-dimensional manifolds / surfaces) to higher even-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In 1943, Carl B. Allendoerfer and André Weil proved a special case for extrinsic manifolds. In a classic paper published in 1944, Shiing-Shen Chern proved the theorem in full generality connecting global topology with local geometry.[4] Riemann–Roch and Atiyah–Singer are other generalizations of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
