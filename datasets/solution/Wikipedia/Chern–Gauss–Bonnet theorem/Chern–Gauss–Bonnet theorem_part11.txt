dimensions: The Chern formula is only defined for even dimensions because the Euler characteristic vanishes for odd dimensions. There is some research being done on 'twisting' the index theorem in K-theory to give non-trivial results for odd dimensions.[10][11] There is also a version of Chern's formula for orbifolds.[12]
