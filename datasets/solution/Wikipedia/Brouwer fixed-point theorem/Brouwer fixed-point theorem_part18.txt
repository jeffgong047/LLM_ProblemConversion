degree: Brouwer's original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the degree of a continuous mapping, stemming from ideas in differential topology. Several modern accounts of the proof can be found in the literature, notably Milnor (1965).[48][49] Let K=B(0)¯=B(0) denote the closed unit ball in Rnℝ^n centered at the origin. Suppose for simplicity that f:K→K:K is continuously differentiable. A regular value of f is a point p∈B(0)(0) such that the Jacobian of f is non-singular at every point of the preimage of p. In particular, by the inverse function theorem, every point of the preimage of f lies in B(0)(0) (the interior of K). The degree of f at a regular value p∈B(0)(0) is defined as the sum of the signs of the Jacobian determinant of f over the preimages of p under f: degp⁡(f)=∑x∈f−1(p)signdet(dfx).deg_p(f)=∑_xinf^-1(p)sign (df_x). The degree is, roughly speaking, the number of "sheets" of the preimage f lying over a small open set around p, with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented. This is thus a generalization of winding number to higher dimensions. The degree satisfies the property of homotopy invariance: let f and g be two continuously differentiable functions, and Ht(x)=tf+(1−t)g_t(x)=tf+(1-t)g for 0≤t≤10≤1. Suppose that the point p is a regular value of Ht_t for all t. Then degp⁡f=degp⁡g_pf=_pg. If there is no fixed point of the boundary of K, then the function g(x)=x−f(x)supx∈K|x−f(x)|(x)=x-f(x)/sup_x|x-f(x)| is well-defined, and H(t,x)=x−tf(x)supx∈K|x−tf(x)|(t,x)=x-tf(x)/sup_x|x-tf(x)| defines a homotopy from the identity function to it. The identity function has degree one at every point. In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so g also has degree one at the origin. As a consequence, the preimage g−1(0)^-1(0) is not empty. The elements of g−1(0)^-1(0) are precisely the fixed points of the original function f. This requires some work to make fully general. The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of f, and then to continuous functions. The more modern advent of homology theory simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature. A proof using the hairy ball
