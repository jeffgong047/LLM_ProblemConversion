proof: The BFPT can be proved using Sperner's lemma. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which f is a function from the standard n-simplex, Δn,Δ^n, to itself, where Δn=P∈Rn+1∣∑i=0nPi=1andPi≥0foralli.Δ^n={P∈ℝ^n+1|∑_i=0^nP_i=1andP_i≥0foralli}. For every point P∈Δn,∈Δ^n, also f(P)∈Δn.(P)∈Δ^n. Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal: ∑i=0nPi=1=∑i=0nf(P)i∑_i=0^nP_i=1=∑_i=0^nf(P)_i Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every P∈Δn,∈Δ^n, there must be an index j∈0,…,n∈{0,…,n} such that the jth coordinate of P is greater than or equal to the jth coordinate of its image under f: Pj≥f(P)j._j(P)_j. Moreover, if P lies on a k-dimensional sub-face of Δn,Δ^n, then by the same argument, the index j can be selected from among the k + 1 coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face. We now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring. For every triangulation of Δn,Δ^n, the color of every vertex P is an index j such that f(P)j≤Pj.(P)_j_j. By construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an n-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of n + 1 available colors. Because f is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point P which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: f(P)j≤Pj(P)_j_j for all j.. Because the sum of the coordinates of P and f(P)(P) must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that: f(P)=P.(P)=P. That is, P is a fixed point of f.. A proof by
