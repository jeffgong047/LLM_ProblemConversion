theorem: The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map f from a finite simplicial complex B to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number ∑n(−1)nTr⁡(f|Hn(B))∑_n(-1)^nTr(f|H_n(B)) and in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then f must have a fixed point. If B is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero simplicial homology group is: H0(B)_0(B) and f acts as the identity on this group, so f has a fixed point.[60][61] A proof in a weak logical
