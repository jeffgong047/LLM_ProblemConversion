theorem: The hairy ball theorem states that on the unit sphere S in an odd-dimensional Euclidean space, there is no nowhere-vanishing continuous tangent vector field w on S. (The tangency condition means that w(x) ⋅ x = 0 for every unit vector x.) Sometimes the theorem is expressed by the statement that "there is always a place on the globe with no wind". An elementary proof of the hairy ball theorem can be found in Milnor (1978). In fact, suppose first that w is continuously differentiable. By scaling, it can be assumed that w is a continuously differentiable unit tangent vector on S. It can be extended radially to a small spherical shell A of S. For t sufficiently small, a routine computation shows that the mapping ft(x) = x + t w(x) is a contraction mapping on A and that the volume of its image is a polynomial in t. On the other hand, as a contraction mapping, ft must restrict to a homeomorphism of S onto (1 + t2)½ S and A onto (1 + t2)½ A. This gives a contradiction, because, if the dimension n of the Euclidean space is odd, (1 + t2)n/2 is not a polynomial. If w is only a continuous unit tangent vector on S, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem, it can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial map u of A into Euclidean space. The orthogonal projection on to the tangent space is given by v(x) = u(x) - u(x) ⋅ x. Thus v is polynomial and nowhere vanishing on A; by construction v/||v|| is a smooth unit tangent vector field on S, a contradiction. The continuous version of the hairy ball theorem can now be used to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem. First suppose that n is even. If there were a fixed-point-free continuous self-mapping f of the closed unit ball B of the n-dimensional Euclidean space V, set w(x)=(1−x⋅f(x))x−(1−x⋅x)f(x).𝐰(𝐱)=(1-𝐱·𝐟(𝐱)) 𝐱-(1-𝐱·𝐱) 𝐟(𝐱). Since f has no fixed points, it follows that, for x in the interior of B, the vector w(x) is non-zero; and for x in S, the scalar product x ⋅ w(x) = 1 – x ⋅ f(x) is strictly positive. From the original n-dimensional space Euclidean space V, construct a new auxiliary (n + 1)-dimensional space W = V x R, with coordinates y = (x, t). Set X(x,t)=(−tw(x),x⋅w(x)).𝐗(𝐱,t)=(-t 𝐰(𝐱),𝐱·𝐰(𝐱)). By construction X is a continuous vector field on the unit sphere of W, satisfying the tangency condition y ⋅ X(y) = 0. Moreover, X(y) is nowhere vanishing (because, if x has norm 1, then x ⋅ w(x) is non-zero; while if x has norm strictly less than 1, then t and w(x) are both non-zero). This contradiction proves the fixed point theorem when n is even. For n odd, one can apply the fixed point theorem to the closed unit ball B in n + 1 dimensions and the mapping F(x,y) = (f(x),0). The advantage of this proof is that it uses only elementary techniques; more general results like the Borsuk-Ulam theorem require tools from algebraic topology.[50] A proof using homology or
