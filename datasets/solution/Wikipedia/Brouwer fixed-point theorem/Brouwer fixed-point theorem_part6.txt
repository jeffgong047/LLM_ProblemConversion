Closedness: Consider the function f(x)=x+12,(x)=x+1/2, which is a continuous function from the open interval (−1,1) to itself. Since x = 1 is not part of the interval, there is not a fixed point of f(x) = x. The space (−1,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. On the other hand, the function f does have a fixed point for the closed interval [−1,1], namely f(1) = 1.
