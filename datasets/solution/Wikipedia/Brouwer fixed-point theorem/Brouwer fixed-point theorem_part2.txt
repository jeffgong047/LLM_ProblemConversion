Statement: The theorem has several formulations, depending on the context in which it is used and its degree of generalization. The simplest is sometimes given as follows: In the plane Every continuous function from a closed disk to itself has at least one fixed point.[6] This can be generalized to an arbitrary finite dimension: In Euclidean space Every continuous function from a closed ball of a Euclidean space into itself has a fixed point.[7] A slightly more general version is as follows:[8] Convex compact set Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset K of a Euclidean space to K itself has a fixed point.[9] An even more general form is better known under a different name: Schauder fixed point theorem Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset K of a Banach space to K itself has a fixed point.[10] Importance of the
