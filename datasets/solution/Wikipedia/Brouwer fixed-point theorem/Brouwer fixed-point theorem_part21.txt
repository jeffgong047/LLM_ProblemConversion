theorem: As in the proof of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem for continuous maps using homology, it is reduced to proving that there is no continuous retraction F from the ball B onto its boundary ∂B. In that case it can be assumed that F is smooth, since it can be approximated using the Weierstrass approximation theorem or by convolving with non-negative smooth bump functions of sufficiently small support and integral one (i.e. mollifying). If ω is a volume form on the boundary then by Stokes' theorem, 0<∫∂Bω=∫∂BF∗(ω)=∫BdF∗(ω)=∫BF∗(dω)=∫BF∗(0)=0,0<∫_ω=∫_F^*(ω)=∫_BdF^*(ω)=∫_BF^*(dω)=∫_BF^*(0)=0, giving a contradiction.[52][53] More generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth oriented compact manifold M onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes' theorem is closely related to the proof using homology, because the form ω generates the de Rham cohomology group Hn-1(∂M) which is isomorphic to the homology group Hn-1(∂M) by de Rham's theorem.[54] A combinatorial
