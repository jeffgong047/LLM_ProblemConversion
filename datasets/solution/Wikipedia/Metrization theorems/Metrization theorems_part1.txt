Topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space In topology and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space. That is, a topological space (X,τ)(X,τ) is said to be metrizable if there is a metric d:X×X→[0,∞):X→[0,∞) such that the topology induced by d is τ.τ.[1][2] Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable.
