Examples: The group of unitary operators U(H)ùïå(‚Ñã) on a separable Hilbert space H‚Ñã endowed with the strong operator topology is metrizable (see Proposition II.1 in [4]). Examples of non-metrizable spaces Non-normal spaces cannot be metrizable; important examples include the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety or on the spectrum of a ring, used in algebraic geometry, the topological vector space of all functions from the real line R‚Ñù to itself, with the topology of pointwise convergence. The real line with the lower limit topology is not metrizable. The usual distance function is not a metric on this space because the topology it determines is the usual topology, not the lower limit topology. This space is Hausdorff, paracompact and first countable. Locally metrizable but not
