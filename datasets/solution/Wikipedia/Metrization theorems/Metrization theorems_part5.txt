metrizable: The Line with two origins, also called the bug-eyed line is a non-Hausdorff manifold (and thus cannot be metrizable). Like all manifolds, it is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space and thus locally metrizable (but not metrizable) and locally Hausdorff (but not Hausdorff). It is also a T1 locally regular space but not a semiregular space. The long line is locally metrizable but not metrizable; in a sense it is "too long". See
