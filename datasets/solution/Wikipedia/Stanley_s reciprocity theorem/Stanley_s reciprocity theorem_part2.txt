Definitions: A rational cone is the set of all d-tuples (a1, ..., ad) of nonnegative integers satisfying a system of inequalities M[a1⋮ad]≥[0⋮0][a_1 ⋮ a_d]≥[0 ⋮ 0] where M is a matrix of integers. A d-tuple satisfying the corresponding strict inequalities, i.e., with ">" rather than "≥", is in the interior of the cone. The generating function of such a cone is F(x1,…,xd)=∑(a1,…,ad)∈conex1a1⋯xdad.(x_1,…,x_d)=∑_(a_1,…,a_d)∈conex_1^a_1_d^a_d. The generating function Fint(x1, ..., xd) of the interior of the cone is defined in the same way, but one sums over d-tuples in the interior rather than in the whole cone. It can be shown that these are rational functions.
