Formulation: Stanley's reciprocity theorem states that for a rational cone as above, we have F(1/x1,…,1/xd)=(−1)dFint(x1,…,xd).(1/x_1,…,1/x_d)=(-1)^dF_int(x_1,…,x_d). Matthias Beck and Mike Develin have shown how to prove this by using the calculus of residues. Develin has said that this amounts to proving the result "without doing any work".[citation needed] Stanley's reciprocity theorem generalizes Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity for Ehrhart polynomials of rational convex polytopes.
