trapezoid: The British flag theorem can be generalized into a statement about (convex) isosceles trapezoids. More precisely for a trapezoid ABCD with parallel sides AB and CD and interior pointP the following equation holds: |AP|2+|AB||CD|⋅|PC|2=|BP|2+|AB||CD|⋅|PD|2|AP|^2+|AB|/|CD|·|PC|^2=|BP|^2+|AB|/|CD|·|PD|^2 In the case of a rectangle the fraction |AB||CD||AB||CD| evaluates to 1 and hence yields the original theorem.[6]
