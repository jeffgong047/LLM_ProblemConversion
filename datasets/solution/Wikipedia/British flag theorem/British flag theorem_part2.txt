Proof: Illustration for proof Drop perpendicular lines from the point P to the sides of the rectangle, meeting sides AB, BC, CD, and AD at points W, X, Y and Z respectively, as shown in the figure. These four points WXYZ form the vertices of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. By applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle AWP, and observing that WP = AZ, it follows that AP2=AW2+WP2=AW2+AZ2^2=AW^2+WP^2=AW^2+AZ^2 and by a similar argument the squares of the lengths of the distances from P to the other three corners can be calculated as PC2=WB2+ZD2,^2=WB^2+ZD^2, BP2=WB2+AZ2,^2=WB^2+AZ^2, and PD2=ZD2+AW2.^2=ZD^2+AW^2. Therefore: AP2+PC2=(AW2+AZ2)+(WB2+ZD2)=(WB2+AZ2)+(ZD2+AW2)=BP2+PD2AP^2+PC^2 =(AW^2+AZ^2)+(WB^2+ZD^2) =(WB^2+AZ^2)+(ZD^2+AW^2) =BP^2+PD^2 Isosceles
