Corollary: The global extrema of a function f on a domain A occur only at boundaries, non-differentiable points, and stationary points. If x0_0 is a global extremum of f, then one of the following is true: boundary: x0_0 is in the boundary of A non-differentiable: f is not differentiable at x0_0 stationary point: x0_0 is a stationary point of f
