Statement: One way to state Fermat's theorem is that, if a function has a local extremum at some point and is differentiable there, then the function's derivative at that point must be zero. In precise mathematical language: Let f:(a,b)→R(a,b)→ℝ be a function and suppose that x0∈(a,b)_0∈(a,b) is a point where f has a local extremum. If f is differentiable at x0_0, then f′(x0)=0'(x_0)=0. Another way to understand the theorem is via the contrapositive statement: if the derivative of a function at any point is not zero, then there is not a local extremum at that point. Formally: If f is differentiable at x0∈(a,b)_0∈(a,b), and f′(x0)≠0'(x_0)≠0, then x0_0 is not a local extremum of f.
