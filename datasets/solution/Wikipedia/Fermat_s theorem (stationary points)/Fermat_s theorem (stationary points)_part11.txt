functions: If f is continuously differentiable (C1)(C^1) on an open neighborhood of the point x0_0, then f′(x0)>0'(x_0)>0 does mean that f is increasing on a neighborhood of x0,_0, as follows. If f′(x0)=K>0'(x_0)=K>0 and f∈C1,^1, then by continuity of the derivative, there is some ε0>0ε_0>0 such that f′(x)>K/2'(x)>K/2 for all x∈(x0−ε0,x0+ε0)∈(x_0-ε_0,x_0+ε_0). Then f is increasing on this interval, by the mean value theorem: the slope of any secant line is at least K/2,/2, as it equals the slope of some tangent line. However, in the general statement of Fermat's theorem, where one is only given that the derivative at x0_0 is positive, one can only conclude that secant lines through x0_0 will have positive slope, for secant lines between x0_0 and near enough points. Conversely, if the derivative of f at a point is zero (x0_0 is a stationary point), one cannot in general conclude anything about the local behavior of f – it may increase to one side and decrease to the other (as in x3^3), increase to both sides (as in x4^4), decrease to both sides (as in −x4-x^4), or behave in more complicated ways, such as oscillating (as in x2sin⁡(1/x)^2sin(1/x), as discussed below). One can analyze the infinitesimal behavior via the second derivative test and higher-order derivative test, if the function is differentiable enough, and if the first non-vanishing derivative at x0_0 is a continuous function, one can then conclude local behavior (i.e., if f(k)(x0)≠0^(k)(x_0)≠0 is the first non-vanishing derivative, and f(k)^(k) is continuous, so f∈Ck^k), then one can treat f as locally close to a polynomial of degree k, since it behaves approximately as f(k)(x0)(x−x0)k,^(k)(x_0)(x-x_0)^k, but if the k-th derivative is not continuous, one cannot draw such conclusions, and it may behave rather differently.
