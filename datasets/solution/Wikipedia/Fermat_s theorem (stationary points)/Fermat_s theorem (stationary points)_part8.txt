extremum: Suppose that f is differentiable at x0∈(a,b),_0∈(a,b), with derivative K, and assume without loss of generality that K>0,>0, so the tangent line at x0_0 has positive slope (is increasing). Then there is a neighborhood of x0_0 on which the secant lines through x0_0 all have positive slope, and thus to the right of x0,_0, f is greater, and to the left of x0,_0, f is lesser. The schematic of the proof is: an infinitesimal statement about derivative (tangent line) at x0_0 implies a local statement about difference quotients (secant lines) near x0,_0, which implies a local statement about the value of f near x0._0. Formally, by the definition of derivative, f′(x0)=K'(x_0)=K means that limε→0f(x0+ε)−f(x0)ε=K.lim_ε→0f(x_0+ε)-f(x_0)/ε=K. In particular, for sufficiently small εε (less than some ε0ε_0), the quotient must be at least K/2,/2, by the definition of limit. Thus on the interval (x0−ε0,x0+ε0)(x_0-ε_0,x_0+ε_0) one has: f(x0+ε)−f(x0)ε>K/2;f(x_0+ε)-f(x_0)/ε>K/2; one has replaced the equality in the limit (an infinitesimal statement) with an inequality on a neighborhood (a local statement). Thus, rearranging the equation, if ε>0,ε>0, then: f(x0+ε)>f(x0)+(K/2)ε>f(x0),(x_0+ε)>f(x_0)+(K/2)ε>f(x_0), so on the interval to the right, f is greater than f(x0),(x_0), and if ε<0,ε<0, then: f(x0+ε)<f(x0)+(K/2)ε<f(x0),(x_0+ε)<f(x_0)+(K/2)ε<f(x_0), so on the interval to the left, f is less than f(x0).(x_0). Thus x0_0 is not a local or global maximum or minimum of f. Proof 2: Extremum implies derivative
