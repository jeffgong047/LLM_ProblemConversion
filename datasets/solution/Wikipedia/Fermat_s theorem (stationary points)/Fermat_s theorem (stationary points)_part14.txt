Notes: ^ This intuition is only correct for continuously differentiable (C1)(C^1) functions, while in general it is not literally correctâ€”a function need not be increasing up to a local maximum: it may instead be oscillating, so neither increasing nor decreasing, but simply the local maximum is greater than any values in a small neighborhood to the left or right of it. See details in the pathologies.
