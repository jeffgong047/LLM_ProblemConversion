functions: The function sin⁡(1/x)sin(1/x) – it oscillates increasingly rapidly between −1-1 and 11 as x approaches 0. Consequently, the function f(x)=(1+sin⁡(1/x))x2(x)=(1+sin(1/x))x^2 oscillates increasingly rapidly between 0 and 2x22x^2 as x approaches 0. If one extends this function by defining f(0)=0(0)=0 then the extended function is continuous and everywhere differentiable (it is differentiable at 0 with derivative 0), but has rather unexpected behavior near 0: in any neighborhood of 0 it attains 0 infinitely many times, but also equals 2x22x^2 (a positive number) infinitely often. Continuing in this vein, one may define g(x)=(2+sin⁡(1/x))x2(x)=(2+sin(1/x))x^2, which oscillates between x2^2 and 3x23x^2. The function has its local and global minimum at x=0=0, but on no neighborhood of 0 is it decreasing down to or increasing up from 0 – it oscillates wildly near 0. This pathology can be understood because, while the function g is everywhere differentiable, it is not continuously differentiable: the limit of g′(x)'(x) as x→0→0 does not exist, so the derivative is not continuous at 0. This reflects the oscillation between increasing and decreasing values as it approaches 0. See
