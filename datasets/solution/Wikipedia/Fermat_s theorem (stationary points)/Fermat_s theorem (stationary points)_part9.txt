vanishes: Alternatively, one can start by assuming that x0_0 is a local maximum, and then prove that the derivative is 0. Suppose that x0_0 is a local maximum (a similar proof applies if x0_0 is a local minimum). Then there exists δ>0δ>0 such that (x0−δ,x0+δ)⊂(a,b)(x_0-δ,x_0+δ)⊂(a,b) and such that we have f(x0)≥f(x)(x_0)(x) for all x with |x−x0|<δ|x-x_0|<δ. Hence for any h∈(0,δ)∈(0,δ) we have f(x0+h)−f(x0)h≤0.f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)/h≤0. Since the limit of this ratio as h gets close to 0 from above exists and is equal to f′(x0)'(x_0) we conclude that f′(x0)≤0'(x_0)≤0. On the other hand, for h∈(−δ,0)∈(-δ,0) we notice that f(x0+h)−f(x0)h≥0f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)/h≥0 but again the limit as h gets close to 0 from below exists and is equal to f′(x0)'(x_0) so we also have f′(x0)≥0'(x_0)≥0. Hence we conclude that f′(x0)=0.'(x_0)=0.
