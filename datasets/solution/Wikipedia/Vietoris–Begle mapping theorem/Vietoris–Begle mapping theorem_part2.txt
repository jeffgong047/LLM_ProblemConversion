Theorem: Let X and Y be compact metric spaces, and let f:X→Y:X be surjective and continuous. Suppose that the fibers of f are acyclic, so that H r(f−1(y))=0,H̃_r(f^-1(y))=0, for all 0≤r≤n−10-1 and all y∈Y, with H rH̃_r denoting the rth reduced Vietoris homology group. Then, the induced homomorphism f∗:H r(X)→H r(Y)_*:H̃_r(X)→H̃_r(Y) is an isomorphism for r≤n−1-1 and a surjection for r=n=n. Note that as stated the theorem doesn't hold for homology theories like singular homology. For example, Vietoris homology groups of the closed topologist's sine curve and of a segment are isomorphic (since the first projects onto the second with acyclic fibers). But the singular homology differs, since the segment is path connected and the topologist's sine curve is not.
