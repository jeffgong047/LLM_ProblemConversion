Proof: In order to prove this generalized form of the theorem, Petersen first proved that a 4-regular graph can be factorized into two 2-factors by taking alternate edges in a Eulerian trail. He noted that the same technique used for the 4-regular graph yields a factorization of a 2k-regular graph into two k-factors.[2] To prove this theorem, it is sufficient to consider connected graphs. A connected graph with even degree has an Eulerian trail. Traversing this Eulerian trail generates an orientation D of G such that every point has indegree and outdegree = k. Next, replace every vertex v ϵ V(D) by two vertices v’ and v”, and replace every directed edge uv of the oriented graph by an undirected edge from u’ to v”. Since D has in- and outdegrees equal to k the resulting bipartite graph G’ is k-regular. The edges of G’ can be partitioned into k perfect matchings by a theorem of Kőnig. Now merging v’ with v” for every v recovers the graph G, and maps the k perfect matchings of G’ onto k 2-factors of G which partition its edges.[1]
