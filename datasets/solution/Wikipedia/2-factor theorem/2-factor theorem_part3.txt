History: The theorem was discovered by Julius Petersen, a Danish mathematician. It is one of the first results ever discovered in the field of graph theory. The theorem appears first in the 1891 article "Die Theorie der regul√§ren graphs". To prove the theorem, Petersen's fundamental idea was to 'colour' the edges of a trail or a path alternatively red and blue, and then to use the edges of one or both colours for the construction of other paths or trials.[3]
