Gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken In quantum field theory and statistical field theory, Elitzur's theorem states that in gauge theories, the only operators that can have non-vanishing expectation values are ones that are invariant under local gauge transformations. An important implication is that gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. The theorem was proved in 1975 by Shmuel Elitzur in lattice field theory,[1] although the same result is expected to hold in the continuum. The theorem shows that the naive interpretation of the Higgs mechanism as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry is incorrect, although the phenomenon can be reformulated entirely in terms of gauge invariant quantities in what is known as the Fröhlich–Morchio–Strocchi mechanism.[2]
