formula: Watanabe's example, using objects A, B, C, and properties F ("first"), W ("white"). "0", "1", "¬", "∧", "∨", and "⊕" denote "false", "true", "not", "and", "or", and "exclusive or", respectively. Since F happens to imply W, each predicate that can be formed from F and W coincides with another one, hence there are only 8 extensionally distinct possible predicates, each shown on an own line. The white ducklings A and B agree on 4 of them (line 2, 3, 4, 8), but so do A and C, too (line 3, 5, 7, 8), and so do B and C (line 1, 3, 6, 8).[1]: 368 [2] Suppose there are n things in the universe, and one wants to put them into classes or categories. One has no preconceived ideas or biases about what sorts of categories are "natural" or "normal" and what are not. So one has to consider all the possible classes that could be, all the possible ways of making a set out of the n objects. There are 2n2^n such ways, the size of the power set of n objects. One can use that to measure the similarity between two objects, and one would see how many sets they have in common. However, one cannot. Any two objects have exactly the same number of classes in common if we can form any possible class, namely 2n−12^n-1 (half the total number of classes there are). To see this is so, one may imagine each class is a represented by an n-bit string (or binary encoded integer), with a zero for each element not in the class and a one for each element in the class. As one finds, there are 2n2^n such strings. As all possible choices of zeros and ones are there, any two bit-positions will agree exactly half the time. One may pick two elements and reorder the bits so they are the first two, and imagine the numbers sorted lexicographically. The first 2n/22^n/2 numbers will have bit #1 set to zero, and the second 2n/22^n/2 will have it set to one. Within each of those blocks, the top 2n/42^n/4 will have bit #2 set to zero and the other 2n/42^n/4 will have it as one, so they agree on two blocks of 2n/42^n/4 or on half of all the cases, no matter which two elements one picks. So if we have no preconceived bias about which categories are better, everything is then equally similar (or equally dissimilar). The number of predicates simultaneously satisfied by two non-identical elements is constant over all such pairs. Thus, some kind of inductive[citation needed] bias is needed to make judgements to prefer certain categories over others. Boolean
