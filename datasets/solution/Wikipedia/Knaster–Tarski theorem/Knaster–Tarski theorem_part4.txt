Proof: Let us restate the theorem. For a complete lattice ⟨L,≤⟩,≤⟩ and a monotone function f:L→L on L, the set of all fixpoints of f is also a complete lattice ⟨P,≤⟩,≤⟩, with: ⋁P=⋁x∈L∣x≤f(x)=⋁{x(x)} as the greatest fixpoint of f ⋀P=⋀x∈L∣x≥f(x)=⋀{x(x)} as the least fixpoint of f. Proof. We begin by showing that P has both a least element and a greatest element. Let D = {x | x ≤ f(x)} and x ∈ D (we know that at least 0L belongs to D). Then because f is monotone we have f(x) ≤ f(f(x)), that is f(x) ∈ D. Now let u=⋁D= (u exists because D ⊆ L and L is a complete lattice). Then for all x ∈ D it is true that x ≤ u and f(x) ≤ f(u), so x ≤ f(x) ≤ f(u). Therefore, f(u) is an upper bound of D, but u is the least upper bound, so u ≤ f(u), i.e. u ∈ D. Then f(u) ∈ D (because f(u) ≤ f(f(u))) and so f(u) ≤ u from which follows f(u) = u. Because every fixpoint is in D we have that u is the greatest fixpoint of f. The function f is monotone on the dual (complete) lattice ⟨Lop,≥⟩^op,≥⟩. As we have just proved, its greatest fixpoint exists. It is the least fixpoint of L, so P has least and greatest elements, that is more generally, every monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixpoint and a greatest fixpoint. For a, b in L we write [a, b] for the closed interval with bounds a and b: {x ∈ L | a ≤ x ≤ b}. If a ≤ b, then ⟨⟨[a, b], ≤⟩⟩ is a complete lattice. It remains to be proven that P is a complete lattice. Let 1L=⋁L1_L=, W ⊆ P and w=⋁W=. We show that f([w, 1L]) ⊆ [w, 1L]. Indeed, for every x ∈ W we have x = f(x) and since w is the least upper bound of W, x ≤ f(w). In particular w ≤ f(w). Then from y ∈ [w, 1L] follows that w ≤ f(w) ≤ f(y), giving f(y) ∈ [w, 1L] or simply f([w, 1L]) ⊆ [w, 1L]. This allows us to look at f as a function on the complete lattice [w, 1L]. Then it has a least fixpoint there, giving us the least upper bound of W. We've shown that an arbitrary subset of P has a supremum, that is, P is a complete lattice. Computing a Tarski
