(February 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In the mathematical areas of order and lattice theory, the Knaster–Tarski theorem, named after Bronisław Knaster and Alfred Tarski, states the following: Let (L, ≤) be a complete lattice and let f : L → L be an order-preserving (monotonic) function w.r.t. ≤ . Then the set of fixed points of f in L forms a complete lattice under ≤ . It was Tarski who stated the result in its most general form,[1] and so the theorem is often known as Tarski's fixed-point theorem. Some time earlier, Knaster and Tarski established the result for the special case where L is the lattice of subsets of a set, the power set lattice.[2] The theorem has important applications in formal semantics of programming languages and abstract interpretation, as well as in game theory. A kind of converse of this theorem was proved by Anne C. Davis: If every order-preserving function f : L → L on a lattice L has a fixed point, then L is a complete lattice.[3] Consequences: least and greatest fixed
