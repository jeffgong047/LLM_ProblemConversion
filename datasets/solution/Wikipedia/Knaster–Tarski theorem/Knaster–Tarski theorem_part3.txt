theorem: Weaker versions of the Knaster–Tarski theorem can be formulated for ordered sets, but involve more complicated assumptions. For example: Let L be a partially ordered set with a least element (bottom) and let f : L → L be an monotonic function. Further, suppose there exists u in L such that f(u) ≤ u and that any chain in the subset x∈L∣x≤f(x),x≤u{x(x),x} has a supremum. Then f admits a least fixed point. This can be applied to obtain various theorems on invariant sets, e.g. the Ok's theorem: For the monotone map F : P(X ) → P(X ) on the family of (closed) nonempty subsets of X, the following are equivalent: (o) F admits A in P(X ) s.t. A⊆F(A)(A), (i) F admits invariant set A in P(X ) i.e. A=F(A)=F(A), (ii) F admits maximal invariant set A, (iii) F admits the greatest invariant set A. In particular, using the Knaster-Tarski principle one can develop the theory of global attractors for noncontractive discontinuous (multivalued) iterated function systems. For weakly contractive iterated function systems the Kantorovitch fixpoint theorem (known also as Tarski-Kantorovitch fixpoint principle) suffices. Other applications of fixed-point principles for ordered sets come from the theory of differential, integral and operator equations.
