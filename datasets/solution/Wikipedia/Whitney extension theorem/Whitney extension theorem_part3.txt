space: Seeley (1964) proved a sharpening of the Whitney extension theorem in the special case of a half space. A smooth function on a half space Rn,+ of points where xn ≥ 0 is a smooth function f on the interior xn for which the derivatives ∂α f extend to continuous functions on the half space. On the boundary xn = 0, f restricts to smooth function. By Borel's lemma, f can be extended to a smooth function on the whole of Rn. Since Borel's lemma is local in nature, the same argument shows that if ΩΩ is a (bounded or unbounded) domain in Rn with smooth boundary, then any smooth function on the closure of ΩΩ can be extended to a smooth function on Rn. Seeley's result for a half line gives a uniform extension map E:C∞(R+)→C∞(R),E:C^∞(𝐑^+)^∞(𝐑), which is linear, continuous (for the topology of uniform convergence of functions and their derivatives on compacta) and takes functions supported in [0,R] into functions supported in [−R,R] To define E,, set[1] E(f)(x)=∑m=1∞amf(−bmx)φ(−bmx)(x<0),E(f)(x)=∑_m=1^∞a_mf(-b_mx)φ(-b_mx) (x<0), where φ is a smooth function of compact support on R equal to 1 near 0 and the sequences (am), (bm) satisfy: bm>0_m>0 tends to ∞∞; ∑ambmj=(−1)j_mb_m^j=(-1)^j for j≥0≥0 with the sum absolutely convergent. A solution to this system of equations can be obtained by taking bn=2n_n=2^n and seeking an entire function g(z)=∑m=1∞amzm(z)=∑_m=1^∞a_mz^m such that g(2j)=(−1)j.(2^j)=(-1)^j. That such a function can be constructed follows from the Weierstrass theorem and Mittag-Leffler theorem.[2] It can be seen directly by setting[3] W(z)=∏j≥1(1−z/2j),(z)=∏_j≥1(1-z/2^j), an entire function with simple zeros at 2j.2^j. The derivatives W '(2j) are bounded above and below. Similarly the function M(z)=∑j≥1(−1)jW′(2j)(z−2j)(z)=∑_j≥1(-1)^j^'(2^j)(z-2^j) meromorphic with simple poles and prescribed residues at 2j.2^j. By construction g(z)=W(z)M(z)g(z)=W(z)M(z) is an entire function with the required properties. The definition for a half space in Rn by applying the operator R to the last variable xn. Similarly, using a smooth partition of unity and a local change of variables, the result for a half space implies the existence of an analogous extending map C∞(Ω¯)→C∞(Rn)C^∞(Ω)^∞(𝐑^n) for any domain ΩΩ in Rn with smooth boundary.
