transitivity: By relaxing the transitivity of social preferences, we can find aggregation rules that satisfy Arrow's other conditions. If we impose neutrality (equal treatment of alternatives) on such rules, however, there exists an individual who has a "veto". So the possibility provided by this approach is also very limited. First, suppose that a social preference is quasi-transitive (instead of transitive); this means that the strict preference ≻≻ ("better than") is transitive: if x≻y and y≻z, then x≻z. Then, there do exist non-dictatorial aggregation rules satisfying Arrow's conditions, but such rules are oligarchic.[32] This means that there exists a coalition L such that L is decisive (if every member in L prefers x to y, then the society prefers x to y), and each member in L has a veto (if she prefers x to y, then the society cannot prefer y to x). Second, suppose that a social preference is acyclic (instead of transitive): there do not exist alternatives x1,…,xk_1,…,x_k that form a cycle (x1≻x2,x2≻x3,…,xk−1≻xk,xk≻x1_1_2, x_2_3, …, x_k-1_k, x_k_1). Then, provided that there are at least as many alternatives as individuals, an aggregation rule satisfying Arrow's other conditions is collegial.[33] This means that there are individuals who belong to the intersection ("collegium") of all decisive coalitions. If there is someone who has a veto, then he belongs to the collegium. If the rule is assumed to be neutral, then it does have someone who has a veto. Finally, Brown's theorem left open the case of acyclic social preferences where the number of alternatives is less than the number of individuals. One can give a definite answer for that case using the Nakamura number. See limiting the number of alternatives. Relaxing assumption
