In the field of consumer's demand theory the ordinalist position turned out to create no problems; cardinal utility had no explanatory power above and beyond ordinal. Leibniz' Principle of the identity of indiscernibles demanded then the excision of cardinal utility from our thought patterns."

JSTOR 1913445. ^ It is sometimes asserted that such methods may trivially fail the universality criterion. However, it is more appropriate to consider that such methods fail Arrow's definition of an aggregation rule (or that of a function whose domain consists of preference profiles), if preference orderings cannot uniquely translate into a ballot. ^ However, a modified version of Arrow's theorem may still apply to such methods (e.g., Brams; Fishburn (2002). "Chapter 4". In Arrow, Kenneth J.; Sen, Amartya K.; Suzumura, Kōtarō (eds.). Handbook of social choice and welfare. Vol. 1. Amsterdam, Netherlands: Elsevier. Theorem 4.2 framework.

Retrieved 2016-02-16. ^ No voting method that nontrivially uses cardinal utility satisfies Arrow's IIA (in which preference profiles are replaced by lists of ballots or lists of utilities). For this reason, a weakened notion of IIA is proposed (e.g., Sen (1979, p. 129)). The notion requires that the social ranking of two alternatives depend only on the levels of utility attained by individuals at the two alternatives. (More formally, a social welfare functional F is a function that maps each list u=(u1,…,un)=(u_1,…,u_n) of utility functions into a social preference. F satisfies IIA (for social welfare functionals) if for all lists u,u′,u' and for all alternatives x,y,y, if ui(x)=ui′(x)_i(x)=u'_i(x) and ui(y)=ui′(y)_i(y)=u'_i(y) for all i, then xF(u)yiffxF(u′)y(u)yiffxF(u')y.) Many cardinal voting methods (including range voting) satisfy the weakened version of IIA. ^ Poundstone, William (2009-02-17).

It is nonsense to talk about social preferences since society itself is nothing more than a collection of individuals, each with his own interests. ... this first reaction to Arrow's Theorem is logically attractive, but it can lead to varieties of nihilism that are unappealing to some people, including us. ^ Arrow, Kenneth Joseph (1963).
