individuals: Several theorists (e.g., Fishburn[17] and Kirman and Sondermann[18]) point out that when one drops the assumption that there are only finitely many individuals, one can find aggregation rules that satisfy all of Arrow's other conditions. However, such aggregation rules are practically of limited interest, since they are based on ultrafilters, highly non-constructive mathematical objects. In particular, Kirman and Sondermann argue that there is an "invisible dictator" behind such a rule.[18] Mihara[19][20] shows that such a rule violates algorithmic computability.[21] These results can be seen to establish the robustness of Arrow's theorem.[22] On the other hand, the ultrafilters (indeed, constructing them in an infinite model relies on the axiom of choice) are inherent in finite models as well (with no need of the axiom of choice). They can be interpreted as decisive hierarchies, with the only difference that the hierarchy's top level - Arrow's dictator - always exists in a finite model but can be unattainable (= missing) in an infinite hierarchy. In the latter case, the "invisible dictator" is nothing else but the infinite decisive hierarchy itself. If desired, it can be complemented with a limit point, which then becomes a "visible dictator". Since dictators are inseparable from decisive hierarchies, the Dictatorship prohibition automatically prohibits decisive hierarchies, which is much less self-evident than the Dictatorship prohibition.[23][24][25] See also paragraph "Relaxing the Dictatorship prohibition".
