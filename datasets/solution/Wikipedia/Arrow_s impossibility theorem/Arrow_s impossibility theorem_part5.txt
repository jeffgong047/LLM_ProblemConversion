coalitions: Arrow's proof used the concept of decisive coalitions.[7] Definition: A subset of voters is a coalition. A coalition is decisive over an ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) if and only if when everyone in the coalition ranks x≻iy≻_iy, then x≻y overall. A coalition is decisive if and only if it is decisive over all ordered pairs. The following proof is a simplification taken from (Sen, 2014)[10] and (Rubinstein, 2012).[11] The simplified proof uses an addition concept: A coalition is weakly decisive over (x,y)(x,y) if and only if when every voter i in the coalition ranks x≻iy≻_iy, and every voter j outside the coalition ranks y≻jx≻_jx, then x≻y. Thenceforth assume that the social choice system satisfies unrestricted domain, Pareto efficiency, and IIA. Also assume that there are at least 3 distinct outcomes. Field expansion lemma — if a coalition G is weakly decisive over (x,y)(x,y) for some x≠y, then it is decisive. Proof Let z be an outcome distinct from x,y,y. Claim: G is decisive over (x,z)(x,z). Let everyone in G vote x over z. By IIA, changing the votes on y does not matter for x,z,z. So change the votes such that x≻iy≻iz≻_iy≻_iz in G and y≻ix≻_ix and z outside of G. By Pareto, y≻z. By coalition weak-decisiveness over (x,y)(x,y), x≻y. Thus x≻z. ◻□ Similarly, G is decisive over (z,y)(z,y). By iterating the above two claims (note that decisiveness implies weak-decisiveness), we find that G is decisive over all ordered pairs in x,y,z{x,y,z}. Then iterating that, we find that G is decisive over all ordered pairs in X. Group contraction lemma — If a coalition is decisive, and has size ≥2≥2, then it has a proper subset that is also decisive. Proof Let G be a coalition with size ≥2≥2. Partition the coalition into nonempty subsets G1,G2_1,G_2. Fix distinct x,y,z,y,z. Design the following voting pattern (notice that it is the cyclic voting pattern which causes the Condorcet paradox): votersinG1:x≻iy≻izvotersinG2:z≻ix≻iyvotersoutsideG:y≻iz≻ixvotersinG_1 :x≻_iy≻_iz votersinG_2 :z≻_ix≻_iy votersoutsideG :y≻_iz≻_ix (Items other than x,y,z,y,z are not relevant.) Since G is decisive, we have x≻y. So at least one is true: x≻z or z≻y. If x≻z, then G1_1 is weakly decisive over (x,z)(x,z). If z≻y, then G2_2 is weakly decisive over (z,y)(z,y). Now apply the field expansion lemma. By Pareto, the entire set of voters is decisive, thus by group contraction lemma, there is a size-one decisive coalition — a dictator. Proof by the pivotal
