proof: An alternative setting uses the language of group actions. We consider the group G as acting on itself by left multiplication, i.e. g⋅x=gx=gx, which has a permutation representation, say ϕ:G→Sym(G)ϕ:G→Sym(G). The representation is faithful if ϕϕ is injective, that is, if the kernel of ϕϕ is trivial. Suppose g∈ker⁡ϕ∈ϕ. Then, g=ge=g⋅e=e=ge=g=e. Thus, ker⁡ϕϕ is trivial. The result follows by use of the first isomorphism theorem, from which we get Imϕ≅GIm ϕ. Remarks on the regular group
