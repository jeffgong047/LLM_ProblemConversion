Background: A permutation of a set A is a bijective function from A to A. The set of all permutations of A forms a group under function composition, called the symmetric group on A, and written as Sym⁡(A)Sym(A).[13] In particular, taking A to be the underlying set of a group G produces a symmetric group denoted Sym⁡(G)Sym(G).
