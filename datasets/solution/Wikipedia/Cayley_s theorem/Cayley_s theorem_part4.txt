theorem: If g is any element of a group G with operation ∗, consider the function fg : G → G, defined by fg(x) = g ∗ x. By the existence of inverses, this function has also an inverse, fg−1_g^-1. So multiplication by g acts as a bijective function. Thus, fg is a permutation of G, and so is a member of Sym(G). The set K = {fg : g ∈ G} is a subgroup of Sym(G) that is isomorphic to G. The fastest way to establish this is to consider the function T : G → Sym(G) with T(g) = fg for every g in G. T is a group homomorphism because (using · to denote composition in Sym(G)): (fg⋅fh)(x)=fg(fh(x))=fg(h∗x)=g∗(h∗x)=(g∗h)∗x=fg∗h(x),(f_g_h)(x)=f_g(f_h(x))=f_g(h*x)=g*(h*x)=(g*h)*x=f_g*h(x), for all x in G, and hence: T(g)⋅T(h)=fg⋅fh=fg∗h=T(g∗h).(g)(h)=f_g_h=f_g*h=T(g*h). The homomorphism T is injective since T(g) = idG (the identity element of Sym(G)) implies that g ∗ x = x for all x in G, and taking x to be the identity element e of G yields g = g ∗ e = e, i.e. the kernel is trivial. Alternatively, T is also injective since g ∗ x = g′ ∗ x implies that g = g′ (because every group is cancellative). Thus G is isomorphic to the image of T, which is the subgroup K. T is sometimes called the regular representation of G. Alternative setting of
