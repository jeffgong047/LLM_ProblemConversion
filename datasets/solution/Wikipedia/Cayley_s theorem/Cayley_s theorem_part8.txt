statement: Theorem: Let G be a group, and let H be a subgroup. Let G/H/H be the set of left cosets of H in G. Let N be the normal core of H in G, defined to be the intersection of the conjugates of H in G. Then the quotient group G/N/N is isomorphic to a subgroup of Sym‚Å°(G/H)Sym(G/H). The special case H=1=1 is Cayley's original theorem. See
