Representation of groups by permutations For the number of labeled trees in graph theory, see Cayley's formula. In group theory, Cayley's theorem, named in honour of Arthur Cayley, states that every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group.[1] More specifically, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group Sym⁡(G)Sym(G) whose elements are the permutations of the underlying set of G. Explicitly, for each g∈G, the left-multiplication-by-g map ℓg:G→Gℓ_g sending each element x to gx is a permutation of G, and the map G→Sym⁡(G)→Sym(G) sending each element g to ℓgℓ_g is an injective homomorphism, so it defines an isomorphism from G onto a subgroup of Sym⁡(G)Sym(G). The homomorphism G→Sym⁡(G)→Sym(G) can also be understood as arising from the left translation action of G on the underlying set G.[2] When G is finite, Sym⁡(G)Sym(G) is finite too. The proof of Cayley's theorem in this case shows that if G is a finite group of order n, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the standard symmetric group Sn_n. But G might also be isomorphic to a subgroup of a smaller symmetric group, Sm_m for some m<n<n; for instance, the order 6 group G=S3=S_3 is not only isomorphic to a subgroup of S6_6, but also (trivially) isomorphic to a subgroup of S3_3.[3] The problem of finding the minimal-order symmetric group into which a given group G embeds is rather difficult.[4][5] Alperin and Bell note that "in general the fact that finite groups are imbedded in symmetric groups has not influenced the methods used to study finite groups".[6] When G is infinite, Sym⁡(G)Sym(G) is infinite, but Cayley's theorem still applies.
