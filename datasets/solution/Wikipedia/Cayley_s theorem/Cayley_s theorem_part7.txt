representation: Z2 = {0,1} with addition modulo 2; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (12) (see cycle notation). E.g. 0 +1 = 1 and 1+1 = 0, so 1↦01↦0 and 0↦1,0↦1, as they would under a permutation. Z3=0,1,2ℤ_3={0,1,2} with addition modulo 3; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (123), and group element 2 to permutation (132). E.g. 1 + 1 = 2 corresponds to (123)(123) = (132). Z4 = {0,1,2,3} with addition modulo 4; the elements correspond to e, (1234), (13)(24), (1432). The elements of Klein four-group {e, a, b, c} correspond to e, (12)(34), (13)(24), and (14)(23). S3 (dihedral group of order 6) is the group of all permutations of 3 objects, but also a permutation group of the 6 group elements, and the latter is how it is realized by its regular representation. * e a b c d f permutation e e a b c d f e a a e d f b c (12)(35)(46) b b f e d c a (13)(26)(45) c c d f e a b (14)(25)(36) d d c a b f e (156)(243) f f b c a e d (165)(234) More general
