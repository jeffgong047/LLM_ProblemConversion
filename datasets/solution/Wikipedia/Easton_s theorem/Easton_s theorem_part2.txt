Statement: If G is a class function whose domain consists of ordinals and whose range consists of ordinals such that G is non-decreasing, the cofinality of ℵG(α)ℵ_G(α) is greater than ℵαℵ_α for each α in the domain of G, and ℵαℵ_α is regular for each α in the domain of G, then there is a model of ZFC such that 2ℵα=ℵG(α)2^ℵ_α=ℵ_G(α) for each αα in the domain of G. The proof of Easton's theorem uses forcing with a proper class of forcing conditions over a model satisfying the generalized continuum hypothesis. The first two conditions in the theorem are necessary. Condition 1 is a well known property of cardinality, while condition 2 follows from König's theorem. In Easton's model the powersets of singular cardinals have the smallest possible cardinality compatible with the conditions that 2κ has cofinality greater than κ and is a non-decreasing function of κ.
