Mathematic theorem In set theory, Easton's theorem is a result on the possible cardinal numbers of powersets. Easton (1970) (extending a result of Robert M. Solovay) showed via forcing that the only constraints on permissible values for 2κ when κ is a regular cardinal are κ<cf⁡(2κ)κ<cf(2^κ) (where cf(α) is the cofinality of α) and ifκ<λthen2κ≤2λ.ifκ<λthen2^κ≤2^λ.
