Theorem about holomorphic functions of several complex variables
In mathematics, Bochner's tube theorem (named for Salomon Bochner) shows that every function holomorphic on a tube domain in Cnℂ^n can be extended to the convex hull of this domain. 
Theorem Let ω⊂Rnω⊂ℝ^n be a connected open set. Then every function f(z)(z) holomorphic on the tube domain Ω=ω+iRnΩ=ω+iℝ^n can be extended to a function holomorphic on the convex hull ch⁡(Ω)ch(Ω).
A classic reference is [1] (Theorem 9). See also [2][3] for other proofs.

Generalizations[edit]
The generalized version of this theorem was first proved by Kazlow (1979),[4] also proved by Boivin and Dwilewicz (1998)[5] under more less complicated hypothese.
Theorem Let ωω be a connected submanifold of Rnℝ^n of class-C2^2. Then every continuous CR function on the tube domain Ω(ω)Ω(ω) can be continuously extended to a CR function on Ω(ach(ω)).(Ω(ω)=ω+iRn⊂Cn(n≥2),ach(ω):=ω∪Intch(ω))Ω(ach(ω)).
left(Ω(ω)=ω+iℝ^n⊂ℂ^n
left(n≥2),ach(ω):=ω∪Int{ch(ω)). By "Int ch(S)" we will mean the interior taken in the smallest dimensional space which contains "ch(S)".
