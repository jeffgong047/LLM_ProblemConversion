Theorem about holomorphic functions of several complex variables In mathematics, Bochner's tube theorem (named for Salomon Bochner) shows that every function holomorphic on a tube domain in Cnℂ^n can be extended to the convex hull of this domain. Theorem Let ω⊂Rnω⊂ℝ^n be a connected open set. Then every function f(z)(z) holomorphic on the tube domain Ω=ω+iRnΩ=ω+iℝ^n can be extended to a function holomorphic on the convex hull ch⁡(Ω)ch(Ω). A classic reference is [1] (Theorem 9). See also [2][3] for other proofs.
