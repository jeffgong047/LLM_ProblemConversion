Generalizations: The generalized version of this theorem was first proved by Kazlow (1979),[4] also proved by Boivin and Dwilewicz (1998)[5] under more less complicated hypothese. Theorem Let ωω be a connected submanifold of Rnℝ^n of class-C2^2. Then every continuous CR function on the tube domain Ω(ω)Ω(ω) can be continuously extended to a CR function on Ω(ach(ω)).(Ω(ω)=ω+iRn⊂Cn(n≥2),ach(ω):=ω∪Intch(ω))Ω(ach(ω)). left(Ω(ω)=ω+iℝ^n⊂ℂ^n left(n≥2),ach(ω):=ω∪Int{ch(ω)). By "Int ch(S)" we will mean the interior taken in the smallest dimensional space which contains "ch(S)".
