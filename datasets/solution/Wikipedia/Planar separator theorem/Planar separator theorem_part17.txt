compression: Separators have been used as part of data compression algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number k and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(n/k)(n/k) subgraphs of size at most k, with O(n/k)(n/√(k)) vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of k (at most proportional to the logarithm of n) the number of non-isomorphic k-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are Pn_n n-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1+o(1))log2⁡Pn(1+o(1))log_2P_n bits.[42] It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.[43] Universal
