Example: A planar separator for a grid graph Consider a grid graph with r rows and c columns; the number n of vertices equals rc. For instance, in the illustration, r=5=5, c=8=8, and n=rc=40=rc=40. If r is odd, there is a single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if c is odd, there is a single central column, and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing S to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing S from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs A and B, each of which has at most n/2/2 vertices. If r≤c (as in the illustration), then choosing a central column will give a separator S with r≤n≤√(n) vertices, and similarly if c≤r then choosing a central row will give a separator with at most n√(n) vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator S of size at most n√(n), the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most n/2/2.[3] The planar separator theorem states that a similar partition can be constructed in any planar graph. The case of arbitrary planar graphs differs from the case of grid graphs in that the separator has size O(n)(√(n)) but may be larger than n√(n), the bound on the size of the two subsets A and B (in the most common versions of the theorem) is 2n/32n/3 rather than n/2/2, and the two subsets A and B need not themselves form connected subgraphs.
