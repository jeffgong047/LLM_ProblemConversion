theorem: As it is usually stated, the separator theorem states that, in any n-vertex planar graph G=(V,E)=(V,E), there exists a partition of the vertices of G into three sets A, S, and B, such that each of A and B has at most 2n/32n/3 vertices, S has O(n)(√(n)) vertices, and there are no edges with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in B. It is not required that A or B form connected subgraphs of G. S is called the separator for this partition. An equivalent formulation is that the edges of any n-vertex planar graph G may be subdivided into two edge-disjoint subgraphs G1_1 and G2_2 in such a way that both subgraphs have at least n/3/3 vertices and such that the intersection of the vertex sets of the two subgraphs has O(n)(√(n)) vertices in it. Such a partition is known as a separation.[1] If a separation is given, then the intersection of the vertex sets forms a separator, and the vertices that belong to one subgraph but not the other form separated subsets each having at most 2n/32n/3 vertices. In the other direction, if one is given a partition into three sets A, S, and B that meet the conditions of the planar separator theorem, then one may form a separation in which the edges with an endpoint in A belong to G1_1, the edges with an endpoint in B belong to G2_2, and the remaining edges (with both endpoints in S) are partitioned arbitrarily. The constant 2/32/3 in the statement of the separator theorem is arbitrary and may be replaced by any other number in the open interval (1/2,1)(1/2,1) without changing the form of the theorem: a partition into more equal subsets may be obtained from a less-even partition by repeatedly splitting the larger sets in the uneven partition and regrouping the resulting connected components.[2]
