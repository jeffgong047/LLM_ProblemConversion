bounds: A polyhedron formed by replacing each of the faces of an icosahedron by a mesh of 100 triangles, an example of the lower bound construction of Djidjev (1982) In a n×n√(n)×√(n) grid graph, a set S of s<n<√(n) points can enclose a subset of at most s(s−1)/2(s-1)/2 grid points, where the maximum is achieved by arranging S in a diagonal line near a corner of the grid. Therefore, in order to form a separator that separates at least n/3/3 of the points from the remaining grid, s needs to be at least 2n/3≈0.82n√(2n/3)≈0.82√(n). There exist n-vertex planar graphs (for arbitrarily large values of n) such that, for every separator S that partitions the remaining graph into subgraphs of at most 2n/32n/3 vertices, S has at least 4πn/27≈1.56n√(4/√(27))≈1.56√(n).[2] The construction involves approximating a sphere by a convex polyhedron, replacing each of the faces of the polyhedron by a triangular mesh, and applying isoperimetric theorems for the surface of the sphere.
