statement: First we notice that: liminfn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞AnBnlim inf_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n holds by definition of limit superior and limit inferior; liminfn→∞anbn≤liminfn→∞AnBnlim inf_n→∞a_n/b_n≤lim inf_n→∞A_n/B_n holds if and only if limsupn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞anbnlim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n because liminfn→∞xn=−limsupn→∞(−xn)lim inf_n→∞x_n=-lim sup_n→∞(-x_n) for any sequence (xn)n≥1(x_n)_n≥1. Therefore we need only to show that limsupn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞anbnlim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n. If L:=limsupn→∞anbn=+∞:=lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n=+∞ there is nothing to prove, hence we can assume L<+∞<+∞ (it can be either finite or −∞-∞). By definition of limsuplim sup, for all l>L>L there is a natural number ν>0ν>0 such that anbn<l,∀n>ν.a_n/b_n<l, >ν. We can use this inequality so as to write An=Aν+aν+1+⋯+an<Aν+l(Bn−Bν),∀n>ν,_n=A_ν+a_ν+1+…+a_n<A_ν+l(B_n-B_ν), >ν, Because bn>0_n>0, we also have Bn>0_n>0 and we can divide by Bn_n to get AnBn<Aν−lBνBn+l,∀n>ν.A_n/B_n<A_ν-lB_ν/B_n+l, >ν. Since Bn→+∞_n→+∞ as n→+∞→+∞, the sequence Aν−lBνBn→0asn→+∞(keepingνfixed),A_ν-lB_ν/B_n→0asn→+∞(keepingνfixed), and we obtain limsupn→∞AnBn≤l,∀l>L,lim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n, >L, By definition of least upper bound, this precisely means that limsupn→∞AnBn≤L=limsupn→∞anbn,lim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n=lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n, and we are done.
