case: Let (an)n≥1(a_n)_n≥1 and (bn)n≥1(b_n)_n≥1 be two sequences of real numbers. Assume that (bn)n≥1(b_n)_n≥1 is a strictly monotone and divergent sequence (i.e. strictly increasing and approaching +∞+∞, or strictly decreasing and approaching −∞-∞) and the following limit exists: limn→∞an+1−anbn+1−bn=l.lim_n→∞a_n+1-a_n/b_n+1-b_n=l.} Then, the limit limn→∞anbn=l.lim_n→∞a_n/b_n=l.} Statement of the theorem for the 0/0
