statement: Now, take (an),(bn)(a_n),(b_n) as in the statement of the general form of the Stolz-Cesàro theorem and define α1=a1,αk=ak−ak−1,∀k>1β1=b1,βk=bk−bk−1∀k>1α_1=a_1,α_k=a_k-a_k-1, >1 β_1=b_1,β_k=b_k-b_k-1 >1 since (bn)(b_n) is strictly monotone (we can assume strictly increasing for example), βn>0β_n>0 for all n and since bn→+∞_n→+∞ also Bn=b1+(b2−b1)+⋯+(bn−bn−1)=bn→+∞B_n=b_1+(b_2-b_1)+…+(b_n-b_n-1)=b_n→+∞, thus we can apply the theorem we have just proved to (αn),(βn)(α_n),(β_n) (and their partial sums (An),(Bn)(A_n),(B_n)) limsupn→∞anbn=limsupn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞αnβn=limsupn→∞an−an−1bn−bn−1,lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n=lim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞α_n/β_n=lim sup_n→∞a_n-a_n-1/b_n-b_n-1, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.
