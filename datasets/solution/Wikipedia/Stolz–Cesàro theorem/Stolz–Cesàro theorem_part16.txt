Proof: Instead of proving the previous statement, we shall prove a slightly different one; first we introduce a notation: let (an)n≥1(a_n)_n≥1 be any sequence, its partial sum will be denoted by An:=∑m≥1nam_n:=∑_m≥1^na_m. The equivalent statement we shall prove is: Let (an)n≥1,(bn)≥1(a_n)_n≥1,(b_n)_≥1 be any two sequences of real numbers such that bn>0,∀n∈Z>0_n>0, ∈ℤ_>0, limn→∞Bn=+∞lim_n→∞B_n=+∞, then liminfn→∞anbn≤liminfn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞AnBn≤limsupn→∞anbn.lim inf_n→∞a_n/b_n≤lim inf_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞A_n/B_n≤lim sup_n→∞a_n/b_n.
