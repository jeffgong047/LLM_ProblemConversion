case: Case 1: suppose (bn)(b_n) strictly increasing and divergent to +∞+∞, and −∞<l<∞-∞<l<∞. By hypothesis, we have that for all ϵ/2>0ϵ/2>0 there exists ν>0ν>0 such that ∀n>ν>ν |an+1−anbn+1−bn−l|<ϵ2,| a_n+1-a_n/b_n+1-b_n-l |<ϵ/2, which is to say l−ϵ/2<an+1−anbn+1−bn<l+ϵ/2,∀n>ν.-ϵ/2<a_n+1-a_n/b_n+1-b_n<l+ϵ/2, >ν. Since (bn)(b_n) is strictly increasing, bn+1−bn>0_n+1-b_n>0, and the following holds (l−ϵ/2)(bn+1−bn)<an+1−an<(l+ϵ/2)(bn+1−bn),∀n>ν(l-ϵ/2)(b_n+1-b_n)<a_n+1-a_n<(l+ϵ/2)(b_n+1-b_n), >ν. Next we notice that an=[(an−an−1)+⋯+(aν+2−aν+1)]+aν+1_n=[(a_n-a_n-1)+…+(a_ν+2-a_ν+1)]+a_ν+1 thus, by applying the above inequality to each of the terms in the square brackets, we obtain (l−ϵ/2)(bn−bν+1)+aν+1=(l−ϵ/2)[(bn−bn−1)+⋯+(bν+2−bν+1)]+aν+1<anan<(l+ϵ/2)[(bn−bn−1)+⋯+(bν+2−bν+1)]+aν+1=(l+ϵ/2)(bn−bν+1)+aν+1. (l-ϵ/2)(b_n-b_ν+1)+a_ν+1=(l-ϵ/2)[(b_n-b_n-1)+…+(b_ν+2-b_ν+1)]+a_ν+1<a_n a_n<(l+ϵ/2)[(b_n-b_n-1)+…+(b_ν+2-b_ν+1)]+a_ν+1=(l+ϵ/2)(b_n-b_ν+1)+a_ν+1. Now, since bn→+∞_n→+∞ as n→∞→∞, there is an n0>0_0>0 such that bn>0_n>0 for all n>n0>n_0, and we can divide the two inequalities by bn_n for all n>maxν,n0>max{ν,n_0} (l−ϵ/2)+aν+1−bν+1(l−ϵ/2)bn<anbn<(l+ϵ/2)+aν+1−bν+1(l+ϵ/2)bn.(l-ϵ/2)+a_ν+1-b_ν+1(l-ϵ/2)/b_n<a_n/b_n<(l+ϵ/2)+a_ν+1-b_ν+1(l+ϵ/2)/b_n. The two sequences (which are only defined for n>n0>n_0 as there could be an N≤n0_0 such that bN=0_N=0) cn±:=aν+1−bν+1(l±ϵ/2)bn_n^±:=a_ν+1-b_ν+1(l±ϵ/2)/b_n are infinitesimal since bn→+∞_n→+∞ and the numerator is a constant number, hence for all ϵ/2>0ϵ/2>0 there exists n±>n0>0_±>n_0>0, such that |cn+|<ϵ/2,∀n>n+,|cn−|<ϵ/2,∀n>n−, |c_n^+|<ϵ/2, >n_+, |c_n^-|<ϵ/2, >n_-, therefore l−ϵ<l−ϵ/2+cn−<anbn<l+ϵ/2+cn+<l+ϵ,∀n>maxν,n±=:N>0,-ϵ<l-ϵ/2+c_n^-<a_n/b_n<l+ϵ/2+c_n^+<l+ϵ, >max{ν,n_±}=:N>0, which concludes the proof. The case with (bn)(b_n) strictly decreasing and divergent to −∞-∞, and l<∞<∞ is similar. Case 2: we assume (bn)(b_n) strictly increasing and divergent to +∞+∞, and l=+∞=+∞. Proceeding as before, for all 2M>02M>0 there exists ν>0ν>0 such that for all n>ν>ν an+1−anbn+1−bn>2M.a_n+1-a_n/b_n+1-b_n>2M. Again, by applying the above inequality to each of the terms inside the square brackets we obtain an>2M(bn−bν+1)+aν+1,∀n>ν,_n>2M(b_n-b_ν+1)+a_ν+1, >ν, and anbn>2M+aν+1−2Mbν+1bn,∀n>maxν,n0.a_n/b_n>2M+a_ν+1-2Mb_ν+1/b_n, >max{ν,n_0}. The sequence (cn)n>n0(c_n)_n>n_0 defined by cn:=aν+1−2Mbν+1bn_n:=a_ν+1-2Mb_ν+1/b_n is infinitesimal, thus ∀M>0∃n¯>n0>0suchthat−M<cn<M,∀n>n¯,>0 ∃n̅>n_0>0suchthat-M<c_n<M, >n̅, combining this inequality with the previous one we conclude anbn>2M+cn>M,∀n>maxν,n¯=:N.a_n/b_n>2M+c_n>M, >max{ν,n̅}=:N. The proofs of the other cases with (bn)(b_n) strictly increasing or decreasing and approaching +∞+∞ or −∞-∞ respectively and l=±∞=±∞ all proceed in this same way. Proof of the theorem for the 0/0
