case: Case 1: we first consider the case with l<∞<∞ and (bn)(b_n) strictly decreasing. This time, for each ν>0ν>0, we can write an=(an−an+1)+⋯+(an+ν−1−an+ν)+an+ν,_n=(a_n-a_n+1)+…+(a_n+ν-1-a_n+ν)+a_n+ν, and for any ϵ/2>0,ϵ/2>0, ∃n0_0 such that for all n>n0>n_0 we have (l−ϵ/2)(bn−bn+ν)+an+ν=(l−ϵ/2)[(bn−bn+1)+⋯+(bn+ν−1−bn+ν)]+an+ν<anan<(l+ϵ/2)[(bn−bn+1)+⋯+(bn+ν−1−bn+ν)]+an+ν=(l+ϵ/2)(bn−bn+ν)+an+ν. (l-ϵ/2)(b_n-b_n+ν)+a_n+ν=(l-ϵ/2)[(b_n-b_n+1)+…+(b_n+ν-1-b_n+ν)]+a_n+ν<a_n a_n<(l+ϵ/2)[(b_n-b_n+1)+…+(b_n+ν-1-b_n+ν)]+a_n+ν=(l+ϵ/2)(b_n-b_n+ν)+a_n+ν. The two sequences cν±:=an+ν−bn+ν(l±ϵ/2)bn_ν^±:=a_n+ν-b_n+ν(l±ϵ/2)/b_n are infinitesimal since by hypothesis an+ν,bn+ν→0_n+ν,b_n+ν→0 as ν→∞ν→∞, thus for all ϵ/2>0ϵ/2>0 there are ν±>0ν_±>0 such that |cν+|<ϵ/2,∀ν>ν+,|cν−|<ϵ/2,∀ν>ν−, |c_ν^+|<ϵ/2, ∀ν>ν_+, |c_ν^-|<ϵ/2, ∀ν>ν_-, thus, choosing νν appropriately (which is to say, taking the limit with respect to νν) we obtain l−ϵ<l−ϵ/2+cν−<anbn<l+ϵ/2+cν+<l+ϵ,∀n>n0-ϵ<l-ϵ/2+c_ν^-<a_n/b_n<l+ϵ/2+c_ν^+<l+ϵ, >n_0 which concludes the proof. Case 2: we assume l=+∞=+∞ and (bn)(b_n) strictly decreasing. For all 2M>02M>0 there exists n0>0_0>0 such that for all n>n0,>n_0, an+1−anbn+1−bn>2M⟹an−an+1>2M(bn−bn+1).a_n+1-a_n/b_n+1-b_n>2M_n-a_n+1>2M(b_n-b_n+1). Therefore, for each ν>0,ν>0, anbn>2M+an+ν−2Mbn+νbn,∀n>n0.a_n/b_n>2M+a_n+ν-2Mb_n+ν/b_n, >n_0. The sequence cν:=an+ν−2Mbn+νbn_ν:=a_n+ν-2Mb_n+ν/b_n converges to 00 (keeping n fixed). Hence ∀M>0∃ν¯>0>0 ∃ν̅>0 such that −M<cν<M,∀ν>ν¯,-M<c_ν<M, ∀ν>ν̅, and, choosing νν conveniently, we conclude the proof anbn>2M+cν>M,∀n>n0.a_n/b_n>2M+c_ν>M, >n_0. Applications and
