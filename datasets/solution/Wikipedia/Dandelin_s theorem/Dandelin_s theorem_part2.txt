foci: Consider the illustration, depicting a cone with apex S at the top. A plane e intersects the cone in a curve C (with blue interior). The following proof shall show that the curve C is an ellipse. The two brown Dandelin spheres, G1 and G2, are placed tangent to both the plane and the cone: G1 above the plane, G2 below. Each sphere touches the cone along a circle (colored white), k1_1 and k2_2. Denote the point of tangency of the plane with G1 by F1, and similarly for G2 and F2 . Let P be a typical point on the curve C. To Prove: The sum of distances d(P,F1)+d(P,F2)(P,F_1)+d(P,F_2) remains constant as the point P moves along the intersection curve C. (This is one definition of C being an ellipse, with F1_1 and F2_2 being its foci.) A line passing through P and the vertex S of the cone intersects the two circles, touching G1 and G2 respectively at points P1 and P2. As P moves around the curve, P1 and P2 move along the two circles, and their distance d(P1, P2) remains constant. The distance from P to F1 is the same as the distance from P to P1, because the line segments PF1 and PP1 are both tangent to the same sphere G1. By a symmetrical argument, the distance from P to F2 is the same as the distance from P to P2. Consequently, we compute the sum of distances as d(P,F1)+d(P,F2)=d(P,P1)+d(P,P2)=d(P1,P2),(P,F_1)+d(P,F_2)̣̄(P,P_1)+d(P,P_2)̣̄(P_1,P_2), which is constant as P moves along the curve. This gives a different proof of a theorem of Apollonius of Perga.[6] If we define an ellipse to mean the locus of points P such that d(F1, P) + d(F2, P) = a constant, then the above argument proves that the intersection curve C is indeed an ellipse. That the intersection of the plane with the cone is symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of the line through F1 and F2 may be counterintuitive, but this argument makes it clear. Cylinder case Adaptations of this argument work for hyperbolas and parabolas as intersections of a plane with a cone. Another adaptation works for an ellipse realized as the intersection of a plane with a right circular cylinder. Proof of the focus-directrix
