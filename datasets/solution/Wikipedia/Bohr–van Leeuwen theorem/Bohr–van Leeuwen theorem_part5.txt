proof: So as to lower the complexity of the proof, a system with N electrons will be used. This is appropriate, since most of the magnetism in a solid is carried by electrons, and the proof is easily generalized to more than one type of charged particle. Each electron has a negative charge e and mass me_e. If its position is r𝐫 and velocity is v𝐯, it produces a current j=ev𝐣=e𝐯 and a magnetic moment[6] μ=12cr×j=e2cr×v.μ=1/2c𝐫×𝐣=e/2c𝐫×𝐯. The above equation shows that the magnetic moment is a linear function of the velocity coordinates, so the total magnetic moment in a given direction must be a linear function of the form μ=∑i=1Nai⋅r˙i,μ=∑_i=1^N𝐚_i·𝐫̇_i, where the dot represents a time derivative and ai𝐚_i are vector coefficients depending on the position coordinates ri,i=1…N{𝐫_i,i=1}.[6] Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics gives the probability that the nth particle has momentum pn𝐩_n and coordinate rn𝐫_n as dP∝exp⁡[−H(p1,…,pN;r1,…,rN)kBT]dp1,…,dpNdr1,…,drN,∝exp[-ℋ(𝐩_1,…,𝐩_N;𝐫_1,…,𝐫_N)/k_BT]d𝐩_1,…,d𝐩_Nd𝐫_1,…,d𝐫_N, where Hℋ is the Hamiltonian, the total energy of the system.[6] The thermal average of any function f(p1,…,pN;r1,…,rN)(𝐩_1,…,𝐩_N;𝐫_1,…,𝐫_N) of these generalized coordinates is then ⟨f⟩=∫fdP∫dP.⟩=/. In the presence of a magnetic field, H=12me∑i=1N(pi−ecAi)2+eϕ(q),ℋ=1/2m_e∑_i=1^N(𝐩_i-e/c𝐀_i)^2+eϕ(𝐪), where Ai𝐀_i is the magnetic vector potential and ϕ(q)ϕ(𝐪) is the electric scalar potential. For each particle the components of the momentum pi𝐩_i and position ri𝐫_i are related by the equations of Hamiltonian mechanics: p˙i=−∂H/∂rir˙i=∂H/∂pi.𝐩̇_i =-∂ℋ/∂𝐫_i 𝐫̇_i =∂ℋ/∂𝐩_i. Therefore, r˙i∝pi−ecAi,𝐫̇_i∝𝐩_i-e/c𝐀_i, so the moment μμ is a linear function of the momenta pi𝐩_i.[6] The thermally averaged moment, ⟨μ⟩=∫μdP∫dP,⟨μ⟩=∫/, is the sum of terms proportional to integrals of the form ∫−∞∞(pi−ecAi)dP,∫_-∞^∞(𝐩_i-e/c𝐀_i)dP, where p represents one of the momentum coordinates. The integrand is an odd function of p, so it vanishes. Therefore, ⟨μ⟩=0⟨μ⟩=0.[6]
