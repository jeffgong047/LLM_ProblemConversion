proof: The Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem applies to an isolated system that cannot rotate. If the isolated system is allowed to rotate in response to an externally applied magnetic field, then this theorem does not apply.[8] If, in addition, there is only one state of thermal equilibrium in a given temperature and field, and the system is allowed time to return to equilibrium after a field is applied, then there will be no magnetization. The probability that the system will be in a given state of motion is predicted by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics to be proportional to exp⁡(−U/kBT)exp(-U/k_BT), where U is the energy of the system, kB_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy (mv2/2^2/2 for a particle with mass m and speed v) and the potential energy.[8] The magnetic field does not contribute to the potential energy. The Lorentz force on a particle with charge q and velocity v𝐯 is F=q(E+v×B),𝐅=q(𝐄+𝐯×𝐁), where E𝐄 is the electric field and B𝐁 is the magnetic flux density. The rate of work done is F⋅v=qE⋅v𝐅·𝐯=q𝐄·𝐯 and does not depend on B𝐁. Therefore, the energy does not depend on the magnetic field, so the distribution of motions does not depend on the magnetic field.[8] In zero field, there will be no net motion of charged particles because the system is not able to rotate. There will therefore be an average magnetic moment of zero. Since the distribution of motions does not depend on the magnetic field, the moment in thermal equilibrium remains zero in any magnetic field.[8] A more formal
