Proof: (BCT1) The following is a standard proof that a complete pseudometric space X is a Baire space.[6] Let U1,U2,…_1,U_2,… be a countable collection of open dense subsets. It remains to show that the intersection U1∩U2∩…_1_2∩… is dense. A subset is dense if and only if every nonempty open subset intersects it. Thus to show that the intersection is dense, it suffices to show that any nonempty open subset W of X has some point x in common with all of the Un_n. Because U1_1 is dense, W intersects U1;_1; consequently, there exists a point x1_1 and a number 0<r1<10<r_1<1 such that: B¯(x1,r1)⊆W∩U1B(x_1,r_1)_1 where B(x,r)(x,r) and B¯(x,r)B(x,r) denote an open and closed ball, respectively, centered at x with radius r.. Since each Un_n is dense, this construction can be continued recursively to find a pair of sequences xn_n and 0<rn<1n0<r_n<1n such that: B¯(xn,rn)⊆B(xn−1,rn−1)∩Un.B(x_n,r_n)(x_n-1,r_n-1)_n. (This step relies on the axiom of choice and the fact that a finite intersection of open sets is open and hence an open ball can be found inside it centered at xn_n.) The sequence (xn)(x_n) is Cauchy because xn∈B(xm,rm)_n(x_m,r_m) whenever n>m,>m, and hence (xn)(x_n) converges to some limit x by completeness. If n is a positive integer then x∈B¯(xn,rn)∈B(x_n,r_n) (because this set is closed). Thus x∈W and x∈Un_n for all n.. ◼▪ There is an alternative proof using Choquet's game.[11] (BCT2) The proof that a locally compact regular space X is a Baire space is similar.[7] It uses the facts that (1) in such a space every point has a local base of closed compact neighborhoods; and (2) in a compact space any collection of closed sets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection. The result for locally compact Hausdorff spaces is a special case, as such spaces are regular.
