Statement: A Baire space is a topological space X in which every countable intersection of open dense sets is dense in X.. See the corresponding article for a list of equivalent characterizations, as some are more useful than others depending on the application. (BCT1) Every complete pseudometric space is a Baire space.[4][5][6] In particular, every completely metrizable topological space is a Baire space. (BCT2) Every locally compact regular space is a Baire space.[4][7] In particular, every locally compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space.[8] Neither of these statements directly implies the other, since there are complete metric spaces that are not locally compact (the irrational numbers with the metric defined below; also, any Banach space of infinite dimension), and there are locally compact Hausdorff spaces that are not metrizable (for instance, any uncountable product of non-trivial compact Hausdorff spaces is such; also, several function spaces used in functional analysis; the uncountable Fort space).
