choice: The proof of BCT1 for arbitrary complete metric spaces requires some form of the axiom of choice; and in fact BCT1 is equivalent over ZF to the axiom of dependent choice, a weak form of the axiom of choice.[9] A restricted form of the Baire category theorem, in which the complete metric space is also assumed to be separable, is provable in ZF with no additional choice principles.[10] This restricted form applies in particular to the real line, the Baire space ωω,ω^ω, the Cantor space 2ω,2^ω, and a separable Hilbert space such as the Lp^p-space L2(Rn)^2(ℝ^n).
