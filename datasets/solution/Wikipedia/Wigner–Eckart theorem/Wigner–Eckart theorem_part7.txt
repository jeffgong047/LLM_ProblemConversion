conventions: There are different conventions for the reduced matrix elements. One convention, used by Racah[5] and Wigner,[6] includes an additional phase and normalization factor, ⟨jm|Tq(k)|j′m′⟩=(−1)2k⟨j′m′kq|jm⟩⟨j‖T(k)‖j′⟩R2j+1=(−1)j−m(jkj′−mqm′)⟨j‖T(k)‖j′⟩R. m|T_q^(k)|j' m'⟩=(-1)^2k' m' k q|j m⟩T^(k)j'⟩_R/√(2j+1)=(-1)^j-m[ j k j'; -m q m' ]T^(k)j'⟩_R. where the 2 × 3 array denotes the 3-j symbol. (Since in practice k is often an integer, the (−1)2 k factor is sometimes omitted in literature.) With this choice of normalization, the reduced matrix element satisfies the relation: ⟨j‖T†(k)‖j′⟩R=(−1)k+j′−j⟨j′‖T(k)‖j⟩R∗,T^†(k)j'⟩_R=(-1)^k+j'-j'T^(k)j⟩_R^*, where the Hermitian adjoint is defined with the k − q convention. Although this relation is not affected by the presence or absence of the (−1)2 k phase factor in the definition of the reduced matrix element, it is affected by the phase convention for the Hermitian adjoint. Another convention for reduced matrix elements is that of Sakurai's Modern Quantum Mechanics: ⟨jm|Tq(k)|j′m′⟩=⟨j′m′kq|jm⟩⟨j‖T(k)‖j′⟩2j′+1. m|T_q^(k)|j' m'⟩=' m' k q|j m⟩T^(k)j'⟩/√(2j'+1).
