Proof: Starting with the definition of a spherical tensor operator, we have [J±,Tq(k)]=ℏ(k∓q)(k±q+1)Tq±1(k),[J_±,T_q^(k)]=ħ√((k)(k+1))T_q±1^(k), which we use to then calculate ⟨jm|[J±,Tq(k)]|j′m′⟩=ℏ(k∓q)(k±q+1)⟨jm|Tq±1(k)|j′m′⟩. m|[J_±,T_q^(k)]|j' m'⟩=ħ√((k)(k+1)) m|T_q±1^(k)|j' m'⟩. If we expand the commutator on the LHS by calculating the action of the J± on the bra and ket, then we get ⟨jm|[J±,Tq(k)]|j′m′⟩=ℏ(j±m)(j∓m+1)⟨j(m∓1)|Tq(k)|j′m′⟩−ℏ(j′∓m′)(j′±m′+1)⟨jm|Tq(k)|j′(m′±1)⟩. m|[J_±,T_q^(k)]|j' m'⟩= ħ√((j)(j+1)) (m∓1)|T_q^(k)|j' m'⟩ -ħ√((j'')(j''+1)) m|T_q^(k)|j' (m'±1)⟩. We may combine these two results to get (j±m)(j∓m+1)⟨j(m∓1)|Tq(k)|j′m′⟩=(j′∓m′)(j′±m′+1)⟨jm|Tq(k)|j′(m′±1)⟩+(k∓q)(k±q+1)⟨jm|Tq±1(k)|j′m′⟩.√((j)(j+1)) (m∓1)|T_q^(k)|j' m'⟩= √((j'')(j''+1)) m|T_q^(k)|j' (m'±1)⟩ +√((k)(k+1)) m|T_q±1^(k)|j' m'⟩. This recursion relation for the matrix elements closely resembles that of the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient. In fact, both are of the form Σc ab, c xc = 0. We therefore have two sets of linear homogeneous equations: ∑cab,cxc=0,∑cab,cyc=0.∑_ca_b,cx_c =0, ∑_ca_b,cy_c =0. one for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients (xc) and one for the matrix elements (yc). It is not possible to exactly solve for xc. We can only say that the ratios are equal, that is xcxd=ycydx_c/x_d=y_c/y_d or that xc ∝ yc, where the coefficient of proportionality is independent of the indices. Hence, by comparing recursion relations, we can identify the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient ⟨j1 m1 j2 (m2 ± 1)|j m⟩ with the matrix element ⟨j′ m′|T(k)q ± 1|j m⟩, then we may write ⟨j′m′|Tq±1(k)|jm⟩∝⟨jmk(q±1)|j′m′⟩.' m'|T_q±1^(k)|j m⟩∝ m k (q±1)|j' m'⟩.
