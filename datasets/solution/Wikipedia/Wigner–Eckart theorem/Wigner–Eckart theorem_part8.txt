Example: Consider the position expectation value ⟨n j m|x|n j m⟩. This matrix element is the expectation value of a Cartesian operator in a spherically symmetric hydrogen-atom-eigenstate basis, which is a nontrivial problem. However, the Wigner–Eckart theorem simplifies the problem. (In fact, we could obtain the solution quickly using parity, although a slightly longer route will be taken.) We know that x is one component of r, which is a vector. Since vectors are rank-1 spherical tensor operators, it follows that x must be some linear combination of a rank-1 spherical tensor T(1)q with q ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. In fact, it can be shown that x=T−1(1)−T1(1)2,=T_-1^(1)-T_1^(1)/√(2), where we define the spherical tensors as[7] Tq(1)=4π3rY1q_q^(1)=√(4π/3)rY_1^q and Ylm are spherical harmonics, which themselves are also spherical tensors of rank l. Additionally, T(1)0 = z, and T±1(1)=∓x±iy2._±1^(1)=∓x/√(2). Therefore, ⟨njm|x|n′j′m′⟩=⟨njm|T−1(1)−T1(1)2|n′j′m′⟩=12⟨nj‖T(1)‖n′j′⟩(⟨j′m′1(−1)|jm⟩−⟨j′m′11|jm⟩). j m|x|n' j' m'⟩ = j m|T_-1^(1)-T_1^(1)/√(2)|n' j' m'⟩ =1/√(2) jT^(1)n' j'⟩ (' m' 1 (-1)|j m⟩-' m' 1 1|j m⟩). The above expression gives us the matrix element for x in the |n j m⟩ basis. To find the expectation value, we set n′ = n, j′ = j, and m′ = m. The selection rule for m′ and m is m ± 1 = m′ for the T(1)±1 spherical tensors. As we have m′ = m, this makes the Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients zero, leading to the expectation value to be equal to zero. See
