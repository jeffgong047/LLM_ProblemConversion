Extensions: The no-hair theorem was originally formulated for black holes within the context of a four-dimensional spacetime, obeying the Einstein field equation of general relativity with zero cosmological constant, in the presence of electromagnetic fields, or optionally other fields such as scalar fields and massive vector fields (Proca fields, etc.).[citation needed] It has since been extended to include the case where the cosmological constant is positive (which recent observations are tending to support).[7] Magnetic charge, if detected as predicted by some theories, would form the fourth parameter possessed by a classical black hole.
