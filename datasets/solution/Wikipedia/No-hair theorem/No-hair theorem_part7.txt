hair: A study by Sasha Haco, Stephen Hawking, Malcolm Perry and Andrew Strominger postulates that black holes might contain "soft hair", giving the black hole more degrees of freedom than previously thought.[14] This hair permeates at a very low-energy state, which is why it didn't come up in previous calculations that postulated the no-hair theorem.[15] This was the subject of Hawking's final paper which was published posthumously.[16][17] See
