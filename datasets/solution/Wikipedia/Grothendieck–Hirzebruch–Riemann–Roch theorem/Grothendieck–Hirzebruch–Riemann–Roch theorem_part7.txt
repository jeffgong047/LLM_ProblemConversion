curves: For the moduli stack of genus g curves (and no marked points) M¯gℳ_g there is a universal curve π:C¯g→M¯gπ𝒞_g→ℳ_g where C¯g=M¯g,1𝒞_g=ℳ_g,1 (is the moduli stack of curves of genus g and one marked point. Then, he defines the tautological classes KC¯g/M¯g=c1(ωC¯g/M¯g)κl=π∗(KC¯g/M¯gl+1)E=π∗(ωC¯g/M¯g)λl=cl(E)K_𝒞_g/ℳ_g =c_1(ω_𝒞_g/ℳ_g) κ_l =π_*(K_𝒞_g/ℳ_g^l+1) 𝔼 =π_*(ω_𝒞_g/ℳ_g) λ_l =c_l(𝔼) where 1≤l≤g1 and ωC¯g/M¯gω_𝒞_g/ℳ_g is the relative dualizing sheaf. Note the fiber of ωC¯g/M¯gω_𝒞_g/ℳ_gover a point [C]∈M¯g[C]∈ℳ_g this is the dualizing sheaf ωCω_C. He was able to find relations between the λiλ_i and κiκ_i describing the λiλ_i in terms of a sum of κiκ_i[7] (corollary 6.2) on the chow ring A∗(Mg)^*(ℳ_g) of the smooth locus using Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch. Because M¯gℳ_g is a smooth Deligne–Mumford stack, he considered a covering by a scheme M g→M¯gℳ̃_g→ℳ_g which presents M¯g=[M g/G]ℳ_g=[ℳ̃_g/G] for some finite group G. He uses Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch on ωC g/M gω_𝒞̃_g/ℳ̃_g to get ch(π!(ωC /M ))=π∗(ch(ωC /M )Td∨(ΩC /M 1))ch(π_!(ω_𝒞̃/ℳ̃))=π_*(ch(ω_𝒞̃/ℳ̃)Td^∨(Ω_𝒞̃/ℳ̃^1)) Because R1π!(ωC g/M g)≅OM ,𝐑^1π_!(ω_𝒞̃_g/ℳ̃_g)≅𝒪_M̃, this gives the formula ch(E)=1+π∗(ch(ωC /M )Td∨(ΩC /M 1)).ch(𝔼)=1+π_*(ch(ω_𝒞̃/ℳ̃)Td^∨(Ω_𝒞̃/ℳ̃^1)). The computation of ch(E)ch(𝔼) can then be reduced even further. In even dimensions 2k2k, ch(E)2k=0.ch(𝔼)_2k=0. Also, on dimension 1, λ1=c1(E)=112(κ1+δ),λ_1=c_1(𝔼)=1/12(κ_1+δ), where δδ is a class on the boundary. In the case g=2=2 and on the smooth locus Mgℳ_g there are the relations λ1=112κ1λ2=λ122=κ12288λ_1 =1/12κ_1 λ_2 =λ_1^2/2=κ_1^2/288 which can be deduced by analyzing the Chern character of E𝔼. Closed
