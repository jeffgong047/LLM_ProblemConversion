embedding: Closed embeddings f:Y→X have a description using the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula as well, showing another non-trivial case where the formula holds.[8] For a smooth variety X of dimension n and a subvariety Y of codimension k, there is the formula ck(OY)=(−1)k−1(k−1)![Y]_k(𝒪_Y)=(-1)^k-1(k-1)![Y] Using the short exact sequence 0→IY→OX→OY→00→ℐ_Y→𝒪_X→𝒪_Y→0, there is the formula ck(IY)=(−1)k(k−1)![Y]_k(ℐ_Y)=(-1)^k(k-1)![Y] for the ideal sheaf since 1=c(OX)=c(OY)c(IY)1=c(𝒪_X)=c(𝒪_Y)c(ℐ_Y).
