spaces: Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch can be used in proving that a coarse moduli space M, such as the moduli space of pointed algebraic curves Mg,n_g,n, admits an embedding into a projective space, hence is a quasi-projective variety. This can be accomplished by looking at canonically associated sheaves on M and studying the degree of associated line bundles. For instance, Mg,n_g,n[9] has the family of curves π:Cg,n→Mg,nπ_g,n_g,n with sections si:Mg,n→Cg,n_i_g,n_g,n corresponding to the marked points. Since each fiber has the canonical bundle ωCω_C, there are the associated line bundles Λg,n(π)=det(Rπ∗(ωCg,n/Mg,n))Λ_g,n(π)=(𝐑π_*(ω_C_g,n/M_g,n)) and χg,n(i)=si∗(ωCg,n/Mg,n).χ_g,n^(i)=s_i^*(ω_C_g,n/M_g,n). It turns out that Λg,n(π)⊗(⨂i=1nχg,n(i))Λ_g,n(π)⊗(⊗_i=1^nχ_g,n^(i)) is an ample line bundle[9]pg 209, hence the coarse moduli space Mg,n_g,n is quasi-projective.
