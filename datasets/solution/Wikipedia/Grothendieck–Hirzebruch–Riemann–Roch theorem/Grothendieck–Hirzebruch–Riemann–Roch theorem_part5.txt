curve: A vector bundle E→C of rank n and degree d (defined as the degree of its determinant; or equivalently the degree of its first Chern class) on a smooth projective curve over a field k has a formula similar to Riemann–Roch for line bundles. If we take X=C=C and Y=∗={*} a point, then the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula can be read as ch(f!F∙)=h0(C,E)−h1(C,E)f∗(ch(E)td(X))=f∗((n+c1(E))(1+(1/2)c1(TC)))=f∗(n+c1(E)+(n/2)c1(TC))=f∗(c1(E)+(n/2)c1(TC))=d+n(1−g);ch(f_!ℱ^∙) =h^0(C,E)-h^1(C,E) f_*(ch(E)td(X)) =f_*((n+c_1(E))(1+(1/2)c_1(T_C))) =f_*(n+c_1(E)+(n/2)c_1(T_C)) =f_*(c_1(E)+(n/2)c_1(T_C)) =d+n(1-g); hence, χ(C,E)=d+n(1−g).χ(C,E)=d+n(1-g).[6] This formula also holds for coherent sheaves of rank n and degree d.
