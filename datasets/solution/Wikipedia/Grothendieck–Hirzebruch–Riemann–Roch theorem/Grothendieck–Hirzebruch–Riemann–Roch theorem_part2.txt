Formulation: Let X be a smooth quasi-projective scheme over a field. Under these assumptions, the Grothendieck group K0(X)_0(X) of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves is canonically isomorphic to the Grothendieck group of bounded complexes of finite-rank vector bundles. Using this isomorphism, consider the Chern character (a rational combination of Chern classes) as a functorial transformation: ch:K0(X)→A(X,Q),ch_0(X)(X,ℚ), where Ad(X,Q)_d(X,ℚ) is the Chow group of cycles on X of dimension d modulo rational equivalence, tensored with the rational numbers. In case X is defined over the complex numbers, the latter group maps to the topological cohomology group: H2dim⁡(X)−2d(X,Q).^2(X)-2d(X,ℚ). Now consider a proper morphism f:X→Y between smooth quasi-projective schemes and a bounded complex of sheaves F∙ℱ^∙ on X.. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem relates the pushforward map f!=∑(−1)iRif∗:K0(X)→K0(Y)_!=∑(-1)^iR^if_*_0(X)_0(Y) (alternating sum of higher direct images) and the pushforward f∗:A(X)→A(Y),_*(X)(Y), by the formula ch(f!F∙)td(Y)=f∗(ch(F∙)td(X)).ch(f_!ℱ^∙)td(Y)=f_*(ch(ℱ^∙)td(X)). Here td(X)td(X) is the Todd genus of (the tangent bundle of) X. Thus the theorem gives a precise measure for the lack of commutativity of taking the push forwards in the above senses and the Chern character and shows that the needed correction factors depend on X and Y only. In fact, since the Todd genus is functorial and multiplicative in exact sequences, we can rewrite the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula as ch(f!F∙)=f∗(ch(F∙)td(Tf)),ch(f_!ℱ^∙)=f_*(ch(ℱ^∙)td(T_f)), where Tf_f is the relative tangent sheaf of f, defined as the element TX−f∗(TY)-f^*(TY) in K0(X)_0(X). For example, when f is a smooth morphism, Tf_f is simply a vector bundle, known as the tangent bundle along the fibers of f. Using A1-homotopy theory, the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem has been extended by Navarro & Navarro (2017) to the situation where f is a proper map between two smooth schemes. Generalising and
