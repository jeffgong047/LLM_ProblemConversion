In the mathematical field of complex analysis, the Looman–Menchoff theorem states that a continuous complex-valued function defined in an open set of the complex plane is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations. It is thus a generalization of a theorem by Édouard Goursat, which instead of assuming the continuity of f, assumes its Fréchet differentiability when regarded as a function from a subset of R2 to R2. A complete statement of the theorem is as follows: Let Ω be an open set in C and f : Ω → C be a continuous function. Suppose that the partial derivatives ∂f/∂x/ and ∂f/∂y/ exist everywhere but a countable set in Ω. Then f is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation: ∂f∂z¯=12(∂f∂x+i∂f∂y)=0./∂z̅=1/2(/+i/)=0.
