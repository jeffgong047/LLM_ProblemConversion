Examples: Looman pointed out that the function given by f(z) = exp(−z−4) for z ≠ 0, f(0) = 0 satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations everywhere but is not analytic (or even continuous) at z = 0. This shows that the function f must be assumed continuous in the theorem. The function given by f(z) = z5/|z|4 for z ≠ 0, f(0) = 0 is continuous everywhere and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations at z = 0, but is not analytic at z = 0 (or anywhere else). This shows that a naive generalization of the Looman–Menchoff theorem to a single point is false: Let f be continuous at a neighborhood of a point z, and such that ∂f/∂x/ and ∂f/∂y/ exist at z. Then f is holomorphic at z if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation at z.
