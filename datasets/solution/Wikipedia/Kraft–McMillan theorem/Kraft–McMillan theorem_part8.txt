converse: Given a sequence of n natural numbers, ℓ1⩽ℓ2⩽⋯⩽ℓnℓ_1⩽ℓ_2⩽⋯⩽ℓ_n satisfying the Kraft inequality, we can construct a prefix code as follows. Define the ith codeword, Ci, to be the first ℓiℓ_i digits after the radix point (e.g. decimal point) in the base r representation of ∑j=1i−1r−ℓj.∑_j=1^i-1r^-ℓ_j. Note that by Kraft's inequality, this sum is never more than 1. Hence the codewords capture the entire value of the sum. Therefore, for j > i, the first ℓiℓ_i digits of Cj form a larger number than Ci, so the code is prefix free.
