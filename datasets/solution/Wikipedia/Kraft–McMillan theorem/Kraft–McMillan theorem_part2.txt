intuitions: Kraft's inequality limits the lengths of codewords in a prefix code: if one takes an exponential of the length of each valid codeword, the resulting set of values must look like a probability mass function, that is, it must have total measure less than or equal to one. Kraft's inequality can be thought of in terms of a constrained budget to be spent on codewords, with shorter codewords being more expensive. Among the useful properties following from the inequality are the following statements: If Kraft's inequality holds with strict inequality, the code has some redundancy. If Kraft's inequality holds with equality, the code in question is a complete code.[2] If Kraft's inequality does not hold, the code is not uniquely decodable. For every uniquely decodable code, there exists a prefix code with the same length distribution. Formal
