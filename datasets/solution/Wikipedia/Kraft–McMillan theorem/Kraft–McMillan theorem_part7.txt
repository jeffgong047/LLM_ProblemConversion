case: Now we will prove that the Kraft inequality holds whenever S is a uniquely decodable code. (The converse needs not be proven, since we have already proven it for prefix codes, which is a stronger claim.) Denote C=∑i=1nr−li=∑_i=1^nr^-l_i. The idea of the proof is to get an upper bound on Cm^m for m∈N∈ℕ and show that it can only hold for all m if C≤1≤1. Rewrite Cm^m as Cm=(∑i=1nr−li)m=∑i1=1n∑i2=1n⋯∑im=1nr−(li1+li2+⋯+lim)C^m =(∑_i=1^nr^-l_i)^m =∑_i_1=1^n∑_i_2=1^n⋯∑_i_m=1^nr^-(l_i_1+l_i_2+⋯+l_i_m) Consider all m-powers Sm^m, in the form of words si1si2…sim_i_1s_i_2_i_m, where i1,i2,…,im_1,i_2,…,i_m are indices between 1 and n. Note that, since S was assumed to uniquely decodable, si1si2…sim=sj1sj2…sjm_i_1s_i_2_i_m=s_j_1s_j_2_j_m implies i1=j1,i2=j2,…,im=jm_1=j_1,i_2=j_2,…,i_m=j_m. This means that each summand corresponds to exactly one word in Sm^m. This allows us to rewrite the equation to Cm=∑ℓ=1m⋅ℓmaxqℓr−ℓ^m=∑_ℓ=1^m·ℓ_maxq_ℓ r^-ℓ where qℓ_ℓ is the number of codewords in Sm^m of length ℓℓ and ℓmaxℓ_max is the length of the longest codeword in S. For an r-letter alphabet there are only rℓ^ℓ possible words of length ℓℓ, so qℓ≤rℓ_ℓ^ℓ. Using this, we upper bound Cm^m: Cm=∑ℓ=1m⋅ℓmaxqℓr−ℓ≤∑ℓ=1m⋅ℓmaxrℓr−ℓ=m⋅ℓmaxC^m =∑_ℓ=1^m·ℓ_maxq_ℓ r^-ℓ ≤∑_ℓ=1^m·ℓ_maxr^ℓ r^-ℓ=m·ℓ_max Taking the m-th root, we get C=∑i=1nr−li≤(m⋅ℓmax)1m=∑_i=1^nr^-l_i≤(m·ℓ_max)^1/m This bound holds for any m∈N∈ℕ. The right side is 1 asymptotically, so ∑i=1nr−li≤1∑_i=1^nr^-l_i≤1 must hold (otherwise the inequality would be broken for a large enough m). Alternative construction for the
