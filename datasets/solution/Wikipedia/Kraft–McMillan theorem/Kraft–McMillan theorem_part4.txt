trees: 9, 14, 19, 67 and 76 are leaf nodes at depths of 3, 3, 3, 3 and 2, respectively. Any binary tree can be viewed as defining a prefix code for the leaves of the tree. Kraft's inequality states that ∑ℓ∈leaves2−depth(ℓ)⩽1.∑_ℓ∈leaves2^-depth(ℓ)⩽1. Here the sum is taken over the leaves of the tree, i.e. the nodes without any children. The depth is the distance to the root node. In the tree to the right, this sum is 14+4(18)=34⩽1.1/4+4(1/8)=3/4⩽1.
