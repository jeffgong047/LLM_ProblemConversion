presentation: A modern, streamlined presentation of Schaefer's theorem is given in an expository paper by Hubie Chen.[3][4] In modern terms, the problem SAT(S) is viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem over the Boolean domain. In this area, it is standard to denote the set of relations by Γ and the decision problem defined by Γ as CSP(Γ). This modern understanding uses algebra, in particular, universal algebra. For Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, the most important concept in universal algebra is that of a polymorphism. An operation f:Dm→D:D^m is a polymorphism of a relation R⊆Dk^k if, for any choice of m tuples (t11,…,t1k),…,(tm1,…,tmk)(t_11,…,t_1k),…,(t_m1,…,t_mk) from R, it holds that the tuple obtained from these m tuples by applying f coordinate-wise, i.e. (f(t11,…,tm1),…,f(t1k,…,tmk))(f(t_11,…,t_m1),…,f(t_1k,…,t_mk)), is in R. That is, an operation f is a polymorphism of R if R is closed under f: applying f to any tuples in R yields another tuple inside R. A set of relations Γ is said to have a polymorphism f if every relation in Γ has f as a polymorphism. This definition allows for the algebraic formulation of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem. Let Γ be a finite constraint language over the Boolean domain. The problem CSP(Γ) is decidable in polynomial-time if Γ has one of the following six operations as a polymorphism: the constant unary operation 1; the constant unary operation 0; the binary AND operation ∧; the binary OR operation ∨; the ternary majority operation Majority⁡(x,y,z)=(x∧y)∨(x∧z)∨(y∧z);Majority(x,y,z)=(x)∨(x)∨(y); the ternary minority operation Minority⁡(x,y,z)=x⊕y⊕z.Minority(x,y,z)=x. Otherwise, the problem CSP(Γ) is NP-complete. In this formulation, it is easy to check if any of the tractability conditions hold. Properties of
