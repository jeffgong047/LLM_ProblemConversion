Generalizations: The analysis was later fine-tuned: CSP(Γ) is either solvable in co-NLOGTIME, L-complete, NL-complete, ⊕L-complete, P-complete or NP-complete, and given Γ, one can decide in polynomial time which of these cases holds.[8] Schaefer's dichotomy theorem was recently generalized to a larger class of relations.[9] Related
