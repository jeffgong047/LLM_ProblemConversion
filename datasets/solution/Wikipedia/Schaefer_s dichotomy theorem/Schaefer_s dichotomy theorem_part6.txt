work: If the problem is to count the number of solutions, which is denoted by #CSP(Γ), then a similar result by Creignou and Hermann holds.[10] Let Γ be a finite constraint language over the Boolean domain. The problem #CSP(Γ) is computable in polynomial time if Γ has a Mal'tsev operation as a polymorphism. Otherwise, the problem #CSP(Γ) is #P-complete. A Mal'tsev operation m is a ternary operation that satisfies m(x,y,y)=m(y,y,x)=x.(x,y,y)=m(y,y,x)=x. An example of a Mal'tsev operation is the Minority operation given in the modern, algebraic formulation of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem above. Thus, when Γ has the Minority operation as a polymorphism, it is not only possible to decide CSP(Γ) in polynomial time, but to compute #CSP(Γ) in polynomial time. There are a total of 4 Mal'tsev operations on Boolean variables, determined by the values of m(T,F,T)(T,F,T) and m(F,T,F)(F,T,F). An example of a less symmetric one is given by m(x,y,z)=(x∧z)∨(¬y∧(x∨z))(x,y,z)=(x)∨(∧(x)). On other domains, such as groups, examples of Mal'tsev operations include x−y+z-y+z and xy−1z.^-1z. For larger domains, even for a domain of size three, the existence of a Mal'tsev polymorphism for Γ is no longer a sufficient condition for the tractability of #CSP(Γ). However, the absence of a Mal'tsev polymorphism for Γ still implies the #P-hardness of #CSP(Γ). See
