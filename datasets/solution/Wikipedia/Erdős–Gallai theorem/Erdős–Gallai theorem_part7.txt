Generalization: A finite sequences of nonnegative integers (d1,⋯,dn)(d_1,⋯,d_n) with d1≥⋯≥dn_1≥⋯_n is graphic if ∑i=1ndi∑_i=1^nd_i is even and there exists a sequence (c1,⋯,cn)(c_1,⋯,c_n) that is graphic and majorizes (d1,⋯,dn)(d_1,⋯,d_n). This result was given by Aigner & Triesch (1994). Mahadev & Peled (1995) reinvented it and gave a more direct proof. See
