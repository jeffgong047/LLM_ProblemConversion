version: Tripathi & Vijay (2003) proved that it suffices to consider the kth inequality such that 1≤k<n1<n with dk>dk+1_k>d_k+1 and for k=n=n. Barrus et al. (2012) restrict the set of inequalities for graphs in an opposite thrust. If an even-summed positive sequence d has no repeated entries other than the maximum and the minimum (and the length exceeds the largest entry), then it suffices to check only the lth inequality, where l=maxk∣dk≥k=max{k_k}.
