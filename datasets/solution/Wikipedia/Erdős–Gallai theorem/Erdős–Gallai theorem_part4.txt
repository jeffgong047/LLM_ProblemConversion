partitions: Aigner & Triesch (1994) describe close connections between the Erdős–Gallai theorem and the theory of integer partitions. Let m=∑di=_i; then the sorted integer sequences summing to m may be interpreted as the partitions of m. Under majorization of their prefix sums, the partitions form a lattice, in which the minimal change between an individual partition and another partition lower in the partition order is to subtract one from one of the numbers di_i and add it to a number dj_j that is smaller by at least two (dj_j could be zero). As Aigner and Triesch show, this operation preserves the property of being graphic, so to prove the Erdős–Gallai theorem it suffices to characterize the graphic sequences that are maximal in this majorization order. They provide such a characterization, in terms of the Ferrers diagrams of the corresponding partitions, and show that it is equivalent to the Erdős–Gallai theorem. Graphic sequences for other types of
