Kneser: While Peano's existence theorem guarantees the existence of solutions of certain initial values problems with continuous right hand side, H. Kneser's theorem deals with the topology of the set of those solutions. Precisely, H. Kneser's theorem states the following:[3][4] Let f(t,x):R×Rn→Rn(t,x):R^n^n be a continuous function on the region R=[t0,t0+a]×x∈Rn:|x−x0|≤bℛ=[t_0,t_0+a]×{x∈ℝ^n:|x-x_0|}, and such that |f(t,x)|≤M|f(t,x)| for all (t,x)∈R(t,x)∈ℛ. Given a real number c satisfying t0<c≤t0+min(a,b/M)_0<c_0+min(a,b/M), define the set Sc_c as the set of points xc_c for which there is a solution x=x(t)=x(t) of x˙=f(t,x)ẋ=f(t,x) such that x(t0)=x0(t_0)=x_0 and x(c)=xc(c)=x_c. The set Sc_c is a closed and connected set.
