Example: To illustrate the theorem consider q(x)=(14−a)x−2forx>0(x)=(1/4-a)x^-2 for>0 where a is real and non-zero. According to the theorem, solutions will be oscillating or not depending on whether a is positive (non-oscillating) or negative (oscillating) because limsupx→+∞x2q(x)=liminfx→+∞x2q(x)=14−alim sup_x→+∞x^2q(x)=lim inf_x→+∞x^2q(x)=1/4-a To find the solutions for this choice of q(x)(x), and verify the theorem for this example, substitute the 'Ansatz' y(x)=xn(x)=x^n which gives n(n−1)+14−a=(n−12)2−a=0(n-1)+1/4-a=(n-1/2)^2-a=0 This means that (for non-zero a) the general solution is y(x)=Ax12+a+Bx12−a(x)=Ax^1/2+√(a)+Bx^1/2-√(a) where A and B are arbitrary constants. It is not hard to see that for positive a the solutions do not oscillate while for negative a=−ω2=-ω^2 the identity x12±iω=xe±(iω)ln⁡x=x(cos⁡(ωln⁡x)±isin⁡(ωln⁡x))^1/2ω=√(x)^±(iω)lnx=√(x)cos(ω)sin(ω)) shows that they do. The general result follows from this example by the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem.
