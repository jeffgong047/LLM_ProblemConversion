Kneser: Consider an ordinary linear homogeneous differential equation of the form y″+q(x)y=0”+q(x)y=0 with q:[0,+∞)→R:[0,+∞)→ℝ continuous. We say this equation is oscillating if it has a solution y with infinitely many zeros, and non-oscillating otherwise. The theorem states[1] that the equation is non-oscillating if limsupx→+∞x2q(x)<14lim sup_x→+∞x^2q(x)<14 and oscillating if liminfx→+∞x2q(x)>14.lim inf_x→+∞x^2q(x)>14.
