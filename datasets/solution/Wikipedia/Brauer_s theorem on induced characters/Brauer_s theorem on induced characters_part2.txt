Background: A precursor to Brauer's induction theorem was Artin's induction theorem, which states that |G| times the trivial character of G is an integer combination of characters which are each induced from trivial characters of cyclic subgroups of G. Brauer's theorem removes the factor |G|, but at the expense of expanding the collection of subgroups used. Some years after the proof of Brauer's theorem appeared, J.A. Green showed (in 1955) that no such induction theorem (with integer combinations of characters induced from linear characters) could be proved with a collection of subgroups smaller than the Brauer elementary subgroups. Another result between Artin's induction theorem and Brauer's induction theorem, also due to Brauer and also known as Brauer's theorem or Brauer's lemma is the fact that the regular representation of G can be written as 1+∑λiρi1+∑λ_iρ_i where the λiλ_i are positive rationals and the ρiρ_i are induced from characters of cyclic subgroups of G. Note that in Artin's theorem the characters are induced from the trivial character of the cyclic group, while here they are induced from arbitrary characters (in applications to Artin's L functions it is important that the groups are cyclic and hence all characters are linear giving that the corresponding L functions are analytic).[1]
