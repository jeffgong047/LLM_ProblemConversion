theorem: Schwartz's Paley–Wiener theorem asserts that the Fourier transform of a distribution of compact support on Rnℝ^n is an entire function on Cnℂ^n and gives estimates on its growth at infinity. It was proven by Laurent Schwartz (1952). The formulation presented here is from Hörmander (1976) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFHörmander1976 (help). Generally, the Fourier transform can be defined for any tempered distribution; moreover, any distribution of compact support v is a tempered distribution. If v is a distribution of compact support and f is an infinitely differentiable function, the expression v(f)=v(x↦f(x))(f)=v(x(x)) is well defined. It can be shown that the Fourier transform of v is a function (as opposed to a general tempered distribution) given at the value s by v^(s)=(2π)−n2v(x↦e−i⟨x,s⟩)v̂(s)=(2π)^-n/2v(x^-i,s⟩) and that this function can be extended to values of s in the complex space Cnℂ^n. This extension of the Fourier transform to the complex domain is called the Fourier–Laplace transform. Schwartz's theorem — An entire function F on Cnℂ^n is the Fourier–Laplace transform of a distribution v of compact support if and only if for all z∈Cn∈ℂ^n, |F(z)|≤C(1+|z|)NeB|Im(z)||F(z)|(1+|z|)^Ne^B|Im(z)| for some constants C, N, B. The distribution v in fact will be supported in the closed ball of center 00 and radius B. Additional growth conditions on the entire function F impose regularity properties on the distribution v. For instance:[3] Theorem — If for every positive N there is a constant CN_N such that for all z∈Cn∈ℂ^n, |F(z)|≤CN(1+|z|)−NeB|Im(z)||F(z)|_N(1+|z|)^-Ne^B|Im(z)| then v is an infinitely differentiable function, and vice versa. Sharper results giving good control over the singular support of v have been formulated by Hörmander (1990). In particular,[4] let K be a convex compact set in Rnℝ^n with supporting function H, defined by H(x)=supy∈K⟨x,y⟩.(x)=sup_y,y⟩. Then the singular support of v is contained in K if and only if there is a constant N and sequence of constants Cm_m such that |v^(ζ)|≤Cm(1+|ζ|)NeH(Im(ζ))|v̂(ζ)|_m(1+|ζ|)^Ne^H(Im(ζ)) for |Im(ζ)|≤mlog⁡(|ζ|+1).|Im(ζ)|log(|ζ|+1).
