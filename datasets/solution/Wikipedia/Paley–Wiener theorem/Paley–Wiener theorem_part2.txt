transforms: The classical Paley–Wiener theorems make use of the holomorphic Fourier transform on classes of square-integrable functions supported on the real line. Formally, the idea is to take the integral defining the (inverse) Fourier transform f(ζ)=∫−∞∞F(x)eixζdx(ζ)=∫_-∞^∞F(x)e^ixζ dx and allow ζζ to be a complex number in the upper half-plane. One may then expect to differentiate under the integral in order to verify that the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold, and thus that f defines an analytic function. However, this integral may not be well-defined, even for F in L2(R)^2(ℝ); indeed, since ζζ is in the upper half plane, the modulus of eixζ^ixζ grows exponentially as x→−∞→-∞; so differentiation under the integral sign is out of the question. One must impose further restrictions on F in order to ensure that this integral is well-defined. The first such restriction is that F be supported on R+ℝ_+: that is, F∈L2(R+)^2(ℝ_+). The Paley–Wiener theorem now asserts the following:[1] The holomorphic Fourier transform of F, defined by f(ζ)=∫0∞F(x)eixζdx(ζ)=∫_0^∞F(x)e^ixζ dx for ζζ in the upper half-plane is a holomorphic function. Moreover, by Plancherel's theorem, one has ∫−∞∞|f(ξ+iη)|2dξ≤∫0∞|F(x)|2dx∫_-∞^∞|f(ξ+iη)|^2 dξ≤∫_0^∞|F(x)|^2 dx and by dominated convergence, limη→0+∫−∞∞|f(ξ+iη)−f(ξ)|2dξ=0.lim_η→0^+∫_-∞^∞|f(ξ+iη)-f(ξ)|^2 dξ=0. Conversely, if f is a holomorphic function in the upper half-plane satisfying supη>0∫−∞∞|f(ξ+iη)|2dξ=C<∞sup_η>0∫_-∞^∞|f(ξ+iη)|^2 dξ=C<∞ then there exists F∈L2(R+)^2(ℝ_+) such that f is the holomorphic Fourier transform of F. In abstract terms, this version of the theorem explicitly describes the Hardy space H2(R)^2(ℝ). The theorem states that FH2(R)=L2(R+).ℱH^2(ℝ)=L^2(ℝ_+). This is a very useful result as it enables one to pass to the Fourier transform of a function in the Hardy space and perform calculations in the easily understood space L2(R+)^2(ℝ_+) of square-integrable functions supported on the positive axis. By imposing the alternative restriction that F be compactly supported, one obtains another Paley–Wiener theorem.[2] Suppose that F is supported in [−A,A][-A,A], so that F∈L2(−A,A)^2(-A,A). Then the holomorphic Fourier transform f(ζ)=∫−AAF(x)eixζdx(ζ)=∫_-A^AF(x)e^ixζ dx is an entire function of exponential type A, meaning that there is a constant C such that |f(ζ)|≤CeA|ζ|,|f(ζ)|^A|ζ|, and moreover, f is square-integrable over horizontal lines: ∫−∞∞|f(ξ+iη)|2dξ<∞.∫_-∞^∞|f(ξ+iη)|^2 dξ<∞. Conversely, any entire function of exponential type A which is square-integrable over horizontal lines is the holomorphic Fourier transform of an L2^2 function supported in [−A,A][-A,A].
