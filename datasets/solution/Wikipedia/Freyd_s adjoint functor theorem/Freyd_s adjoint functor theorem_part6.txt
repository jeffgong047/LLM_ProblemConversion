definitions: There are various equivalent definitions for adjoint functors: The definitions via universal morphisms are easy to state, and require minimal verifications when constructing an adjoint functor or proving two functors are adjoint. They are also the most analogous to our intuition involving optimizations. The definition via hom-sets makes symmetry the most apparent, and is the reason for using the word adjoint. The definition via counitâ€“unit adjunction is convenient for proofs about functors which are known to be adjoint, because they provide formulas that can be directly manipulated. The equivalency of these definitions is quite useful. Adjoint functors arise everywhere, in all areas of mathematics. Since the structure in any of these definitions gives rise to the structures in the others, switching between them makes implicit use of many details that would otherwise have to be repeated separately in every subject area.
