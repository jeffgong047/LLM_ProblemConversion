Probability: The twin fact in probability can be understood as an adjunction: that expectation commutes with affine transform, and that the expectation is in some sense the best solution to the problem of finding a real-valued approximation to a distribution on the real numbers. Define a category based on Rℝ, with objects being the real numbers, and the morphisms being "affine functions evaluated at a point". That is, for any affine function f(x)=ax+b(x)=ax+b and any real number r, define a morphism (r,f):r→f(r)(r,f):r(r). Define a category based on M(R)(ℝ), the set of probability distribution on Rℝ with finite expectation. Define morphisms on M(R)(ℝ) as "affine functions evaluated at a distribution". That is, for any affine function f(x)=ax+b(x)=ax+b and any μ∈M(R)μ(ℝ), define a morphism (μ,f):r→μ∘f−1(μ,f):r→μ^-1. Then, the Dirac delta measure defines a functor: δ:x↦δxδ:x↦δ_x, and the expectation defines another functor E:μ↦E[μ]𝔼:μ↦𝔼[μ], and they are adjoint: E⊣δ𝔼⊣δ. (Somewhat disconcertingly, E𝔼 is the left adjoint, even though E𝔼 is "forgetful" and δδ is "free".) Adjunctions in
