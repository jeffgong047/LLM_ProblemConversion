morphisms: By definition, a functor F:D→C:D is a left adjoint functor if for each object X in C there exists a universal morphism from F to X. Spelled out, this means that for each object X in C there exists an object G(X)(X) in D and a morphism ϵX:F(G(X))→Xϵ_X:F(G(X)) such that for every object Y in D and every morphism f:F(Y)→X:F(Y) there exists a unique morphism g:Y→G(X):Y(X) with ϵX∘F(g)=fϵ_X(g)=f. The latter equation is expressed by the following commutative diagram: Here the counit is a universal morphism. In this situation, one can show that G can be turned into a functor G:C→D:C in a unique way such that ϵX∘F(G(f))=f∘ϵX′ϵ_X(G(f))=f∘ϵ_X' for all morphisms f:X′→X:X' in C; F is then called a left adjoint to G. Similarly, we may define right-adjoint functors. A functor G:C→D:C is a right adjoint functor if for each object Y in D, there exists a universal morphism from Y to G. Spelled out, this means that for each object Y in D, there exists an object F(Y)(Y) in C and a morphism ηY:Y→G(F(Y))η_Y:Y(F(Y)) such that for every object X in C and every morphism g:Y→G(X):Y(X) there exists a unique morphism f:F(Y)→X:F(Y) with G(f)∘ηY=g(f)∘η_Y=g. The existence of the unit, a universal morphism, can prove the existence of an adjunction. Again, this F can be uniquely turned into a functor F:D→C:D such that G(F(g))∘ηY=ηY′∘g(F(g))∘η_Y=η_Y' for g:Y→Y′:Y' a morphism in D; G is then called a right adjoint to F. It is true, as the terminology implies, that F is left adjoint to G if and only if G is right adjoint to F. These definitions via universal morphisms are often useful for establishing that a given functor is left or right adjoint, because they are minimalistic in their requirements. They are also intuitively meaningful in that finding a universal morphism is like solving an optimization problem. Definition via Hom-set
