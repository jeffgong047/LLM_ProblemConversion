adjunction: Given functors F : D → C, G : C → D, and a counit–unit adjunction (ε, η) : F ⊣⊣ G, we can construct a hom-set adjunction by finding the natural transformation Φ : homC(F-,-) → homD(-,G-) in the following steps: For each f : FY → X and each g : Y → GX, define ΦY,X(f)=G(f)∘ηYΨY,X(g)=εX∘F(g)Φ_Y,X(f)=G(f)∘η_Y Ψ_Y,X(g)=ε_X(g) The transformations Φ and Ψ are natural because η and ε are natural. Using, in order, that F is a functor, that ε is natural, and the counit–unit equation 1FY = εFY o F(ηY), we obtain ΨΦf=εX∘FG(f)∘F(ηY)=f∘εFY∘F(ηY)=f∘1FY=fΨ =ε_X(f)(η_Y) =f∘ε_FY(η_Y) =f∘1_FY=f hence ΨΦ is the identity transformation. Dually, using that G is a functor, that η is natural, and the counit–unit equation 1GX = G(εX) o ηGX, we obtain ΦΨg=G(εX)∘GF(g)∘ηY=G(εX)∘ηGX∘g=1GX∘g=gΦ =G(ε_X)(g)∘η_Y =G(ε_X)∘η_GX =1_GX=g hence ΦΨ is the identity transformation. Thus Φ is a natural isomorphism with inverse Φ−1 = Ψ. Hom-set adjunction induces all of the
