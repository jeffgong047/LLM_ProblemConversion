adjunction: A hom-set adjunction between two categories C and D consists of two functors F : D → C and G : C → D and a natural isomorphism Φ:homC(F−,−)→homD(−,G−)Φ:hom_C(F-,-)→hom_D(-,G-). This specifies a family of bijections ΦY,X:homC(FY,X)→homD(Y,GX)Φ_Y,X:hom_C(FY,X)→hom_D(Y,GX) for all objects X in C and Y in D. In this situation, F is left adjoint to G and G is right adjoint to F . This definition is a logical compromise in that it is more difficult to satisfy than the universal morphism definitions, and has fewer immediate implications than the counit–unit definition. It is useful because of its obvious symmetry, and as a stepping-stone between the other definitions. In order to interpret Φ as a natural isomorphism, one must recognize homC(F–, –) and homD(–, G–) as functors. In fact, they are both bifunctors from Dop × C to Set (the category of sets). For details, see the article on hom functors. Explicitly, the naturality of Φ means that for all morphisms f : X → X′ in C and all morphisms g : Y′ → Y in D the following diagram commutes: Naturality of Φ The vertical arrows in this diagram are those induced by composition. Formally, Hom(Fg, f) : HomC(FY, X) → HomC(FY′, X′) is given by h → f o h o Fg for each h in HomC(FY, X). Hom(g, Gf) is similar. Definition via counit–unit
