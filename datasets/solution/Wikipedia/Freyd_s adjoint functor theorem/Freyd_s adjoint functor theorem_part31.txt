Uniqueness: If the functor F : D → C has two right adjoints G and G′, then G and G′ are naturally isomorphic. The same is true for left adjoints. Conversely, if F is left adjoint to G, and G is naturally isomorphic to G′ then F is also left adjoint to G′. More generally, if 〈F, G, ε, η〉 is an adjunction (with counit–unit (ε,η)) and σ : F → F′ τ : G → G′ are natural isomorphisms then 〈F′, G′, ε′, η′〉 is an adjunction where η′=(τ∗σ)∘ηε′=ε∘(σ−1∗τ−1).η' =(τ∗σ)∘η ε' =ε∘(σ^-1∗τ^-1). Here ∘∘ denotes vertical composition of natural transformations, and ∗∗ denotes horizontal composition.
