logic: Quantification. If ϕYϕ_Y is a unary predicate expressing some property, then a sufficiently strong set theory may prove the existence of the set Y=y∣ϕY(y)={y|ϕ_Y(y)} of terms that fulfill the property. A proper subset T⊂Y and the associated injection of T into Y is characterized by a predicate ϕT(y)=ϕY(y)∧φ(y)ϕ_T(y)=ϕ_Y(y)φ(y) expressing a strictly more restrictive property. The role of quantifiers in predicate logics is in forming propositions and also in expressing sophisticated predicates by closing formulas with possibly more variables. For example, consider a predicate ψfψ_f with two open variables of sort X and Y. Using a quantifier to close X, we can form the set y∈Y∣∃x.ψf(x,y)∧ϕS(x){y|. ψ_f(x,y)ϕ_S(x)} of all elements y of Y for which there is an x to which it is ψfψ_f-related, and which itself is characterized by the property ϕSϕ_S. Set theoretic operations like the intersection ∩∩ of two sets directly corresponds to the conjunction ∧ of predicates. In categorical logic, a subfield of topos theory, quantifiers are identified with adjoints to the pullback functor. Such a realization can be seen in analogy to the discussion of propositional logic using set theory but the general definition make for a richer range of logics. So consider an object Y in a category with pullbacks. Any morphism f:X→Y:X induces a functor f∗:Sub(Y)⟶Sub(X)^*:Sub(Y)⟶Sub(X) on the category that is the preorder of subobjects. It maps subobjects T of Y (technically: monomorphism classes of T→Y) to the pullback X×YT×_YT. If this functor has a left- or right adjoint, they are called ∃f∃_f and ∀f∀_f, respectively.[5] They both map from Sub(X)Sub(X) back to Sub(Y)Sub(Y). Very roughly, given a domain S⊂X to quantify a relation expressed via f over, the functor/quantifier closes X in X×YT×_YT and returns the thereby specified subset of Y. Example: In SetSet, the category of sets and functions, the canonical subobjects are the subset (or rather their canonical injections). The pullback f∗T=X×YT^*T=X×_YT of an injection of a subset T into Y along f is characterized as the largest set which knows all about f and the injection of T into Y. It therefore turns out to be (in bijection with) the inverse image f−1[T]⊆X^-1[T]. For S⊆X, let us figure out the left adjoint, which is defined via Hom(∃fS,T)≅Hom(S,f∗T),Hom(∃_fS,T)≅Hom(S,f^*T), which here just means ∃fS⊆T↔S⊆f−1[T]∃_fS^-1[T]. Consider f[S]⊆T[S]. We see S⊆f−1[f[S]]⊆f−1[T]^-1[f[S]]^-1[T]. Conversely, If for an x∈S we also have x∈f−1[T]inf^-1[T], then clearly f(x)∈T(x). So S⊆f−1[T]^-1[T] implies f[S]⊆T[S]. We conclude that left adjoint to the inverse image functor f∗^* is given by the direct image. Here is a characterization of this result, which matches more the logical interpretation: The image of S under ∃f∃_f is the full set of y's, such that f−1[y]∩S^-1[{y}] is non-empty. This works because it neglects exactly those y∈Y which are in the complement of f[S][S]. So ∃fS=y∈Y∣∃(x∈f−1[y]).x∈S=f[S].∃_fS={y|∃(xinf^-1[{y}]). x }=f[S]. Put this in analogy to our motivation y∈Y∣∃x.ψf(x,y)∧ϕS(x){y|. ψ_f(x,y)ϕ_S(x)}. The right adjoint to the inverse image functor is given (without doing the computation here) by ∀fS=y∈Y∣∀(x∈f−1[y]).x∈S.∀_fS={y|∀(xinf^-1[{y}]). x }. The subset ∀fS∀_fS of Y is characterized as the full set of y's with the property that the inverse image of y{y} with respect to f is fully contained within S. Note how the predicate determining the set is the same as above, except that ∃∃ is replaced by ∀∀. See also powerset.
