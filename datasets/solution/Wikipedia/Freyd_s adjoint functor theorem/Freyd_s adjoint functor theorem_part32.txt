Composition: Adjunctions can be composed in a natural fashion. Specifically, if 〈F, G, ε, η〉 is an adjunction between C and D and 〈F′, G′, ε′, η′〉 is an adjunction between D and E then the functor F∘F′:E→C':E is left adjoint to G′∘G:C→E.':C. More precisely, there is an adjunction between F F' and G' G with unit and counit given respectively by the compositions: 1E→η′G′F′→G′ηF′G′GFF′FF′G′G→Fε′GFG→ε1C. 1_ℰG'F'G'GFF' FF'G'GFG1_𝒞. This new adjunction is called the composition of the two given adjunctions. Since there is also a natural way to define an identity adjunction between a category C and itself, one can then form a category whose objects are all small categories and whose morphisms are adjunctions.
