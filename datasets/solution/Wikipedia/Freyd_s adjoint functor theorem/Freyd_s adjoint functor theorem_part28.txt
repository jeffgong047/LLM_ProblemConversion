above: Given functors F : D → C, G : C → D, and a hom-set adjunction Φ : homC(F-,-) → homD(-,G-), one can construct a counit–unit adjunction (ε,η):F⊣G(ε,η):F , which defines families of initial and terminal morphisms, in the following steps: Let εX=ΦGX,X−1(1GX)∈homC(FGX,X)ε_X=Φ_GX,X^-1(1_GX)∈hom_C(FGX,X) for each X in C, where 1GX∈homD(GX,GX)1_GX∈hom_D(GX,GX) is the identity morphism. Let ηY=ΦY,FY(1FY)∈homD(Y,GFY)η_Y=Φ_Y,FY(1_FY)∈hom_D(Y,GFY) for each Y in D, where 1FY∈homC(FY,FY)1_FY∈hom_C(FY,FY) is the identity morphism. The bijectivity and naturality of Φ imply that each (GX, εX) is a terminal morphism from F to X in C, and each (FY, ηY) is an initial morphism from Y to G in D. The naturality of Φ implies the naturality of ε and η, and the two formulas ΦY,X(f)=G(f)∘ηYΦY,X−1(g)=εX∘F(g)Φ_Y,X(f)=G(f)∘η_Y Φ_Y,X^-1(g)=ε_X(g) for each f: FY → X and g: Y → GX (which completely determine Φ). Substituting FY for X and ηY = ΦY, FY(1FY) for g in the second formula gives the first counit–unit equation 1FY=εFY∘F(ηY)1_FY=ε_FY(η_Y), and substituting GX for Y and εX = Φ−1GX, X(1GX) for f in the first formula gives the second counit–unit equation 1GX=G(εX)∘ηGX1_GX=G(ε_X)∘η_GX.
