History: The idea of adjoint functors was introduced by Daniel Kan in 1958.[2] Like many of the concepts in category theory, it was suggested by the needs of homological algebra, which was at the time devoted to computations. Those faced with giving tidy, systematic presentations of the subject would have noticed relations such as hom(F(X), Y) = hom(X, G(Y)) in the category of abelian groups, where F was the functor −⊗A- (i.e. take the tensor product with A), and G was the functor hom(A,–) (this is now known as the tensor-hom adjunction). The use of the equals sign is an abuse of notation; those two groups are not really identical but there is a way of identifying them that is natural. It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that these are two alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from X × A to Y. That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the 'naturality' of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism.
