preservation: The most important property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor that has a left adjoint (and therefore is a right adjoint) is continuous (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right adjoint (and therefore is a left adjoint) is cocontinuous (i.e. commutes with colimits). Since many common constructions in mathematics are limits or colimits, this provides a wealth of information. For example: applying a right adjoint functor to a product of objects yields the product of the images; applying a left adjoint functor to a coproduct of objects yields the coproduct of the images; every right adjoint functor between two abelian categories is left exact; every left adjoint functor between two abelian categories is right exact.
