Monads: Every adjunction 〈F, G, ε, η〉 gives rise to an associated monad 〈T, η, μ〉 in the category D. The functor T:D→D:𝒟→𝒟 is given by T = GF. The unit of the monad η:1D→Tη:1_𝒟 is just the unit η of the adjunction and the multiplication transformation μ:T2→Tμ:T^2 is given by μ = GεF. Dually, the triple 〈FG, ε, FηG〉 defines a comonad in C. Every monad arises from some adjunction—in fact, typically from many adjunctions—in the above fashion. Two constructions, called the category of Eilenberg–Moore algebras and the Kleisli category are two extremal solutions to the problem of constructing an adjunction that gives rise to a given monad.
