notation: The terms adjoint and adjunct are both used, and are cognates: one is taken directly from Latin, the other from Latin via French. In the classic text Categories for the working mathematician, Mac Lane makes a distinction between the two. Given a family φXY:homC(FY,X)≅homD(Y,GX)φ_XY:hom_𝒞(FY,X)≅hom_𝒟(Y,GX) of hom-set bijections, we call φφ an adjunction or an adjunction between F and G. If f is an arrow in homC(FY,X)hom_𝒞(FY,X), φf is the right adjunct of f (p. 81). The functor F is left adjoint to G, and G is right adjoint to F. (Note that G may have itself a right adjoint that is quite different from F; see below for an example.) In general, the phrases "F is a left adjoint" and "F has a right adjoint" are equivalent. We call F a left adjoint because it is applied to the left argument of homChom_𝒞, and G a right adjoint because it is applied to the right argument of homDhom_𝒟. If F is left adjoint to G, we also write F⊣G.. The terminology comes from the Hilbert space idea of adjoint operators T, U with ⟨Ty,x⟩=⟨y,Ux⟩,x⟩=,Ux⟩, which is formally similar to the above relation between hom-sets. The analogy to adjoint maps of Hilbert spaces can be made precise in certain contexts.[1] Introduction and
