Existence: See also: Formal criteria for adjoint functors Not every functor G : C → D admits a left adjoint. If C is a complete category, then the functors with left adjoints can be characterized by the adjoint functor theorem of Peter J. Freyd: G has a left adjoint if and only if it is continuous and a certain smallness condition is satisfied: for every object Y of D there exists a family of morphisms fi : Y → G(Xi) where the indices i come from a set I, not a proper class, such that every morphism h : Y → G(X) can be written as h = G(t) ∘ fi for some i in I and some morphism t : Xi → X ∈ C. An analogous statement characterizes those functors with a right adjoint. An important special case is that of locally presentable categories. If F:C→D:C is a functor between locally presentable categories, then F has a right adjoint if and only if F preserves small colimits F has a left adjoint if and only if F preserves small limits and is an accessible functor
