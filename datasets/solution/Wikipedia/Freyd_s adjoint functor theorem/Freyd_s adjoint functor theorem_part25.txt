full: There are hence numerous functors and natural transformations associated with every adjunction, and only a small portion is sufficient to determine the rest. An adjunction between categories C and D consists of A functor F : D → C called the left adjoint A functor G : C → D called the right adjoint A natural isomorphism Φ : homC(F–,–) → homD(–,G–) A natural transformation ε : FG → 1C called the counit A natural transformation η : 1D → GF called the unit An equivalent formulation, where X denotes any object of C and Y denotes any object of D, is as follows: For every C-morphism f : FY → X, there is a unique D-morphism ΦY, X(f) = g : Y → GX such that the diagrams below commute, and for every D-morphism g : Y → GX, there is a unique C-morphism Φ−1Y, X(g) = f : FY → X in C such that the diagrams below commute: From this assertion, one can recover that: The transformations ε, η, and Φ are related by the equations f=ΦY,X−1(g)=εX∘F(g)∈homC(F(Y),X)g=ΦY,X(f)=G(f)∘ηY∈homD(Y,G(X))ΦGX,X−1(1GX)=εX∈homC(FG(X),X)ΦY,FY(1FY)=ηY∈homD(Y,GF(Y))f=Φ_Y,X^-1(g) =ε_X(g) ∈ hom_C(F(Y),X) g=Φ_Y,X(f) =G(f)∘η_Y ∈ hom_D(Y,G(X)) Φ_GX,X^-1(1_GX) =ε_X ∈ hom_C(FG(X),X) Φ_Y,FY(1_FY) =η_Y ∈ hom_D(Y,GF(Y)) The transformations ε, η satisfy the counit–unit equations 1FY=εFY∘F(ηY)1GX=G(εX)∘ηGX1_FY =ε_FY(η_Y) 1_GX =G(ε_X)∘η_GX Each pair (GX, εX) is a terminal morphism from F to X in C Each pair (FY, ηY) is an initial morphism from Y to G in D In particular, the equations above allow one to define Φ, ε, and η in terms of any one of the three. However, the adjoint functors F and G alone are in general not sufficient to determine the adjunction. The equivalence of these situations is demonstrated below. Universal morphisms induce hom-set
