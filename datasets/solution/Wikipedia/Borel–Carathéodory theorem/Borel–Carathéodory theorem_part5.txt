Applications: Borel–Carathéodory is often used to bound the logarithm of derivatives, such as in the proof of Hadamard factorization theorem. The following example is a strengthening of Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem, improved — If f is an entire function, such that there exists a sequence rk↗∞_k↗∞ with maxz∈∂B(0,rk)ℜ(f(z))=o(rkn+1)max_z∈(0,r_k)(f(z))=o(r_k^n+1), then f is a polynomial of degree at most n. Proof By Borel-Caratheodory lemma, for any 0<r<rk0<r<r_k, maxz∈∂B(0,r)|f(n+1)(z)|≤4n!(rk−r)n+2rkMmax_z∈(0,r)|f^(n+1)(z)|≤4n!/(r_k-r)^n+2r_kM where M=maxz∈∂B(0,rk)ℜ(f(z))=o(rkn+1)=max_z∈(0,r_k)(f(z))=o(r_k^n+1). Letting r≤rk2≤r_k/2, and taking the k↗∞↗∞ limit: maxz∈∂B(0,r)|f(n+1)(z)|=o(1)→0max_z∈(0,r)|f^(n+1)(z)|=o(1)→0 Thus by Liouville's theorem, f(n+1)^(n+1) is a constant function, and it converges to zero, so it is zero. So f is a polynomial of degree at most n. Corollary — If an entire function f has no roots and is of finite order ρρ, then f(z)=ep(z)(z)=e^p(z) for some polynomial p of degree deg(p)≤ρ(p)≤ρ. Proof Apply the improved Liouville theorem to g=log⁡(f)=log(f).
