proof: We start with the following result:[1] Theorem — If f=u+iv=u+iv is analytic on B(0,R+ϵ)(0,R+ϵ) for some ϵ>0ϵ>0, and u≤M on ∂B(0,R)(0,R), then ∀n≥1≥1, |f(n)(0)|≤2n!Rn(M−u(0))|f^(n)(0)|≤2n!/R^n(M-u(0)) and similarly if v≤M. Proof[2] It suffices to prove the u case, since the v case is found by −if=v−iu-if=v-iu. WLOG, subtract a constant away, to get f(0)=0(0)=0. Do three contour integrals around ∂B(0,R)(0,R) using Cauchy integral formula: f(n)(0)/n!=12πi∮f(z)zn+1dz=∫01f(Re2πit)Rne2πintdt^(n)(0)/n!=1/2∮f(z)/z^n+1dz=∫_0^1f(Re^2)/R^ne^2dt ∫01f(Re2πit)e2πintdt=12πiRn∮f(z)zn−1dz=0∫_0^1f(Re^2)e^2dt=1/2^n(z)z^n-1dz=0 ∫01f(Re2πit)dt=12πi∮f(z)z−1dz=f(0)=0∫_0^1f(Re^2)dt=1/2(z)z^-1dz=f(0)=0 Pick angle θθ, so that e−iθf(n)(0)=|f(n)(0)|^-iθf^(n)(0)=|f^(n)(0)|. Then by linearly combining the three integrals, we get ∫01f(Re2πit)dt(1+cos⁡(2πnt+θ))=12Rn|f(n)(0)|/n!∫_0^1f(Re^2)dt(1+cos(2+θ))=1/2R^n|f^(n)(0)|/n! The imaginary part vanishes, and the real part gives ∫01u(Re2πit)dt(1+cos⁡(2πnt+θ))=12Rn|f(n)(0)|/n!∫_0^1u(Re^2)dt(1+cos(2+θ))=1/2R^n|f^(n)(0)|/n! The integral is bounded above by M∫01dt(1+cos⁡(2πnt+θ))=M∫_0^1dt(1+cos(2+θ))=M, so we have the result. Corollary 1 — With the same assumptions, for all r∈(0,R)∈(0,R), maxz∈∂B(0,r)|f(z)|≤2rR−rM+R+rR−r|f(0)|max_z∈(0,r)|f(z)|≤2r/R-rM+R+r/R-r|f(0)| Proof It suffices to prove the case of f(0)=0(0)=0. By previous result, using the Taylor expansion, |f(z)|≤∑n=0∞1n!|f(n)(0)|⋅|z|n≤|f(0)|+∑n=1∞2M(r/R)n=2rR−rM|f(z)|≤∑_n=0^∞1/n!|f^(n)(0)|·|z|^n≤|f(0)|+∑_n=1^∞2M(r/R)^n=2r/R-rM Corollary 2 (Titchmarsh, 5.51, improved) — With the same assumptions, for all r∈(0,R)∈(0,R), and all integer n≥1≥1 maxz∈∂B(0,r)|f(n)(z)|≤2n!(R−r)n+1R(M−u(0))max_z∈(0,r)|f^(n)(z)|≤2n!/(R-r)^n+1R(M-u(0)) Proof It suffices to prove the case of f(0)=0(0)=0 as well. And similarly to above, |f(n)(z)|≤∑k=n∞k⋯(k−n+1)k!|f(k)(0)|⋅|z|k−n≤2(M−u(0))Rn∑k=n∞k⋯(k−n+1)(rR)k−n=2n!(R−r)n+1R(M−u(0))|f^(n)(z)| ≤∑_k=n^∞k⋯(k-n+1)/k!|f^(k)(0)|·|z|^k-n ≤2(M-u(0))/R^n∑_k=n^∞k⋯(k-n+1)(r/R)^k-n =2n!/(R-r)^n+1R(M-u(0))
