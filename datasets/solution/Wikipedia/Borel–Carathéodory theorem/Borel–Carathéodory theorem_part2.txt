theorem: Let a function f be analytic on a closed disc of radius R centered at the origin. Suppose that r < R. Then, we have the following inequality: ‖f‖r≤2rR−rsup|z|≤RRe⁡f(z)+R+rR−r|f(0)|.f_r≤2r/R-rsup_|z|Ref(z)+R+r/R-r|f(0)|. Here, the norm on the left-hand side denotes the maximum value of f in the closed disc: ‖f‖r=max|z|≤r|f(z)|=max|z|=r|f(z)|f_r=max_|z||f(z)|=max_|z|=r|f(z)| (where the last equality is due to the maximum modulus principle).
