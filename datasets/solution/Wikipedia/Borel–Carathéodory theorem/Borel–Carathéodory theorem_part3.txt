Proof: Define A by A=sup|z|≤RRe⁡f(z).=sup_|z|Ref(z). If f is constant c, the inequality follows from (R+r)|c|+2rRe⁡c≥(R−r)|c|(R+r)|c|+2rRec≥(R-r)|c|, so we may assume f is nonconstant. First let f(0) = 0. Since Re f is harmonic, Re f(0) is equal to the average of its values around any circle centered at 0. That is, Re⁡f(0)=12π∫|z|=RRe⁡f(z)dz.Ref(0)=1/2π∫_|z|=RRef(z)dz. Since f is regular and nonconstant, we have that Re f is also nonconstant. Since Re f(0) = 0, we must have Re f(z)>0(z)>0 for some z on the circle |z|=R|z|=R, so we may take A>0>0. Now f maps into the half-plane P to the left of the x=A line. Roughly, our goal is to map this half-plane to a disk, apply Schwarz's lemma there, and make out the stated inequality. w↦w/A−1/A-1 sends P to the standard left half-plane. w↦R(w+1)/(w−1)(w+1)/(w-1) sends the left half-plane to the circle of radius R centered at the origin. The composite, which maps 0 to 0, is the desired map: w↦Rww−2A.↦Rw/w-2A. From Schwarz's lemma applied to the composite of this map and f, we have |Rf(z)||f(z)−2A|≤|z|.|Rf(z)|/|f(z)-2A|≤|z|. Take |z| ≤ r. The above becomes R|f(z)|≤r|f(z)−2A|≤r|f(z)|+2Ar|f(z)||f(z)-2A||f(z)|+2Ar so |f(z)|≤2ArR−r|f(z)|≤2Ar/R-r, as claimed. In the general case, we may apply the above to f(z)-f(0): |f(z)|−|f(0)|≤|f(z)−f(0)|≤2rR−rsup|w|≤RRe⁡(f(w)−f(0))≤2rR−r(sup|w|≤RRe⁡f(w)+|f(0)|),|f(z)|-|f(0)| ≤|f(z)-f(0)|≤2r/R-rsup_|w|Re(f(w)-f(0)) ≤2r/R-r(sup_|w|Ref(w)+|f(0)|), which, when rearranged, gives the claim.
