corollaries: Post's theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees of the form ∅(n)∅^(n), that is, finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set. (The empty set could be replaced with any other computable set without changing the truth of the theorem.) Post's theorem states: A set B is Σn+10Σ_n+1^0 if and only if B is recursively enumerable by an oracle Turing machine with an oracle for ∅(n)∅^(n), that is, if and only if B is Σ10,∅(n)Σ_1^0,∅^(n). The set ∅(n)∅^(n) is Σn0Σ_n^0-complete for every n>0>0. This means that every Σn0Σ_n^0 set is many-one reducible to ∅(n)∅^(n). Post's theorem has many corollaries that expose additional relationships between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees. These include: Fix a set C. A set B is Σn+10,CΣ_n+1^0,C if and only if B is Σ10,C(n)Σ_1^0,C^(n). This is the relativization of the first part of Post's theorem to the oracle C. A set B is Δn+1Δ_n+1 if and only if B≤T∅(n)≤_T∅^(n). More generally, B is Δn+1CΔ_n+1^C if and only if B≤TC(n)≤_TC^(n). A set is defined to be arithmetical if it is Σn0Σ_n^0 for some n. Post's theorem shows that, equivalently, a set is arithmetical if and only if it is Turing reducible to ∅(m)∅^(m) for some m. Proof of Post's
