arithmetic: The operation of a Turing machine T on input n can be formalized logically in first-order arithmetic. For example, we may use symbols Ak_k, Bk_k, and Ck_k for the tape configuration, machine state and location along the tape after k steps, respectively. T's transition system determines the relation between (Ak,Bk,Ck)(A_k,B_k,C_k) and (Ak+1,Bk+1,Ck+1)(A_k+1,B_k+1,C_k+1); their initial values (for k=0=0) are the input, the initial state and zero, respectively. The machine halts if and only if there is a number k such that Bk_k is the halting state. The exact relation depends on the specific implementation of the notion of Turing machine (e.g. their alphabet, allowed mode of motion along the tape, etc.) In case T halts at time n1_1, the relation between (Ak,Bk,Ck)(A_k,B_k,C_k) and (Ak+1,Bk+1,Ck+1)(A_k+1,B_k+1,C_k+1) must be satisfied only for k bounded from above by n1_1. Thus there is a formula φ(n,n1)φ(n,n_1) in first-order arithmetic with no unbounded quantifiers, such that T halts on input n at time n1_1 at most if and only if φ(n,n1)φ(n,n_1) is satisfied.
