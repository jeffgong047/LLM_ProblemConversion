sets: Let S be a set that can be recursively enumerated by a Turing machine. Then there is a Turing machine T that for every n in S, T halts when given n as an input. This can be formalized by the first-order arithmetical formula presented above. The members of S are the numbers n satisfying the following formula: ∃n1:φ(n,n1)_1:φ(n,n_1) This formula is in Σ10Σ_1^0. Therefore, S is in Σ10Σ_1^0. Thus every recursively enumerable set is in Σ10Σ_1^0. The converse is true as well: for every formula φ(n)φ(n) in Σ10Σ_1^0 with k existential quantifiers, we may enumerate the k–tuples of natural numbers and run a Turing machine that goes through all of them until it finds the formula is satisfied. This Turing machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying φ(n)φ(n), and thus enumerates its corresponding set. Oracle
