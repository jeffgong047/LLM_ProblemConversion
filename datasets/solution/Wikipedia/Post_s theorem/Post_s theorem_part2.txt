Background: See also: Arithmetical hierarchy § Relation to Turing machines The statement of Post's theorem uses several concepts relating to definability and recursion theory. This section gives a brief overview of these concepts, which are covered in depth in their respective articles. The arithmetical hierarchy classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of Peano arithmetic. A formula is said to be Σm0Σ_m^0 if it is an existential statement in prenex normal form (all quantifiers at the front) with m alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a formula with bounded quantifiers only. Formally a formula ϕ(s)ϕ(s) in the language of Peano arithmetic is a Σm0Σ_m^0 formula if it is of the form (∃n11∃n21⋯∃nj11)(∀n12⋯∀nj22)(∃n13⋯)⋯(Qn1m⋯)ρ(n11,…njmm,x1,…,xk)(_1^1_2^1⋯_j_1^1)(_1^2⋯_j_2^2)(_1^3⋯)⋯(Qn_1^m⋯)ρ(n_1^1,_j_m^m,x_1,…,x_k) where ρρ contains only bounded quantifiers and Q is ∀∀ if m is even and ∃∃ if m is odd. A set of natural numbers A is said to be Σm0Σ_m^0 if it is definable by a Σm0Σ_m^0 formula, that is, if there is a Σm0Σ_m^0 formula ϕ(s)ϕ(s) such that each number n is in A if and only if ϕ(n)ϕ(n) holds. It is known that if a set is Σm0Σ_m^0 then it is Σn0Σ_n^0 for any n>m>m, but for each m there is a Σm+10Σ_m+1^0 set that is not Σm0Σ_m^0. Thus the number of quantifier alternations required to define a set gives a measure of the complexity of the set. Post's theorem uses the relativized arithmetical hierarchy as well as the unrelativized hierarchy just defined. A set A of natural numbers is said to be Σm0Σ_m^0 relative to a set B, written Σm0,BΣ_m^0,B, if A is definable by a Σm0Σ_m^0 formula in an extended language that includes a predicate for membership in B. While the arithmetical hierarchy measures definability of sets of natural numbers, Turing degrees measure the level of uncomputability of sets of natural numbers. A set A is said to be Turing reducible to a set B, written A≤TB≤_TB, if there is an oracle Turing machine that, given an oracle for B, computes the characteristic function of A. The Turing jump of a set A is a form of the Halting problem relative to A. Given a set A, the Turing jump A′' is the set of indices of oracle Turing machines that halt on input 00 when run with oracle A. It is known that every set A is Turing reducible to its Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set. Post's theorem uses finitely iterated Turing jumps. For any set A of natural numbers, the notation A(n)^(n) indicates the n–fold iterated Turing jump of A. Thus A(0)^(0) is just A, and A(n+1)^(n+1) is the Turing jump of A(n)^(n). Post's theorem and
