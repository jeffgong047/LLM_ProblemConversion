curves: For closed polygonal chains the same result holds with the integral of curvature replaced by the sum of angles between adjacent segments of the chain. By approximating arbitrary curves by polygonal chains, one may extend the definition of total curvature to larger classes of curves, within which the Fáry–Milnor theorem also holds (Milnor 1950, Sullivan 2008).
