Statement: If K is any closed curve in Euclidean space that is sufficiently smooth to define the curvature κ at each of its points, and if the total absolute curvature is less than or equal to 4π, then K is an unknot, i.e.: If∮K|κ(s)|ds≤4π,thenKisanunknot.If oint_K|κ(s)| ds≤4π,{then{isanunknot. The seam of a baseball follows an unknotted curve with total curvature roughly 4π. By making the curve more convoluted, unknots can be made to have arbitrarily large curvature. The contrapositive tells us that if K is not an unknot, i.e. K is not isotopic to the circle, then the total curvature will be strictly greater than 4π. Notice that having the total curvature less than or equal to 4π is merely a sufficient condition for K to be an unknot; it is not a necessary condition. In other words, although all knots with total curvature less than or equal to 4π are the unknot, there exist unknots with curvature strictly greater than 4π. Generalizations to non-smooth
