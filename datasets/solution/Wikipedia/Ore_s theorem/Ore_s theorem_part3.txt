Proof: Illustration for the proof of Ore's theorem. In a graph with the Hamiltonian path v1...vn but no Hamiltonian cycle, at most one of the two edges v1vi and vi − 1vn (shown as blue dashed curves) can exist. For, if they both exist, then adding them to the path and removing the (red) edge vi − 1vi would produce a Hamiltonian cycle. It is equivalent to show that every non-Hamiltonian graph G does not obey condition (∗). Accordingly, let G be a graph on n ≥ 3 vertices that is not Hamiltonian, and let H be formed from G by adding edges one at a time that do not create a Hamiltonian cycle, until no more edges can be added. Let x and y be any two non-adjacent vertices in H. Then adding edge xy to H would create at least one new Hamiltonian cycle, and the edges other than xy in such a cycle must form a Hamiltonian path v1v2...vn in H with x = v1 and y = vn. For each index i in the range 2 ≤ i ≤ n, consider the two possible edges in H from v1 to vi and from vi − 1 to vn. At most one of these two edges can be present in H, for otherwise the cycle v1v2...vi − 1vnvn − 1...vi would be a Hamiltonian cycle. Thus, the total number of edges incident to either v1 or vn is at most equal to the number of choices of i, which is n − 1. Therefore, H does not obey property (∗), which requires that this total number of edges (deg v1 + deg vn) be greater than or equal to n. Since the vertex degrees in G are at most equal to the degrees in H, it follows that G also does not obey property (∗).
