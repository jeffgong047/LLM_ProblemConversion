For Ore's theorem in ring theory, see Ore condition. A graph meeting the conditions of Ore's theorem, and a Hamiltonian cycle in it. There are two vertices with degree less than n/2 in the center of the drawing, so the conditions for Dirac's theorem are not met. However, these two vertices are adjacent, and all other pairs of vertices have total degree at least seven, the number of vertices. Ore's theorem is a result in graph theory proved in 1960 by Norwegian mathematician Ã˜ystein Ore. It gives a sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian, essentially stating that a graph with sufficiently many edges must contain a Hamilton cycle. Specifically, the theorem considers the sum of the degrees of pairs of non-adjacent vertices: if every such pair has a sum that at least equals the total number of vertices in the graph, then the graph is Hamiltonian.
