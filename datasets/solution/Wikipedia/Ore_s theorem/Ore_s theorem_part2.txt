statement: Let G be a (finite and simple) graph with n ≥ 3 vertices. We denote by deg v the degree of a vertex v in G, i.e. the number of incident edges in G to v. Then, Ore's theorem states that if deg v + deg w ≥ n for every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices v and w of G (∗) then G is Hamiltonian.
