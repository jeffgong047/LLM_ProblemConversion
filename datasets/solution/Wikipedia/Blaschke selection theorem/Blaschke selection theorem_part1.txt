Any sequence of convex sets contained in a bounded set has a convergent subsequence The Blaschke selection theorem is a result in topology and convex geometry about sequences of convex sets. Specifically, given a sequence Kn{K_n} of convex sets contained in a bounded set, the theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence Knm{K_n_m} and a convex set K such that Knm_n_m converges to K in the Hausdorff metric. The theorem is named for Wilhelm Blaschke. Alternate
