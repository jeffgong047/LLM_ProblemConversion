Application: As an example of its use, the isoperimetric problem can be shown to have a solution.[1] That is, there exists a curve of fixed length that encloses the maximum area possible. Other problems likewise can be shown to have a solution: Lebesgue's universal covering problem for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of all sets in the plane of unit diameter,[1] the maximum inclusion problem,[1] and the Moser's worm problem for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of planar curves of unit length.[2]
