Definitions: A decision problem is in NP if it can be decided by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. An instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem is a Boolean expression that combines Boolean variables using Boolean operators. Such an expression is satisfiable if there is some assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the entire expression true.
