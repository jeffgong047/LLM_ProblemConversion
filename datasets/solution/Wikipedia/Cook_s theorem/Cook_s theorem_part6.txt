Complexity: While the above method encodes a non-deterministic Turing machine in complexity O(log⁡(p(n))p(n)3)(log(p(n))p(n)^3), the literature describes more sophisticated approaches in complexity O(p(n)log⁡(p(n)))(p(n)log(p(n))).[9][10][11][12][13] The quasilinear result first appeared seven years after Cook's original publication. The use of SAT to prove the existence of an NP-complete problem can be extended to other computational problems in logic, and to completeness for other complexity classes. The quantified Boolean formula problem (QBF) involves Boolean formulas extended to include nested universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers for its variables. The QBF problem can be used to encode computation with a Turing machine limited to polynomial space complexity, proving that there exists a problem (the recognition of true quantified Boolean formulas) that is PSPACE-complete. Analogously, dependency quantified boolean formulas encode computation with a Turing machine limited to logarithmic space complexity, proving that there exists a problem that is NL-complete.[14][15]
