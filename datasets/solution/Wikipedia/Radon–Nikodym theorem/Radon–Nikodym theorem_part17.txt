measures: If μ and ν are σ-finite, then X can be written as the union of a sequence {Bn}n of disjoint sets in Σ, each of which has finite measure under both μ and ν. For each n, by the finite case, there is a Σ-measurable function fn : Bn → [0, ∞) such that νn(A)=∫Afndμν_n(A)=∫_Af_n dμ for each Σ-measurable subset A of Bn. The sum (∑nfn1Bn):=f(∑_nf_n1_B_n):=f of those functions is then the required function such that ν(A)=∫Afdμν(A)=∫_Af dμ. As for the uniqueness, since each of the fn is μ-almost everywhere unique, so is f. For signed and complex
