Examples: In the following examples, the set X is the real interval [0,1], and ΣΣ is the Borel sigma-algebra on X. μμ is the length measure on X. νν assigns to each subset Y of X, twice the length of Y. Then, dνdμ=2dν/dμ=2. μμ is the length measure on X. νν assigns to each subset Y of X, the number of points from the set {0.1, …, 0.9} that are contained in Y. Then, νν is not absolutely-continuous with respect to μμ since it assigns non-zero measure to zero-length points. Indeed, there is no derivative dνdμdν/dμ: there is no finite function that, when integrated e.g. from (0.1−ε)(0.1-ε) to (0.1+ε)(0.1+ε), gives 11 for all ε>0ε>0. μ=ν+δ0μ=ν+δ_0, where νν is the length measure on X and δ0δ_0 is the Dirac measure on 0 (it assigns a measure of 1 to any set containing 0 and a measure of 0 to any other set). Then, νν is absolutely continuous with respect to μμ, and dνdμ=1X∖0dν/dμ=1_X∖{0} – the derivative is 0 at x=0=0 and 1 at x>0>0.[4]
