measures: Constructing an extended-valued candidate First, suppose μ and ν are both finite-valued nonnegative measures. Let F be the set of those extended-value measurable functions f : X → [0, ∞] such that: ∀A∈Σ:∫Afdμ≤ν(A)∈Σ: ∫_Af dμ≤ν(A) F ≠ ∅, since it contains at least the zero function. Now let f1, f2 ∈ F, and suppose A is an arbitrary measurable set, and define: A1=x∈A:f1(x)>f2(x),A2=x∈A:f2(x)≥f1(x).A_1 ={x:f_1(x)>f_2(x)}, A_2 ={x:f_2(x)_1(x)}. Then one has ∫Amaxf1,f2dμ=∫A1f1dμ+∫A2f2dμ≤ν(A1)+ν(A2)=ν(A),∫_Amax{f_1,f_2} dμ=∫_A_1f_1 dμ+∫_A_2f_2 dμ≤ν(A_1)+ν(A_2)=ν(A), and therefore, max{ f 1, f 2} ∈ F. Now, let { fn } be a sequence of functions in F such that limn→∞∫Xfndμ=supf∈F∫Xfdμ.lim_n→∞∫_Xf_n dμ=sup_f∫_Xf dμ. By replacing fn with the maximum of the first n functions, one can assume that the sequence { fn } is increasing. Let g be an extended-valued function defined as g(x):=limn→∞fn(x).(x):=lim_n→∞f_n(x). By Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem, one has limn→∞∫Afndμ=∫Alimn→∞fn(x)dμ(x)=∫Agdμ≤ν(A)lim_n→∞∫_Af_n dμ=∫_Alim_n→∞f_n(x) dμ(x)=∫_Ag dμ≤ν(A) for each A ∈ Σ, and hence, g ∈ F. Also, by the construction of g, ∫Xgdμ=supf∈F∫Xfdμ.∫_Xg dμ=sup_f∫_Xf dμ. Proving equality Now, since g ∈ F, ν0(A):=ν(A)−∫Agdμν_0(A):=ν(A)-∫_Ag dμ defines a nonnegative measure on Σ. To prove equality, we show that ν0 = 0. Suppose ν0 ≠ 0; then, since μ is finite, there is an ε > 0 such that ν0(X) > ε μ(X). To derive a contradiction from ν0 ≠ 0, we look for a positive set P ∈ Σ for the signed measure ν0 − ε μ (i.e. a measurable set P, all of whose measurable subsets have non-negative ν0 − εμ measure), where also P has positive μ-measure. Conceptually, we're looking for a set P, where ν0 ≥ ε μ in every part of P. A convenient approach is to use the Hahn decomposition (P, N) for the signed measure ν0 − ε μ. Note then that for every A ∈ Σ one has ν0(A ∩ P) ≥ ε μ(A ∩ P), and hence, ν(A)=∫Agdμ+ν0(A)≥∫Agdμ+ν0(A∩P)≥∫Agdμ+εμ(A∩P)=∫A(g+ε1P)dμ,ν(A) =∫_Ag dμ+ν_0(A) ≥∫_Ag dμ+ν_0(A) ≥∫_Ag dμ+εμ(A)=∫_A(g+ε1_P) dμ, where 1P is the indicator function of P. Also, note that μ(P) > 0 as desired; for if μ(P) = 0, then (since ν is absolutely continuous in relation to μ) ν0(P) ≤ ν(P) = 0, so ν0(P) = 0 and ν0(X)−εμ(X)=(ν0−εμ)(N)≤0,ν_0(X)-εμ(X)=(ν_0-εμ)(N)≤0, contradicting the fact that ν0(X) > εμ(X). Then, since also ∫X(g+ε1P)dμ≤ν(X)<+∞,∫_X(g+ε1_P) dμ≤ν(X)<+∞, g + ε 1P ∈ F and satisfies ∫X(g+ε1P)dμ>∫Xgdμ=supf∈F∫Xfdμ.∫_X(g+ε1_P) dμ>∫_Xg dμ=sup_f∫_Xf dμ. This is impossible because it violates the definition of a supremum; therefore, the initial assumption that ν0 ≠ 0 must be false. Hence, ν0 = 0, as desired. Restricting to finite values Now, since g is μ-integrable, the set {x ∈ X : g(x) = ∞} is μ-null. Therefore, if a f is defined as f(x)=g(x)ifg(x)<∞0otherwise,(x)=g(x) ifg(x)<∞ 0 otherwise, then f has the desired properties. Uniqueness As for the uniqueness, let f, g : X → [0, ∞) be measurable functions satisfying ν(A)=∫Afdμ=∫Agdμν(A)=∫_Af dμ=∫_Ag dμ for every measurable set A. Then, g − f is μ-integrable, and ∫A(g−f)dμ=0.∫_A(g-f) dμ=0. In particular, for A = {x ∈ X : f(x) > g(x)}, or {x ∈ X : f(x) < g(x)}. It follows that ∫X(g−f)+dμ=0=∫X(g−f)−dμ,∫_X(g-f)^+ dμ=0=∫_X(g-f)^- dμ, and so, that (g − f )+ = 0 μ-almost everywhere; the same is true for (g − f )−, and thus, f = g μ-almost everywhere, as desired.
