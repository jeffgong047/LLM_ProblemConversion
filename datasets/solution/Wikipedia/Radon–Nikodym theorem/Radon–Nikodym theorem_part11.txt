divergences: If μ and ν are measures over X, and μ ≪ ν The Kullback–Leibler divergence from ν to μ is defined to be DKL(μ∥ν)=∫Xlog⁡(dμdν)dμ._KL(μ∥ν)=∫_Xlog(dμ/dν) dμ. For α > 0, α ≠ 1 the Rényi divergence of order α from ν to μ is defined to be Dα(μ∥ν)=1α−1log⁡(∫X(dμdν)α−1dμ)._α(μ∥ν)=1/α-1log(∫_X(dμ/dν)^α-1 dμ). The assumption of
