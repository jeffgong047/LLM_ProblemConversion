measures: A similar theorem can be proven for signed and complex measures: namely, that if μμ is a nonnegative σ-finite measure, and νν is a finite-valued signed or complex measure such that ν≪μ,ν≪μ, that is, νν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ,μ, then there is a μμ-integrable real- or complex-valued function g on X such that for every measurable set A,, ν(A)=∫Agdμ.ν(A)=∫_Ag dμ.
