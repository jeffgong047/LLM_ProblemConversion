example: Here is an example when μ is not σ-finite and the Radon–Nikodym theorem fails to hold. Consider the Borel σ-algebra on the real line. Let the counting measure, μ, of a Borel set A be defined as the number of elements of A if A is finite, and ∞ otherwise. One can check that μ is indeed a measure. It is not σ-finite, as not every Borel set is at most a countable union of finite sets. Let ν be the usual Lebesgue measure on this Borel algebra. Then, ν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ, since for a set A one has μ(A) = 0 only if A is the empty set, and then ν(A) is also zero. Assume that the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds, that is, for some measurable function f one has ν(A)=∫Afdμν(A)=∫_Af dμ for all Borel sets. Taking A to be a singleton set, A = {a}, and using the above equality, one finds 0=f(a)0=f(a) for all real numbers a. This implies that the function f , and therefore the Lebesgue measure ν, is zero, which is a contradiction. Positive
