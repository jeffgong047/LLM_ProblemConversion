theorem: The Radon–Nikodym theorem involves a measurable space (X,Σ)(X,Σ) on which two σ-finite measures are defined, μμ and ν.ν. It states that, if ν≪μν≪μ (that is, if νν is absolutely continuous with respect to μμ), then there exists a ΣΣ-measurable function f:X→[0,∞),:X→[0,∞), such that for any measurable set A⊆X,, ν(A)=∫Afdμ.ν(A)=∫_Af dμ.
