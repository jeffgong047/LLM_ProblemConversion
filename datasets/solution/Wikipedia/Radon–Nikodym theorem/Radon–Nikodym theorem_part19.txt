theorem: Lebesgue's decomposition theorem shows that the assumptions of the Radon–Nikodym theorem can be found even in a situation which is seemingly more general. Consider a σ-finite positive measure μμ on the measure space (X,Σ)(X,Σ) and a σ-finite signed measure νν on ΣΣ, without assuming any absolute continuity. Then there exist unique signed measures νaν_a and νsν_s on ΣΣ such that ν=νa+νsν=ν_a+ν_s, νa≪μν_a≪μ, and νs⊥μν_s⊥μ. The Radon–Nikodym theorem can then be applied to the pair νa,μν_a,μ. See
