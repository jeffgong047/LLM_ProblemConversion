Properties: Let ν, μ, and λ be σ-finite measures on the same measurable space. If ν ≪ λ and μ ≪ λ (ν and μ are both absolutely continuous with respect to λ), then d(ν+μ)dλ=dνdλ+dμdλλ-almosteverywhere.d(ν+μ)/dλ=dν/dλ+dμ/dλ λ-almosteverywhere. If ν ≪ μ ≪ λ, then dνdλ=dνdμdμdλλ-almosteverywhere.dν/dλ=dν/dμdμ/dλ λ-almosteverywhere. In particular, if μ ≪ ν and ν ≪ μ, then dμdν=(dνdμ)−1ν-almosteverywhere.dμ/dν=(dν/dμ)^-1 ν-almosteverywhere. If μ ≪ λ and g is a μ-integrable function, then ∫Xgdμ=∫Xgdμdλdλ.∫_Xg dμ=∫_Xgdμ/dλ dλ. If ν is a finite signed or complex measure, then d|ν|dμ=|dνdμ|.d|ν|μ=|dνμ|.
