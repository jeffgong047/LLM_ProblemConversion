Notes: ^ By the definition used here, semisimple rings are automatically Artinian rings. However, some authors use "semisimple" differently, to mean that the ring has a trivial Jacobson radical. For Artinian rings, the two notions are equivalent, so "Artinian" is included here to eliminate that ambiguity.
