Proof: There are various proofs of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem.[2][3] A common modern one[4] takes the following approach. Suppose the ring R is semisimple. Then the right R-module RR_R is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of simple modules (which are the same as minimal right ideals of R). Write this direct sum as RR≅⨁i=1mIi⊕ni_R ≅ ⊕_i=1^mI_i^_i where the Ii_i are mutually nonisomorphic simple right R-modules, the ith one appearing with multiplicity ni_i. This gives an isomorphism of endomorphism rings End(RR)≅⨁i=1mEnd(Ii⊕ni)End(R_R) ≅ ⊕_i=1^mEnd(I_i^_i) and we can identify End(Ii⊕ni)End(I_i^_i) with a ring of matrices End(Ii⊕ni)≅Mni(End(Ii))End(I_i^_i) ≅ M_n_i(End(I_i)) where the endomorphism ring End(Ii)End(I_i) of Ii_i is a division ring by Schur's lemma, because Ii_i is simple. Since R≅End(RR)≅End(R_R) we conclude R≅⨁i=1mMni(End(Ii)). ≅ ⊕_i=1^mM_n_i(End(I_i)) . Here we used right modules because R≅End(RR)≅End(R_R); if we used left modules R would be isomorphic to the opposite algebra of End(RR)End(_RR), but the proof would still go through. To see this proof in a larger context, see Decomposition of a module. For the proof of an important special case, see Simple Artinian ring.
