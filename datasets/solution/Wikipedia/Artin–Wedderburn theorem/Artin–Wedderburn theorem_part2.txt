Theorem: Let R be a (Artinian) semisimple ring. Then the Wedderburn–Artin theorem states that R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings Mni(Di)_n_i(D_i) over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i. There is also a version of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem for algebras over a field k. If R is a finite-dimensional semisimple k-algebra, then each Di in the above statement is a finite-dimensional division algebra over k. The center of each Di need not be k; it could be a finite extension of k. Note that if R is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a division ring E, D need not be contained in E. For example, matrix rings over the complex numbers are finite-dimensional simple algebras over the real numbers.
