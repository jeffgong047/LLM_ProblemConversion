oddness: The fact that the order of the group G is odd is used in several places in the proof, as follows (Thompson 1963). The Hallâ€“Higman theorem is sharper for groups of odd order. For groups of odd order, all non-principal characters occur in complex conjugate pairs. Several results about p-groups only hold for odd primes p. If a group of odd order has no elementary abelian subgroups of rank 3, then its derived group is nilpotent. (This fails for the symmetric group S4 of even order.) Several arguments involving character theory fail for small primes, especially for the prime 2.
