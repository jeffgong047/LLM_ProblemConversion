proof: Many mathematicians have simplified parts of the original Feitâ€“Thompson proof. However all of these improvements are in some sense local; the global structure of the argument is still the same, but some of the details of the arguments have been simplified. The simplified proof has been published in two books: (Bender & Glauberman 1994), which covers everything except the character theory, and (Peterfalvi 2000, part I), which covers the character theory. This revised proof is still very hard, and is longer than the original proof, but is written in a more leisurely style. A fully formal proof, checked with the Coq proof assistant, was announced in September 2012 by Georges Gonthier and fellow researchers at Microsoft Research and Inria.[1] An outline of the
