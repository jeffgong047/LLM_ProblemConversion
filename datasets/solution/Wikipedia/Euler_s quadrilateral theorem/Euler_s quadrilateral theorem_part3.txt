extensions: Euler's theorem with parallelogram Euler originally derived the theorem above as corollary from slightly different theorem that requires the introduction of an additional point, but provides more structural insight. For a given convex quadrilateral ABCD Euler introduced an additional point E such that ABED forms a parallelogram and then the following equality holds: |AB|2+|BC|2+|CD|2+|AD|2=|AC|2+|BD|2+|CE|2|AB|^2+|BC|^2+|CD|^2+|AD|^2=|AC|^2+|BD|^2+|CE|^2 The distance |CE||CE| between the additional point E and the point C of the quadrilateral not being part of the parallelogram can be thought of measuring how much the quadrilateral deviates from a parallelogram and |CE|2|CE|^2 is correction term that needs to be added to the original equation of the parallelogram law.[2] M being the midpoint of AC yields |AC||AM|=2|AC||AM|=2. Since N is the midpoint of BD it is also the midpoint of AE, as AE and BD are both diagonals of the parallelogram ABED. This yields |AE||AN|=2|AE||AN|=2 and hence |AC||AM|=|AE||AN||AC||AM|=|AE||AN|. Therefore, it follows from the intercept theorem (and its converse) that CE and NM are parallel and |CE|2=(2|NM|)2=4|NM|2|CE|^2=(2|NM|)^2=4|NM|^2, which yields Euler's theorem.[2] Euler's theorem can be extended to a larger set of quadrilaterals, that includes crossed and nonplaner ones. It holds for so called generalized quadrilaterals, which simply consist of four arbitrary points in Rn‚Ñù^n connected by edges so that they form a cycle graph.[3]
