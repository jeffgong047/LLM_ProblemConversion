Relation between the sides of a convex quadrilateral and its diagonals a2+b2+c2+d2=e2+f2+4g2^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=e^2+f^2+4g^2 Euler's quadrilateral theorem or Euler's law on quadrilaterals, named after Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), describes a relation between the sides of a convex quadrilateral and its diagonals. It is a generalisation of the parallelogram law which in turn can be seen as generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem. Because of the latter the restatement of the Pythagorean theorem in terms of quadrilaterals is occasionally called the Euler–Pythagoras theorem. Theorem and special
