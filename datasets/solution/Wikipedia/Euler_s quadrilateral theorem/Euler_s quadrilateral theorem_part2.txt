cases: For a convex quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d,b,c,d, diagonals e and f, and g being the line segment connecting the midpoints of the two diagonals, the following equations holds: a2+b2+c2+d2=e2+f2+4g2^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=e^2+f^2+4g^2 If the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then the midpoints of the diagonals coincide so that the connecting line segment g has length 0. In addition the parallel sides are of equal length, hence Euler's theorem reduces to 2a2+2b2=e2+f22a^2+2b^2=e^2+f^2 which is the parallelogram law. If the quadrilateral is rectangle, then equation simplifies further since now the two diagonals are of equal length as well: 2a2+2b2=2e22a^2+2b^2=2e^2 Dividing by 2 yields the Eulerâ€“Pythagoras theorem: a2+b2=e2^2+b^2=e^2 In other words, in the case of a rectangle the relation of the quadrilateral's sides and its diagonals is described by the Pythagorean theorem.[1] Alternative formulation and
