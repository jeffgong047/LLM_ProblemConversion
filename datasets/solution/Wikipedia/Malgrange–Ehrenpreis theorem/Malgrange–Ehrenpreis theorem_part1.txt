In mathematics, the Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem states that every non-zero linear differential operator with constant coefficients has a Green's function. It was first proved independently by Leon Ehrenpreis (1954, 1955) and Bernard Malgrange (1955–1956). This means that the differential equation P(∂∂x1,…,∂∂xℓ)u(x)=δ(x),(∂/_1,…,∂/_ℓ)u(𝐱)=δ(𝐱), where P is a polynomial in several variables and δ is the Dirac delta function, has a distributional solution u. It can be used to show that P(∂∂x1,…,∂∂xℓ)u(x)=f(x)(∂/_1,…,∂/_ℓ)u(𝐱)=f(𝐱) has a solution for any compactly supported distribution f. The solution is not unique in general. The analogue for differential operators whose coefficients are polynomials (rather than constants) is false: see Lewy's example.
