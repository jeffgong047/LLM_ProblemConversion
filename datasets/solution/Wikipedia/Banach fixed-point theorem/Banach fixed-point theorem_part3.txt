Proof: Let x0∈X_0 be arbitrary and define a sequence (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ by setting xn = T(xn−1). We first note that for all n∈N,∈ℕ, we have the inequality d(xn+1,xn)≤qnd(x1,x0).(x_n+1,x_n)≦^nd(x_1,x_0). This follows by induction on n, using the fact that T is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ is a Cauchy sequence. In particular, let m,n∈N,n∈ℕ such that m > n: d(xm,xn)≤d(xm,xm−1)+d(xm−1,xm−2)+⋯+d(xn+1,xn)≤qm−1d(x1,x0)+qm−2d(x1,x0)+⋯+qnd(x1,x0)=qnd(x1,x0)∑k=0m−n−1qk≤qnd(x1,x0)∑k=0∞qk=qnd(x1,x0)(11−q).d(x_m,x_n) (x_m,x_m-1)+d(x_m-1,x_m-2)+⋯+d(x_n+1,x_n) ≦^m-1d(x_1,x_0)+q^m-2d(x_1,x_0)+⋯+q^nd(x_1,x_0) =q^nd(x_1,x_0)∑_k=0^m-n-1q^k ≦^nd(x_1,x_0)∑_k=0^∞q^k =q^nd(x_1,x_0)(1/1-q). Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Since q ∈ [0, 1), we can find a large N∈N∈ℕ so that qN<ε(1−q)d(x1,x0).^N<ε(1-q)/d(x_1,x_0). Therefore, by choosing m and n greater than N we may write: d(xm,xn)≤qnd(x1,x0)(11−q)<(ε(1−q)d(x1,x0))d(x1,x0)(11−q)=ε.(x_m,x_n)≦^nd(x_1,x_0)(1/1-q)<(ε(1-q)/d(x_1,x_0))d(x_1,x_0)(1/1-q)=ε. This proves that the sequence (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ is Cauchy. By completeness of (X,d), the sequence has a limit x∗∈X.^*. Furthermore, x∗^* must be a fixed point of T: x∗=limn→∞xn=limn→∞T(xn−1)=T(limn→∞xn−1)=T(x∗).^*=lim_n→∞x_n=lim_n→∞T(x_n-1)=T(lim_n→∞x_n-1)=T(x^*). As a contraction mapping, T is continuous, so bringing the limit inside T was justified. Lastly, T cannot have more than one fixed point in (X,d), since any pair of distinct fixed points p1 and p2 would contradict the contraction of T: d(T(p1),T(p2))=d(p1,p2)>qd(p1,p2).(T(p_1),T(p_2))=d(p_1,p_2)>qd(p_1,p_2).
