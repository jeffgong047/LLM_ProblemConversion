Generalizations: There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries).[9] Let T : X → X be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are: Assume that some iterate Tn of T is a contraction. Then T has a unique fixed point. Assume that for each n, there exist cn such that d(Tn(x), Tn(y)) ≤ cnd(x, y) for all x and y, and that ∑ncn<∞.∑_nc_n<∞. Then T has a unique fixed point. In applications, the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map T a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for generalizations. A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of metric space, e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric.[10] Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.[11] See
