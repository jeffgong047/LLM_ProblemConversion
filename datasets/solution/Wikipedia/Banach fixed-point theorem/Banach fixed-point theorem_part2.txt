Statement: Definition. Let (X,d)(X,d) be a metric space. Then a map T:X→X:X is called a contraction mapping on X if there exists q∈[0,1)∈[0,1) such that d(T(x),T(y))≤qd(x,y)(T(x),T(y))(x,y) for all x,y∈X.,y. Banach Fixed Point Theorem. Let (X,d)(X,d) be a non-empty complete metric space with a contraction mapping T:X→X.:X. Then T admits a unique fixed-point x∗^* in X (i.e. T(x∗)=x∗(x^*)=x^*). Furthermore, x∗^* can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element x0∈X_0 and define a sequence (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ by xn=T(xn−1)_n=T(x_n-1) for n≥1.≥1. Then limn→∞xn=x∗lim_n→∞x_n=x^*. Remark 1. The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the speed of convergence: d(x∗,xn)≤qn1−qd(x1,x0),d(x∗,xn+1)≤q1−qd(xn+1,xn),d(x∗,xn+1)≤qd(x∗,xn).d(x^*,x_n) ≤q^n/1-qd(x_1,x_0), d(x^*,x_n+1) ≤q/1-qd(x_n+1,x_n), d(x^*,x_n+1) (x^*,x_n). Any such value of q is called a Lipschitz constant for T, and the smallest one is sometimes called "the best Lipschitz constant" of T. Remark 2. d(T(x),T(y))<d(x,y)(T(x),T(y))<d(x,y) for all x≠y is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map T:[1,∞)→[1,∞),T(x)=x+1x,:[1,∞)→[1,∞), T(x)=x+1x , which lacks a fixed point. However, if X is compact, then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of d(x,T(x))(x,T(x)), indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of T. It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of T. Remark 3. When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define X properly so that T(X)⊆X.(X).
