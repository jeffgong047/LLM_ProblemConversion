Converses: Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to Czesław Bessaga, from 1959: Let f : X → X be a map of an abstract set such that each iterate fn has a unique fixed point. Let q∈(0,1),∈(0,1), then there exists a complete metric on X such that f is contractive, and q is the contraction constant. Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if f:X→X:X is a map on a T1 topological space with a unique fixed point a, such that for each x∈X we have fn(x) → a, then there already exists a metric on X with respect to which f satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2.[8] In this case the metric is in fact an ultrametric.
