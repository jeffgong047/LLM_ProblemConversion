In mathematics, the Browder–Minty theorem (sometimes called the Minty–Browder theorem) states that a bounded, continuous, coercive and monotone function T from a real, separable reflexive Banach space X into its continuous dual space X∗ is automatically surjective. That is, for each continuous linear functional g ∈ X∗, there exists a solution u ∈ X of the equation T(u) = g. (Note that T itself is not required to be a linear map.) The theorem is named in honor of Felix Browder and George J. Minty, who independently proved it.[1] See
