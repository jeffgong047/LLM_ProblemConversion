Example: Let G be the free group with two generators a,b,b, and let H be the subgroup consisting of all reduced words of even length (products of an even number of letters a,b,a−1,b−1,b,a^-1,b^-1). Then H is generated by its six elements p=aa,q=ab,r=ba,s=bb,t=ab−1,u=a−1b.=aa,=ab,=̊ba,=bb,=ab^-1,=̆a^-1b. A factorization of any reduced word in H into these generators and their inverses may be constructed simply by taking consecutive pairs of letters in the reduced word. However, this is not a free presentation of H because the last three generators can be written in terms of the first three as s=rp−1q,t=pr−1,u=p−1q=rp^-1q,=pr^-1,=̆p^-1q. Rather, H is generated as a free group by the three elements p=aa,q=ab,r=ba,=aa,=ab,=̊ba, which have no relations among them; or instead by several other triples of the six generators.[5] Further, G is free on n = 2 generators, H has index e = [G : H] = 2 in G, and H is free on 1 + e(n–1) = 3 generators. The Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that like H, every subgroup of a free group can be generated as a free group, and if the index of H is finite, its rank is given by the index formula.
