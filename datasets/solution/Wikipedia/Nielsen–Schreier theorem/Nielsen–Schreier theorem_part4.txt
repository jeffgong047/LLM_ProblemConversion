Proof: The free group G = π1(X) has n = 2 generators corresponding to loops a,b from the base point P in X. The subgroup H of even-length words, with index e = [G : H] = 2, corresponds to the covering graph Y with two vertices corresponding to the cosets H and H' = aH = bH = a−1H = b−1H, and two lifted edges for each of the original loop-edges a,b. Contracting one of the edges of Y gives a homotopy equivalence to a bouquet of three circles, so that H = π1(Y) is a free group on three generators, for example aa, ab, ba. A short proof of the Nielsen–Schreier theorem uses the algebraic topology of fundamental groups and covering spaces.[1] A free group G on a set of generators is the fundamental group of a bouquet of circles, a topological graph X with a single vertex and with a loop-edge for each generator.[6] Any subgroup H of the fundamental group is itself the fundamental group of a connected covering space Y → X. The space Y is a (possibly infinite) topological graph, the Schreier coset graph having one vertex for each coset in G/H.[7] In any connected topological graph, it is possible to shrink the edges of a spanning tree of the graph, producing a bouquet of circles that has the same fundamental group H. Since H is the fundamental group of a bouquet of circles, it is itself free.[6] Simplicial homology allows the computation of the rank of H, which is equal to h1(Y), the first Betti number of the covering space, the number of independent cycles. For G free of rank n, the graph X has n edges and 1 vertex; assuming H has finite index [G : H] = e, the covering graph Y has en edges and e vertices. The first Betti number of a graph is equal to the number of edges, minus the number of vertices, plus the number of connected components; hence the rank of H is: h1(Y)=en−e+1=1+e(n−1)._1(Y) = en-e+1 = 1+e(n-1). This proof is due to Reinhold Baer and Friedrich Levi (1936); the original proof by Schreier forms the Schreier graph in a different way as a quotient of the Cayley graph of G modulo the action of H.[8] According to Schreier's subgroup lemma, a set of generators for a free presentation of H may be constructed from cycles in the covering graph formed by concatenating a spanning tree path from a base point (the coset of the identity) to one of the cosets, a single non-tree edge, and an inverse spanning tree path from the other endpoint of the edge back to the base point.[9][8] Axiomatic
