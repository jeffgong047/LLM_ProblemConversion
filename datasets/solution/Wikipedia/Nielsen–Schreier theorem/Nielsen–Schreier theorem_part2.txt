theorem: A free group may be defined from a group presentation consisting of a set of generators with no relations. That is, every element is a product of some sequence of generators and their inverses, but these elements do not obey any equations except those trivially following from gg−1 = 1. The elements of a free group may be described as all possible reduced words, those strings of generators and their inverses in which no generator is adjacent to its own inverse. Two reduced words may be multiplied by concatenating them and then removing any generator-inverse pairs that result from the concatenation. The Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that if H is a subgroup of a free group G, then H is itself isomorphic to a free group. That is, there exists a set S of elements which generate H, with no nontrivial relations among the elements of S. The Nielsen–Schreier formula, or Schreier index formula, quantifies the result in the case where the subgroup has finite index: if G is a free group of rank n (free on n generators), and H is a subgroup of finite index [G : H] = e, then H is free of rank 1+e(n−1)1+e(n-1).[4]
