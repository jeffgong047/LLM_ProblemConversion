2: The previous lemma shows that A(x) can cover every possible point in the space using a small set of translations. Complementary to this, for x ∉ L only a small fraction of the space is covered by S=⋃iA(x)⊕ti=⋃_iA(x)_i. We have: |S||R|≤|r|⋅|A(x)||R|≤|r|⋅2−|x|<1|S|/|R|≤|r|·|A(x)|/|R|≤|r|·2^-|x|<1 because |r||r| is polynomial in |x||x|.
