Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time is contained in the polynomial time hierarchy In computational complexity theory, the Sipser–Lautemann theorem or Sipser–Gács–Lautemann theorem states that bounded-error probabilistic polynomial (BPP) time is contained in the polynomial time hierarchy, and more specifically Σ2 ∩ Π2. In 1983, Michael Sipser showed that BPP is contained in the polynomial time hierarchy.[1] Péter Gács showed that BPP is actually contained in Σ2 ∩ Π2. Clemens Lautemann contributed by giving a simple proof of BPP’s membership in Σ2 ∩ Π2, also in 1983.[2] It is conjectured that in fact BPP=P, which is a much stronger statement than the Sipser–Lautemann theorem.
