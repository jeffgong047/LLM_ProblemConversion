Conclusion: The lemmas show that language membership of a language in BPP can be expressed as a Σ2 expression, as follows. x∈L⟺∃t1,t2,…,t|r|∀r∈R⋁1≤i≤|r|(M(x,r⊕ti)accepts)._1,t_2,…,t_|r| ⋁_1≤|r|(M(x,r_i)accepts). That is, x is in language L if and only if there exist |r||r| binary vectors, where for all random bit vectors r, TM M accepts at least one random vector ⊕ ti. The above expression is in Σ2 in that it is first existentially then universally quantified. Therefore BPP ⊆ Σ2. Because BPP is closed under complement, this proves BPP ⊆ Σ2 ∩ Π2. Stronger
