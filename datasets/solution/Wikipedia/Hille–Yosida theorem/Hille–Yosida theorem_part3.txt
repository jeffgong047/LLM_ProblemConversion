theorem: Let A be a linear operator defined on a linear subspace D(A) of the Banach space X, ω a real number, and M > 0. Then A generates a strongly continuous semigroup T that satisfies ‖T(t)‖≤MeωtT(t)e^ if and only if[1] A is closed and D(A) is dense in X, every real λ > ω belongs to the resolvent set of A and for such λ and for all positive integers n, ‖(λI−A)−n‖≤M(λ−ω)n.(-A)^-n≤M/(λ-ω)^n.
