definitions: Main article: C0-semigroup If X is a Banach space, a one-parameter semigroup of operators on X is a family of operators indexed on the non-negative real numbers {T(t)} t ∈ [0, ∞) such that T(0)=I(0)=I T(s+t)=T(s)∘T(t),∀t,s≥0.(s+t)=T(s)(t), ,s≥0. The semigroup is said to be strongly continuous, also called a (C0) semigroup, if and only if the mapping t↦T(t)x(t)x is continuous for all x ∈ X, where [0, ∞) has the usual topology and X has the norm topology. The infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter semigroup T is an operator A defined on a possibly proper subspace of X as follows: The domain of A is the set of x ∈ X such that h−1(T(h)x−x)^-1(T(h)x-x) has a limit as h approaches 0 from the right. The value of Ax is the value of the above limit. In other words, Ax is the right-derivative at 0 of the function t↦T(t)x.(t)x. The infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup is a closed linear operator defined on a dense linear subspace of X. The Hille–Yosida theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a closed linear operator A on a Banach space to be the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup.
