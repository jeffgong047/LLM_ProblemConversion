geometry: In differential geometry, Schur's theorem compares the distance between the endpoints of a space curve C∗^* to the distance between the endpoints of a corresponding plane curve C of less curvature. Suppose C(s)(s) is a plane curve with curvature κ(s)κ(s) which makes a convex curve when closed by the chord connecting its endpoints, and C∗(s)^*(s) is a curve of the same length with curvature κ∗(s)κ^*(s). Let d denote the distance between the endpoints of C and d∗^* denote the distance between the endpoints of C∗^*. If κ∗(s)≤κ(s)κ^*(s)≤κ(s) then d∗≥d^*. Schur's theorem is usually stated for C2^2 curves, but John M. Sullivan has observed that Schur's theorem applies to curves of finite total curvature (the statement is slightly different). Linear
