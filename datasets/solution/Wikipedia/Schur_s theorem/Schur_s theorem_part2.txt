theory: The Wikibook Combinatorics has a page on the topic of: Proof of Schur's theorem In Ramsey theory, Schur's theorem states that for any partition of the positive integers into a finite number of parts, one of the parts contains three integers x, y, z with x+y=z.+y=z. For every positive integer c, S(c) denotes the smallest number S such that for every partition of the integers 1,…,S(c){1,…,S(c)} into c parts, one of the parts contains integers x, y, and z with x+y=z+y=z. Schur's theorem ensures that S(c) is well-defined for every positive integer c. The numbers of the form S(c) are called Schur's number. Folkman's theorem generalizes Schur's theorem by stating that there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers, all of whose nonempty sums belong to the same part. Using this definition, the only known Schur numbers are S(n) = 2, 5, 14, 45, and 161 (OEIS: A030126) The proof that S(5) = 161 was announced in 2017 and took up 2 petabytes of space.[1][2]
