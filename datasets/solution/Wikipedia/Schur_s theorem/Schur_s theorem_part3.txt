Combinatorics: In combinatorics, Schur's theorem tells the number of ways for expressing a given number as a (non-negative, integer) linear combination of a fixed set of relatively prime numbers. In particular, if a1,…,an{a_1,…,a_n} is a set of integers such that gcd(a1,…,an)=1(a_1,…,a_n)=1, the number of different tuples of non-negative integer numbers (c1,…,cn)(c_1,…,c_n) such that x=c1a1+⋯+cnan=c_1a_1+⋯+c_na_n when x goes to infinity is: xn−1(n−1)!a1⋯an(1+o(1)).x^n-1/(n-1)!a_1_n(1+o(1)). As a result, for every set of relatively prime numbers a1,…,an{a_1,…,a_n} there exists a value of x such that every larger number is representable as a linear combination of a1,…,an{a_1,…,a_n} in at least one way. This consequence of the theorem can be recast in a familiar context considering the problem of changing an amount using a set of coins. If the denominations of the coins are relatively prime numbers (such as 2 and 5) then any sufficiently large amount can be changed using only these coins. (See Coin problem.) Differential
