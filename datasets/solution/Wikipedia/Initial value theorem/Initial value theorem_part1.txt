In mathematical analysis, the initial value theorem is a theorem used to relate frequency domain expressions to the time domain behavior as time approaches zero.[1] Let F(s)=∫0∞f(t)e−stdt(s)=∫_0^∞f(t)e^-st dt be the (one-sided) Laplace transform of ƒ(t). If f is bounded on (0,∞)(0,∞) (or if just f(t)=O(ect)(t)=O(e^ct)) and limt→0+f(t)lim_t→0^+f(t) exists then the initial value theorem says[2] limt→0f(t)=lims→∞sF(s).lim_t → 0f(t)=lim_s→∞sF(s).
