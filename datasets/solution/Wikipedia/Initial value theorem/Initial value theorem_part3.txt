bounded: Suppose first that f is bounded, i.e. limt→0+f(t)=αlim_t→0^+f(t)=α. A change of variable in the integral ∫0∞f(t)e−stdt∫_0^∞f(t)e^-st dt shows that sF(s)=∫0∞f(ts)e−tdt(s)=∫_0^∞f(t/s)e^-t dt. Since f is bounded, the Dominated Convergence Theorem implies that lims→∞sF(s)=∫0∞αe−tdt=α.lim_s→∞sF(s)=∫_0^∞^-t dt=α. Proof using elementary calculus and assuming that function is
