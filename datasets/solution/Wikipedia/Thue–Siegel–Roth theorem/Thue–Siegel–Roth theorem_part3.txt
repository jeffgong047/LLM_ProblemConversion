Discussion: The first result in this direction is Liouville's theorem on approximation of algebraic numbers, which gives an approximation exponent of d for an algebraic number α of degree d ≥ 2. This is already enough to demonstrate the existence of transcendental numbers. Thue realised that an exponent less than d would have applications to the solution of Diophantine equations and in Thue's theorem from 1909 established an exponent d/2+1+ε/2+1+ε which he applied to prove the finiteness of the solutions of Thue equation. Siegel's theorem improves this to an exponent about 2√d, and Dyson's theorem of 1947 has exponent about √2d. Roth's result with exponent 2 is in some sense the best possible, because this statement would fail on setting ε=0ε=0: by Dirichlet's theorem on diophantine approximation there are infinitely many solutions in this case. However, there is a stronger conjecture of Serge Lang that |α−pq|<1q2log⁡(q)1+ε|α-p/q|<1/q^2log(q)^1+ε can have only finitely many solutions in integers p and q. If one lets α run over the whole of the set of real numbers, not just the algebraic reals, then both Roth's conclusion and Lang's hold for almost all αα. So both the theorem and the conjecture assert that a certain countable set misses a certain set of measure zero.[1] The theorem is not currently effective: that is, there is no bound known on the possible values of p,q given αα.[2] Davenport & Roth (1955) showed that Roth's techniques could be used to give an effective bound for the number of p/q satisfying the inequality, using a "gap" principle.[2] The fact that we do not actually know C(ε) means that the project of solving the equation, or bounding the size of the solutions, is out of reach.
