Statement: Roth's theorem states that every irrational algebraic number αα has approximation exponent equal to 2. This means that, for every ε>0ε>0, the inequality |α−pq|<1q2+ε|α-p/q|<1/q^2+ε can have only finitely many solutions in coprime integers p and q. Roth's proof of this fact resolved a conjecture by Siegel. It follows that every irrational algebraic number α satisfies |α−pq|>C(α,ε)q2+ε|α-p/q|>C(α,ε)/q^2+ε with C(α,ε)(α,ε) a positive number depending only on ε>0ε>0 and αα.
