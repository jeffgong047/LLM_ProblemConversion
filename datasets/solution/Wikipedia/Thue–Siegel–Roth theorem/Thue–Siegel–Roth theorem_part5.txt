Generalizations: There is a higher-dimensional version, Schmidt's subspace theorem, of the basic result. There are also numerous extensions, for example using the p-adic metric,[3] based on the Roth method. William J. LeVeque generalized the result by showing that a similar bound holds when the approximating numbers are taken from a fixed algebraic number field. Define the height H(ξ) of an algebraic number ξ to be the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of its minimal polynomial. Fix κ>2. For a given algebraic number α and algebraic number field K, the equation |α−ξ|<1H(ξ)κ|α-ξ|<1/H(ξ)^κ has only finitely many solutions in elements ξ of K.[4] See
