theorem: Preparation: Assume that μμ does not take the value −∞-∞ (otherwise decompose according to −μ-μ). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set A∈Σ∈Σ such that μ(B)≤0μ(B)≤0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆A. Claim: Suppose that D∈Σ∈Σ satisfies μ(D)≤0μ(D)≤0. Then there is a negative set A⊆D such that μ(A)≤μ(D)μ(A)≤μ(D). Proof of the claim: Define A0:=D_0:=D. Inductively assume for n∈N0∈ℕ_0 that An⊆D_n has been constructed. Let tn:=sup(μ(B)∣B∈ΣandB⊆An)_n:=sup({μ(B)∈Σ and B_n}) denote the supremum of μ(B)μ(B) over all the ΣΣ-measurable subsets B of An_n. This supremum might a priori be infinite. As the empty set ∅∅ is a possible candidate for B in the definition of tn_n, and as μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0, we have tn≥0_n≥0. By the definition of tn_n, there then exists a ΣΣ-measurable subset Bn⊆An_n_n satisfying μ(Bn)≥min(1,tn2).μ(B_n)≥min(1,t_n/2). Set An+1:=An∖Bn_n+1:=A_n_n to finish the induction step. Finally, define A:=Dn=0∞Bn.:=D\⋃_n=0^∞B_n. As the sets (Bn)n=0∞(B_n)_n=0^∞ are disjoint subsets of D, it follows from the sigma additivity of the signed measure μμ that μ(D)=μ(A)+∑n=0∞μ(Bn)≥μ(A)+∑n=0∞min(1,tn2)≥μ(A).μ(D)=μ(A)+∑_n=0^∞μ(B_n)≥μ(A)+∑_n=0^∞min(1,t_n/2)≥μ(A). This shows that μ(A)≤μ(D)μ(A)≤μ(D). Assume A were not a negative set. This means that there would exist a ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆A that satisfies μ(B)>0μ(B)>0. Then tn≥μ(B)_n≥μ(B) for every n∈N0∈ℕ_0, so the series on the right would have to diverge to +∞+∞, implying that μ(D)=+∞μ(D)=+∞, which is a contradiction, since μ(D)≤0μ(D)≤0. Therefore, A must be a negative set. Construction of the decomposition: Set N0=∅_0=∅. Inductively, given Nn_n, define sn:=inf(μ(D)∣D∈ΣandD⊆X∖Nn)._n:=inf({μ(D)∈Σ and D_n}). as the infimum of μ(D)μ(D) over all the ΣΣ-measurable subsets D of X∖Nn_n. This infimum might a priori be −∞-∞. As ∅∅ is a possible candidate for D in the definition of sn_n, and as μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0, we have sn≤0_n≤0. Hence, there exists a ΣΣ-measurable subset Dn⊆X∖Nn_n_n such that μ(Dn)≤max(sn2,−1)≤0.μ(D_n)≤max(s_n/2,-1)≤0. By the claim above, there is a negative set An⊆Dn_n_n such that μ(An)≤μ(Dn)μ(A_n)≤μ(D_n). Set Nn+1:=Nn∪An_n+1:=N_n_n to finish the induction step. Finally, define N:=⋃n=0∞An.:=⋃_n=0^∞A_n. As the sets (An)n=0∞(A_n)_n=0^∞ are disjoint, we have for every ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆N that μ(B)=∑n=0∞μ(B∩An)μ(B)=∑_n=0^∞μ(B_n) by the sigma additivity of μμ. In particular, this shows that N is a negative set. Next, define P:=X∖N:=X. If P were not a positive set, there would exist a ΣΣ-measurable subset D⊆P with μ(D)<0μ(D)<0. Then sn≤μ(D)_n≤μ(D) for all n∈N0∈ℕ_0 and[clarification needed] μ(N)=∑n=0∞μ(An)≤∑n=0∞max(sn2,−1)=−∞,μ(N)=∑_n=0^∞μ(A_n)≤∑_n=0^∞max(s_n/2,-1)=-∞, which is not allowed for μμ. Therefore, P is a positive set. Proof of the uniqueness statement: Suppose that (N′,P′)(N',P') is another Hahn decomposition of X. Then P∩N′' is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to N∩P′'. As P△P′=N△N′=(P∩N′)∪(N∩P′),'=N'=(P')∪(N'), this completes the proof. Q.E.D.
