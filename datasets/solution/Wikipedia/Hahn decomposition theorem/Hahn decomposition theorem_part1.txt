Measurability theorem In mathematics, the Hahn decomposition theorem, named after the Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn, states that for any measurable space (X,Σ)(X,Σ) and any signed measure μμ defined on the σσ-algebra ΣΣ, there exist two ΣΣ-measurable sets, P and N, of X such that: P∪N=X=X and P∩N=∅=∅. For every E∈Σ∈Σ such that E⊆P, one has μ(E)≥0μ(E)≥0, i.e., P is a positive set for μμ. For every E∈Σ∈Σ such that E⊆N, one has μ(E)≤0μ(E)≤0, i.e., N is a negative set for μμ. Moreover, this decomposition is essentially unique, meaning that for any other pair (P′,N′)(P',N') of ΣΣ-measurable subsets of X fulfilling the three conditions above, the symmetric differences P△P′' and N△N′' are μμ-null sets in the strong sense that every ΣΣ-measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair (P,N)(P,N) is then called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μμ. Jordan measure
