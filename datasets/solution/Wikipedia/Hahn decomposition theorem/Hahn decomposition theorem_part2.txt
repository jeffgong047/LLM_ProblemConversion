decomposition: A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem, which states that every signed measure μμ defined on ΣΣ has a unique decomposition into a difference μ=μ+−μ−μ=μ^+-μ^- of two positive measures, μ+μ^+ and μ−μ^-, at least one of which is finite, such that μ+(E)=0μ^+(E)=0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset E⊆N and μ−(E)=0μ^-(E)=0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset E⊆P, for any Hahn decomposition (P,N)(P,N) of μμ. We call μ+μ^+ and μ−μ^- the positive and negative part of μμ, respectively. The pair (μ+,μ−)(μ^+,μ^-) is called a Jordan decomposition (or sometimes Hahn–Jordan decomposition) of μμ. The two measures can be defined as μ+(E):=μ(E∩P)andμ−(E):=−μ(E∩N)μ^+(E):=μ(E) and μ^-(E):=-μ(E) for every E∈Σ∈Σ and any Hahn decomposition (P,N)(P,N) of μμ. Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique. The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition (μ+,μ−)(μ^+,μ^-) of a finite signed measure μμ, one has μ+(E)=supB∈Σ,B⊆Eμ(B)andμ−(E)=−infB∈Σ,B⊆Eμ(B)μ^+(E)=sup_B∈Σ, Bμ(B) and μ^-(E)=-inf_B∈Σ, Bμ(B) for any E in ΣΣ. Furthermore, if μ=ν+−ν−μ=ν^+-ν^- for a pair (ν+,ν−)(ν^+,ν^-) of finite non-negative measures on X, then ν+≥μ+andν−≥μ−.ν^+≥μ^+ and ν^-≥μ^-. The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the minimal decomposition of μμ into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the minimality property of the Jordan decomposition. Proof of the Jordan decomposition: For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see Fischer (2012). Proof of the Hahn decomposition
