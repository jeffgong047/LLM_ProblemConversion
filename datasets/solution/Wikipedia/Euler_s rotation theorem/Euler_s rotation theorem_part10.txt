theory: In order to prove the previous equation some facts from matrix theory must be recalled. An m × m matrix A has m orthogonal eigenvectors if and only if A is normal, that is, if A†A = AA†.[b] This result is equivalent to stating that normal matrices can be brought to diagonal form by a unitary similarity transformation: AU=Udiag⁡(α1,…,αm)⟺U†AU=diag⁡(α1,…,αm),𝐀𝐔=𝐔 diag(α_1,…,α_m) ⟺ 𝐔^†𝐀𝐔=diag(α_1,…,α_m), and U is unitary, that is, U†=U−1.𝐔^†=𝐔^-1. The eigenvalues α1, ..., αm are roots of the characteristic equation. If the matrix A happens to be unitary (and note that unitary matrices are normal), then (U†AU)†=diag⁡(α1∗,…,αm∗)=U†A−1U=diag⁡(1α1,…,1αm)(𝐔^†𝐀𝐔)^†=diag(α_1^*,…,α_m^*)=𝐔^†𝐀^-1𝐔=diag(1/α_1,…,1/α_m) and it follows that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are on the unit circle in the complex plane: αk∗=1αk⟺αk∗αk=|αk|2=1,k=1,…,m.α_k^*=1/α_k ⟺ α_k^*α_k=|α_k|^2=1,=1,…,m. Also an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix has eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex plane. Moreover, since its characteristic equation (an mth order polynomial in λ) has real coefficients, it follows that its roots appear in complex conjugate pairs, that is, if α is a root then so is α∗. There are 3 roots, thus at least one of them must be purely real (+1 or −1). After recollection of these general facts from matrix theory, we return to the rotation matrix R. It follows from its realness and orthogonality that we can find a U such that: RU=U(eiϕ000e−iϕ000±1)𝐑𝐔=𝐔[ e^iϕ 0 0; 0 e^-iϕ 0; 0 0 ±1; ] If a matrix U can be found that gives the above form, and there is only one purely real component and it is −1, then we define R𝐑 to be an improper rotation. Let us only consider the case, then, of matrices R that are proper rotations (the third eigenvalue is just 1). The third column of the 3 × 3 matrix U will then be equal to the invariant vector n. Writing u1 and u2 for the first two columns of U, this equation gives Ru1=eiϕu1andRu2=e−iϕu2.𝐑𝐮_1=e^iϕ 𝐮_1 and 𝐑𝐮_2=e^-iϕ 𝐮_2. If u1 has eigenvalue 1, then φ = 0 and u2 has also eigenvalue 1, which implies that in that case R = I. In general, however, as (R−eiϕI)u1=0(𝐑-e^iϕ𝐈)𝐮_1=0 implies that also (R−e−iϕI)u1∗=0(𝐑-e^-iϕ𝐈)𝐮_1^*=0 holds, so u2=u1∗𝐮_2=𝐮_1^* can be chosen for u2𝐮_2. Similarly, (R−I)u3=0(𝐑-𝐈)𝐮_3=0 can result in a u3𝐮_3 with real entries only, for a proper rotation matrix R𝐑. Finally, the matrix equation is transformed by means of a unitary matrix, RU(12i2012−i20001)=U(12i2012−i20001)(12120−i2i20001)⏟=I(eiϕ000e−iϕ0001)(12i2012−i20001)𝐑𝐔[ 1/√(2) i/√(2) 0; 1/√(2) -i/√(2) 0; 0 0 1; ]=𝐔[ 1/√(2) i/√(2) 0; 1/√(2) -i/√(2) 0; 0 0 1; ][ 1/√(2) 1/√(2) 0; -i/√(2) i/√(2) 0; 0 0 1; ]_= 𝐈[ e^iϕ 0 0; 0 e^-iϕ 0; 0 0 1; ][ 1/√(2) i/√(2) 0; 1/√(2) -i/√(2) 0; 0 0 1; ] which gives U′†RU′=(cos⁡ϕ−sin⁡ϕ0sin⁡ϕcos⁡ϕ0001)withU′=U(12i2012−i20001).𝐔'^†𝐑𝐔'=[ cosϕ -sinϕ 0; sinϕ cosϕ 0; 0 0 1; ] with 𝐔'=𝐔[ 1/√(2) i/√(2) 0; 1/√(2) -i/√(2) 0; 0 0 1; ]. The columns of U′ are orthonormal as it is a unitary matrix with real-valued entries only, due to its definition above, that u1𝐮_1 is the complex conjugate of u2𝐮_2 and that u3𝐮_3 is a vector with real-valued components. The third column is still u3=𝐮_3= n, the other two columns of U′ are perpendicular to n. We can now see how our definition of improper rotation corresponds with the geometric interpretation: an improper rotation is a rotation around an axis (here, the axis corresponding to the third coordinate) and a reflection on a plane perpendicular to that axis. If we only restrict ourselves to matrices with determinant 1, we can thus see that they must be proper rotations. This result implies that any orthogonal matrix R corresponding to a proper rotation is equivalent to a rotation over an angle φ around an axis n. Equivalence
