matrix: Two matrices (representing linear maps) are said to be equivalent if there is a change of basis that makes one equal to the other. A proper orthogonal matrix is always equivalent (in this sense) to either the following matrix or to its vertical reflection: R∼(cos⁡ϕ−sin⁡ϕ0sin⁡ϕcos⁡ϕ0001),0≤ϕ≤2π.𝐑∼[ cosϕ -sinϕ 0; sinϕ cosϕ 0; 0 0 1; ], 0≤ϕ≤2π. Then, any orthogonal matrix is either a rotation or an improper rotation. A general orthogonal matrix has only one real eigenvalue, either +1 or −1. When it is +1 the matrix is a rotation. When −1, the matrix is an improper rotation. If R has more than one invariant vector then φ = 0 and R = I. Any vector is an invariant vector of I. Excursion into matrix
