Generalizations: See also: Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space In higher dimensions, any rigid motion that preserves a point in dimension 2n or 2n + 1 is a composition of at most n rotations in orthogonal planes of rotation, though these planes need not be uniquely determined, and a rigid motion may fix multiple axes. Also, any rigid motion that preserves n linearly independent points, which span an n-dimensional body in dimension 2n or 2n + 1, is a single plane of rotation. To put it another way, if two rigid bodies, with identical geometry, share at least n points of 'identical' locations within themselves, the convex hull of which is n-dimensional, then a single planar rotation can bring one to cover the other accurately in dimension 2n or 2n + 1. A screw motion. A rigid motion in three dimensions that does not necessarily fix a point is a "screw motion". This is because a composition of a rotation with a translation perpendicular to the axis is a rotation about a parallel axis, while composition with a translation parallel to the axis yields a screw motion; see screw axis. This gives rise to screw theory. See
