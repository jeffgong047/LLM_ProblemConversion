transformation: Now let us suppose that O′ is the image of O. Then we know ∠αAO = ∠AaO′ and orientation is preserved,[a] so O′ must be interior to ∠αAa. Now AO is transformed to aO′, so AO = aO′. Since AO is also the same length as aO, ∠AaO = ∠aAO. But ∠aAO = ∠AaO′, so ∠AaO = ∠AaO′ and therefore O′ is the same point as O. In other words, O is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing O is the axis of rotation. Final notes about the
