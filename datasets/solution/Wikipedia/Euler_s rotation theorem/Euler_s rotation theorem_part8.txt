proof: A spatial rotation is a linear map in one-to-one correspondence with a 3 × 3 rotation matrix R that transforms a coordinate vector x into X, that is Rx = X. Therefore, another version of Euler's theorem is that for every rotation R, there is a nonzero vector n for which Rn = n; this is exactly the claim that n is an eigenvector of R associated with the eigenvalue 1. Hence it suffices to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of R; the rotation axis of R will be the line μn, where n is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. A rotation matrix has the fundamental property that its inverse is its transpose, that is RTR=RRT=I,𝐑^𝖳𝐑=𝐑𝐑^𝖳=𝐈, where I is the 3 × 3 identity matrix and superscript T indicates the transposed matrix. Compute the determinant of this relation to find that a rotation matrix has determinant ±1. In particular, 1=det(I)=det(RTR)=det(RT)det(R)=det(R)2⟹det(R)=±1.1=(𝐈) =(𝐑^𝖳𝐑)=(𝐑^𝖳)(𝐑)=(𝐑)^2 ⟹ (𝐑) =±1. A rotation matrix with determinant +1 is a proper rotation, and one with a negative determinant −1 is an improper rotation, that is a reflection combined with a proper rotation. It will now be shown that a proper rotation matrix R has at least one invariant vector n, i.e., Rn = n. Because this requires that (R − I)n = 0, we see that the vector n must be an eigenvector of the matrix R with eigenvalue λ = 1. Thus, this is equivalent to showing that det(R − I) = 0. Use the two relations det(−A)=(−1)3det(A)=−det(A)(-𝐀)=(-1)^3(𝐀)=-(𝐀) for any 3 × 3 matrix A and det(R−1)=1(𝐑^-1)=1 (since det(R) = 1) to compute det(R−I)=det((R−I)T)=det(RT−I)=det(R−1−R−1R)=det(R−1(I−R))=det(R−1)det(−(R−I))=−det(R−I)⟹0=det(R−I). (𝐑-𝐈)=((𝐑-𝐈)^𝖳) = (𝐑^𝖳-𝐈)=(𝐑^-1-𝐑^-1𝐑) = (𝐑^-1(𝐈-𝐑))=(𝐑^-1) (-(𝐑-𝐈)) = -(𝐑-𝐈) ⟹= (𝐑-𝐈). This shows that λ = 1 is a root (solution) of the characteristic equation, that is, det(R−λI)=0forλ=1.(𝐑-λ𝐈)=0 for λ=1. In other words, the matrix R − I is singular and has a non-zero kernel, that is, there is at least one non-zero vector, say n, for which (R−I)n=0⟺Rn=n.(𝐑-𝐈)𝐧=0 ⟺ 𝐑𝐧=𝐧. The line μn for real μ is invariant under R, i.e., μn is a rotation axis. This proves Euler's theorem. Equivalence of an orthogonal matrix to a rotation
