Notes: ^ Orientation is preserved in the sense that if αA is rotated about A counterclockwise to align with OA, then Aa must be rotated about a counterclockwise to align with O′a. Likewise if the rotations are clockwise. ^ The dagger symbol † stands for complex conjugation followed by transposition. For real matrices complex conjugation does nothing and daggering a real matrix is the same as transposing it.
