(1776): Euler states the theorem as follows:[1] Theorema. Quomodocunque sphaera circa centrum suum conuertatur, semper assignari potest diameter, cuius directio in situ translato conueniat cum situ initiali. or (in English): When a sphere is moved around its centre it is always possible to find a diameter whose direction in the displaced position is the same as in the initial position. Figure 1: Blue great circle on sphere transforms into red great circle when rotated about diameter through O.
