rotations: Main articles: Rotation matrix, Rotation group SO(3), and Infinitesimal transformation Suppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector [x, y, z], and suppose we have an infinitely small rotation of angle Δθ about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first order approach, the rotation matrix ΔR is represented as: ΔR=[100010001]+[0z−y−z0xy−x0]Δθ=I+AΔθ.=[ 1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1 ]+[ 0 z -y; -z 0 x; y -x 0 ] Δθ=𝐈+𝐀 Δθ. A finite rotation through angle θ about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating Δθ as θ/N where N is a large number, a rotation of θ about the axis may be represented as: R=(1+AθN)N≈eAθ.=(1+𝐀θ/N)^N^𝐀θ. It can be seen that Euler's theorem essentially states that all rotations may be represented in this form. The product Aθ is the "generator" of the particular rotation, being the vector (x,y,z) associated with the matrix A. This shows that the rotation matrix and the axis–angle format are related by the exponential function. One can derive a simple expression for the generator G. One starts with an arbitrary plane (in Euclidean space) defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors a and b. In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector x with perpendicular y. One then solves for y in terms of x and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix R which includes the generator G = baT − abT. x=acos⁡α+bsin⁡αy=−asin⁡α+bcos⁡αcos⁡α=aTxsin⁡α=bTxy=−abTx+baTx=(baT−abT)xx′=xcos⁡β+ysin⁡β=(Icos⁡β+(baT−abT)sin⁡β)xR=Icos⁡β+(baT−abT)sin⁡β=Icos⁡β+Gsin⁡βG=baT−abT𝐱 =𝐚cosα+𝐛sinα 𝐲 =-𝐚sinα+𝐛cosα cosα =𝐚^𝖳𝐱 sinα =𝐛^𝖳𝐱 𝐲 =-𝐚𝐛^𝖳𝐱+𝐛𝐚^𝖳𝐱=(𝐛𝐚^𝖳-𝐚𝐛^𝖳)𝐱 𝐱' =𝐱cosβ+𝐲sinβ =(𝐈cosβ+(𝐛𝐚^𝖳-𝐚𝐛^𝖳)sinβ)𝐱 𝐑 =𝐈cosβ+(𝐛𝐚^𝖳-𝐚𝐛^𝖳)sinβ =𝐈cosβ+𝐆sinβ 𝐆 =𝐛𝐚^𝖳-𝐚𝐛^𝖳 To include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for R by including two projection operators that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an exponential function.

Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the Lie algebra of the rotation group.
