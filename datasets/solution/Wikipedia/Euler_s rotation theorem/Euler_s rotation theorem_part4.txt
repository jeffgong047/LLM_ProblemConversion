analysis: To arrive at a proof, Euler analyses what the situation would look like if the theorem were true. To that end, suppose the yellow line in Figure 1 goes through the center of the sphere and is the axis of rotation we are looking for, and point O is one of the two intersection points of that axis with the sphere. Then he considers an arbitrary great circle that does not contain O (the blue circle), and its image after rotation (the red circle), which is another great circle not containing O. He labels a point on their intersection as point A. (If the circles coincide, then A can be taken as any point on either; otherwise A is one of the two points of intersection.) Figure 2: Arcs connecting preimage α and image a of A with bisector AO of the angle at A. Now A is on the initial circle (the blue circle), so its image will be on the transported circle (red). He labels that image as point a. Since A is also on the transported circle (red), it is the image of another point that was on the initial circle (blue) and he labels that preimage as α (see Figure 2). Then he considers the two arcs joining α and a to A. These arcs have the same length because arc αA is mapped onto arc Aa. Also, since O is a fixed point, triangle αOA is mapped onto triangle AOa, so these triangles are isosceles, and arc AO bisects angle ∠αAa. Figure 3: O goes to O′, but O′ must coincide with O.
