theorem: A product of creation and annihilation operators A^B^C^D^E^F^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂… can be expressed as A^B^C^D^E^F^…=:A^B^C^D^E^F^…:+∑singles:A^∙B^∙C^D^E^F^…:+∑doubles:A^∙B^∙∙C^∙∙D^∙E^F^…:+…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂… =:ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…: +∑_singles:Â^∙B̂^∙ĈD̂ÊF̂…: +∑_doubles:Â^∙B̂^∙∙Ĉ^∙∙D̂^∙ÊF̂…: +… In other words, a string of creation and annihilation operators can be rewritten as the normal-ordered product of the string, plus the normal-ordered product after all single contractions among operator pairs, plus all double contractions, etc., plus all full contractions. Applying the theorem to the above examples provides a much quicker method to arrive at the final expressions. A warning: In terms on the right hand side containing multiple contractions care must be taken when the operators are fermionic. In this case an appropriate minus sign must be introduced according to the following rule: rearrange the operators (introducing minus signs whenever the order of two fermionic operators is swapped) to ensure the contracted terms are adjacent in the string. The contraction can then be applied (See "Rule C" in Wick's paper). Example: If we have two fermions (N=2=2) with creation and annihilation operators f^i†f̂_i^† and f^if̂_i (i=1,2=1,2) then f^1f^2f^1†f^2†=:f^1f^2f^1†f^2†:−f^1∙f^1†∙:f^2f^2†:+f^1∙f^2†∙:f^2f^1†:+f^2∙f^1†∙:f^1f^2†:−f^2∙f^2†∙:f^1f^1†:−f^1∙∙f^1†∙∙f^2∙f^2†∙+f^1∙∙f^2†∙∙f^2∙f^1†∙f̂_1 f̂_2 f̂_1^† f̂_2^† = :f̂_1 f̂_2 f̂_1^† f̂_2^† : - f̂_1^∙ f̂_1^†∙ :f̂_2 f̂_2^† :+ f̂_1^∙ f̂_2^†∙ :f̂_2 f̂_1^† :+ f̂_2^∙ f̂_1^†∙ :f̂_1 f̂_2^† :-f̂_2^∙ f̂_2^†∙ :f̂_1 f̂_1^† : -f̂_1^∙∙ f̂_1^†∙∙ f̂_2^∙ f̂_2^†∙ +f̂_1^∙∙ f̂_2^†∙∙ f̂_2^∙ f̂_1^†∙ Note that the term with contractions of the two creation operators and of the two annihilation operators is not included because their contractions vanish.
