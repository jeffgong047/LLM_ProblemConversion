contraction: For two operators A^Â and B^B̂ we define their contraction to be A^∙B^∙≡A^B^−:A^B^:Â^∙ B̂^∙≡Â B̂ -:Â B̂: where :O^::Ô: denotes the normal order of an operator O^Ô. Alternatively, contractions can be denoted by a line joining A^Â and B^B̂, like A^B^⊓⊓ÂB̂. We shall look in detail at four special cases where A^Â and B^B̂ are equal to creation and annihilation operators. For N particles we'll denote the creation operators by a^i†â_i^† and the annihilation operators by a^iâ_i (i=1,2,3,…,N)(i=1,2,3,…,N). They satisfy the commutation relations for bosonic operators [a^i,a^j†]=δij[â_i,â_j^†]=δ_ij, or the anti-commutation relations for fermionic operators a^i,a^j†=δij{â_i,â_j^†}=δ_ij where δijδ_ij denotes the Kronecker delta. We then have a^i∙a^j∙=a^ia^j−:a^ia^j:=0â_i^∙ â_j^∙=â_i â_j -: â_i â_j : =0 a^i†∙a^j†∙=a^i†a^j†−:a^i†a^j†:=0â_i^†∙ â_j^†∙=â_i^† â_j^† - :â_i^† â_j^† : =0 a^i†∙a^j∙=a^i†a^j−:a^i†a^j:=0â_i^†∙ â_j^∙=â_i^† â_j -: â_i^† â_j : =0 a^i∙a^j†∙=a^ia^j†−:a^ia^j†:=δijâ_i^∙ â_j^†∙=â_i â_j^† -: â_i â_j^† : =δ_ij where i,j=1,…,N,j=1,…,N. These relationships hold true for bosonic operators or fermionic operators because of the way normal ordering is defined.
