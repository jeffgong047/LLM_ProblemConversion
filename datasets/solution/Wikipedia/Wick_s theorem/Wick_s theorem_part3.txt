Examples: We can use contractions and normal ordering to express any product of creation and annihilation operators as a sum of normal ordered terms. This is the basis of Wick's theorem. Before stating the theorem fully we shall look at some examples. Suppose a^iâ_i and a^i†â_i^† are bosonic operators satisfying the commutation relations: [a^i†,a^j†]=0[â_i^†,â_j^†]=0 [a^i,a^j]=0[â_i,â_j]=0 [a^i,a^j†]=δij[â_i,â_j^†]=δ_ij where i,j=1,…,N,j=1,…,N, [A^,B^]≡A^B^−B^A^[Â,B̂]≡ÂB̂-B̂Â denotes the commutator, and δijδ_ij is the Kronecker delta. We can use these relations, and the above definition of contraction, to express products of a^iâ_i and a^i†â_i^† in other ways. Example
