Proof: We use induction to prove the theorem for bosonic creation and annihilation operators. The N=2=2 base case is trivial, because there is only one possible contraction: A^B^=:A^B^:+(A^B^−:A^B^:)=:A^B^:+A^∙B^∙ÂB̂=:ÂB̂:+(Â B̂ -:Â B̂:)=:ÂB̂:+Â^∙B̂^∙ In general, the only non-zero contractions are between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right. Suppose that Wick's theorem is true for N−1-1 operators B^C^D^E^F^…B̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…, and consider the effect of adding an Nth operator A^Â to the left of B^C^D^E^F^…B̂ĈD̂ÊF̂… to form A^B^C^D^E^F^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…. By Wick's theorem applied to N−1-1 operators, we have: A^B^C^D^E^F^…=A^:B^C^D^E^F^…:+A^∑singles:B^∙C^∙D^E^F^…:+A^∑doubles:B^∙C^∙∙D^∙∙E^∙F^…:+A^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂… =Â:B̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…: +Â∑_singles:B̂^∙Ĉ^∙D̂ÊF̂…: +Â∑_doubles:B̂^∙Ĉ^∙∙D̂^∙∙Ê^∙F̂…: +Â… A^Â is either a creation operator or an annihilation operator. If A^Â is a creation operator, all above products, such as A^:B^C^D^E^F^…:Â:B̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…:, are already normal ordered and require no further manipulation. Because A^Â is to the left of all annihilation operators in A^B^C^D^E^F^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…, any contraction involving it will be zero. Thus, we can add all contractions involving A^Â to the sums without changing their value. Therefore, if A^Â is a creation operator, Wick's theorem holds for A^B^C^D^E^F^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…. Now, suppose that A^Â is an annihilation operator. To move A^Â from the left-hand side to the right-hand side of all the products, we repeatedly swap A^Â with the operator immediately right of it (call it X^X̂), each time applying A^X^=:A^X^:+A^∙X^∙ÂX̂=:ÂX̂:+Â^∙X̂^∙ to account for noncommutativity. Once we do this, all terms will be normal ordered. All terms added to the sums by pushing A^Â through the products correspond to additional contractions involving A^Â. Therefore, if A^Â is an annihilation operator, Wick's theorem holds for A^B^C^D^E^F^…ÂB̂ĈD̂ÊF̂…. We have proved the base case and the induction step, so the theorem is true. By introducing the appropriate minus signs, the proof can be extended to fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The theorem applied to fields is proved in essentially the same way.[3] Wick's theorem applied to
