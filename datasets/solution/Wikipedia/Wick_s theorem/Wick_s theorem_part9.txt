fields: The correlation function that appears in quantum field theory can be expressed by a contraction on the field operators: C(x1,x2)=⟨0∣Tϕi(x1)ϕi(x2)∣0⟩=⟨0∣ϕi(x1)ϕi(x2)¯∣0⟩=iΔF(x1−x2)=i∫d4k(2π)4e−ik(x1−x2)(k2−m2)+iϵ,𝒞(x_1,x_2)=⟨0|𝒯ϕ_i(x_1)ϕ_i(x_2)|0⟩=⟨0|ϕ_i(x_1)ϕ_i(x_2)|0⟩=iΔ_F(x_1-x_2)=i∫d^4k/(2π)^4e^-ik(x_1-x_2)/(k^2-m^2)+iϵ, where the operator ϕi(x1)ϕi(x2)¯ϕ_i(x_1)ϕ_i(x_2) are the amount that do not annihilate the vacuum state |0⟩|0⟩. Which means that AB¯=TAB−:TAB:AB=𝒯AB-:𝒯AB:. This means that AB¯AB is a contraction over TAB𝒯AB. Note that the contraction of a time-ordered string of two field operators is a C-number. In the end, we arrive at Wick's theorem: The T-product of a time-ordered free fields string can be expressed in the following manner: T∏k=1mϕ(xk)=:T∏ϕi(xk):+∑α,βϕ(xα)ϕ(xβ)¯:T∏k≠α,βϕi(xk):+𝒯∏_k=1^mϕ(x_k)=:𝒯∏ϕ_i(x_k):+∑_α,βϕ(x_α)ϕ(x_β):𝒯∏_k≠α,βϕ_i(x_k):+ +∑(α,β),(γ,δ)ϕ(xα)ϕ(xβ)¯ϕ(xγ)ϕ(xδ)¯:T∏k≠α,β,γ,δϕi(xk):+⋯.+∑_(α,β),(γ,δ)ϕ(x_α)ϕ(x_β) ϕ(x_γ)ϕ(x_δ):𝒯∏_k≠α,β,γ,δϕ_i(x_k):+⋯. Applying this theorem to S-matrix elements, we discover that normal-ordered terms acting on vacuum state give a null contribution to the sum. We conclude that m is even and only completely contracted terms remain. Fmi(x)=⟨0∣Tϕi(x1)ϕi(x2)∣0⟩=∑pairsϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)¯⋯ϕ(xm−1)ϕ(xm¯)_m^i(x)=⟨0|𝒯ϕ_i(x_1)ϕ_i(x_2)|0⟩=∑_pairsϕ(x_1)ϕ(x_2)⋯ϕ(x_m-1)ϕ(x_m) Gp(n)=⟨0∣T:vi(y1):⋯:vi(yn):ϕi(x1)⋯ϕi(xp)∣0⟩_p^(n)=⟨0|𝒯:v_i(y_1):…:v_i(y_n):ϕ_i(x_1)⋯ϕ_i(x_p)|0⟩ where p is the number of interaction fields (or, equivalently, the number of interacting particles) and n is the development order (or the number of vertices of interaction). For example, if v=gy4⇒:vi(y1):=:ϕi(y1)ϕi(y1)ϕi(y1)ϕi(y1):=gy^4⇒:v_i(y_1):=:ϕ_i(y_1)ϕ_i(y_1)ϕ_i(y_1)ϕ_i(y_1): This is analogous to the corresponding Isserlis' theorem in statistics for the moments of a Gaussian distribution. Note that this discussion is in terms of the usual definition of normal ordering which is appropriate for the vacuum expectation values (VEV's) of fields. (Wick's theorem provides as a way of expressing VEV's of n fields in terms of VEV's of two fields.[4]) There are any other possible definitions of normal ordering, and Wick's theorem is valid irrespective. However Wick's theorem only simplifies computations if the definition of normal ordering used is changed to match the type of expectation value wanted. That is we always want the expectation value of the normal ordered product to be zero. For instance in thermal field theory a different type of expectation value, a thermal trace over the density matrix, requires a different definition of normal ordering.[5] See
