G(k): G(3) is at least 4 (since cubes are congruent to 0, 1 or −1 mod 9); for numbers less than 1.3×109, 1290740 is the last to require 6 cubes, and the number of numbers between N and 2N requiring 5 cubes drops off with increasing N at sufficient speed to have people believe that G(3) = 4;[14] the largest number now known not to be a sum of 4 cubes is 7373170279850,[15] and the authors give reasonable arguments there that this may be the largest possible. The upper bound G(3) ≤ 7 is due to Linnik in 1943.[16] (All nonnegative integers require at most 9 cubes, and the largest integers requiring 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 cubes are conjectured to be 239, 454, 8042, 1290740 and 7373170279850, respectively.) 13792 is the largest number to require 17 fourth powers (Deshouillers, Hennecart and Landreau showed in 2000[17] that every number between 13793 and 10245 required at most 16, and Kawada, Wooley and Deshouillers extended[citation needed] Davenport's 1939 result to show that every number above 10220 required no more than 16). Numbers of the form 31·16n always require 16 fourth powers. 68578904422 is the last known number that requires 9 fifth powers (Integer sequence S001057, Tony D. Noe, Jul 04 2017), 617597724 is the last number less than 1.3×109 that requires 10 fifth powers, and 51033617 is the last number less than 1.3×109 that requires 11. The upper bounds on the right with k = 5, 6, ..., 20 are due to Vaughan and Wooley.[18] Using his improved Hardy-Littlewood method, I. M. Vinogradov published numerous refinements leading to G(k)≤k(3log⁡k+11)(k)(3+11) in 1947[citation needed] and, ultimately, G(k)≤k(2log⁡k+2log⁡log⁡k+Clog⁡log⁡log⁡k)(k)(2+2log+Cloglog) for an unspecified constant C and sufficiently large k in 1959[citation needed]. Applying his p-adic form of the Hardy–Littlewood–Ramanujan–Vinogradov method to estimating trigonometric sums, in which the summation is taken over numbers with small prime divisors, Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba obtained[19] (1985) a new estimate of the Hardy function G(k)(k) (for k≥400≥400): G(k)<2klog⁡k+2klog⁡log⁡k+12k.(k)<2k+2klog+12k. Further refinements were obtained by Vaughan in 1989[citation needed]. Wooley then established that for some constant C,[20] G(k)≤klog⁡k+klog⁡log⁡k+Ck.(k)+klog+Ck. Vaughan and Wooley have written a comprehensive survey article.[18] See
