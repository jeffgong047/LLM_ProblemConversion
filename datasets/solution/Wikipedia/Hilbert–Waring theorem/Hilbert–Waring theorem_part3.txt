g(k): For every k, let g(k)(k) denote the minimum number s of kth powers of naturals needed to represent all positive integers. Every positive integer is the sum of one first power, itself, so g(1)=1(1)=1. Some simple computations show that 7 requires 4 squares, 23 requires 9 cubes,[2] and 79 requires 19 fourth powers; these examples show that g(2)≥4(2)≥4, g(3)≥9(3)≥9, and g(4)≥19(4)≥19. Waring conjectured that these lower bounds were in fact exact values. Lagrange's four-square theorem of 1770 states that every natural number is the sum of at most four squares. Since three squares are not enough, this theorem establishes g(2)=4(2)=4. Lagrange's four-square theorem was conjectured in Bachet's 1621 edition of Diophantus's Arithmetica; Fermat claimed to have a proof, but did not publish it.[3] Over the years various bounds were established, using increasingly sophisticated and complex proof techniques. For example, Liouville showed that g(4)(4) is at most 53. Hardy and Littlewood showed that all sufficiently large numbers are the sum of at most 19 fourth powers. That g(3)=9(3)=9 was established from 1909 to 1912 by Wieferich[4] and A. J. Kempner,[5] g(4)=19(4)=19 in 1986 by R. Balasubramanian, F. Dress, and J.-M. Deshouillers,[6][7] g(5)=37(5)=37 in 1964 by Chen Jingrun, and g(6)=73(6)=73 in 1940 by Pillai.[8] Let ⌊x⌋⌋ and x{x} respectively denote the integral and fractional part of a positive real number x. Given the number c=2k⌊(3/2)k⌋−1<3k=2^k⌊(3/2)^k⌋-1<3^k, only 2k2^k and 1k1^k can be used to represent c; the most economical representation requires ⌊(3/2)k⌋−1⌊(3/2)^k⌋-1 terms of 2k2^k and 2k−12^k-1 terms of 1k1^k. It follows that g(k)(k) is at least as large as 2k+⌊(3/2)k⌋−22^k+⌊(3/2)^k⌋-2. This was noted by J. A. Euler, the son of Leonhard Euler, in about 1772.[9] Later work by Dickson, Pillai, Rubugunday, Niven[10] and many others has proved that g(k)=2k+⌊(3/2)k⌋−2if2k(3/2)k+⌊(3/2)k⌋≤2k,2k+⌊(3/2)k⌋+⌊(4/3)k⌋−2if2k(3/2)k+⌊(3/2)k⌋>2kand⌊(4/3)k⌋⌊(3/2)k⌋+⌊(4/3)k⌋+⌊(3/2)k⌋=2k,2k+⌊(3/2)k⌋+⌊(4/3)k⌋−3if2k(3/2)k+⌊(3/2)k⌋>2kand⌊(4/3)k⌋⌊(3/2)k⌋+⌊(4/3)k⌋+⌊(3/2)k⌋>2k.(k)=2^k+⌊(3/2)^k⌋-2 if 2^k{(3/2)^k}+⌊(3/2)^k⌋≤2^k, 2^k+⌊(3/2)^k⌋+⌊(4/3)^k⌋-2 if 2^k{(3/2)^k}+⌊(3/2)^k⌋>2^kand⌊(4/3)^k⌋⌊(3/2)^k⌋+⌊(4/3)^k⌋+⌊(3/2)^k⌋=2^k, 2^k+⌊(3/2)^k⌋+⌊(4/3)^k⌋-3 if 2^k{(3/2)^k}+⌊(3/2)^k⌋>2^kand⌊(4/3)^k⌋⌊(3/2)^k⌋+⌊(4/3)^k⌋+⌊(3/2)^k⌋>2^k. No value of k is known for which 2k(3/2)k+⌊(3/2)k⌋>2k2^k{(3/2)^k}+⌊(3/2)^k⌋>2^k. Mahler[11] proved that there can only be a finite number of such k, and Kubina and Wunderlich[12] have shown that any such k must satisfy k>471600000>471 600 000. Thus it is conjectured that this never happens, that is, g(k)=2k+⌊(3/2)k⌋−2(k)=2^k+⌊(3/2)^k⌋-2 for every positive integer k. The first few values of g(k)(k) are: 1, 4, 9, 19, 37, 73, 143, 279, 548, 1079, 2132, 4223, 8384, 16673, 33203, 66190, 132055, 263619, 526502, 1051899, ... (sequence A002804 in the OEIS). The number
