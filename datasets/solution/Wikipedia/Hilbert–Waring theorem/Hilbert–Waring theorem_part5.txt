G(k): Bounds 1 = G(1) = 1 4 = G(2) = 4 4 ≤ G(3) ≤ 7 16 = G(4) = 16 6 ≤ G(5) ≤ 17 9 ≤ G(6) ≤ 24 8 ≤ G(7) ≤ 33 32 ≤ G(8) ≤ 42 13 ≤ G(9) ≤ 50 12 ≤ G(10) ≤ 59 12 ≤ G(11) ≤ 67 16 ≤ G(12) ≤ 76 14 ≤ G(13) ≤ 84 15 ≤ G(14) ≤ 92 16 ≤ G(15) ≤ 100 64 ≤ G(16) ≤ 109 18 ≤ G(17) ≤ 117 27 ≤ G(18) ≤ 125 20 ≤ G(19) ≤ 134 25 ≤ G(20) ≤ 142 The number G(k) is greater than or equal to 2r+2 if k = 2r with r ≥ 2, or k = 3 × 2r; pr+1 if p is a prime greater than 2 and k = pr(p − 1); (pr+1 − 1)/2 if p is a prime greater than 2 and k = pr(p − 1)/2; k + 1 for all integers k greater than 1. In the absence of congruence restrictions, a density argument suggests that G(k) should equal k + 1. Upper bounds for
