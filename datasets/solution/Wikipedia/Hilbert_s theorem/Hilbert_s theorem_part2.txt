History: Hilbert's theorem was first treated by David Hilbert in "Über Flächen von konstanter Krümmung" (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2 (1901), 87–99). A different proof was given shortly after by E. Holmgren in "Sur les surfaces à courbure constante négative" (1902). A far-leading generalization was obtained by Nikolai Efimov in 1975.[1]
