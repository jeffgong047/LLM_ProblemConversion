No complete regular surface of constant negative gaussian curvature immerses in R3 In differential geometry, Hilbert's theorem (1901) states that there exists no complete regular surface S of constant negative gaussian curvature K immersed in R3ℝ^3. This theorem answers the question for the negative case of which surfaces in R3ℝ^3 can be obtained by isometrically immersing complete manifolds with constant curvature.
