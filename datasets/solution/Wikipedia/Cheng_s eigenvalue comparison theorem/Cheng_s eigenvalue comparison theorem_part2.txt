Theorem: Let M be a Riemannian manifold with dimension n, and let BM(p, r) be a geodesic ball centered at p with radius r less than the injectivity radius of p ∈ M. For each real number k, let N(k) denote the simply connected space form of dimension n and constant sectional curvature k. Cheng's eigenvalue comparison theorem compares the first eigenvalue λ1(BM(p, r)) of the Dirichlet problem in BM(p, r) with the first eigenvalue in BN(k)(r) for suitable values of k. There are two parts to the theorem: Suppose that KM, the sectional curvature of M, satisfies KM≤k._M. Then λ1(BN(k)(r))≤λ1(BM(p,r)).λ_1(B_N(k)(r))≤λ_1(B_M(p,r)). The second part is a comparison theorem for the Ricci curvature of M: Suppose that the Ricci curvature of M satisfies, for every vector field X, Ric⁡(X,X)≥k(n−1)|X|2.Ric(X,X)(n-1)|X|^2. Then, with the same notation as above, λ1(BN(k)(r))≥λ1(BM(p,r)).λ_1(B_N(k)(r))≥λ_1(B_M(p,r)). S.Y. Cheng used Barta's theorem to derive the eigenvalue comparison theorem. As a special case, if k = −1 and inj(p) = ∞, Cheng’s inequality becomes λ*(N) ≥ λ*(H n(−1)) which is McKean’s inequality.[2] See
