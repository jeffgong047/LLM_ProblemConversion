Application: In quantum information theory, quantum channels, or quantum operations, are defined to be completely positive maps between C*-algebras. Being a classification for all such maps, Stinespring's theorem is important in that context. For example, the uniqueness part of the theorem has been used to classify certain classes of quantum channels. For the comparison of different channels and computation of their mutual fidelities and information another representation of the channels by their "Radon–Nikodym" derivatives introduced by Belavkin is useful. In the finite-dimensional case, Choi's theorem as the tracial variant of the Belavkin's Radon–Nikodym theorem for completely positive maps is also relevant. The operators Vi{V_i} from the expression Φ(a)=∑i=1nmVi∗aVi.Φ(a)=∑_i=1^nmV_i^*aV_i. are called the Kraus operators of Φ. The expression ∑i=1nmVi∗(⋅)Vi∑_i=1^nmV_i^*(·)V_i is sometimes called the operator sum representation of Φ.
