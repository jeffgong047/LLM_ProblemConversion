Uniqueness: Let (π1, V1, K1) and (π2, V2, K2) be two Stinespring representations of a given Φ. Define a partial isometry W : K1 → K2 by Wπ1(a)V1h=π2(a)V2h. Wπ_1(a)V_1h=π_2(a)V_2h. On V1H ⊂ K1, this gives the intertwining relation Wπ1=π2W. Wπ_1=π_2W. In particular, if both Stinespring representations are minimal, W is unitary. Thus minimal Stinespring representations are unique up to a unitary transformation. Some
