Minimality: The triple (π, V, K) is called a Stinespring representation of Φ. A natural question is now whether one can reduce a given Stinespring representation in some sense. Let K1 be the closed linear span of π(A) VH. By property of *-representations in general, K1 is an invariant subspace of π(a) for all a. Also, K1 contains VH. Define π1(a)=π(a)|K1.π_1(a)=π(a)|_K_1. We can compute directly π1(a)π1(b)=π(a)|K1π(b)|K1=π(a)π(b)|K1=π(ab)|K1=π1(ab)π_1(a)π_1(b) =π(a)|_K_1π(b)|_K_1 =π(a)π(b)|_K_1 =π(ab)|_K_1 =π_1(ab) and if k and ℓ lie in K1 ⟨π1(a∗)k,ℓ⟩=⟨π(a∗)k,ℓ⟩=⟨π(a)∗k,ℓ⟩=⟨k,π(a)ℓ⟩=⟨k,π1(a)ℓ⟩=⟨π1(a)∗k,ℓ⟩.⟨π_1(a^*)k,ℓ⟩ =⟨π(a^*)k,ℓ⟩ =⟨π(a)^*k,ℓ⟩ =,π(a)ℓ⟩ =,π_1(a)ℓ⟩ =⟨π_1(a)^*k,ℓ⟩. So (π1, V, K1) is also a Stinespring representation of Φ and has the additional property that K1 is the closed linear span of π(A) V H. Such a representation is called a minimal Stinespring representation.
