proof: We now briefly sketch the proof. Let K=A⊗H=A. For a⊗h,b⊗g∈K,, define ⟨a⊗h,b⊗g⟩K:=⟨Φ(b∗a)h,g⟩H=⟨h,Φ(a∗b)g⟩H,b⟩_K:=⟨Φ(b^*a)h,g⟩_H=,Φ(a^*b)g⟩_H and extend by semi-linearity to all of K. This is a Hermitian sesquilinear form because ΦΦ is compatible with the * operation. Complete positivity of ΦΦ is then used to show that this sesquilinear form is in fact positive semidefinite. Since positive semidefinite Hermitian sesquilinear forms satisfy the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the subset K′=x∈K∣⟨x,x⟩K=0⊂K'={x|,x⟩_K=0} is a subspace. We can remove degeneracy by considering the quotient space K/K′/K'. The completion of this quotient space is then a Hilbert space, also denoted by K. Next define π(a)(b⊗g)=ab⊗gπ(a)(b)=ab and Vh=1A⊗h=1_A. One can check that ππ and V have the desired properties. Notice that V is just the natural algebraic embedding of H into K. One can verify that V∗(a⊗h)=Φ(a)h^∗(a)=Φ(a)h holds. In particular V∗V=Φ(1)^∗V=Φ(1) holds so that V is an isometry if and only if Φ(1)=1Φ(1)=1. In this case H can be embedded, in the Hilbert space sense, into K and V∗^∗, acting on K, becomes the projection onto H. Symbolically, we can write Φ(a)=PHπ(a)|H.Φ(a)=P_H π(a)|_H. In the language of dilation theory, this is to say that Φ(a)Φ(a) is a compression of π(a)π(a). It is therefore a corollary of Stinespring's theorem that every unital completely positive map is the compression of some *-homomorphism.
