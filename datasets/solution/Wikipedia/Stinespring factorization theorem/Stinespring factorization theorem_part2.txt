Formulation: In the case of a unital C*-algebra, the result is as follows: Theorem. Let A be a unital C*-algebra, H be a Hilbert space, and B(H) be the bounded operators on H. For every completely positive Φ:A→B(H),Φ:A(H), there exists a Hilbert space K and a unital *-homomorphism π:A→B(K)π:A(K) such that Φ(a)=V∗π(a)V,Φ(a)=V^∗π(a)V, where V:H→K:H is a bounded operator. Furthermore, we have ‖Φ(1)‖=‖V‖2.Φ(1)=V^2. Informally, one can say that every completely positive map ΦΦ can be "lifted" up to a map of the form V∗(⋅)V^*(·)V. The converse of the theorem is true trivially. So Stinespring's result classifies completely positive maps. Sketch of
