Vertex: This proof is due to Paul Erdős. Take the vertex v of largest degree. Consider the set A of vertices not adjacent to v and the set B of vertices adjacent to v. Now, delete all edges within A and draw all edges between A and B. This increases the number of edges by our maximality assumption and keeps the graph Kr+1_r+1-free. Now, B is Kr_r-free, so the same argument can be repeated on B. Repeating this argument eventually produces a graph in the same form as a Turán graph, which is a collection of independent sets, with edges between each two vertices from different independent sets. A simple calculation shows that the number of edges of this graph is maximized when all independent set sizes are as close to equal as possible.[3][4] Complete Multipartite
