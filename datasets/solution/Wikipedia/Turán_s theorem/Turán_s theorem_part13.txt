Quantities: Another natural extension of Turán's theorem is the following question: if a graph has no Kr+1_r+1s, how many copies of Ka_a can it have? Turán's theorem is the case where a=2=2. Zykov's Theorem answers this question:(Zykov's Theorem) The graph on n vertices with no Kr+1_r+1s and the largest possible number of Ka_as is the Turán graph T(n,r)(n,r)This was first shown by Zykov (1949) using Zykov Symmetrization[1][3]. Since the Turán Graph contains r parts with size around nrn/r, the number of Ka_as in T(n,r)(n,r) is around (ra)(nr)ara(n/r)^a. A paper by Alon and Shikhelman in 2016 gives the following generalization, which is similar to the Erdos-Stone generalization of Turán's theorem:(Alon-Shikhelman, 2016) Let H be a graph with chromatic number χ(H)>aχ(H)>a. The largest possible number of Ka_as in a graph with no copy of H is (1+o(1))(χ(H)−1a)(nχ(H)−1)a.(1+o(1))χ(H)-1a(n/χ(H)-1)^a.[9]As in Erdős–Stone, the Turán graph T(n,χ(H)−1)(n,χ(H)-1) attains the desired number of copies of Ka_a.
