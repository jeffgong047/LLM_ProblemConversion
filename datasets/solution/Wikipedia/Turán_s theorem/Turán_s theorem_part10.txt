theorem: The special case of Turán's theorem for r=2=2 is Mantel's theorem: The maximum number of edges in an n-vertex triangle-free graph is ⌊n2/4⌋.^2/4⌋.[2] In other words, one must delete nearly half of the edges in Kn_n to obtain a triangle-free graph. A strengthened form of Mantel's theorem states that any Hamiltonian graph with at least n2/4^2/4 edges must either be the complete bipartite graph Kn/2,n/2_n/2,n/2 or it must be pancyclic: not only does it contain a triangle, it must also contain cycles of all other possible lengths up to the number of vertices in the graph.[7] Another strengthening of Mantel's theorem states that the edges of every n-vertex graph may be covered by at most ⌊n2/4⌋^2/4⌋ cliques which are either edges or triangles. As a corollary, the graph's intersection number (the minimum number of cliques needed to cover all its edges) is at most ⌊n2/4⌋^2/4⌋.[8]
