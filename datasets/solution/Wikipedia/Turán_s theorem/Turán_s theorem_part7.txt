Lagrangian: This proof is due to Motzkin & Straus (1965). They begin by considering a Kr+1_r+1 free graph with vertices labelled 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, and considering maximizing the functionf(x1,x2,…,xn)=∑i,jadjacentxixj(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)=∑_i,j{adjacentx_ix_jover all nonnegative x1,x2,…,xn_1,x_2,…,x_n with sum 11. This function is known as the Lagrangian of the graph and its edges. The idea behind their proof is that if xi,xj_i,x_j are both nonzero while i,j,j are not adjacent in the graph, the functionf(x1,…,xi−t,…,xj+t,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_i-t,…,x_j+t,…,x_n)is linear in t. Hence, one can either replace (xi,xj)(x_i,x_j) with either (xi+xj,0)(x_i+x_j,0) or (0,xi+xj)(0,x_i+x_j) without decreasing the value of the function. Hence, there is a point with at most r nonzero variables where the function is maximized. Now, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives that the maximal value is at most 12(1−1r)1/2(1-1/r). Plugging in xi=1n_i=1/n for all i gives that the maximal value is at least |E|n2|E|/n^2, giving the desired bound.[3][5] Probabilistic
