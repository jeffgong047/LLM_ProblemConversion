Method: The key claim in this proof was independently found by Caro and Wei. This proof is due to Noga Alon and Joel Spencer, from their book The Probabilistic Method. The proof shows that every graph with degrees d1,d2,…,dn_1,d_2,…,d_n has an independent set of size at leastS=1d1+1+1d2+1+⋯+1dn+1.=1/d_1+1+1/d_2+1+⋯+1/d_n+1.The proof attempts to find such an independent set as follows: Consider a random permutation of the vertices of a Kr+1_r+1-free graph Select every vertex that is adjacent to none of the vertices before it. A vertex of degree d is included in this with probability 1d+11/d+1, so this process gives an average of S vertices in the chosen set. (Zykov Symmetrization) Example of first step. Applying this fact to the complement graph and bounding the size of the chosen set using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality proves Turán's theorem.[3] See Method of conditional probabilities § Turán's theorem for more. (Zykov Symmetrization) Example of second step. Zykov
