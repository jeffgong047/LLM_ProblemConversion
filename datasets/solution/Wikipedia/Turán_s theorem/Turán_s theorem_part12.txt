Subgraphs: Turán's theorem shows that the largest number of edges in a Kr+1_r+1-free graph is (1−1r+o(1))n22(1-1/r+o(1))n^2/2. The Erdős–Stone theorem finds the number of edges up to a o(n2)(n^2) error in all other graphs:(Erdős–Stone) Suppose H is a graph with chromatic number χ(H)χ(H). The largest possible number of edges in a graph where H does not appear as a subgraph is(1−1χ(H)−1+o(1))n22(1-1/χ(H)-1+o(1))n^2/2where the o(1)(1) constant only depends on H. One can see that the Turán graph T(n,χ(H)−1)(n,χ(H)-1) cannot contain any copies of H, so the Turán graph establishes the lower bound. As a Kr+1_r+1 has chromatic number r+1+1, Turán's theorem is the special case in which H is a Kr+1_r+1. The general question of how many edges can be included in a graph without a copy of some H is the forbidden subgraph problem. Maximizing Other
