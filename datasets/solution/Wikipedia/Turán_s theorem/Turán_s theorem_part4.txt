Induction: (Induction on n) An example of sets A and B for r=3=3. (Maximal Degree Vertex) Deleting edges within A and drawing edges between A and B. This was Turán's original proof. Take a Kr+1_r+1-free graph on n vertices with the maximal number of edges. Find a Kr_r (which exists by maximality), and partition the vertices into the set A of the r vertices in the Kr_r and the set B of the n−r-r other vertices. Now, one can bound edges above as follows: There are exactly (r2)r2 edges within A. There are at most (r−1)|B|=(r−1)(n−r)(r-1)|B|=(r-1)(n-r) edges between A and B, since no vertex in B can connect to all of A. The number of edges within B is at most the number of edges of T(n−r,r)(n-r,r) by the inductive hypothesis. Adding these bounds gives the result.[1][3] Maximal Degree
