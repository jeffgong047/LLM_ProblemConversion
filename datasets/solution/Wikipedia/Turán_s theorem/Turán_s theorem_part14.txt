region: Turan's theorem states that if a graph has edge homomorphism density strictly above 1−1r−11-1/r-1, it has a nonzero number of Kr_rs. One could ask the far more general question: if you are given the edge density of a graph, what can you say about the density of Kr_rs? An issue with answering this question is that for a given density, there may be some bound not attained by any graph, but approached by some infinite sequence of graphs. To deal with this, weighted graphs or graphons are often considered. In particular, graphons contain the limit of any infinite sequence of graphs. For a given edge density d, the construction for the largest Kr_r density is as follows:Take a number of vertices N approaching infinity. Pick a set of dN√(d)N of the vertices, and connect two vertices if and only if they are in the chosen set.This gives a Kr_r density of dk/2.^k/2. The construction for the smallest Kr_r density is as follows:Take a number of vertices approaching infinity. Let t be the integer such that 1−1t−1<d≤1−1t1-1/t-1<d≤1-1/t. Take a t-partite graph where all parts but the unique smallest part have the same size, and sizes of the parts are chosen such that the total edge density is d.For d≤1−1r−1≤1-1/r-1, this gives a graph that is (r−1)(r-1)-partite and hence gives no Kr_rs. The lower bound was proven by Razborov (2008)[10] for the case of triangles, and was later generalized to all cliques by Reiher (2016)[11]. The upper bound is a consequence of the Kruskal–Katona theorem [12]. See
