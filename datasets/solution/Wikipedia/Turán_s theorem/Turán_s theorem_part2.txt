Statement: Turán's theorem states that every graph G with n vertices that does not contain Kr+1_r+1 as a subgraph has at most as many edges as the Turán graph T(n,r)(n,r). For a fixed value of r, this graph has(1−1r+o(1))n22(1-1/r+o(1))n^2/2edges, using little-o notation. Intuitively, this means that as n gets larger, the fraction of edges included in T(n,r)(n,r) gets closer and closer to 1−1r1-1/r. Many of the following proofs only give the upper bound of (1−1r)n22(1-1/r)n^2/2.[3]
