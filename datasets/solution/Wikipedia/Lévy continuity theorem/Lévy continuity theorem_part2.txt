Statement: Suppose we have a sequence of random variables Xnn=1∞{X_n}_n=1^∞, not necessarily sharing a common probability space,the sequence of corresponding characteristic functions φnn=1∞{φ_n}_n=1^∞, which by definition are φn(t)=E⁡[eitXn]∀t∈R,∀n∈N,φ_n(t)=E[e^itX_n] ∈ℝ, foralln∈ℕ, where EE is the expected value operator. If the sequence of characteristic functions converges pointwise to some function φφ φn(t)→φ(t)∀t∈R,φ_n(t)→φ(t) ∈ℝ, then the following statements become equivalent: Xn_n converges in distribution to some random variable X Xn→DX,_n{, i.e. the cumulative distribution functions corresponding to random variables converge at every continuity point of the c.d.f. of X;Xnn=1∞{X_n}_n=1^∞ is tight: limx→∞(supnP⁡[|Xn|>x])=0;lim_x→∞(sup_nP[ |X_n|>x ])=0;φ(t)φ(t) is a characteristic function of some random variable X;φ(t)φ(t) is a continuous function of t;φ(t)φ(t) is continuous at t = 0.
