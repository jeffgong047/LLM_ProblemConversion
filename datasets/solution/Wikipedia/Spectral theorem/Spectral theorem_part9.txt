version: An alternative formulation of the spectral theorem says that every bounded self-adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator. The significance of this result is that multiplication operators are in many ways easy to understand. Theorem.[6] — Let A be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H. Then there is a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and a real-valued essentially bounded measurable function f on X and a unitary operator U:H → L2(X, μ) such that U∗TU=A,^*TU=A, where T is the multiplication operator: [Tφ](x)=f(x)φ(x),[Tφ](x)=f(x)φ(x), and ‖T‖=‖f‖∞T=f_∞. The spectral theorem is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called operator theory; see also the spectral measure. There is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now f may be complex-valued. Direct
