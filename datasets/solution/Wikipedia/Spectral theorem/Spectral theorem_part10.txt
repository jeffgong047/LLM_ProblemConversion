integrals: There is also a formulation of the spectral theorem in terms of direct integrals. It is similar to the multiplication-operator formulation, but more canonical. Let A be a bounded self-adjoint operator and let σ(A)σ(A) be the spectrum of A. The direct-integral formulation of the spectral theorem associates two quantities to A. First, a measure μμ on σ(A)σ(A), and second, a family of Hilbert spaces Hλ,λ∈σ(A).{H_λ}, λ∈σ(A). We then form the direct integral Hilbert space ∫R⊕Hλdμ(λ).∫_𝐑^⊕H_λ dμ(λ). The elements of this space are functions (or "sections") s(λ),λ∈σ(A),(λ), λ∈σ(A), such that s(λ)∈Hλ(λ)_λ for all λλ. The direct-integral version of the spectral theorem may be expressed as follows:[7] Theorem — If A is a bounded self-adjoint operator, then A is unitarily equivalent to the "multiplication by λλ" operator on ∫R⊕Hλdμ(λ)∫_𝐑^⊕H_λ dμ(λ) for some measure μμ and some family Hλ{H_λ} of Hilbert spaces. The measure μμ is uniquely determined by A up to measure-theoretic equivalence; that is, any two measure associated to the same A have the same sets of measure zero. The dimensions of the Hilbert spaces Hλ_λ are uniquely determined by A up to a set of μμ-measure zero. The spaces Hλ_λ can be thought of as something like "eigenspaces" for A. Note, however, that unless the one-element set λλ has positive measure, the space Hλ_λ is not actually a subspace of the direct integral. Thus, the Hλ_λ's should be thought of as "generalized eigenspace"—that is, the elements of Hλ_λ are "eigenvectors" that do not actually belong to the Hilbert space. Although both the multiplication-operator and direct integral formulations of the spectral theorem express a self-adjoint operator as unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator, the direct integral approach is more canonical. First, the set over which the direct integral takes place (the spectrum of the operator) is canonical. Second, the function we are multiplying by is canonical in the direct-integral approach: Simply the function λ↦λλ↦λ. Cyclic vectors and simple
