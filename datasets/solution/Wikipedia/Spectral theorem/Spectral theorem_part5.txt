operators: Main article: Compact operator on Hilbert space In the more general setting of Hilbert spaces, which may have an infinite dimension, the statement of the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators is virtually the same as in the finite-dimensional case. Theorem. Suppose A is a compact self-adjoint operator on a (real or complex) Hilbert space V. Then there is an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of A. Each eigenvalue is real. As for Hermitian matrices, the key point is to prove the existence of at least one nonzero eigenvector. One cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. If the compactness assumption is removed, then it is not true that every self-adjoint operator has eigenvectors. For example, the multiplication operator Mx_x on L2([0,1])^2([0,1]) which takes each ψ(x)∈L2([0,1])ψ(x)^2([0,1]) to xψ(x)ψ(x) is bounded and self-adjoint, but has no eigenvectors. However, its spectrum, suitably defined, is still equal to [0,1][0,1], see spectrum of bounded operator. Bounded self-adjoint
