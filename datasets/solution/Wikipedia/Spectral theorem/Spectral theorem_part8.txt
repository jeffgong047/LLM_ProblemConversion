measures: In the absence of (true) eigenvectors, one can look for subspaces consisting of almost eigenvectors. In the above example, for example, where [Aφ](t)=tφ(t),[Aφ](t)=tφ(t), we might consider the subspace of functions supported on a small interval [a,a+ε][a,a+ε] inside [0,1][0,1]. This space is invariant under A and for any φφ in this subspace, Aφφ is very close to aφφ. In this approach to the spectral theorem, if A is a bounded self-adjoint operator, then one looks for large families of such "spectral subspaces".[4] Each subspace, in turn, is encoded by the associated projection operator, and the collection of all the subspaces is then represented by a projection-valued measure. One formulation of the spectral theorem expresses the operator A as an integral of the coordinate function over the operator's spectrum σ(A)σ(A) with respect to a projection-valued measure.[5] A=∫σ(A)λdEλ.=∫_σ(A)λ dE_λ. When the self-adjoint operator in question is compact, this version of the spectral theorem reduces to something similar to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem above, except that the operator is expressed as a finite or countably infinite linear combination of projections, that is, the measure consists only of atoms.
