spectrum: A vector φφ is called a cyclic vector for A if the vectors φ,Aφ,A2φ,…φ,Aφ,A^2φ,… span a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. Suppose A is a bounded self-adjoint operator for which a cyclic vector exists. In that case, there is no distinction between the direct-integral and multiplication-operator formulations of the spectral theorem. Indeed, in that case, there is a measure μμ on the spectrum σ(A)σ(A) of A such that A is unitarily equivalent to the "multiplication by λλ" operator on L2(σ(A),μ)^2(σ(A),μ).[8] This result represents A simultaneously as a multiplication operator and as a direct integral, since L2(σ(A),μ)^2(σ(A),μ) is just a direct integral in which each Hilbert space Hλ_λ is just Cℂ. Not every bounded self-adjoint operator admits a cyclic vector; indeed, by the uniqueness in the direct integral decomposition, this can occur only when all the Hλ_λ's have dimension one. When this happens, we say that A has "simple spectrum" in the sense of spectral multiplicity theory. That is, a bounded self-adjoint operator that admits a cyclic vector should be thought of as the infinite-dimensional generalization of a self-adjoint matrix with distinct eigenvalues (i.e., each eigenvalue has multiplicity one). Although not every A admits a cyclic vector, it is easy to see that we can decompose the Hilbert space as a direct sum of invariant subspaces on which A has a cyclic vector. This observation is the key to the proofs of the multiplication-operator and direct-integral forms of the spectral theorem. Functional
