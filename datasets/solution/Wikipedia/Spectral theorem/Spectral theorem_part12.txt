calculus: One important application of the spectral theorem (in whatever form) is the idea of defining a functional calculus. That is, given a function f defined on the spectrum of A, we wish to define an operator f(A)(A). If f is simply a positive power, f(x)=xn(x)=x^n, then f(A)(A) is just the n-th power of A, An^n. The interesting cases are where f is a nonpolynomial function such as a square root or an exponential. Either of the versions of the spectral theorem provides such a functional calculus.[9] In the direct-integral version, for example, f(A)(A) acts as the "multiplication by f" operator in the direct integral: [f(A)s](λ)=f(λ)s(λ).[f(A)s](λ)=f(λ)s(λ). That is to say, each space Hλ_λ in the direct integral is a (generalized) eigenspace for f(A)(A) with eigenvalue f(λ)(λ). General self-adjoint
