eigenvectors: The next generalization we consider is that of bounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Such operators may have no eigenvalues: for instance let A be the operator of multiplication by t on L2([0,1])^2([0,1]), that is,[3] [Aφ](t)=tφ(t).[Aφ](t)=tφ(t). This operator does not have any eigenvectors in L2([0,1])^2([0,1]), though it does have eigenvectors in a larger space. Namely the distribution φ(t)=δ(t−t0)φ(t)=δ(t-t_0), where δδ is the Dirac delta function, is an eigenvector when construed in an appropriate sense. The Dirac delta function is however not a function in the classical sense and does not lie in the Hilbert space L2[0, 1] or any other Banach space. Thus, the delta-functions are "generalized eigenvectors" of A but not eigenvectors in the usual sense. Spectral subspaces and projection-valued
