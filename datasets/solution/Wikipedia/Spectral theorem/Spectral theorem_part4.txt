matrices: Main article: Normal matrix The spectral theorem extends to a more general class of matrices. Let A be an operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. A is said to be normal if A*A = AA*. One can show that A is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable. Proof: By the Schur decomposition, we can write any matrix as A = UTU*, where U is unitary and T is upper-triangular. If A is normal, then one sees that TT* = T*T. Therefore, T must be diagonal since a normal upper triangular matrix is diagonal (see normal matrix). The converse is obvious. In other words, A is normal if and only if there exists a unitary matrix U such that A=UDUâˆ—,=UDU^*, where D is a diagonal matrix. Then, the entries of the diagonal of D are the eigenvalues of A. The column vectors of U are the eigenvectors of A and they are orthonormal. Unlike the Hermitian case, the entries of D need not be real. Compact self-adjoint
