delay: Takens' theorem is usually used to reconstruct strange attractors out of experimental data, for which there is contamination by noise. As such, the choice of delay time becomes important. Whereas for data without noise, any choice of delay is valid, for noisy data, the attractor would be destroyed by noise for delays chosen badly. The optimal delay is typically around one-tenth to one-half the mean orbital period around the attractor.[4][5] See
