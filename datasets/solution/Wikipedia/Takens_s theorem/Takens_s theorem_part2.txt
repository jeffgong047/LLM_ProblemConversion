version: Suppose the d-dimensional state vector xt_t evolves according to an unknown but continuous and (crucially) deterministic dynamic. Suppose, too, that the one-dimensional observable y is a smooth function of x, and “coupled” to all the components of x. Now at any time we can look not just at the present measurement y(t)(t), but also at observations made at times removed from us by multiples of some lag τ:yt+τ,yt+2ττ:y_t+τ,y_t+2τ, etc. If we use k lags, we have a k-dimensional vector. One might expect that, as the number of lags is increased, the motion in the lagged space will become more and more predictable, and perhaps in the limit k→∞→∞ would become deterministic. In fact, the dynamics of the lagged vectors become deterministic at a finite dimension; not only that, but the deterministic dynamics are completely equivalent to those of the original state space (precisely, they are related by a smooth, invertible change of coordinates, or diffeomorphism). The magic embedding dimension[clarification needed] k is at most 2d+12d+1, and often less.[2][3] Choice of
