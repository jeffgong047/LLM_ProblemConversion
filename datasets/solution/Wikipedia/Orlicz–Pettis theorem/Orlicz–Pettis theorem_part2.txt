theorems: The theorem of Orlicz and Pettis had been strengthened and generalized in many directions. An early survey of this area of research is Kalton's paper.[12] A natural setting for subseries convergence is that of an Abelian topological group X and a representative result of this area of research is the following theorem, called by Kalton the Graves-Labuda-Pachl Theorem.[13][14][15] Theorem. Let X be an Abelian group and α,βα,β two Hausdorff group topologies on X such that (X,β)(X,β) is sequentially complete, α⊂βα⊂β, and the identity j:(X,α)→(X,β):(X,α)→(X,β) is universally measurable. Then the subseries convergence for both topologies αα and ββ is the same. As a consequence, if (X,β)(X,β) is a sequentially complete K-analytic group, then the conclusion of the theorem is true for every Hausdorff group topology αα weaker than ββ. This is a generalization of an analogical result for a sequentially complete analytic group (X,β)(X,β)[16] (in the original statement of the Andersen-Christensen theorem the assumption of sequential completeness is missing[17]), which in turn extends the corresponding theorem of Kalton for a Polish group,[18] a theorem that triggered this series of papers. The limitations for this kind of results are provided by the weak* topology of the Banach space ℓ∞ℓ^∞ and the examples of F-spaces X with separating dual X∗^* such that the weak (i.e., σ(X,X∗)σ(X,X^*)) subseries convergence does not imply the subseries convergence in the F-norm of the space X.[19][20]
