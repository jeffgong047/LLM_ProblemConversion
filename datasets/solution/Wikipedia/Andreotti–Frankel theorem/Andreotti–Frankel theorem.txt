Mathematical theorem of complex manifolds
In mathematics, the Andreotti–Frankel theorem, introduced by Aldo Andreotti and Theodore Frankel (1959), states that if V is a smooth, complex affine variety of complex dimension n or, more generally, if V is any Stein manifold of dimension n, then 
V admits a Morse function with critical points of index at most n, and so V is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex of real dimension at most n. 
Consequently, if V⊆Cr⊆ℂ^r is a closed connected complex submanifold of complex dimension n, then V has the homotopy type of a CW complex of real dimension ≤n.
Therefore

Hi(V;Z)=0,fori>n^i(V;ℤ)=0,fori>n
and

Hi(V;Z)=0,fori>n._i(V;ℤ)=0,fori>n.
This theorem applies in particular to any smooth, complex affine variety of dimension n.
