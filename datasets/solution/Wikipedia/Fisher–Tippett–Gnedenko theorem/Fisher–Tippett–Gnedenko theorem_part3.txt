convergence: The Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem is a statement about the convergence of the limiting distribution G(x)(x) above. The study of conditions for convergence of G to particular cases of the generalized extreme value distribution began with Mises (1936)[3][5][4] and was further developed by Gnedenko (1943).[5] Let F be the distribution function of X, and X1,…,Xn_1,…,X_n an i.i.d. sample thereof. Also let x∗^* be the populational maximum, i.e. x∗=supx∣F(x)<1^*=sup{x(x)<1}. The limiting distribution of the normalized sample maximum, given by G above, will then be:[7] A Fréchet distribution (γ>0γ>0) if and only if x∗=∞^*=∞ and limt→∞1−F(ut)1−F(t)=u−1/|γ|lim_t→∞1-F(ut)/1-F(t)=u^-1/|γ| for all u>0>0. This corresponds to what is called a heavy tail. In this case, possible sequences that will satisfy the theorem conditions are bn=0_n=0 and an=F−1(1−1n)_n=F^-1(1-1/n). A Gumbel distribution (γ=0γ=0), with x∗^* finite or infinite, if and only if limt→x∗1−F(t+uf(t))1−F(t)=e−ulim_t^*1-F(t+uf(t))/1-F(t)=e^-u for all u>0>0 with f(t):=∫tx∗1−F(s)ds1−F(t)(t):=∫_t^x^*1-F(s)ds/1-F(t). Possible sequences here are bn=F−1(1−1n)_n=F^-1(1-1/n) and an=f(F−1(1−1n))_n=f(F^-1(1-1/n)). A Weibull distribution (γ<0γ<0) if and only if x∗^* is finite and limt→0+1−F(x∗−ut)1−F(x∗−t)=u1/|γ|lim_t→0^+1-F(x^*-ut)/1-F(x^*-t)=u^1/|γ| for all u>0>0. Possible sequences here are bn=x∗_n=x^* and an=x∗−F−1(1−1n)_n=x^*-F^-1(1-1/n).
