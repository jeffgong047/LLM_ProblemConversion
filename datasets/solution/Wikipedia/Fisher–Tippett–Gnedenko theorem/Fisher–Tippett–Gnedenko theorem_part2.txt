Statement: Let X1,X2,…,Xn_1,X_2,…,X_n be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function F. Suppose that there exist two sequences of real numbers an>0_n>0 and bn∈R_n∈ℝ such that the following limits converge to a non-degenerate distribution function: limn→∞P(maxX1,…,Xn−bnan≤x)=G(x)lim_n→∞P(max{X_1,…,X_n}-b_n/a_n)=G(x), or equivalently: limn→∞Fn(anx+bn)=G(x)lim_n→∞F^n(a_nx+b_n)=G(x). In such circumstances, the limit distribution G belongs to either the Gumbel, the Fréchet or the Weibull family.[6] In other words, if the limit above converges, then up to a linear change of coordinates G(x)(x) will assume the form:[7] Gγ(x)=exp⁡(−(1+γx)−1/γ),1+γx>0_γ(x)=exp(-(1+γ x)^-1/γ), 1+γ x>0 or else G0(x)=exp⁡(−exp⁡(−x))_0(x)=exp(-exp(-x)) for some parameter γ.γ. This is the cumulative distribution function of the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) with extreme value index γγ. The GEV distribution groups the Gumbel, Fréchet and Weibull distributions into a single one. Note that the second formula (the Gumbel distribution) is the limit of the first as γγ goes to zero.
