Network: A network consists of a finite directed graph N = (V, E), where V denotes the finite set of vertices and E ⊆ V×V is the set of directed edges; a source s ∈ V and a sink t ∈ V; a capacity function, which is a mapping c:E→R+:E→ℝ^+ denoted by cuv or c(u, v) for (u,v) ∈ E. It represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through an edge.
