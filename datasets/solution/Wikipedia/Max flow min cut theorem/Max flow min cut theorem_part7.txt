Example: A maximal flow in a network. Each edge is labeled with f/c, where f is the flow over the edge and c is the edge's capacity. The flow value is 5. There are several minimal s-t cuts with capacity 5; one is S={s,p} and T={o, q, r, t}. The figure on the right shows a flow in a network. The numerical annotation on each arrow, in the form f/c, indicates the flow (f) and the capacity (c) of the arrow. The flows emanating from the source total five (2+3=5), as do the flows into the sink (2+3=5), establishing that the flow's value is 5. One s-t cut with value 5 is given by S={s,p} and T={o, q, r, t}. The capacities of the edges that cross this cut are 3 and 2, giving a cut capacity of 3+2=5. (The arrow from o to p is not considered, as it points from T back to S.) The value of the flow is equal to the capacity of the cut, showing that the flow is a maximal flow and the cut is a minimal cut. Note that the flow through each of the two arrows that connect S to T is at full capacity; this is always the case: a minimal cut represents a 'bottleneck' of the system. Linear program
