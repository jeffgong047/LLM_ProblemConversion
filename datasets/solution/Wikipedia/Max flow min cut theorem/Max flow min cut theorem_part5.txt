Cuts: The other half of the max-flow min-cut theorem refers to a different aspect of a network: the collection of cuts. An s-t cut C = (S, T) is a partition of V such that s ∈ S and t ∈ T. That is, an s-t cut is a division of the vertices of the network into two parts, with the source in one part and the sink in the other. The cut-set XC_C of a cut C is the set of edges that connect the source part of the cut to the sink part: XC:=(u,v)∈E:u∈S,v∈T=(S×T)∩E._C:={(u,v) ,v}=(S). Thus, if all the edges in the cut-set of C are removed, then no positive flow is possible, because there is no path in the resulting graph from the source to the sink. The capacity of an s-t cut is the sum of the capacities of the edges in its cut-set, c(S,T)=∑(u,v)∈XCcuv=∑(i,j)∈Ecijdij,(S,T)=∑_(u,v)_Cc_uv=∑_(i,j)c_ijd_ij, where dij=1_ij=1 if i∈S and j∈T, 00 otherwise. There are typically many cuts in a graph, but cuts with smaller weights are often more difficult to find. Minimum s-t Cut Problem. Minimize c(S, T), that is, determine S and T such that the capacity of the s-t cut is minimal. Main
