theorem: See also: Cederbaum's maximum flow theorem The maximum flow problem can be formulated as the maximization of the electrical current through a network composed of nonlinear resistive elements.[4] In this formulation, the limit of the current Iin between the input terminals of the electrical network as the input voltage Vin approaches ∞∞, is equal to the weight of the minimum-weight cut set. limVin→∞(Iin)=minXC∑(u,v)∈XCcuvlim_V_in→∞(I_in)=min_X_C∑_(u,v)_Cc_uv Generalized max-flow min-cut
