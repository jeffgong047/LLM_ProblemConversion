theorem: Let A be an n × n Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues λ1 ≤ ... ≤ λk ≤ ... ≤ λn, then λk=minUmaxxRA(x)∣x∈Uandx≠0∣dim⁡(U)=kλ_k=min_U{max_x{R_A(x)andx≠0}|(U)=k} and λk=maxUminxRA(x)∣x∈Uandx≠0∣dim⁡(U)=n−k+1λ_k=max_U{min_x{R_A(x)andx≠0}|(U)=n-k+1}, in particular, ∀x∈Cn∖0:λ1≤RA(x)≤λn∈𝐂^n\{0}λ_1_A(x)≤λ_n and these bounds are attained when x is an eigenvector of the appropriate eigenvalues. Also the simpler formulation for the maximal eigenvalue λn is given by: λn=maxRA(x):x≠0.λ_n=max{R_A(x):x≠0}. Similarly, the minimal eigenvalue λ1 is given by: λ1=minRA(x):x≠0.λ_1=min{R_A(x):x≠0}. Proof Since the matrix A is Hermitian it is diagonalizable and we can choose an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors {u1, ..., un} that is, ui is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue λi and such that (ui, ui) = 1 and (ui, uj) = 0 for all i ≠ j. If U is a subspace of dimension k then its intersection with the subspace span{uk, ..., un} isn't zero, for if it were, then the dimension of the span of the two subspaces would be k+(n−k+1)+(n-k+1), which is impossible. Hence there exists a vector v ≠ 0 in this intersection that we can write as v=∑i=knαiui=∑_i=k^nα_iu_i and whose Rayleigh quotient is RA(v)=∑i=knλi|αi|2∑i=kn|αi|2≥λk_A(v)=∑_i=k^nλ_i|α_i|^2/∑_i=k^n|α_i|^2≥λ_k (as all λi≥λkλ_i≥λ_k for i=k,..,n) and hence maxRA(x)∣x∈U≥λkmax{R_A(x)}≥λ_k Since this is true for all U, we can conclude that minmaxRA(x)∣x∈Uandx≠0∣dim⁡(U)=k≥λkmin{max{R_A(x)andx≠0}|(U)=k}≥λ_k This is one inequality. To establish the other inequality, choose the specific k-dimensional space V = span{u1, ..., uk} , for which maxRA(x)∣x∈Vandx≠0≤λkmax{R_A(x)andx≠0}≤λ_k because λkλ_k is the largest eigenvalue in V. Therefore, also minmaxRA(x)∣x∈Uandx≠0∣dim⁡(U)=k≤λkmin{max{R_A(x)andx≠0}|(U)=k}≤λ_k To get the other formula, consider the Hermitian matrix A′=−A'=-A, whose eigenvalues in increasing order are λk′=−λn−k+1λ'_k=-λ_n-k+1. Applying the result just proved, −λn−k+1=λk′=minmaxRA′(x)∣x∈U∣dim⁡(U)=k=minmax−RA(x)∣x∈U∣dim⁡(U)=k=−maxminRA(x)∣x∈U∣dim⁡(U)=k-λ_n-k+1=λ'_k =min{max{R_A'(x)}|(U)=k} =min{max{-R_A(x)}|(U)=k} =-max{min{R_A(x)}|(U)=k} The result follows on replacing k with n−k+1-k+1.
