operators: Let A be a compact, Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space H. Recall that the spectrum of such an operator (the set of eigenvalues) is a set of real numbers whose only possible cluster point is zero. It is thus convenient to list the positive eigenvalues of A as ⋯≤λk≤⋯≤λ1,⋯≤λ_k≤⋯≤λ_1, where entries are repeated with multiplicity, as in the matrix case. (To emphasize that the sequence is decreasing, we may write λk=λk↓λ_k=λ_k^↓.) When H is infinite-dimensional, the above sequence of eigenvalues is necessarily infinite. We now apply the same reasoning as in the matrix case. Letting Sk ⊂ H be a k dimensional subspace, we can obtain the following theorem. Theorem (Min-Max). Let A be a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H, whose positive eigenvalues are listed in decreasing order ... ≤ λk ≤ ... ≤ λ1. Then: maxSkminx∈Sk,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)=λk↓,minSk−1maxx∈Sk−1⊥,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)=λk↓.max_S_kmin_x_k,x=1(Ax,x) =λ_k^↓, min_S_k-1max_x_k-1^⊥,x=1(Ax,x) =λ_k^↓. A similar pair of equalities hold for negative eigenvalues. Proof Let S' be the closure of the linear span S′=span⁡uk,uk+1,…'=span{u_k,u_k+1,…}. The subspace S' has codimension k − 1. By the same dimension count argument as in the matrix case, S' ∩ Sk has positive dimension. So there exists x ∈ S' ∩ Sk with ‖x‖=1x=1. Since it is an element of S' , such an x necessarily satisfy (Ax,x)≤λk.(Ax,x)≤λ_k. Therefore, for all Sk infx∈Sk,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)≤λkinf_x_k,x=1(Ax,x)≤λ_k But A is compact, therefore the function f(x) = (Ax, x) is weakly continuous. Furthermore, any bounded set in H is weakly compact. This lets us replace the infimum by minimum: minx∈Sk,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)≤λk.min_x_k,x=1(Ax,x)≤λ_k. So supSkminx∈Sk,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)≤λk.sup_S_kmin_x_k,x=1(Ax,x)≤λ_k. Because equality is achieved when Sk=span⁡u1,…,uk_k=span{u_1,…,u_k}, maxSkminx∈Sk,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)=λk.max_S_kmin_x_k,x=1(Ax,x)=λ_k. This is the first part of min-max theorem for compact self-adjoint operators. Analogously, consider now a (k − 1)-dimensional subspace Sk−1, whose the orthogonal complement is denoted by Sk−1⊥. If S' = span{u1...uk}, S′∩Sk−1⊥≠0.'_k-1^⊥≠0. So ∃x∈Sk−1⊥‖x‖=1,(Ax,x)≥λk._k-1^⊥ x=1,(Ax,x)≥λ_k. This implies maxx∈Sk−1⊥,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)≥λkmax_x_k-1^⊥,x=1(Ax,x)≥λ_k where the compactness of A was applied. Index the above by the collection of k-1-dimensional subspaces gives infSk−1maxx∈Sk−1⊥,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)≥λk.inf_S_k-1max_x_k-1^⊥,x=1(Ax,x)≥λ_k. Pick Sk−1 = span{u1, ..., uk−1} and we deduce minSk−1maxx∈Sk−1⊥,‖x‖=1(Ax,x)=λk.min_S_k-1max_x_k-1^⊥,x=1(Ax,x)=λ_k. Self-adjoint
