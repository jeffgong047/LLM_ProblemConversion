case: Let N be the nilpotent matrix [0100].[ 0 1; 0 0 ]. Define the Rayleigh quotient RN(x)_N(x) exactly as above in the Hermitian case. Then it is easy to see that the only eigenvalue of N is zero, while the maximum value of the Rayleigh quotient is 1/2. That is, the maximum value of the Rayleigh quotient is larger than the maximum eigenvalue.
