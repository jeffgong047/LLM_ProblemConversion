Matrices: Let A be a n × n Hermitian matrix. As with many other variational results on eigenvalues, one considers the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient RA : Cn \ {0} → R defined by RA(x)=(Ax,x)(x,x)_A(x)=(Ax,x)/(x,x) where (⋅, ⋅) denotes the Euclidean inner product on Cn. Clearly, the Rayleigh quotient of an eigenvector is its associated eigenvalue. Equivalently, the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient can be replaced by f(x)=(Ax,x),‖x‖=1.(x)=(Ax,x), x=1. For Hermitian matrices A, the range of the continuous function RA(x), or f(x), is a compact interval [a, b] of the real line. The maximum b and the minimum a are the largest and smallest eigenvalue of A, respectively. The min-max theorem is a refinement of this fact. Min-max
