result: Let B:[0,1]×Ω→R:[0,1]×Ω→ℝ be a standard Wiener process. Then, almost surely, limh→0supt,t′≤1;|t−t′|≤h|Bt′−Bt|2hlog⁡(1/h)=1.lim_h→0sup_t,t'≤1;|t-t'||B_t'-B_t|/√(2hlog(1/h))=1. In other words, the sample paths of Brownian motion have modulus of continuity ωB(δ)=c2δlog⁡(1/δ)ω_B(δ)=c√(2δlog(1/δ)) with probability one, for c>1>1 and sufficiently small δ>0δ>0.[1] See
