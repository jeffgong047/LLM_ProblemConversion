1: Notation: For a triangle the vertical bars (|…||…|) denote its area and for a line segment its length. Proof: Since CA∥BD, the altitudes of △CDA and △CBA are of equal length. As those triangles share the same baseline, their areas are identical. So we have |△CDA|=|△CBA|||=|| and therefore |△SCB|=|△SDA|||=|| as well. This yields |△SCA||△CDA|=|△SCA||△CBA|||/||=||/|| and |△SCA||△SDA|=|△SCA||△SCB|||/||=||/|| Plugging in the formula for triangle areas (baseline⋅altitude2baseline·altitude2) transforms that into |SC||AF||CD||AF|=|SA||EC||AB||EC||SC||AF|/|CD||AF|=|SA||EC|/|AB||EC| and |SC||AF||SD||AF|=|SA||EC||SB||EC||SC||AF|/|SD||AF|=|SA||EC|/|SB||EC| Canceling the common factors results in: (a) |SC||CD|=|SA||AB| |SC|/|CD|=|SA|/|AB| and (b) |SC||SD|=|SA||SB| |SC|/|SD|=|SA|/|SB| Now use (b) to replace |SA||SA| and |SC||SC| in (a): |SA||SD||SB||CD|=|SB||SC||SD||AB||SA||SD|/|SB|/|CD|=|SB||SC|/|SD|/|AB| Using (b) again this simplifies to: (c) |SD||CD|=|SB||AB| |SD|/|CD|=|SB|/|AB| ◻ □ Claim
