trapezoids: The intercept theorem can be used to prove that a certain construction yields parallel line (segment)s. If the midpoints of two triangle sides are connected then the resulting line segment is parallel to the third triangle side (Midpoint theorem of triangles). If the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid are connected, then the resulting line segment is parallel to the other two sides of the trapezoid. Historical
