theorem: intercept theorem with rays |SA| / |SB| = |AC| / |BD| does not necessarily imply AC is parallel to BD. Suppose S is the common starting point of two rays and A, B are the intersections of the first ray with the two parallels, such that B is further away from S than A, and similarly C, D are the intersections of the second ray with the two parallels such that D is further away from S than C. In this configuration the following statements hold:[1][2] The ratio of any two segments on the first ray equals the ratio of the according segments on the second ray: |SA||AB|=|SC||CD||SA|/|AB|=|SC|/|CD|, |SB||AB|=|SD||CD||SB|/|AB|=|SD|/|CD|, |SA||SB|=|SC||SD||SA|/|SB|=|SC|/|SD| The ratio of the two segments on the same ray starting at S equals the ratio of the segments on the parallels: |SA||SB|=|SC||SD|=|AC||BD||SA|/|SB|=|SC|/|SD|=|AC|/|BD| The converse of the first statement is true as well, i.e. if the two rays are intercepted by two arbitrary lines and |SA||AB|=|SC||CD||SA|/|AB|=|SC|/|CD| holds then the two intercepting lines are parallel. However, the converse of the second statement is not true (see graphic for a counterexample). Extensions and
