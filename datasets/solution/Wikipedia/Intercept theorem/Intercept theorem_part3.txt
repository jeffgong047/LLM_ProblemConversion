conclusions: intercept theorem with a pair of intersecting lines intercept theorem with more than two lines The first two statements remain true if the two rays get replaced by two lines intersecting in S. In this case there are two scenarios with regard to S, either it lies between the 2 parallels (X figure) or it does not (V figure). If S is not located between the two parallels, the original theorem applies directly. If S lies between the two paralles, then a reflection of A and C at S yields V figure with identical measures for which the original theorem now applies.[2] The third statement (converse) however does not remain true for lines.[3][4][5] If there are more than two rays starting at S or more than two lines intersecting at S, then each parallel contains more than one line segment and the ratio of two line segments on one parallel equals the ratio of the according line segments on the other parallek. For instance if there's a third ray starting at S and intersecting the parallels in E and F, such that F is further away from S than E, then the following equalities holds:[4] |AE||BF|=|EC||FD||AE|/|BF|=|EC|/|FD| , |AE||EC|=|BF||FD||AE|/|EC|=|BF|/|FD| For the second equation the converse is true as well, that is if the 3 rays are intercepted by two lines and the ratios of the according line segments on each line are equal, then those 2 lines must be parallel.[4] Related
