3: Assume AC and BD are not parallel. Then the parallel line to AC through D intersects SA in B0≠B_0. Since |SB|:|SA|=|SD|:|SC||SB|:|SA|=|SD|:|SC| is true, we have |SB|=|SD||SA||SC||SB|=|SD||SA|/|SC| and on the other hand from claim 1 we have |SB0|=|SD||SA||SC||SB_0|=|SD||SA|/|SC|. So B and B0_0 are on the same side of S and have the same distance to S, which means B=B0=B_0. This is a contradiction, so the assumption could not have been true, which means AC and BD are indeed parallel ◻□
