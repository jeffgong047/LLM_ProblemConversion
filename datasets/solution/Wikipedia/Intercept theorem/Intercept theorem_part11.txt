pyramid: measuring pieces computing C and D According to some historical sources the Greek mathematician Thales applied the intercept theorem to determine the height of the Cheops' pyramid. The following description illustrates the use of the intercept theorem to compute the height of the pyramid. It does not, however, recount Thales' original work, which was lost.[9][10] Thales measured the length of the pyramid's base and the height of his pole. Then at the same time of the day he measured the length of the pyramid's shadow and the length of the pole's shadow. This yielded the following data: height of the pole (A): 1.63 m shadow of the pole (B): 2 m length of the pyramid base: 230 m shadow of the pyramid: 65 m From this he computed C=65m+230m2=180m=65 m+230 m/2=180 m Knowing A,B and C he was now able to apply the intercept theorem to compute D=C⋅AB=1.63m⋅180m2m=146.7m=C/B=1.63 m·180 m/2 m=146.7 m Measuring the width of a
