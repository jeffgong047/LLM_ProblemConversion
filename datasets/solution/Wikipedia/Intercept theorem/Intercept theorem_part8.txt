constructions: There are three famous problems in elementary geometry which were posed by the Greeks in terms of compass and straightedge constructions:[6][7] Trisecting the angle Doubling the cube Squaring the circle It took more than 2000 years until all three of them were finally shown to be impossible. This was achieved in the 19th century with the help of algebraic methods, that had become available by then. In order to reformulate the three problems in algebraic terms using field extensions, one needs to match field operations with compass and straightedge constructions (see constructible number). In particular it is important to assure that for two given line segments, a new line segment can be constructed, such that its length equals the product of lengths of the other two. Similarly one needs to be able to construct, for a line segment of length a, a new line segment of length aâˆ’1^-1. The intercept theorem can be used to show that for both cases, that such a construction is possible. Construction of a product Construction of an inverse Dividing a line segment in a given
