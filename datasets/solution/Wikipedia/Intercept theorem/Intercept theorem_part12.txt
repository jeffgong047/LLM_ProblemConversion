river: The intercept theorem can be used to determine a distance that cannot be measured directly, such as the width of a river or a lake, the height of tall buildings or similar. The graphic to the right illustrates measuring the width of a river. The segments |CF||CF|,|CA||CA|,|FE||FE| are measured and used to compute the wanted distance |AB|=|AC||FE||FC||AB|=|AC||FE|/|FC|.
