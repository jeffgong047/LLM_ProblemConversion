ratio: To divide an arbitrary line segment AB¯AB in a m:n:n ratio, draw an arbitrary angle in A with AB¯AB as one leg. On the other leg construct m+n+n equidistant points, then draw the line through the last point and B and parallel line through the mth point. This parallel line divides AB¯AB in the desired ratio. The graphic to the right shows the partition of a line segment AB¯AB in a 5:35:3 ratio.[8] Measuring and
