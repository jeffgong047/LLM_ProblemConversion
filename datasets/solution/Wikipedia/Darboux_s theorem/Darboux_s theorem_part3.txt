theorem: Darboux's theorem for p=0=0 ensures the any 1-form θ≠0θ≠0 such that θ∧dθ=0θθ=0 can be written as θ=dx1θ=dx_1 in some coordinate system (x1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_n). This recovers one of the formulation of Frobenius theorem in terms of differential forms: if I⊂Ω∗(M)ℐ⊂Ω^*(M) is the differential ideal generated by θθ, then θ∧dθ=0θθ=0 implies the existence of a coordinate system (x1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_n) where I⊂Ω∗(M)ℐ⊂Ω^*(M) is actually generated by dx1_1.[4] Darboux's theorem for symplectic
