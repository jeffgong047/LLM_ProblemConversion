manifolds: Suppose that ωω is a symplectic 2-form on an n=2m=2m-dimensional manifold M. In a neighborhood of each point p of M, by the Poincaré lemma, there is a 1-form θθ with dθ=ωdθ=ω. Moreover, θθ satisfies the first set of hypotheses in Darboux's theorem, and so locally there is a coordinate chart U near p in whichθ=x1dy1+…+xmdym.θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_m dy_m. Taking an exterior derivative now shows ω=dθ=dx1∧dy1+…+dxm∧dym.ω=dθ=dx_1∧dy_1+…+dx_m∧dy_m. The chart U is said to be a Darboux chart around p.[5] The manifold M can be covered by such charts. To state this differently, identify R2mℝ^2m with Cmℂ^m by letting zj=xj+iyj_j=x_j+i y_j. If φ:U→Cnφ:U→ℂ^nis a Darboux chart, then ωω can be written as the pullback of the standard symplectic form ω0ω_0 on Cnℂ^n: ω=φ∗ω0.ω=φ^*ω_0. A modern proof of this result, without employing Darboux's general statement on 1-forms, is done using Moser's trick.[5][6] Comparison with Riemannian
