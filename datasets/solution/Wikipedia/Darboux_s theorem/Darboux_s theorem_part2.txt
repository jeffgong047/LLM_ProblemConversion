Statement: Suppose that θθ is a differential 1-form on an n-dimensional manifold, such that dθdθ has constant rank p. Then if θ∧(dθ)p=0θ∧(dθ)^p=0 everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates (x1,…,xn−p,y1,…,yp)(x_1,…,x_n-p,y_1,…,y_p) in which θ=x1dy1+…+xpdyp;θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_p dy_p; if θ∧(dθ)p≠0θ∧(dθ)^p≠0 everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates (x1,…,xn−p,y1,…,yp)(x_1,…,x_n-p,y_1,…,y_p) in whichθ=x1dy1+…+xpdyp+dxp+1.θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_p dy_p+dx_p+1. Darboux's original proof used induction on p and it can be equivalently presented in terms of distributions[3] or of differential ideals.[4] Frobenius'
