theorem: Alan Weinstein showed that the Darboux's theorem for sympletic manifolds can be strengthened to hold on a neighborhood of a submanifold:[8] Let M be a smooth manifold endowed with two symplectic forms ω1ω_1 and ω2ω_2, and let N⊂M be a closed submanifold. If ω1|N=ω2|N.ω_1|_N=.ω_2|_N, then there is a neighborhood U of N in M and a diffeomorphism f:U→U:U such that f∗ω2=ω1^*ω_2=ω_1. The standard Darboux theorem is recovered when N is a point and ω2ω_2 is the standard symplectic structure on a coordinate chart. This theorem also holds for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds. See
