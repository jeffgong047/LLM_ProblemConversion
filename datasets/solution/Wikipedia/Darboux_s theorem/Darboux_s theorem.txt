Foundational result in symplectic geometry
This article is about Darboux's theorem in differential geometry. For Darboux's theorem related to the intermediate value theorem, see Darboux's theorem (analysis).
In differential geometry, a field in mathematics, Darboux's theorem is a theorem providing a normal form for special classes of differential 1-forms, partially generalizing the Frobenius integration theorem. It is named after Jean Gaston Darboux[1] who established it as the solution of the Pfaff problem.[2]
It is a foundational result in several fields, the chief among them being symplectic geometry. Indeed, one of its many consequences is that any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic to one another. That is, every 2n2n-dimensional symplectic manifold can be made to look locally like the linear symplectic space Cnℂ^n with its canonical symplectic form.
There is also an analogous consequence of the theorem applied to contact geometry.


Statement[edit]
Suppose that θθ is a differential 1-form on an n-dimensional manifold, such that dθdθ has constant rank p. Then

if θ∧(dθ)p=0θ∧(dθ)^p=0 everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates (x1,…,xn−p,y1,…,yp)(x_1,…,x_n-p,y_1,…,y_p) in which θ=x1dy1+…+xpdyp;θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_p dy_p;
if θ∧(dθ)p≠0θ∧(dθ)^p≠0 everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates (x1,…,xn−p,y1,…,yp)(x_1,…,x_n-p,y_1,…,y_p) in whichθ=x1dy1+…+xpdyp+dxp+1.θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_p dy_p+dx_p+1.
Darboux's original proof used induction on p and it can be equivalently presented in terms of distributions[3] or of differential ideals.[4]

Frobenius' theorem[edit]
Darboux's theorem for p=0=0 ensures the any 1-form θ≠0θ≠0 such that θ∧dθ=0θθ=0 can be written as θ=dx1θ=dx_1 in some coordinate system (x1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_n).
This recovers one of the formulation of Frobenius theorem in terms of differential forms: if I⊂Ω∗(M)ℐ⊂Ω^*(M) is the differential ideal generated by θθ, then θ∧dθ=0θθ=0 implies the existence of a coordinate system (x1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_n) where I⊂Ω∗(M)ℐ⊂Ω^*(M) is actually generated by dx1_1.[4]

Darboux's theorem for symplectic manifolds[edit]
Suppose that ωω is a symplectic 2-form on an n=2m=2m-dimensional manifold M. In a neighborhood of each point p of M, by the Poincaré lemma, there is a 1-form θθ with dθ=ωdθ=ω. Moreover, θθ satisfies the first set of hypotheses in Darboux's theorem, and so locally there is a coordinate chart U near p in whichθ=x1dy1+…+xmdym.θ=x_1 dy_1+…+x_m dy_m.
Taking an exterior derivative now shows

ω=dθ=dx1∧dy1+…+dxm∧dym.ω=dθ=dx_1∧dy_1+…+dx_m∧dy_m.
The chart U is said to be a Darboux chart around p.[5] The manifold M can be covered by such charts.
To state this differently, identify R2mℝ^2m with Cmℂ^m by letting zj=xj+iyj_j=x_j+i y_j. If φ:U→Cnφ:U→ℂ^nis a Darboux chart, then ωω can be written as the pullback of the standard symplectic form ω0ω_0 on Cnℂ^n:

ω=φ∗ω0.ω=φ^*ω_0. 
A modern proof of this result, without employing Darboux's general statement on 1-forms, is done using Moser's trick.[5][6]

Comparison with Riemannian geometry[edit]
Darboux's theorem for symplectic manifolds implies that there are no local invariants in symplectic geometry: a Darboux basis can always be taken, valid near any given point. This is in marked contrast to the situation in Riemannian geometry where the curvature is a local invariant, an obstruction to the metric being locally a sum of squares of coordinate differentials.
The difference is that Darboux's theorem states that ωω can be made to take the standard form in an entire neighborhood around p. In Riemannian geometry, the metric can always be made to take the standard form at any given point, but not always in a neighborhood around that point.

Darboux's theorem for contact manifolds[edit]
Another particular case is recovered when n=2p+1=2p+1; if θ∧(dθ)p≠0θ∧(dθ)^p≠0 everywhere, then θθ is a contact form. A simpler proof can be given, as in the case of symplectic structures, by using Moser's trick.[7]

The Darboux-Weinstein theorem[edit]
Alan Weinstein showed that the Darboux's theorem for sympletic manifolds can be strengthened to hold on a neighborhood of a submanifold:[8]

Let M be a smooth manifold endowed with two symplectic forms ω1ω_1 and ω2ω_2, and let N⊂M be a closed submanifold. If ω1|N=ω2|N.ω_1|_N=.ω_2|_N, then there is a neighborhood U of N in M and a diffeomorphism f:U→U:U such that f∗ω2=ω1^*ω_2=ω_1.
The standard Darboux theorem is recovered when N is a point and ω2ω_2 is the standard symplectic structure on a coordinate chart.
This theorem also holds for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds.
