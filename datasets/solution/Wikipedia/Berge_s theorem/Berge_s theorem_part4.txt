1: Let M be a maximum matching and consider an alternating chain such that the edges in the path alternates between being and not being in M. If the alternating chain is a cycle or a path of even length starting on an unmatched vertex, then a new maximum matching M′ can be found by interchanging the edges found in M and not in M. For example, if the alternating chain is (m1, n1, m2, n2, ...), where mi ∈ M and ni ∉ M, interchanging them would make all ni part of the new matching and make all mi not part of the matching.
