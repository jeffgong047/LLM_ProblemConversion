generalizations: This theorem is a statement of the first isomorphism theorem of algebra for the case of vector spaces; it generalizes to the splitting lemma. In more modern language, the theorem can also be phrased as saying that each short exact sequence of vector spaces splits. Explicitly, given that 0→U→V→TR→00T→R→0 is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then U⊕R≅V, hence dim⁡(U)+dim⁡(R)=dim⁡(V).(U)+(R)=(V). Here R plays the role of Im⁡TImT and U is Ker⁡TKerT, i.e. 0→ker⁡T↪V→Tim⁡T→00→↪VT→imT→0 In the finite-dimensional case, this formulation is susceptible to a generalization: if 0→V1→V2→⋯Vr→00_1_2→_r→0 is an exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then[9] ∑i=1r(−1)idim⁡(Vi)=0.∑_i=1^r(-1)^i(V_i)=0. The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces may also be formulated in terms of the index of a linear map. The index of a linear map T∈Hom⁡(V,W)∈Hom(V,W), where V and W are finite-dimensional, is defined by index⁡T=dim⁡Ker⁡(T)−dim⁡Coker⁡T.indexT=Ker(T)-CokerT. Intuitively, dim⁡Ker⁡TKerT is the number of independent solutions v of the equation Tv=0=0, and dim⁡Coker⁡TCokerT is the number of independent restrictions that have to be put on w to make Tv=w=w solvable. The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces is equivalent to the statement index⁡T=dim⁡V−dim⁡W.indexT=-. We see that we can easily read off the index of the linear map T from the involved spaces, without any need to analyze T in detail. This effect also occurs in a much deeper result: the Atiyah–Singer index theorem states that the index of certain differential operators can be read off the geometry of the involved spaces.
