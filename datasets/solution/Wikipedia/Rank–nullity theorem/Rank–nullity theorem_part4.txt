Matrices: Linear maps can be represented with matrices. More precisely, an m×n matrix M represents a linear map f:Fn→Fm,:F^n^m, where F is the underlying field.[5] So, the dimension of the domain of f is n, the number of columns of M, and the rank–nullity theorem for an m×n matrix M is rank⁡(M)+nullity⁡(M)=n.rank(M)+nullity(M)=n.
