Proofs: Here we provide two proofs. The first[2] operates in the general case, using linear maps. The second proof[6] looks at the homogeneous system Ax=0,𝐀𝐱=0, where A𝐀 is a m×n with rank r,, and shows explicitly that there exists a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions that span the null space of A𝐀. While the theorem requires that the domain of the linear map be finite-dimensional, there is no such assumption on the codomain. This means that there are linear maps not given by matrices for which the theorem applies. Despite this, the first proof is not actually more general than the second: since the image of the linear map is finite-dimensional, we can represent the map from its domain to its image by a matrix, prove the theorem for that matrix, then compose with the inclusion of the image into the full codomain.
