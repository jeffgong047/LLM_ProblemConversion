proof: Let A𝐀 be an m×n matrix with r linearly independent columns (i.e. Rank⁡(A)=rRank(𝐀)=r). We will show that: There exists a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous system Ax=0𝐀𝐱=0.That every other solution is a linear combination of these n−r-r solutions. To do this, we will produce an n×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix X𝐗 whose columns form a basis of the null space of A𝐀. Without loss of generality, assume that the first r columns of A𝐀 are linearly independent. So, we can write A=(A1A2),𝐀=[ 𝐀_1 𝐀_2 ], where A1𝐀_1 is an m×r matrix with r linearly independent column vectors, and A2𝐀_2 is an m×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix such that each of its n−r-r columns is linear combinations of the columns of A1𝐀_1. This means that A2=A1B𝐀_2=𝐀_1𝐁 for some r×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix B𝐁 (see rank factorization) and, hence, A=(A1A1B).𝐀=[ 𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ]. Let X=(−BIn−r),𝐗=[ -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ], where In−r𝐈_n-r is the (n−r)×(n−r)(n-r)×(n-r) identity matrix. So, X𝐗 is an n×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix such that AX=(A1A1B)(−BIn−r)=−A1B+A1B=0m×(n−r).𝐀𝐗=[ 𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ][ -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]=-𝐀_1𝐁+𝐀_1𝐁=0_m×(n-r). Therefore, each of the n−r-r columns of X𝐗 are particular solutions of Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_F^m. Furthermore, the n−r-r columns of X𝐗 are linearly independent because Xu=0Fn𝐗𝐮=0_F^n will imply u=0Fn−r𝐮=0_F^n-r for u∈Fn−r𝐮∈F^n-r: Xu=0Fn⟹(−BIn−r)u=0Fn⟹(−Buu)=(0Fr0Fn−r)⟹u=0Fn−r.𝐗𝐮=0_F^n[ -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]𝐮=0_F^n[ -𝐁𝐮; 𝐮 ]=[ 0_F^r; 0_F^n-r ]𝐮=0_F^n-r. Therefore, the column vectors of X𝐗 constitute a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions for Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_𝔽^m. We next prove that any solution of Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_F^m must be a linear combination of the columns of X𝐗. For this, let u=(u1u2)∈Fn𝐮=[ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ]∈F^n be any vector such that Au=0Fm𝐀𝐮=0_F^m. Since the columns of A1𝐀_1 are linearly independent, A1x=0Fm𝐀_1𝐱=0_F^m implies x=0Fr𝐱=0_F^r. Therefore, Au=0Fm⟹(A1A1B)(u1u2)=A1u1+A1Bu2=A1(u1+Bu2)=0Fm⟹u1+Bu2=0Fr⟹u1=−Bu2[ 𝐀𝐮 = 0_F^m; [ 𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ][ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ] = 𝐀_1𝐮_1+𝐀_1𝐁𝐮_2 = 𝐀_1(𝐮_1+𝐁𝐮_2) = 0_𝔽^m; 𝐮_1+𝐁𝐮_2 = 0_F^r; 𝐮_1 = -𝐁𝐮_2 ] ⟹u=(u1u2)=(−BIn−r)u2=Xu2.𝐮=[ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ]=[ -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]𝐮_2=𝐗𝐮_2. This proves that any vector u𝐮 that is a solution of Ax=0𝐀𝐱=0 must be a linear combination of the n−r-r special solutions given by the columns of X𝐗. And we have already seen that the columns of X𝐗 are linearly independent. Hence, the columns of X𝐗 constitute a basis for the null space of A𝐀. Therefore, the nullity of A𝐀 is n−r-r. Since r equals rank of A𝐀, it follows that Rank⁡(A)+Nullity⁡(A)=nRank(𝐀)+Nullity(𝐀)=n. This concludes our proof. A third fundamental
