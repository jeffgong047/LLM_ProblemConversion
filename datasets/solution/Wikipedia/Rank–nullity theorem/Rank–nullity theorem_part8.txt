subspace: When T:V→W:V is a linear transformation between two finite-dimensional subspaces, with n=dim⁡(V)=(V) and m=dim⁡(W)=(W) (so can be represented by an m×n matrix M), the rank–nullity theorem asserts that if T has rank r, then n−r-r is the dimension of the null space of M, which represents the kernel of T. In some texts, a third fundamental subspace associated to T is considered alongside its image and kernel: the cokernel of T is the quotient space W/Image⁡(T)/Image(T), and its dimension is m−r-r. This dimension formula (which might also be rendered dim⁡Image⁡(T)+dim⁡Coker⁡(T)=dim⁡(W)Image(T)+Coker(T)=(W)) together with the rank–nullity theorem is sometimes called the fundamental theorem of linear algebra.[7][8] Reformulations and
