transformations: Let T:V→W:V be a linear transformation between two vector spaces where T's domain V is finite dimensional. Then rank⁡(T)+nullity⁡(T)=dim⁡V,rank(T) + nullity(T) = , where rank⁡(T)rank(T) is the rank of T (the dimension of its image) and nullity⁡(T)nullity(T) is the nullity of T (the dimension of its kernel). In other words, dim⁡(Im⁡T)+dim⁡(Ker⁡T)=dim⁡(Domain⁡(T)).(ImT)+(KerT)=(Domain(T)). This theorem can be refined via the splitting lemma to be a statement about an isomorphism of spaces, not just dimensions. Explicitly, since T induces an isomorphism from V/Ker⁡(T)/Ker(T) to Image⁡(T),Image(T), the existence of a basis for V that extends any given basis of Ker⁡(T)Ker(T) implies, via the splitting lemma, that Image⁡(T)⊕Ker⁡(T)≅V.Image(T)⊕Ker(T). Taking dimensions, the rank–nullity theorem follows.
