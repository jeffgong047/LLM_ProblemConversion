proof: Let V,W,W be vector spaces over some field F,, and T defined as in the statement of the theorem with dim⁡V=n=n. As Ker⁡T⊂VKerT is a subspace, there exists a basis for it. Suppose dim⁡Ker⁡T=kKerT=k and let K:=v1,…,vk⊂Ker⁡(T)𝒦:={v_1,…,v_k}⊂Ker(T) be such a basis. We may now, by the Steinitz exchange lemma, extend K𝒦 with n−k-k linearly independent vectors w1,…,wn−k_1,…,w_n-k to form a full basis of V. Let S:=w1,…,wn−k⊂V∖Ker⁡(T)𝒮:={w_1,…,w_n-k}∖Ker(T) such that B:=K∪S=v1,…,vk,w1,…,wn−k⊂Vℬ:=𝒦∪𝒮={v_1,…,v_k,w_1,…,w_n-k} is a basis for V. From this, we know that Im⁡T=Span⁡T(B)=Span⁡T(v1),…,T(vk),T(w1),…,T(wn−k)ImT=SpanT(ℬ)=Span{T(v_1),…,T(v_k),T(w_1),…,T(w_n-k)} =Span⁡T(w1),…,T(wn−k)=Span⁡T(S).=Span{T(w_1),…,T(w_n-k)}=SpanT(𝒮). We now claim that T(S)(𝒮) is a basis for Im⁡TImT. The above equality already states that T(S)(𝒮) is a generating set for Im⁡TImT; it remains to be shown that it is also linearly independent to conclude that it is a basis. Suppose T(S)(𝒮) is not linearly independent, and let ∑j=1n−kαjT(wj)=0W∑_j=1^n-kα_jT(w_j)=0_W for some αj∈Fα_j. Thus, owing to the linearity of T, it follows that T(∑j=1n−kαjwj)=0W⟹(∑j=1n−kαjwj)∈Ker⁡T=Span⁡K⊂V.(∑_j=1^n-kα_jw_j)=0_W(∑_j=1^n-kα_jw_j)∈KerT=Span𝒦. This is a contradiction to Bℬ being a basis, unless all αjα_j are equal to zero. This shows that T(S)(𝒮) is linearly independent, and more specifically that it is a basis for Im⁡TImT. To summarize, we have K𝒦, a basis for Ker⁡TKerT, and T(S)(𝒮), a basis for Im⁡TImT. Finally we may state that Rank⁡(T)+Nullity⁡(T)=dim⁡Im⁡T+dim⁡Ker⁡TRank(T)+Nullity(T)=ImT+KerT =|T(S)|+|K|=(n−k)+k=n=dim⁡V.=|T(𝒮)|+|𝒦|=(n-k)+k=n=. This concludes our proof. Second
