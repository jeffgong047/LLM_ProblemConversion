theorem: Historically the theorems above were pointers to the following result, at one time known as the α+βα+β hypothesis. It was used by Edmund Landau and was finally proved by Henry Mann in 1942. Theorem. (Mann 1942) Let A and B be subsets of Nℕ. In case that A⊕B≠N≠ℕ, we still have σ(A⊕B)≥σA+σB.σ(A)≥+. An analogue of this theorem for lower asymptotic density was obtained by Kneser.[4] At a later date, E. Artin and P. Scherk simplified the proof of Mann's theorem.[5] Waring's
