theorems: If we set G2=k2k=1∞𝔊^2={k^2}_k=1^∞, then Lagrange's four-square theorem can be restated as σ(G2⊕G2⊕G2⊕G2)=1σ(𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2)=1. (Here the symbol A⊕B denotes the sumset of A∪0∪{0} and B∪0∪{0}.) It is clear that σG2=0σ𝔊^2=0. In fact, we still have σ(G2⊕G2)=0σ(𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2)=0, and one might ask at what point the sumset attains Schnirelmann density 1 and how does it increase. It actually is the case that σ(G2⊕G2⊕G2)=5/6σ(𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2⊕𝔊^2)=5/6 and one sees that sumsetting G2𝔊^2 once again yields a more populous set, namely all of Nℕ. Schnirelmann further succeeded in developing these ideas into the following theorems, aiming towards Additive Number Theory, and proving them to be a novel resource (if not greatly powerful) to attack important problems, such as Waring's problem and Goldbach's conjecture. Theorem. Let A and B be subsets of Nℕ. Then σ(A⊕B)≥σA+σB−σA⋅σB.σ(A)≥+-·. Note that σA+σB−σA⋅σB=1−(1−σA)(1−σB)+-·=1-(1-)(1-). Inductively, we have the following generalization. Corollary. Let Ai⊆N_i⊆ℕ be a finite family of subsets of Nℕ. Then σ(⨁iAi)≥1−∏i(1−σAi).σ(⊕_iA_i)≥1-∏_i(1-_i). The theorem provides the first insights on how sumsets accumulate. It seems unfortunate that its conclusion stops short of showing σσ being superadditive. Yet, Schnirelmann provided us with the following results, which sufficed for most of his purpose. Theorem. Let A and B be subsets of Nℕ. If σA+σB≥1+≥1, then A⊕B=N.=ℕ. Theorem. (Schnirelmann) Let A⊆N⊆ℕ. If σA>0>0 then there exists k such that ⨁i=1kA=N.⊕_i=1^kA=ℕ. Additive
