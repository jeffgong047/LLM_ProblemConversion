components: Khintchin proved that the sequence of squares, though of zero Schnirelmann density, when added to a sequence of Schnirelmann density between 0 and 1, increases the density: σ(A+G2)>σ(A)for0<σ(A)<1.σ(A+𝔊^2)>σ(A)for0<σ(A)<1. This was soon simplified and extended by Erdős, who showed, that if A is any sequence with Schnirelmann density α and B is an additive basis of order k then σ(A+B)≥α+α(1−α)2k,σ(A+B)≥α+α(1-α)/2k ,[12] and this was improved by Plünnecke to σ(A+B)≥α1−1k.σ(A+B)≥α^1-1/k[13] Sequences with this property, of increasing density less than one by addition, were named essential components by Khintchin. Linnik showed that an essential component need not be an additive basis[14] as he constructed an essential component that has xo(1) elements less than x. More precisely, the sequence has e(log⁡x)c^()^c elements less than x for some c < 1. This was improved by E. Wirsing to elog⁡xlog⁡log⁡x.^√()log. For a while, it remained an open problem how many elements an essential component must have. Finally, Ruzsa determined that an essential component has at least (log x)c elements up to x, for some c > 1, and for every c > 1 there is an essential component which has at most (log x)c elements up to x.[15]
