Sensitivity: The Schnirelmann density is sensitive to the first values of a set: ∀kk∉A⇒σA≤1−1/k⇒≤1-1/k. In particular, 1∉A⇒σA=01⇒=0 and 2∉A⇒σA≤12.2⇒≤1/2. Consequently, the Schnirelmann densities of the even numbers and the odd numbers, which one might expect to agree, are 0 and 1/2 respectively. Schnirelmann and Yuri Linnik exploited this sensitivity. Schnirelmann's
