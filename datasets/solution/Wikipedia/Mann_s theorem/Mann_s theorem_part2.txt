Definition: The Schnirelmann density of a set of natural numbers A is defined as σA=infnA(n)n,=inf_nA(n)/n, where A(n) denotes the number of elements of A not exceeding n and inf is infimum.[3] The Schnirelmann density is well-defined even if the limit of A(n)/n as n → ∞ fails to exist (see upper and lower asymptotic density).
