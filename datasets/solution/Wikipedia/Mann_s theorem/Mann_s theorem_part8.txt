problem: Main article: Waring's problem Let k and N be natural numbers. Let Gk=iki=1∞𝔊^k={i^k}_i=1^∞. Define rNk(n)_N^k(n) to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the equation x1k+x2k+⋯+xNk=n_1^k+x_2^k+⋯+x_N^k=n and RNk(n)_N^k(n) to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the inequality 0≤x1k+x2k+⋯+xNk≤n,0_1^k+x_2^k+⋯+x_N^k, in the variables xi_i, respectively. Thus RNk(n)=∑i=0nrNk(i)_N^k(n)=∑_i=0^nr_N^k(i). We have rNk(n)>0↔n∈NGk,_N^k(n)>0𝔊^k, RNk(n)≥(nN)Nk._N^k(n)≥(n/N)^N/k. The volume of the N-dimensional body defined by 0≤x1k+x2k+⋯+xNk≤n0_1^k+x_2^k+⋯+x_N^k, is bounded by the volume of the hypercube of size n1/k^1/k, hence RNk(n)=∑i=0nrNk(i)≤nN/k_N^k(n)=∑_i=0^nr_N^k(i)^N/k. The hard part is to show that this bound still works on the average, i.e., Lemma. (Linnik) For all k∈N∈ℕ there exists N∈N∈ℕ and a constant c=c(k)=c(k), depending only on k, such that for all n∈N∈ℕ, rNk(m)<cnNk−1_N^k(m)<cn^N/k-1 for all 0≤m≤n.0. With this at hand, the following theorem can be elegantly proved. Theorem. For all k there exists N for which σ(NGk)>0σ(N𝔊^k)>0. We have thus established the general solution to Waring's Problem: Corollary. (Hilbert 1909) For all k there exists N, depending only on k, such that every positive integer n can be expressed as the sum of at most N many k-th powers. Schnirelmann's
