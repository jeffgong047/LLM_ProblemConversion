constant: In 1930 Schnirelmann used these ideas in conjunction with the Brun sieve to prove Schnirelmann's theorem,[1][2] that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than C prime numbers, where C is an effectively computable constant:[6] Schnirelmann obtained C < 800000.[7] Schnirelmann's constant is the lowest number C with this property.[6] Olivier Ramaré showed in (Ramaré 1995) that Schnirelmann's constant is at most 7,[6] improving the earlier upper bound of 19 obtained by Hans Riesel and R. C. Vaughan. Schnirelmann's constant is at least 3; Goldbach's conjecture implies that this is the constant's actual value.[6] In 2013, Harald Helfgott proved Goldbach's weak conjecture for all odd numbers. Therefore, Schnirelmann's constant is at most 4.[8][9][10][11] Essential
