bases: A subset A⊆N⊆ℕ with the property that A⊕A⊕⋯⊕A=N⊕⋯=ℕ for a finite sum, is called an additive basis, and the least number of summands required is called the degree (sometimes order) of the basis. Thus, the last theorem states that any set with positive Schnirelmann density is an additive basis. In this terminology, the set of squares G2=k2k=1∞𝔊^2={k^2}_k=1^∞ is an additive basis of degree 4. (About an open problem for additive bases, see Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases.) Mann's
