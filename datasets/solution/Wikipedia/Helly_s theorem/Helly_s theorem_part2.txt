Statement: Let X1, ..., Xn be a finite collection of convex subsets of Rd, with n ≥ d + 1. If the intersection of every d + 1 of these sets is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection; that is, ⋂j=1nXj≠∅.⋂_j=1^nX_j≠∅. For infinite collections one has to assume compactness: Let {Xα} be a collection of compact convex subsets of Rd, such that every subcollection of cardinality at most d + 1 has nonempty intersection. Then the whole collection has nonempty intersection.
