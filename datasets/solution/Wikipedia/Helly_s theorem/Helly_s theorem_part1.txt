Theorem about the intersections of d-dimensional convex sets Not to be confused with Helly's selection theorem. Helly's theorem for the Euclidean plane: if a family of convex sets has a nonempty intersection for every triple of sets, then the whole family has a nonempty intersection. Helly's theorem is a basic result in discrete geometry on the intersection of convex sets. It was discovered by Eduard Helly in 1913,[1] but not published by him until 1923, by which time alternative proofs by Radon (1921) and KÃ¶nig (1922) had already appeared. Helly's theorem gave rise to the notion of a Helly family.
