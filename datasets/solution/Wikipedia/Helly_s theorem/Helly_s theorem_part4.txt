theorem: The colorful Helly theorem is an extension of Helly's theorem in which, instead of one collection, there are d+1 collections of convex subsets of Rd. If, for every choice of a transversal – one set from every collection – there is a point in common to all the chosen sets, then for at least one of the collections, there is a point in common to all sets in the collection. Figuratively, one can consider the d+1 collections to be of d+1 different colors. Then the theorem says that, if every choice of one-set-per-color has a non-empty intersection, then there exists a color such that all sets of that color have a non-empty intersection.[2] Fractional Helly
