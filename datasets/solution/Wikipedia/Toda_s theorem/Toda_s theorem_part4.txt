Proof: The proof is broken into two parts. First, it is established that ΣP⋅BP⋅⊕P⊆BP⋅⊕PΣ^P·𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯⊆𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯 The proof uses a variation of Valiant–Vazirani theorem. Because BP⋅⊕P𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯 contains P𝖯 and is closed under complement, it follows by induction that PH⊆BP⋅⊕P𝖯𝖧⊆𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯. Second, it is established that BP⋅⊕P⊆P♯P𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯⊆𝖯^ Together, the two parts imply PH⊆BP⋅⊕P⊆P⋅⊕P⊆P♯P𝖯𝖧⊆𝖡𝖯·⊕𝖯⊆𝖯·⊕𝖯⊆𝖯^
