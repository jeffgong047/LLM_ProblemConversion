3: The unit sphere S2 is partitioned into orbits by the action of our group H: two points belong to the same orbit if and only if there is a rotation in H which moves the first point into the second. (Note that the orbit of a point is a dense set in S2.) The axiom of choice can be used to pick exactly one point from every orbit; collect these points into a set M. The action of H on a given orbit is free and transitive and so each orbit can be identified with H. In other words, every point in S2 can be reached in exactly one way by applying the proper rotation from H to the proper element from M. Because of this, the paradoxical decomposition of H yields a paradoxical decomposition of S2 into four pieces A1, A2, A3, A4 as follows: A1=S(a)M∪M∪B_1=S(a)M A2=S(a−1)M∖B_2=S(a^-1)M A3=S(b)M_3=S(b)M A4=S(b−1)M_4=S(b^-1)M where we define S(a)M=s(x)|s∈S(a),x∈M(a)M={s(x)|s(a),x} and likewise for the other sets, and where we define B=a−1M∪a−2M∪…=a^-1M^-2M∪… (The five "paradoxical" parts of F2 were not used directly, as they would leave M as an extra piece after doubling, owing to the presence of the singleton {e}.) The (majority of the) sphere has now been divided into four sets (each one dense on the sphere), and when two of these are rotated, the result is double of what was had before: aA2=A2∪A3∪A4_2=A_2_3_4 bA4=A1∪A2∪A4_4=A_1_2_4 Step
