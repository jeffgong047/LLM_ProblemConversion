progress: 2000: Von Neumann's paper left open the possibility of a paradoxical decomposition of the interior of the unit square with respect to the linear group SL(2,R) (Wagon, Question 7.4). In 2000, Miklós Laczkovich proved that such a decomposition exists.[15] More precisely, let A be the family of all bounded subsets of the plane with non-empty interior and at a positive distance from the origin, and B the family of all planar sets with the property that a union of finitely many translates under some elements of SL(2, R) contains a punctured neighborhood of the origin. Then all sets in the family A are SL(2, R)-equidecomposable, and likewise for the sets in B. It follows that both families consist of paradoxical sets. 2003: It had been known for a long time that the full plane was paradoxical with respect to SA2, and that the minimal number of pieces would equal four provided that there exists a locally commutative free subgroup of SA2. In 2003 Kenzi Satô constructed such a subgroup, confirming that four pieces suffice.[16] 2011: Laczkovich's paper[17] left open the possibility if there exists a free group F of piecewise linear transformations acting on the punctured disk D \{0,0} without fixed points. Grzegorz Tomkowicz constructed such a group,[18] showing that the system of congruences A ≈ B ≈ C ≈ B U C can be realized by means of F and D \{0,0}. 2017: It has been known for a long time that there exists in the hyperbolic plane H2 a set E that is a third, a fourth and ... and a 2ℵ02^ℵ_0-th part of H2. The requirement was satisfied by orientation-preserving isometries of H2. Analogous results were obtained by John Frank Adams[19] and Jan Mycielski[20] who showed that the unit sphere S2 contains a set E that is a half, a third, a fourth and ... and a 2ℵ02^ℵ_0-th part of S2. Grzegorz Tomkowicz[21] showed that Adams and Mycielski construction can be generalized to obtain a set E of H2 with the same properties as in S2. 2017: Von Neumann's paradox concerns the Euclidean plane, but there are also other classical spaces where the paradoxes are possible. For example, one can ask if there is a Banach–Tarski paradox in the hyperbolic plane H2. This was shown by Jan Mycielski and Grzegorz Tomkowicz.[22][23] Tomkowicz[24] proved also that most of the classical paradoxes are an easy consequence of a graph theoretical result and the fact that the groups in question are rich enough. 2018: In 1984, Jan Mycielski and Stan Wagon [25] constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the hyperbolic plane H2 that uses Borel sets. The paradox depends on the existence of a properly discontinuous subgroup of the group of isometries of H2. Similar paradox is obtained by Grzegorz Tomkowicz [26] who constructed a free properly discontinuous subgroup G of the affine group SA(3,Z). The existence of such a group implies the existence of a subset E of Z3 such that for any finite F of Z3 there exists an element g of G such that g(E)=E△F(E)=E, where E△F F denotes the symmetric difference of E and F. 2019: Banach–Tarski paradox uses finitely many pieces in the duplication. In the case of countably many pieces, any two sets with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable using translations. But allowing only Lebesgue measurable pieces one obtains: If A and B are subsets of Rn with non-empty interiors, then they have equal Lebesgue measures if and only if they are countably equidecomposable using Lebesgue measurable pieces. Jan Mycielski and Grzegorz Tomkowicz [27] extended this result to finite dimensional Lie groups and second countable locally compact topological groups that are totally disconnected or have countably many connected components.
