1: Cayley graph of F2, showing decomposition into the sets S(a) and aS(a−1). Traversing a horizontal edge of the graph in the rightward direction represents left multiplication of an element of F2 by a; traversing a vertical edge of the graph in the upward direction represents left multiplication of an element of F2 by b. Elements of the set S(a) are green dots; elements of the set aS(a−1) are blue dots or red dots with blue border. Red dots with blue border are elements of S(a−1), which is a subset of aS(a−1). The free group with two generators a and b consists of all finite strings that can be formed from the four symbols a, a−1, b and b−1 such that no a appears directly next to an a−1 and no b appears directly next to a b−1. Two such strings can be concatenated and converted into a string of this type by repeatedly replacing the "forbidden" substrings with the empty string. For instance: abab−1a−1 concatenated with abab−1a yields abab−1a−1abab−1a, which contains the substring a−1a, and so gets reduced to abab−1bab−1a, which contains the substring b−1b, which gets reduced to abaab−1a. One can check that the set of those strings with this operation forms a group with identity element the empty string e. This group may be called F2. The group F2_2 can be "paradoxically decomposed" as follows: Let S(a) be the subset of F2_2 consisting of all strings that start with a, and define S(a−1), S(b) and S(b−1) similarly. Clearly, F2=e∪S(a)∪S(a−1)∪S(b)∪S(b−1)_2={e}(a)(a^-1)(b)(b^-1) but also F2=aS(a−1)∪S(a),_2=aS(a^-1)(a), and F2=bS(b−1)∪S(b),_2=bS(b^-1)(b), where the notation aS(a−1) means take all the strings in S(a−1) and concatenate them on the left with a. This is at the core of the proof. For example, there may be a string aa−1b^-1b in the set aS(a−1)(a^-1) which, because of the rule that a must not appear next to a−1^-1, reduces to the string b. Similarly, aS(a−1)(a^-1) contains all the strings that start with a−1^-1 (for example, the string aa−1a−1^-1a^-1 which reduces to a−1^-1). In this way, aS(a−1)(a^-1) contains all the strings that start with b, b−1^-1 and a−1^-1, as well as the empty string e. Group F2 has been cut into four pieces (plus the singleton {e}), then two of them "shifted" by multiplying with a or b, then "reassembled" as two pieces to make one copy of F2_2 and the other two to make another copy of F2_2. That is exactly what is intended to do to the ball. Step
