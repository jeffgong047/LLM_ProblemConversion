2: In order to find a free group of rotations of 3D space, i.e. that behaves just like (or "is isomorphic to") the free group F2, two orthogonal axes are taken (e.g. the x and z axes). Then, A is taken to be a rotation of θ=arccos⁡(13)θ=arccos(1/3) about the x axis, and B to be a rotation of θθ about the z axis (there are many other suitable pairs of irrational multiples of π that could be used here as well).[11] The group of rotations generated by A and B will be called H. Let ωω be an element of H that starts with a positive rotation about the z axis, that is, an element of the form ω=…bk3ak2bk1ω=^k_3a^k_2b^k_1 with k1>0,k2,k3,…,kn≠0,n≥1_1>0,_̨2,k_3,…,k_n≠0,≥1. It can be shown by induction that ωω maps the point (1,0,0)(1,0,0) to (k3N,l23N,m3N)(k/3^N,l√(2)/3^N,m/3^N), for some k,l,m∈Z,N∈N,l,m∈ℤ,N∈ℕ. Analyzing k,l,l and m modulo 3, one can show that l≠0≠0. The same argument repeated (by symmetry of the problem) is valid when ωω starts with a negative rotation about the z axis, or a rotation about the x axis. This shows that if ωω is given by a non-trivial word in A and B, then ω≠eω. Therefore, the group H is a free group, isomorphic to F2. The two rotations behave just like the elements a and b in the group F2: there is now a paradoxical decomposition of H. This step cannot be performed in two dimensions since it involves rotations in three dimensions. If two rotations are taken about the same axis, the resulting group is the abelian circle group and does not have the property required in step 1. An alternate arithmetic proof of the existence of free groups in some special orthogonal groups using integral quaternions leads to paradoxical decompositions of the rotation group.[12] Step
