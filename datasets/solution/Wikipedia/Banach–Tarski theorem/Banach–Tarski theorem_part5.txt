proof: Here a proof is sketched which is similar but not identical to that given by Banach and Tarski. Essentially, the paradoxical decomposition of the ball is achieved in four steps: Find a paradoxical decomposition of the free group in two generators. Find a group of rotations in 3-d space isomorphic to the free group in two generators. Use the paradoxical decomposition of that group and the axiom of choice to produce a paradoxical decomposition of the hollow unit sphere. Extend this decomposition of the sphere to a decomposition of the solid unit ball. These steps are discussed in more detail below. Step
