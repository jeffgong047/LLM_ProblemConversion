results: This theorem may be viewed as a generalization of BÃ©zout's identity, which provides a condition under which an integer or a univariate polynomial h may be expressed as an element of the ideal generated by two other integers or univariate polynomials f and g: such a representation exists exactly when h is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of f and g. The AF+BG condition expresses, in terms of divisors (sets of points, with multiplicities), a similar condition under which a homogeneous polynomial H in three variables can be written as an element of the ideal generated by two other polynomials F and G. This theorem is also a refinement, for this particular case, of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which provides a condition expressing that some power of a polynomial h (in any number of variables) belongs to the ideal generated by a finite set of polynomials.
