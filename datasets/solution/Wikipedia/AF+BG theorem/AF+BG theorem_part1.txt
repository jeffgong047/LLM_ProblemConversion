About algebraic curves passing through all intersection points of two other curves This article includes a list of general references, but it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.

(October 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In algebraic geometry the AF+BG theorem (also known as Max Noether's fundamental theorem) is a result of Max Noether that asserts that, if the equation of an algebraic curve in the complex projective plane belongs locally (at each intersection point) to the ideal generated by the equations of two other algebraic curves, then it belongs globally to this ideal.
