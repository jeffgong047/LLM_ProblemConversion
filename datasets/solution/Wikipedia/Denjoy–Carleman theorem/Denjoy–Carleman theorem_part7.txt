division: A function g:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ is said to be regular of order d with respect to xn_n if g(0,xn)=h(xn)xnd(0,x_n)=h(x_n)x_n^d and h(0)≠0(0)≠0. Given g regular of order d with respect to xn_n, a ring An_n of real or complex functions of n variables is said to satisfy the Weierstrass division with respect to g if for every f∈An_n there is q∈A, and h1,h2,…,hd−1∈An−1_1,h_2,…,h_d-1_n-1 such that f=gq+h=gq+h with h(x′,xn)=∑j=0d−1hj(x′)xnj(x',x_n)=∑_j=0^d-1h_j(x')x_n^j. While the ring of analytic functions and the ring of formal power series both satisfy the Weierstrass division property, the same is not true for other quasi-analytic classes. If M is logarithmically convex and CM^M is not equal to the class of analytic function, then CM^M doesn't satisfy the Weierstrass division property with respect to g(x1,x2,…,xn)=x1+x22(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)=x_1+x_2^2.
