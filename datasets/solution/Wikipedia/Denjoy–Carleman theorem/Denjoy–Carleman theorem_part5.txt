theorem: The Denjoy–Carleman theorem, proved by Carleman (1926) after Denjoy (1921) gave some partial results, gives criteria on the sequence M under which CM([a,b]) is a quasi-analytic class. It states that the following conditions are equivalent: CM([a,b]) is quasi-analytic. ∑1/Lj=∞∑1/L_j=∞ where Lj=infk≥j(k⋅Mk1/k)_j=inf_k(k_k^1/k). ∑j1j(Mj∗)−1/j=∞∑_j1/j(M_j^*)^-1/j=∞, where Mj* is the largest log convex sequence bounded above by Mj. ∑jMj−1∗(j+1)Mj∗=∞.∑_jM_j-1^*/(j+1)M_j^*=∞. The proof that the last two conditions are equivalent to the second uses Carleman's inequality. Example: Denjoy (1921) pointed out that if Mn is given by one of the sequences 1,(ln⁡n)n,(ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡n)n,(ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡ln⁡n)n,…,1, ()^n, ()^n (ln)^n, ()^n (ln)^n (lnln)^n,…, then the corresponding class is quasi-analytic. The first sequence gives analytic functions. Additional
