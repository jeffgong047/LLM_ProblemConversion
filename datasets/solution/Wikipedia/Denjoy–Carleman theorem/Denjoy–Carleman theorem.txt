In mathematics, a quasi-analytic class of functions is a generalization of the class of real analytic functions based upon the following fact: If f is an analytic function on an interval [a,b] ⊂ R, and at some point f and all of its derivatives are zero, then f is identically zero on all of [a,b]. Quasi-analytic classes are broader classes of functions for which this statement still holds true.


Definitions[edit]
Let M=Mkk=0∞={M_k}_k=0^∞ be a sequence of positive real numbers. Then the Denjoy-Carleman class of functions CM([a,b]) is defined to be those f ∈ C∞([a,b]) which satisfy

|dkfdxk(x)|≤Ak+1k!Mk|d^kf/dx^k(x)|^k+1k!M_k
for all x ∈ [a,b], some constant A, and all non-negative integers k. If Mk = 1 this is exactly the class of real analytic functions on [a,b]. 
The class CM([a,b]) is said to be quasi-analytic if whenever f ∈ CM([a,b]) and

dkfdxk(x)=0d^kf/dx^k(x)=0
for some point x ∈ [a,b] and all k, then f is identically equal to zero.
A function f is called a quasi-analytic function if f is in some quasi-analytic class.

Quasi-analytic functions of several variables[edit]
For a function f:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ and multi-indexes j=(j1,j2,…,jn)∈Nn=(j_1,j_2,…,j_n)∈ℕ^n, denote |j|=j1+j2+…+jn|j|=j_1+j_2+…+j_n, and 

Dj=∂j∂x1j1∂x2j2…∂xnjn^j=∂^j/_1^j_1_2^j_2…_n^j_n
j!=j1!j2!…jn!!=j_1!j_2!_n!
and 

xj=x1j1x2j2…xnjn.^j=x_1^j_1x_2^j_2_n^j_n.
Then f is called quasi-analytic on the open set U⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n if for every compact K⊂U there is a constant A such that 

|Djf(x)|≤A|j|+1j!M|j||D^jf(x)|^|j|+1j!M_|j|
for all multi-indexes j∈Nn∈ℕ^n and all points x∈K.
The Denjoy-Carleman class of functions of n variables with respect to the sequence M on the set U can be denoted CnM(U)_n^M(U), although other notations abound. 
The Denjoy-Carleman class CnM(U)_n^M(U) is said to be quasi-analytic when the only function in it having all its partial derivatives equal to zero at a point is the function identically equal to zero.
A function of several variables is said to be quasi-analytic when it belongs to a quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class.

Quasi-analytic classes with respect to logarithmically convex sequences[edit]
In the definitions above it is possible to assume that M1=1_1=1 and that the sequence Mk_k is non-decreasing. 
The sequence Mk_k is said to be logarithmically convex, if 

Mk+1/Mk_k+1/M_k is increasing.
When Mk_k is logarithmically convex, then (Mk)1/k(M_k)^1/k is increasing and 

MrMs≤Mr+s_rM_s_r+s for all (r,s)∈N2(r,s)∈ℕ^2.
The quasi-analytic class CnM_n^M with respect to a logarithmically convex sequence M satisfies:

CnM_n^M is a ring. In particular it is closed under multiplication.
CnM_n^M is closed under composition. Specifically, if f=(f1,f2,…fp)∈(CnM)p=(f_1,f_2,_p)∈(C_n^M)^p and g∈CpM_p^M, then g∘f∈CnM_n^M.
The Denjoy–Carleman theorem[edit]
The Denjoy–Carleman theorem, proved by Carleman (1926) after Denjoy (1921) gave some partial results,  gives criteria on the sequence M under which CM([a,b]) is a quasi-analytic class. It states that the following conditions are equivalent: 

CM([a,b]) is quasi-analytic.
∑1/Lj=∞∑1/L_j=∞ where Lj=infk≥j(k⋅Mk1/k)_j=inf_k(k_k^1/k).
∑j1j(Mj∗)−1/j=∞∑_j1/j(M_j^*)^-1/j=∞,  where Mj* is the largest log convex sequence bounded above by Mj.
∑jMj−1∗(j+1)Mj∗=∞.∑_jM_j-1^*/(j+1)M_j^*=∞.
The proof that the last two conditions are equivalent to the second uses Carleman's inequality.
Example: Denjoy (1921) pointed out that if Mn is given by one of the sequences

1,(ln⁡n)n,(ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡n)n,(ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡n)n(ln⁡ln⁡ln⁡n)n,…,1, ()^n, ()^n (ln)^n, ()^n (ln)^n (lnln)^n,…,
then the corresponding class is quasi-analytic. The first sequence gives analytic functions.

Additional properties[edit]
For a logarithmically convex sequence M the following properties of the corresponding class of functions hold:

CM^M contains the analytic functions, and it is equal to it if and only if supj≥1(Mj)1/j<∞sup_j≥1(M_j)^1/j<∞
If N is another logarithmically convex sequence, with Mj≤CjNj_j^jN_j for some constant C, then CM⊂CN^M^N.
CM^M is stable under differentiation if and only if supj≥1(Mj+1/Mj)1/j<∞sup_j≥1(M_j+1/M_j)^1/j<∞.
For any infinitely differentiable function f there are quasi-analytic rings CM^M and CN^N and elements g∈CM^M, and h∈CN^N, such that f=g+h=g+h.
Weierstrass division[edit]
A function g:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ is said to be regular of order d with respect to xn_n if g(0,xn)=h(xn)xnd(0,x_n)=h(x_n)x_n^d and h(0)≠0(0)≠0. Given g regular of order d with respect to xn_n, a ring An_n of real or complex functions of n variables is said to satisfy the Weierstrass division with respect to g if for every f∈An_n there is q∈A, and h1,h2,…,hd−1∈An−1_1,h_2,…,h_d-1_n-1 such that 

f=gq+h=gq+h with h(x′,xn)=∑j=0d−1hj(x′)xnj(x',x_n)=∑_j=0^d-1h_j(x')x_n^j.
While the ring of analytic functions and the ring of formal power series both satisfy the Weierstrass division property, the same is not true for other quasi-analytic classes.
If M is logarithmically convex and CM^M is not equal to the class of analytic function, then CM^M doesn't satisfy the Weierstrass division property with respect to g(x1,x2,…,xn)=x1+x22(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)=x_1+x_2^2.
