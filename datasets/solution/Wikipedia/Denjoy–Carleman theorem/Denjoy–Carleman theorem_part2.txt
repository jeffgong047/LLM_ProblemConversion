Definitions: Let M=Mkk=0∞={M_k}_k=0^∞ be a sequence of positive real numbers. Then the Denjoy-Carleman class of functions CM([a,b]) is defined to be those f ∈ C∞([a,b]) which satisfy |dkfdxk(x)|≤Ak+1k!Mk|d^kf/dx^k(x)|^k+1k!M_k for all x ∈ [a,b], some constant A, and all non-negative integers k. If Mk = 1 this is exactly the class of real analytic functions on [a,b]. The class CM([a,b]) is said to be quasi-analytic if whenever f ∈ CM([a,b]) and dkfdxk(x)=0d^kf/dx^k(x)=0 for some point x ∈ [a,b] and all k, then f is identically equal to zero. A function f is called a quasi-analytic function if f is in some quasi-analytic class. Quasi-analytic functions of several
