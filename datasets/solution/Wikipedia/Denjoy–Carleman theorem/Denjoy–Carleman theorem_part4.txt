sequences: In the definitions above it is possible to assume that M1=1_1=1 and that the sequence Mk_k is non-decreasing. The sequence Mk_k is said to be logarithmically convex, if Mk+1/Mk_k+1/M_k is increasing. When Mk_k is logarithmically convex, then (Mk)1/k(M_k)^1/k is increasing and MrMs≤Mr+s_rM_s_r+s for all (r,s)∈N2(r,s)∈ℕ^2. The quasi-analytic class CnM_n^M with respect to a logarithmically convex sequence M satisfies: CnM_n^M is a ring. In particular it is closed under multiplication. CnM_n^M is closed under composition. Specifically, if f=(f1,f2,…fp)∈(CnM)p=(f_1,f_2,_p)∈(C_n^M)^p and g∈CpM_p^M, then g∘f∈CnM_n^M. The Denjoy–Carleman
