variables: For a function f:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ and multi-indexes j=(j1,j2,…,jn)∈Nn=(j_1,j_2,…,j_n)∈ℕ^n, denote |j|=j1+j2+…+jn|j|=j_1+j_2+…+j_n, and Dj=∂j∂x1j1∂x2j2…∂xnjn^j=∂^j/_1^j_1_2^j_2…_n^j_n j!=j1!j2!…jn!!=j_1!j_2!_n! and xj=x1j1x2j2…xnjn.^j=x_1^j_1x_2^j_2_n^j_n. Then f is called quasi-analytic on the open set U⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n if for every compact K⊂U there is a constant A such that |Djf(x)|≤A|j|+1j!M|j||D^jf(x)|^|j|+1j!M_|j| for all multi-indexes j∈Nn∈ℕ^n and all points x∈K. The Denjoy-Carleman class of functions of n variables with respect to the sequence M on the set U can be denoted CnM(U)_n^M(U), although other notations abound. The Denjoy-Carleman class CnM(U)_n^M(U) is said to be quasi-analytic when the only function in it having all its partial derivatives equal to zero at a point is the function identically equal to zero. A function of several variables is said to be quasi-analytic when it belongs to a quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class. Quasi-analytic classes with respect to logarithmically convex
