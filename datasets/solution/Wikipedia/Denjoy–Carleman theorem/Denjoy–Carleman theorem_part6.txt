properties: For a logarithmically convex sequence M the following properties of the corresponding class of functions hold: CM^M contains the analytic functions, and it is equal to it if and only if supj≥1(Mj)1/j<∞sup_j≥1(M_j)^1/j<∞ If N is another logarithmically convex sequence, with Mj≤CjNj_j^jN_j for some constant C, then CM⊂CN^M^N. CM^M is stable under differentiation if and only if supj≥1(Mj+1/Mj)1/j<∞sup_j≥1(M_j+1/M_j)^1/j<∞. For any infinitely differentiable function f there are quasi-analytic rings CM^M and CN^N and elements g∈CM^M, and h∈CN^N, such that f=g+h=g+h. Weierstrass
