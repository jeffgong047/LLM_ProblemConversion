theorem: Each λnλ_n defines a function λ¯n(B¯)λ_n(B) on B ℬ̃ by taking λ¯n(B¯)=λn(B)λ_n(B)=λ_n(B). This function is well defined, this is it is independent on the representative B of the class B¯B due to the absolute continuity of λnλ_n with respect to m. Moreover λ¯nλ_n is continuous. For every ϵ>0ϵ>0 the set Fk,ϵ=B¯∈B :supn≥1|λ¯k(B¯)−λ¯k+n(B¯)|≤ϵ_k,ϵ={B∈ℬ̃: sup_n≥1|λ_k(B)-λ_k+n(B)|≤ϵ} is closed in B ℬ̃, and by the hypothesis limn→∞λn(B)=λ(B)lim_n→∞λ_n(B)=λ(B) we have that B =⋃k=1∞Fk,ϵℬ̃=⋃_k=1^∞F_k,ϵ By Baire category theorem at least one Fk0,ϵ_k_0,ϵ must contain a non-empty open set of B ℬ̃. This means that there is B0¯∈B B_0∈ℬ̃ and a δ>0δ>0 such that d(B,B0)<δ(B,B_0)<δ implies supn≥1|λ¯k0(B¯)−λ¯k0+n(B¯)|≤ϵsup_n≥1|λ_k_0(B)-λ_k_0+n(B)|≤ϵ On the other hand, any B∈B∈ℬ with m(B)≤δ(B)≤δ can be represented as B=B1∖B2=B_1_2 with d(B1,B0)≤δ(B_1,B_0)≤δ and d(B2,B0)≤δ(B_2,B_0)≤δ. This can be done, for example by taking B1=B∪B0_1=B_0 and B2=B0∖(B∩B0)_2=B_0∖(B_0). Thus, if m(B)≤δ(B)≤δ and k≥k0_0 then |λk(B)|≤|λk0(B)|+|λk0(B)−λk(B)|≤|λk0(B)|+|λk0(B1)−λk(B1)|+|λk0(B2)−λk(B2)|≤|λk0(B)|+2ϵ|λ_k(B)| ≤|λ_k_0(B)|+|λ_k_0(B)-λ_k(B)| ≤|λ_k_0(B)|+|λ_k_0(B_1)-λ_k(B_1)|+|λ_k_0(B_2)-λ_k(B_2)| ≤|λ_k_0(B)|+2ϵ Therefore, by the absolute continuity of λk0λ_k_0 with respect to m, and since ϵϵ is arbitrary, we get that m(B)→0(B)→0 implies λn(B)→0λ_n(B)→0 uniformly in n.. In particular, m(B)→0(B)→0 implies λ(B)→0.λ(B)→0. By the additivity of the limit it follows that λλ is finitely-additive. Then, since limm(B)→0λ(B)=0lim_m(B)→0λ(B)=0 it follows that λλ is actually countably additive.
