theorem: If (S,B,m)(S,ℬ,m) is a measure space with m(S)<∞,(S)<∞, and a sequence λnλ_n of complex measures. Assuming that each λnλ_n is absolutely continuous with respect to m,, and that a for all B∈B∈ℬ the finite limits exist limn→∞λn(B)=λ(B).lim_n→∞λ_n(B)=λ(B). Then the absolute continuity of the λnλ_n with respect to m is uniform in n,, that is, limBm(B)=0lim_Bm(B)=0 implies that limBλn(B)=0lim_Bλ_n(B)=0 uniformly in n.. Also λλ is countably additive on B.ℬ.
