Example: A seven-vertex cycle and its complement, the seven-vertex antihole, showing in each case an optimal coloring and a maximum clique (shown with heavy edges). Since neither graph uses a number of colors equal to its clique size, neither is perfect. Let G be a cycle graph of odd length greater than three (a so-called "odd hole"). Then G requires at least three colors in any coloring, but has no triangle, so it is not perfect. By the perfect graph theorem, the complement of G (an "odd antihole") must therefore also not be perfect. If G is a cycle of five vertices, it is isomorphic to its complement, but this property is not true for longer odd cycles, and it is not as trivial to compute the clique number and chromatic number in an odd antihole as it is in an odd hole. As the strong perfect graph theorem states, the odd holes and odd antiholes turn out to be the minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for the perfect graphs.
