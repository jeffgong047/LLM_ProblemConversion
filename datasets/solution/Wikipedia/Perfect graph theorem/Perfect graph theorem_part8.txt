Notes: ^ This was also conjectured by Berge but only proven much later by Chudnovsky et al. (2006). ^ Kőnig (1931), later rediscovered by Gallai (1958). ^ Golumbic (1980), Section 5.7, "Coloring and other problems on comparability graphs", pp. 132–135. ^ See Golumbic (1980), Lemma 3.1(i), and Reed (2001), Corollary 2.21. ^ Reed (2001), Lemma 2.20. ^ We follow here the exposition of the proof by Reed (2001). Golumbic (1980) notes that much of this line of reasoning was quickly reconstructed by D. R. Fulkerson after hearing of Lovász's result but not seeing his proof.
