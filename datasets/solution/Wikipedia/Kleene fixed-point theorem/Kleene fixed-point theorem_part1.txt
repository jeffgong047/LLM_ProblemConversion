This article is about Kleene's fixed-point theorem in lattice theory. For the fixed-point theorem in computability theory, see Kleene's recursion theorem. Computation of the least fixpoint of f(x) = 1/10x2+atan(x)+1 using Kleene's theorem in the real interval [0,7] with the usual order In the mathematical areas of order and lattice theory, the Kleene fixed-point theorem, named after American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene, states the following: Kleene Fixed-Point Theorem. Suppose (L,⊑)(L,⊑) is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo) with a least element, and let f:L→L:L be a Scott-continuous (and therefore monotone) function. Then f has a least fixed point, which is the supremum of the ascending Kleene chain of f.. The ascending Kleene chain of f is the chain ⊥⊑f(⊥)⊑f(f(⊥))⊑⋯⊑fn(⊥)⊑⋯()(f())⊑⋯^n()⊑⋯ obtained by iterating f on the least element ⊥ of L. Expressed in a formula, the theorem states that lfp(f)=sup(fn(⊥)∣n∈N)lfp(f)=sup({f^n()∈ℕ}) where lfplfp denotes the least fixed point. Although Tarski's fixed point theorem does not consider how fixed points can be computed by iterating f from some seed (also, it pertains to monotone functions on complete lattices), this result is often attributed to Alfred Tarski who proves it for additive functions [1] Moreover, Kleene Fixed-Point Theorem can be extended to monotone functions using transfinite iterations.[2]
