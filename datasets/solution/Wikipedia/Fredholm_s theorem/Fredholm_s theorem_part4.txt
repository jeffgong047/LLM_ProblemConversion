solutions: One of Fredholm's theorems, closely related to the Fredholm alternative, concerns the existence of solutions to the inhomogeneous Fredholm equation λϕ(x)−∫abK(x,y)ϕ(y)dy=f(x).λϕ(x)-∫_a^bK(x,y)ϕ(y) dy=f(x). Solutions to this equation exist if and only if the function f(x)(x) is orthogonal to the complete set of solutions ψn(x){ψ_n(x)} of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation: ∫abψn(x)¯f(x)dx=0∫_a^bψ_n(x)f(x) dx=0 where ψn(x)¯ψ_n(x) is the complex conjugate of ψn(x)ψ_n(x) and the former is one of the complete set of solutions to λψ(y)¯−∫abψ(x)¯K(x,y)dx=0.λψ(y)-∫_a^bψ(x)K(x,y) dx=0. A sufficient condition for this theorem to hold is for K(x,y)(x,y) to be square integrable on the rectangle [a,b]×[a,b][a,b]×[a,b].
