equations: Fredholm's theorem for integral equations is expressed as follows. Let K(x,y)(x,y) be an integral kernel, and consider the homogeneous equations ∫abK(x,y)ϕ(y)dy=λϕ(x)∫_a^bK(x,y)ϕ(y) dy=λϕ(x) and its complex adjoint ∫abψ(x)K(x,y)¯dx=λ¯ψ(y).∫_a^bψ(x)K(x,y) dx=λψ(y). Here, λ¯λ denotes the complex conjugate of the complex number λλ, and similarly for K(x,y)¯K(x,y). Then, Fredholm's theorem is that, for any fixed value of λλ, these equations have either the trivial solution ψ(x)=ϕ(x)=0ψ(x)=ϕ(x)=0 or have the same number of linearly independent solutions ϕ1(x),⋯,ϕn(x)ϕ_1(x),⋯,ϕ_n(x), ψ1(y),⋯,ψn(y)ψ_1(y),⋯,ψ_n(y). A sufficient condition for this theorem to hold is for K(x,y)(x,y) to be square integrable on the rectangle [a,b]×[a,b][a,b]×[a,b] (where a and/or b may be minus or plus infinity). Here, the integral is expressed as a one-dimensional integral on the real number line. In Fredholm theory, this result generalizes to integral operators on multi-dimensional spaces, including, for example, Riemannian manifolds. Existence of
