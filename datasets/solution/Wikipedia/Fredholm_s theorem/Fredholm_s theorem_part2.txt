algebra: Fredholm's theorem in linear algebra is as follows: if M is a matrix, then the orthogonal complement of the row space of M is the null space of M: (row⁡M)⊥=ker⁡M.(rowM)^=. Similarly, the orthogonal complement of the column space of M is the null space of the adjoint: (col⁡M)⊥=ker⁡M∗.(colM)^=^*. Integral
