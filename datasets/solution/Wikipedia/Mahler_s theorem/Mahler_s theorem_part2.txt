Statement: Let (Δf)(x)=f(x+1)−f(x)()(x)=f(x+1)-f(x) be the forward difference operator. Then for any p-adic function f:Zp→Qp:ℤ_p→ℚ_p, Mahler's theorem states that f is continuous if and only if its Newton series converges everywhere to f, so that for all x∈Zp∈ℤ_p we have f(x)=∑n=0∞(Δnf)(0)(xn),(x)=∑_n=0^∞(Δ^nf)(0)x, where (xn)=x(x−1)(x−2)⋯(x−n+1)n!x=x(x-1)(x-2)⋯(x-n+1)/n! is the nth binomial coefficient polynomial. Here, the nth forward difference is computed by the binomial transform, so that(Δnf)(0)=∑k=0n(−1)n−k(nk)f(k).(Δ^nf)(0)=∑_k=0^n(-1)^n-knkf(k).Moreover, we have that f is continuous if and only if the coefficients (Δnf)(0)→0(Δ^nf)(0)→0 in Qpℚ_p as n→∞→∞. It is remarkable that as weak an assumption as continuity is enough in the p-adic setting to establish convergence of Newton series. By contrast, Newton series on the field of complex numbers are far more tightly constrained, and require Carlson's theorem to hold.
