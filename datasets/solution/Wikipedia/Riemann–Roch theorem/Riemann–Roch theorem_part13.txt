embedding: Analyzing this equation further, the Euler characteristic reads as χ(ωC⊗n)=h0(C,ωC⊗n)−h0(C,ωC⊗(ωC⊗n)∨)=h0(C,ωC⊗n)−h0(C,(ωC⊗(n−1))∨)χ(ω_C^) =h^0(C,ω_C^)-h^0(C,ω_C⊗(ω_C^)^∨) =h^0(C,ω_C^)-h^0(C,(ω_C^⊗(n-1))^∨) Since deg⁡(ωC⊗n)=n(2g−2)(ω_C^)=n(2g-2) h0(C,(ωC⊗(n−1))∨)=0^0(C,(ω_C^⊗(n-1))^∨)=0 for n≥3≥3, since its degree is negative for all g≥2≥2, implying it has no global sections, there is an embedding into some projective space from the global sections of ωC⊗nω_C^. In particular, ωC⊗3ω_C^⊗3 gives an embedding into PN≅P(H0(C,ωC⊗3))ℙ^N≅ℙ(H^0(C,ω_C^⊗3)) where N=5g−5−1=5g−6=5g-5-1=5g-6 since h0(ωC⊗3)=6g−6−g+1^0(ω_C^⊗3)=6g-6-g+1. This is useful in the construction of the moduli space of algebraic curves because it can be used as the projective space to construct the Hilbert scheme with Hilbert polynomial HC(t)_C(t).[9] Genus of plane curves with
