curves: The statement for algebraic curves can be proved using Serre duality. The integer ℓ(D)ℓ(D) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle L(D)ℒ(D) associated to D (cf. Cartier divisor). In terms of sheaf cohomology, we therefore have ℓ(D)=dimH0(X,L(D))ℓ(D)=dimH^0(X,ℒ(D)), and likewise ℓ(KX−D)=dim⁡H0(X,ωX⊗L(D)∨)ℓ(𝒦_X-D)=^0(X,ω_X⊗ℒ(D)^∨). But Serre duality for non-singular projective varieties in the particular case of a curve states that H0(X,ωX⊗L(D)∨)^0(X,ω_X⊗ℒ(D)^∨) is isomorphic to the dual H1(X,L(D))∨^1(X,ℒ(D))^∨. The left hand side thus equals the Euler characteristic of the divisor D. When D = 0, we find the Euler characteristic for the structure sheaf is 1−g1-g by definition. To prove the theorem for general divisor, one can then proceed by adding points one by one to the divisor and ensure that the Euler characteristic transforms accordingly to the right hand side.
