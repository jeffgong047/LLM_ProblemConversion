zero: The Riemann sphere (also called complex projective line) is simply connected and hence its first singular homology is zero. In particular its genus is zero. The sphere can be covered by two copies of Cℂ, with transition map being given by C×∋z↦1z∈C×.ℂ^×↦1/z∈ℂ^×. Therefore, the form ω=dzω=dz on one copy of Cℂ extends to a meromorphic form on the Riemann sphere: it has a double pole at infinity, since d(1z)=−1z2dz.(1/z)=-1/z^2 dz. Thus, its divisor K:=div⁡(ω)=−2P:=div(ω)=-2P (where P is the point at infinity). Therefore, the theorem says that the sequence ℓ(n⋅P)ℓ(n) reads 1, 2, 3, ... . This sequence can also be read off from the theory of partial fractions. Conversely if this sequence starts this way, then g must be zero. Genus
