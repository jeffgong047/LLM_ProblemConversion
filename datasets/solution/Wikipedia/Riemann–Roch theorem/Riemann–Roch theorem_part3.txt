theorem: The Riemann–Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface of genus g with canonical divisor K states ℓ(D)−ℓ(K−D)=deg⁡(D)−g+1.ℓ(D)-ℓ(K-D)=(D)-g+1. Typically, the number ℓ(D)ℓ(D) is the one of interest, while ℓ(K−D)ℓ(K-D) is thought of as a correction term (also called index of speciality[2][3]) so the theorem may be roughly paraphrased by saying dimension − correction = degree − genus + 1. Because it is the dimension of a vector space, the correction term ℓ(K−D)ℓ(K-D) is always non-negative, so that ℓ(D)≥deg⁡(D)−g+1.ℓ(D)≥(D)-g+1. This is called Riemann's inequality. Roch's part of the statement is the description of the possible difference between the sides of the inequality. On a general Riemann surface of genus g, K has degree 2g−22g-2, independently of the meromorphic form chosen to represent the divisor. This follows from putting D=K=K in the theorem. In particular, as long as D has degree at least 2g−12g-1, the correction term is 0, so that ℓ(D)=deg⁡(D)−g+1.ℓ(D)=(D)-g+1. The theorem will now be illustrated for surfaces of low genus. There are also a number other closely related theorems: an equivalent formulation of this theorem using line bundles and a generalization of the theorem to algebraic curves.
