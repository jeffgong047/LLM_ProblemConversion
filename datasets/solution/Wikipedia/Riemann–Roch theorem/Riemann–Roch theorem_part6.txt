one: A torus. The next case is a Riemann surface of genus g=1=1, such as a torus C/Λℂ/Λ, where ΛΛ is a two-dimensional lattice (a group isomorphic to Z2ℤ^2). Its genus is one: its first singular homology group is freely generated by two loops, as shown in the illustration at the right. The standard complex coordinate z on C yields a one-form ω=dzω=dz on X that is everywhere holomorphic, i.e., has no poles at all. Therefore, K, the divisor of ωω is zero. On this surface, this sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... ; and this characterises the case g=1=1. Indeed, for D=0=0, ℓ(K−D)=ℓ(0)=1ℓ(K-D)=ℓ(0)=1, as was mentioned above. For D=n⋅P=n with n>0>0, the degree of K−D-D is strictly negative, so that the correction term is 0. The sequence of dimensions can also be derived from the theory of elliptic functions. Genus two and
