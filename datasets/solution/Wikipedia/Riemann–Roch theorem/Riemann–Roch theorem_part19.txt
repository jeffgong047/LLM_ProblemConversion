surfaces: The theorem for compact Riemann surfaces can be deduced from the algebraic version using Chow's Theorem and the GAGA principle: in fact, every compact Riemann surface is defined by algebraic equations in some complex projective space. (Chow's Theorem says that any closed analytic subvariety of projective space is defined by algebraic equations, and the GAGA principle says that sheaf cohomology of an algebraic variety is the same as the sheaf cohomology of the analytic variety defined by the same equations). One may avoid the use of Chow's theorem by arguing identically to the proof in the case of algebraic curves, but replacing L(D)ℒ(D) with the sheaf OD𝒪_D of meromorphic functions h such that all coefficients of the divisor (h)+D(h)+D are nonnegative. Here the fact that the Euler characteristic transforms as desired when one adds a point to the divisor can be read off from the long exact sequence induced by the short exact sequence 0→OD→OD+P→CP→00→𝒪_D→𝒪_D+P→ℂ_P→0 where CPℂ_P is the skyscraper sheaf at P, and the map OD+P→CP𝒪_D+P→ℂ_P returns the −k−1-k-1th Laurent coefficient, where k=D(P)=D(P).[11] Arithmetic Riemann–Roch
