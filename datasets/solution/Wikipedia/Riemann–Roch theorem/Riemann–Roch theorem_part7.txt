beyond: For g=2=2, the sequence mentioned above is 1, 1, ?, 2, 3, ... . It is shown from this that the ? term of degree 2 is either 1 or 2, depending on the point. It can be proven that in any genus 2 curve there are exactly six points whose sequences are 1, 1, 2, 2, ... and the rest of the points have the generic sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, ... In particular, a genus 2 curve is a hyperelliptic curve. For g>2>2 it is always true that at most points the sequence starts with g+1+1 ones and there are finitely many points with other sequences (see Weierstrass points). Riemannâ€“Roch for line
