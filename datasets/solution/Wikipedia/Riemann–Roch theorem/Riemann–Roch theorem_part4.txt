Examples: The theorem will be illustrated by picking a point P on the surface in question and regarding the sequence of numbers ℓ(n⋅P),n≥0ℓ(n),n≥0 i.e., the dimension of the space of functions that are holomorphic everywhere except at P where the function is allowed to have a pole of order at most n. For n=0=0, the functions are thus required to be entire, i.e., holomorphic on the whole surface X. By Liouville's theorem, such a function is necessarily constant. Therefore, ℓ(0)=1ℓ(0)=1. In general, the sequence ℓ(n⋅P)ℓ(n) is an increasing sequence. Genus
