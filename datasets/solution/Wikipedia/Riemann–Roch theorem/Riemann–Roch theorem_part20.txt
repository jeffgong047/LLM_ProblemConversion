theorem: A version of the arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem states that if k is a global field, and f is a suitably admissible function of the adeles of k, then for every idele a, one has a Poisson summation formula: 1|a|∑x∈kf^(x/a)=∑x∈kf(ax).1/|a|∑_xf̂(x/a)=∑_xf(ax). In the special case when k is the function field of an algebraic curve over a finite field and f is any character that is trivial on k, this recovers the geometric Riemann–Roch theorem.[12] Other versions of the arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem make use of Arakelov theory to resemble the traditional Riemann–Roch theorem more exactly.
