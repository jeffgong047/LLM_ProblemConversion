bundles: Using the close correspondence between divisors and holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface, the theorem can also be stated in a different, yet equivalent way: let L be a holomorphic line bundle on X. Let H0(X,L)^0(X,L) denote the space of holomorphic sections of L. This space will be finite-dimensional; its dimension is denoted h0(X,L)^0(X,L). Let K denote the canonical bundle on X. Then, the Riemann–Roch theorem states that h0(X,L)−h0(X,L−1⊗K)=deg⁡(L)+1−g.^0(X,L)-h^0(X,L^-1)=(L)+1-g. The theorem of the previous section is the special case of when L is a point bundle. The theorem can be applied to show that there are g linearly independent holomorphic sections of K, or one-forms on X, as follows. Taking L to be the trivial bundle, h0(X,L)=1^0(X,L)=1 since the only holomorphic functions on X are constants. The degree of L is zero, and L−1^-1 is the trivial bundle. Thus, 1−h0(X,K)=1−g.1-h^0(X,K)=1-g. Therefore, h0(X,K)=g^0(X,K)=g, proving that there are g holomorphic one-forms. Degree of canonical
