polynomial: One of the important consequences of Riemann–Roch is it gives a formula for computing the Hilbert polynomial of line bundles on a curve. If a line bundle Lℒ is ample, then the Hilbert polynomial will give the first degree L⊗nℒ^ giving an embedding into projective space. For example, the canonical sheaf ωCω_C has degree 2g−22g-2, which gives an ample line bundle for genus g≥2≥2.[8] If we set ωC(n)=ωC⊗nω_C(n)=ω_C^ then the Riemann–Roch formula reads χ(ωC(n))=deg⁡(ωC⊗n)−g+1=n(2g−2)−g+1=2ng−2n−g+1=(2n−1)(g−1)χ(ω_C(n)) =(ω_C^)-g+1 =n(2g-2)-g+1 =2ng-2n-g+1 =(2n-1)(g-1) Giving the degree 11 Hilbert polynomial of ωCω_C HωC(t)=2(g−1)t−g+1_ω_C(t)=2(g-1)t-g+1 Because the tri-canonical sheaf ωC⊗3ω_C^⊗3 is used to embed the curve, the Hilbert polynomial HC(t)=HωC⊗3(t)_C(t)=H_ω_C^⊗3(t) is generally considered while constructing the Hilbert scheme of curves (and the moduli space of algebraic curves). This polynomial is HC(t)=(6t−1)(g−1)=6(g−1)t+(1−g)H_C(t) =(6t-1)(g-1) =6(g-1)t+(1-g) and is called the Hilbert polynomial of an genus g curve. Pluricanonical
