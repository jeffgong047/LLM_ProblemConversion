theorem: If φ(t)φ(t) and ψ(t)ψ(t) are integrable functions, such that φ∗ψ=∫0xφ(t)ψ(x−t)dt=0φ*ψ=∫_0^xφ(t)ψ(x-t) dt=0 almost everywhere in the interval 0<x<κ0<x<κ , then there exist λ≥0λ≥0 and μ≥0μ≥0 satisfying λ+μ≥κλ+μ≥κ such that φ(t)=0φ(t)=0 almost everywhere in 0<t<λ0<t<λ and ψ(t)=0ψ(t)=0 almost everywhere in 0<t<μ.0<t<μ. As a corollary, if the integral above is 0 for all x>0,>0, then either φφ or ψψ is almost everywhere 0 in the interval [0,+∞).[0,+∞). Thus the convolution of two functions on [0,+∞)[0,+∞) cannot be identically zero unless at least one of the two functions is identically zero. As another corollary, if φ∗ψ(x)=0φ*ψ(x)=0 for all x∈[0,κ]∈[0,κ] and one of the function φφ or ψψ is almost everywhere not null in this interval, then the other function must be null almost everywhere in [0,κ][0,κ]. The theorem can be restated in the following form: Let φ,ψ∈L1(R)φ,ψ^1(ℝ). Then infsupp⁡φ∗ψ=infsupp⁡φ+infsupp⁡ψinfsuppφ∗ψ=infsuppφ+infsuppψ if the left-hand side is finite. Similarly, supsupp⁡φ∗ψ=supsupp⁡φ+supsupp⁡ψsupsuppφ∗ψ=supsuppφ+supsuppψ if the right-hand side is finite. Above, suppsupp denotes the support of a function and infinf and supsup denote the infimum and supremum. This theorem essentially states that the well-known inclusion supp⁡φ∗ψ⊂supp⁡φ+supp⁡ψsuppφ∗ψ⊂suppφ+suppψ is sharp at the boundary. The higher-dimensional generalization in terms of the convex hull of the supports was proven by Jacques-Louis Lions in 1951:[2] If φ,ψ∈E′(Rn)φ,ψ∈ℰ'(ℝ^n), then c.h.⁡supp⁡φ∗ψ=c.h.⁡supp⁡φ+c.h.⁡supp⁡ψc.h.suppφ∗ψ=c.h.suppφ+c.h.suppψ Above, c.h.c.h. denotes the convex hull of the set and E′(Rn)ℰ'(ℝ^n) denotes the space of distributions with compact support. The original proof by Titchmarsh uses complex-variable techniques, and is based on the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle, Jensen's inequality, Carleman's theorem, and Valiron's theorem. The theorem has since been proven several more times, typically using either real-variable[3][4][5] or complex-variable[6][7][8] methods. Gian-Carlo Rota has stated that no proof yet addresses the theorem's underlying combinatorial structure, which he believes is necessary for complete understanding.[9]
