Theorem relating graph minors and topological embeddings In mathematics, the graph structure theorem is a major result in the area of graph theory. The result establishes a deep and fundamental connection between the theory of graph minors and topological embeddings. The theorem is stated in the seventeenth of a series of 23 papers by Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour. Its proof is very long and involved. Kawarabayashi & Mohar (2007) and Lov√°sz (2006) are surveys accessible to nonspecialists, describing the theorem and its consequences. Setup and motivation for the
