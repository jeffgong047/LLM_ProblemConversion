theorem: Graph structure theorem. For any graph H, there exists a positive integer k such that every H-free graph can be obtained as follows: We start with a list of graphs, where each graph in the list is embedded on a surface on which H does not embed to each embedded graph in the list, we add at most k vortices, where each vortex has depth at most k to each resulting graph we add at most k new vertices (called apexes) and add any number of edges, each having at least one of its endpoints among the apexes. finally, we join via k-clique-sums the resulting list of graphs. Note that steps 1. and 2. result in an empty graph if H is planar, but the bounded number of vertices added in step 3. makes the statement consistent with Corollary 1.
