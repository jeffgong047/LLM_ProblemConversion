Gives the signature of a smooth compact oriented manifold in terms of Pontryagin numbers In differential topology, an area of mathematics, the Hirzebruch signature theorem[1] (sometimes called the Hirzebruch index theorem) is Friedrich Hirzebruch's 1954 result expressing the signature of a smooth closed oriented manifold by a linear combination of Pontryagin numbers called the L-genus. It was used in the proof of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem. Statement of the
