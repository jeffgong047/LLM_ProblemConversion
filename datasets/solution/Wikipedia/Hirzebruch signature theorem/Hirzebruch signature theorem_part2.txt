theorem: The L-genus is the genus for the multiplicative sequence of polynomials associated to the characteristic power series xtanh⁡(x)=∑k≥022kB2k(2k)!x2k=1+x23−x445+⋯.xtanh(x)=∑_k≥02^2kB_2k(2k)!x^2k=1+x^23-x^445+⋯. The first two of the resulting L-polynomials are: L1=13p1_1=13p_1 L2=145(7p2−p12)_2=145(7p_2-p_1^2) (for further L-polynomials see [2] or OEIS: A237111). By taking for the pi_i the Pontryagin classes pi(M)_i(M) of the tangent bundle of a 4n dimensional smooth closed oriented manifold M one obtains the L-classes of M. Hirzebruch showed that the n-th L-class of M evaluated on the fundamental class of M, [M][M], is equal to σ(M)σ(M), the signature of M (i.e. the signature of the intersection form on the 2nth cohomology group of M): σ(M)=⟨Ln(p1(M),…,pn(M)),[M]⟩.σ(M)=_n(p_1(M),…,p_n(M)),[M]⟩.
