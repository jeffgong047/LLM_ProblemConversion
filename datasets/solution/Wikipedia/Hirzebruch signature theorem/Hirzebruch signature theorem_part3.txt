theorem: René Thom had earlier proved that the signature was given by some linear combination of Pontryagin numbers, and Hirzebruch found the exact formula for this linear combination by introducing the notion of the genus of a multiplicative sequence. Since the rational oriented cobordism ring Ω∗SO⊗QΩ_*^SO⊗ℚ is equal to Ω∗SO⊗Q=Q[P2(C),P4(C),…],Ω_*^SO⊗ℚ=ℚ[ℙ^2(ℂ),ℙ^4(ℂ),…], the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes [P2i(C)][ℙ^2i(ℂ)] of the even dimensional complex projective spaces, it is enough to verify that σ(P2i)=1=⟨Li(p1(P2i),…,pn(P2i)),[P2i]⟩σ(ℙ^2i)=1=_i(p_1(ℙ^2i),…,p_n(ℙ^2i)),[ℙ^2i]⟩ for all i.
