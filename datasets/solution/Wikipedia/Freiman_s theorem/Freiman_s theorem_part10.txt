Proof: By the Plünnecke-Ruzsa inequality, |8A−8A|≤K16|A||8A-8A|^16|A|. By Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime N such that |8A−8A|≤N≤2K16|A||8A-8A|≤2K^16|A|. By the Ruzsa modeling lemma, there exists a subset A′' of A of cardinality at least |A|/8|A|/8 such that A′' is Freiman 8-isomorphic to a subset B⊆Z/NZ⊆ℤ/Nℤ. By the generalization of Bogolyubov's lemma, 2B−2B2B-2B contains a proper generalized arithmetic progression of dimension d at most (1/(8⋅2K16))−2=256K32(1/(8·2K^16))^-2=256K^32 and size at least (1/(4d))dN(1/(4d))^dN. Because A′' and B are Freiman 8-isomorphic, 2A′−2A′2A'-2A' and 2B−2B2B-2B are Freiman 2-isomorphic. Then the image under the 2-isomorphism of the proper generalized arithmetic progression in 2B−2B2B-2B is a proper generalized arithmetic progression in 2A′−2A′⊆2A−2A2A'-2A'⊆2A-2A called P. But P+A⊆3A−2A+A⊆3A-2A, since P⊆2A−2A⊆2A-2A. Thus |P+A|≤|3A−2A|≤|8A−8A|≤N≤(4d)d|P||P+A|≤|3A-2A|≤|8A-8A|≤(4d)^d|P| so by the Ruzsa covering lemma A⊆X+P−P+P-P for some X⊆A of cardinality at most (4d)d(4d)^d. Then X+P−P+P-P is contained in a generalized arithmetic progression of dimension |X|+d|X|+d and size at most 2|X|2d|P|≤2|X|+d|2A−2A|≤2|X|+dK4|A|2^|X|2^d|P|≤2^|X|+d|2A-2A|≤2^|X|+dK^4|A|, completing the proof.
