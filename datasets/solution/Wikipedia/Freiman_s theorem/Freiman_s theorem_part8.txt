lemma: Let s≥2≥2 be a positive integer, and ΓΓ and Γ′Γ' be abelian groups. Let A⊆Γ⊆Γ and B⊆Γ′⊆Γ'. A map φ:A→Bφ is a Freiman s-homomorphism if φ(a1)+⋯+φ(as)=φ(a1′)+⋯+φ(as′)φ(a_1)+⋯+φ(a_s)=φ(a_1')+⋯+φ(a_s') whenever a1+⋯+as=a1′+⋯+as′_1+⋯+a_s=a_1'+⋯+a_s' for any a1,…,as,a1′,…,as′∈A_1,…,a_s,a_1',…,a_s'. If in addition φφ is a bijection and φ−1:B→Aφ^-1 is a Freiman s-homomorphism, then φφ is a Freiman s-isomorphism. If φφ is a Freiman s-homomorphism, then φφ is a Freiman t-homomorphism for any positive integer t such that 2≤t≤s2. Then the Ruzsa modeling lemma states the following: Let A be a finite set of integers, and let s≥2≥2 be a positive integer. Let N be a positive integer such that N≥|sA−sA|≥|sA-sA|. Then there exists a subset A′' of A with cardinality at least |A|/s|A|/s such that A′' is Freiman s-isomorphic to a subset of Z/NZℤ/Nℤ. The last statement means there exists some Freiman s-homomorphism between the two subsets. Proof sketch: Choose a prime q sufficiently large such that the modulo-q reduction map πq:Z→Z/qZπ_qℤ→ℤ/qℤ is a Freiman s-isomorphism from A to its image in Z/qZℤ/qℤ. Let ψq:Z/qZ→Zψ_qℤ/qℤ→ℤ be the lifting map that takes each member of Z/qZℤ/qℤ to its unique representative in 1,…,q⊆Z{1,…,q}⊆ℤ. For nonzero λ∈Z/qZλ∈ℤ/qℤ, let ⋅λ:Z/qZ→Z/qZ·λℤ/qℤ→ℤ/qℤ be the multiplication by λλ map, which is a Freiman s-isomorphism. Let B be the image (⋅λ∘πq)(A)(·λ∘π_q)(A). Choose a suitable subset B′' of B with cardinality at least |B|/s|B|/s such that the restriction of ψqψ_q to B′' is a Freiman s-isomorphism onto its image, and let A′⊆A' be the preimage of B′' under ⋅λ∘πq·λ∘π_q. Then the restriction of ψq∘⋅λ∘πqψ_q∘·λ∘π_q to A′' is a Freiman s-isomorphism onto its image ψq(B′)ψ_q(B'). Lastly, there exists some choice of nonzero λλ such that the restriction of the modulo-N reduction Z→Z/NZℤ→ℤ/Nℤ to ψq(B′)ψ_q(B') is a Freiman s-isomorphism onto its image. The result follows after composing this map with the earlier Freiman s-isomorphism. Bohr sets and Bogolyubov's
