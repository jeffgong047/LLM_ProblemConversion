Generalizations: A result due to Ben Green and Imre Ruzsa generalized Freiman's theorem to arbitrary abelian groups. They used an analogous notion to generalized arithmetic progressions, which they called coset progressions. A coset progression of an abelian group G is a set P+H+H for a proper generalized arithmetic progression P and a subgroup H of G. The dimension of this coset progression is defined to be the dimension of P, and its size is defined to be the cardinality of the whole set. Green and Ruzsa showed the following: Let A be a finite set in an abelian group G such that |A+A|≤K|A||A+A||A|. Then A is contained in a coset progression of dimension at most d(K)(K) and size at most f(K)|A|(K)|A|, where f(K)(K) and d(K)(K) are functions of K that are independent of G. Green and Ruzsa provided upper bounds of d(K)=CK4log⁡(K+2)(K)=CK^4log(K+2) and f(K)=eCK4log2⁡(K+2)(K)=e^CK^4log^2(K+2) for some absolute constant C.[8] Terence Tao (2010) also generalized Freiman's theorem to solvable groups of bounded derived length.[9] Extending Freiman’s theorem to an arbitrary nonabelian group is still open. Results for K<2<2, when a set has very small doubling, are referred to as Kneser theorems.[10] See
