Examples: For a finite set A of integers, it is always true that |A+A|≥2|A|−1,|A+A|≥2|A|-1, with equality precisely when A is an arithmetic progression. More generally, suppose A is a subset of a finite proper generalized arithmetic progression P of dimension d such that |P|≤C|A||P||A| for some real C≥1≥1. Then |P+P|≤2d|P||P+P|≤2^d|P|, so that |A+A|≤|P+P|≤2d|P|≤C2d|A|.|A+A|≤|P+P|≤2^d|P|2^d|A|. History of Freiman's
