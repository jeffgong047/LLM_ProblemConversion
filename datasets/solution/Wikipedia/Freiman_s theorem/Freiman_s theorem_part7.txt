lemma: The Ruzsa covering lemma states the following: Let A and S be finite subsets of an abelian group with S nonempty, and let K be a positive real number. Then if |A+S|≤K|S||A+S||S|, there is a subset T of A with at most K elements such that A⊆T+S−S+S-S. This lemma provides a bound on how many copies of S−S-S one needs to cover A, hence the name. The proof is essentially a greedy algorithm: Proof: Let T be a maximal subset of A such that the sets t+S+S for A are all disjoint. Then |T+S|=|T|⋅|S||T+S|=|T|·|S|, and also |T+S|≤|A+S|≤K|S||T+S|≤|A+S||S|, so |T|≤K|T|. Furthermore, for any a∈A, there is some t∈T such that t+S+S intersects a+S+S, as otherwise adding a to T contradicts the maximality of T. Thus a∈T+S−S+S-S, so A⊆T+S−S+S-S.
