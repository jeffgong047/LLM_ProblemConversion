On the approximate structure of sets whose sumset is small In additive combinatorics, Freiman's theorem is a central result which indicates the approximate structure of sets whose sumset is small. It roughly states that if |A+A|/|A||A+A|/|A| is small, then A can be contained in a small generalized arithmetic progression.
