lemma: Though Freiman's theorem applies to sets of integers, the Ruzsa modeling lemma allows one to model sets of integers as subsets of finite cyclic groups. So it is useful to first work in the setting of a finite field, and then generalize results to the integers. The following lemma was proved by Bogolyubov: Let A∈F2n∈𝔽_2^n and let α=|A|/2nα=|A|/2^n. Then 4A4A contains a subspace of F2n𝔽_2^n of dimension at least n−α−2-α^-2. Generalizing this lemma to arbitrary cyclic groups requires an analogous notion to “subspace”: that of the Bohr set. Let R be a subset of Z/NZℤ/Nℤ where N is a prime. The Bohr set of dimension |R||R| and width ϵϵ is Bohr⁡(R,ϵ)=x∈Z/NZ:∀r∈R,|rx/N|≤ϵ,Bohr(R,ϵ)={x∈ℤ/Nℤ:,|rx/N|≤ϵ}, where |rx/N||rx/N| is the distance from rx/N/N to the nearest integer. The following lemma generalizes Bogolyubov's lemma: Let A∈Z/NZ∈ℤ/Nℤ and α=|A|/Nα=|A|/N. Then 2A−2A2A-2A contains a Bohr set of dimension at most α−2α^-2 and width 1/41/4. Here the dimension of a Bohr set is analogous to the codimension of a set in F2n𝔽_2^n. The proof of the lemma involves Fourier-analytic methods. The following proposition relates Bohr sets back to generalized arithmetic progressions, eventually leading to the proof of Freiman's theorem. Let X be a Bohr set in Z/NZℤ/Nℤ of dimension d and width ϵϵ. Then X contains a proper generalized arithmetic progression of dimension at most d and size at least (ϵ/d)dN(ϵ/d)^dN. The proof of this proposition uses Minkowski's theorem, a fundamental result in geometry of numbers.
