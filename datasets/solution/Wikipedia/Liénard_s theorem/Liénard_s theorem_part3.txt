system: The equation can be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We define F(x):=∫0xf(ξ)dξ(x):=∫_0^xf(ξ)dξ x1:=x_1:=x x2:=dxdt+F(x)_2:=dx+F(x) then [x˙1x˙2]=h(x1,x2):=[x2−F(x1)−g(x1)][ ẋ_1; ẋ_2 ]=𝐡(x_1,x_2):=[ x_2-F(x_1); -g(x_1) ] is called a Liénard system. Alternatively, since the Liénard equation itself is also an autonomous differential equation, the substitution v=dxdt=dx leads the Liénard equation to become a first order differential equation: vdvdx+f(x)v+g(x)=0dv+f(x)v+g(x)=0 which is an Abel equation of the second kind.[3][4]
