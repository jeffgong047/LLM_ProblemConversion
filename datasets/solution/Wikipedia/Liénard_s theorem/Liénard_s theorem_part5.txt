theorem: A Liénard system has a unique and stable limit cycle surrounding the origin if it satisfies the following additional properties:[6] g(x) > 0 for all x > 0; limx→∞F(x):=limx→∞∫0xf(ξ)dξ=∞;lim_x→∞F(x):=lim_x→∞∫_0^xf(ξ)dξ∞̄; F(x) has exactly one positive root at some value p, where F(x) < 0 for 0 < x < p and F(x) > 0 and monotonic for x > p.
