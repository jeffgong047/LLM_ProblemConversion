Example: The Van der Pol oscillator d2xdt2−μ(1−x2)dxdt+x=0d^2x^2-μ(1-x^2)dx+x=0 is a Liénard equation. The solution of a Van der Pol oscillator has a limit cycle. Such cycle has a solution of a Liénard equation with negative f(x)(x) at small |x||x| and positive f(x)(x) otherwise. The Van der Pol equation has no exact, analytic solution. Such solution for a limit cycle exists if f(x)(x) is a constant piece-wise function.[5] Liénard's
