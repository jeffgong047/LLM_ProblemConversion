theorem: Let ΩΩ be a bounded domain in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rnℝ^n and let f:Rm→R∪±∞:ℝ^m→ℝ∪{±∞} be a continuous extended real-valued function. Define a nonlinear functional F on functions u:Ω→Rm:Ω→ℝ^mby F[u]=∫Ωf(u(x))dx.[u]=∫_Ωf(u(x)) dx. Then F is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous on the Lp^p space Lp(Ω,Rm)^p(Ω,ℝ^m) for 1<p<+∞1<p<+∞ and weakly-∗ lower semicontinuous on L∞(Ω,Rm)^∞(Ω,ℝ^m) if and only if the function f:Rm→R∪±∞:ℝ^m→ℝ∪{±∞} defined by Rm∋u↦f(u)∈R∪±∞ℝ^m(u)∈ℝ∪{±∞}} is convex.
