theorem: Let λn denote n-dimensional Lebesgue measure on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn and let M denote the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator: for a function f : Rn → R, Mf : Rn → R is defined by Mf(x)=supr>01λn(Br(x))∫Br(x)|f(y)|dλn(y),(x)=sup_r>01/λ^n(B_r(x))∫_B_r(x)|f(y)| dλ^n(y), where Br(x) denotes the open ball of radius r with center x. Then, for each p > 1, there is a constant Cp > 0 such that, for all natural numbers n and functions f ∈ Lp(Rn; R), ‖Mf‖Lp≤Cp‖f‖Lp.Mf_L^p_pf_L^p. In general, a maximal operator M is said to be of strong type (p, p) if ‖Mf‖Lp≤Cp,n‖f‖LpMf_L^p_p,nf_L^p for all f ∈ Lp(Rn; R). Thus, the Stein–Strömberg theorem is the statement that the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator is of strong type (p, p) uniformly with respect to the dimension n.
