Background: The main motivation behind Arakelov geometry is the fact there is a correspondence between prime ideals p∈Spec(Z)𝔭∈Spec(ℤ) and finite places vp:Q∗→R_p:ℚ^*→ℝ, but there also exists a place at infinity v∞_∞, given by the Archimedean valuation, which doesn't have a corresponding prime ideal. Arakelov geometry gives a technique for compactifying Spec(Z)Spec(ℤ) into a complete space Spec(Z)¯Spec(ℤ) which has a prime lying at infinity. Arakelov's original construction studies one such theory, where a definition of divisors is constructor for a scheme X𝔛 of relative dimension 1 over Spec(OK)Spec(𝒪_K) such that it extends to a Riemann surface X∞=X(C)_∞=𝔛(ℂ) for every valuation at infinity. In addition, he equips these Riemann surfaces with Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles over X(C), the complex points of X. This extra Hermitian structure is applied as a substitute for the failure of the scheme Spec(Z) to be a complete variety. Note that other techniques exist for constructing a complete space extending Spec(Z)Spec(ℤ), which is the basis of F1 geometry. Original definition of
