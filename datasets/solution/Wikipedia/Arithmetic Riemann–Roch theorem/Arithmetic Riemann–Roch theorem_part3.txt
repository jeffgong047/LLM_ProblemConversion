divisors: Let K be a field, OK𝒪_K its ring of integers, and X a genus g curve over K with a non-singular model X→Spec(OK)𝔛→Spec(𝒪_K), called an arithmetic surface. Also, we let ∞:K→C∞:K→ℂ be an inclusion of fields (which is supposed to represent a place at infinity). Also, we will let X∞_∞ be the associated Riemann surface from the base change to Cℂ. Using this data, we can define a c-divisor as a formal linear combination D=∑ikiCi+∑∞λ∞X∞=∑_ik_iC_i+∑_∞λ_∞X_∞ where Ci_i is an irreducible closed subset of X𝔛 of codimension 1, ki∈Z_i∈ℤ, and λ∞∈Rλ_∞∈ℝ, and the sum ∑∞∑_∞ represents the sum over every real embedding of K→C→ℂ and over one embedding for each pair of complex embeddings K→C→ℂ. The set of c-divisors forms a group Divc(X)Div_c(𝔛).
