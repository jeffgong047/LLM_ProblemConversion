groups: An arithmetic cycle of codimension p is a pair (Z, g) where Z ∈ Zp(X) is a p-cycle on X and g is a Green current for Z, a higher-dimensional generalization of a Green function. The arithmetic Chow group CH^p(X)CH_p(X) of codimension p is the quotient of this group by the subgroup generated by certain "trivial" cycles.[1] The arithmetic Riemann–Roch
