theorem: The usual Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem describes how the Chern character ch behaves under pushforward of sheaves, and states that ch(f*(E))= f*(ch(E)TdX/Y), where f is a proper morphism from X to Y and E is a vector bundle over f. The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem is similar, except that the Todd class gets multiplied by a certain power series. The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem states ch^(f∗([E]))=f∗(ch^(E)Td^R(TX/Y))ĉĥ(f_*([E]))=f_*(ĉĥ(E)Td^R(T_X/Y)) where X and Y are regular projective arithmetic schemes. f is a smooth proper map from X to Y E is an arithmetic vector bundle over X. ch^ĉĥ is the arithmetic Chern character. TX/Y is the relative tangent bundle Td^T̂d̂ is the arithmetic Todd class Td^R(E)T̂d̂^R(E) is Td^(E)(1−ϵ(R(E)))T̂d̂(E)(1-ϵ(R(E))) R(X) is the additive characteristic class associated to the formal power series ∑m>0moddXmm![2ζ′(−m)+ζ(−m)(11+12+⋯+1m)].∑_m>0oddX^m/m![2ζ'(-m)+ζ(-m)(11+12+⋯+1)].
