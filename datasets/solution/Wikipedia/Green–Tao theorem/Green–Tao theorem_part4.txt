work: Main article: primes in arithmetic progression The proof of the Green–Tao theorem does not show how to find the arithmetic progressions of primes; it merely proves they exist. There has been separate computational work to find large arithmetic progressions in the primes. The Green–Tao paper states 'At the time of writing the longest known arithmetic progression of primes is of length 23, and was found in 2004 by Markus Frind, Paul Underwood, and Paul Jobling: 56211383760397 + 44546738095860 · k; k = 0, 1, . . ., 22.'. On January 18, 2007, Jarosław Wróblewski found the first known case of 24 primes in arithmetic progression:[6] 468,395,662,504,823 + 205,619 · 223,092,870 · n, for n = 0 to 23. The constant 223,092,870 here is the product of the prime numbers up to 23, more compactly written 23# in primorial notation. On May 17, 2008, Wróblewski and Raanan Chermoni found the first known case of 25 primes: 6,171,054,912,832,631 + 366,384 · 23# · n, for n = 0 to 24. On April 12, 2010, Benoît Perichon with software by Wróblewski and Geoff Reynolds in a distributed PrimeGrid project found the first known case of 26 primes (sequence A204189 in the OEIS): 43,142,746,595,714,191 + 23,681,770 · 23# · n, for n = 0 to 25. In September 2019 Rob Gahan and PrimeGrid found the first known case of 27 primes (sequence A327760 in the OEIS): 224,584,605,939,537,911 + 81,292,139 · 23# · n, for n = 0 to 26. Extensions and
