generalizations: Many of the extensions of Szemerédi's theorem hold for the primes as well. Independently, Tao and Ziegler[7] and Cook, Magyar, and Titichetrakun[8][9] derived a multidimensional generalization of the Green–Tao theorem. The Tao–Ziegler proof was also simplified by Fox and Zhao.[10] In 2006, Tao and Ziegler extended the Green–Tao theorem to cover polynomial progressions.[11][12] More precisely, given any integer-valued polynomials P1, ..., Pk in one unknown m all with constant term 0, there are infinitely many integers x, m such that x + P1(m), ..., x + Pk(m) are simultaneously prime. The special case when the polynomials are m, 2m, ..., km implies the previous result that there are length k arithmetic progressions of primes. Tao proved an analogue of the Green–Tao theorem for the Gaussian primes.[13] See
