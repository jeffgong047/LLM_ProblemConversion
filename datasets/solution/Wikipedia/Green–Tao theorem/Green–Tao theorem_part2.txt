Statement: Let π(N)π(N) denote the number of primes less than or equal to N. If A is a subset of the prime numbers such that limsupN→∞|A∩[1,N]|π(N)>0,lim sup_N→∞|A∩[1,N]|/π(N)>0, then for all positive integers k, the set A contains infinitely many arithmetic progressions of length k. In particular, the entire set of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In their later work on the generalized Hardy–Littlewood conjecture, Green and Tao stated and conditionally proved the asymptotic formula (Sk+o(1))N2(log⁡N)k(𝔖_k+o(1))N^2/()^k for the number of k tuples of primes p1<p2<⋯<pk≤N_1<p_2<…<p_k in arithmetic progression.[2] Here, Sk𝔖_k is the constant Sk:=12(k−1)(∏p≤k1p(pp−1)k−1)(∏p>k(1−k−1p)(pp−1)k−1).𝔖_k:=1/2(k-1)(∏_p1/p(p/p-1)^k-1)(∏_p>k(1-k-1/p)(p/p-1)^k-1). The result was made unconditional by Green–Tao [3] and Green–Tao–Ziegler.[4] Overview of the
