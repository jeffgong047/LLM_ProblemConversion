proof: Green and Tao's proof has three main components: Szemerédi's theorem, which asserts that subsets of the integers with positive upper density have arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. It does not a priori apply to the primes because the primes have density zero in the integers. A transference principle that extends Szemerédi's theorem to subsets of the integers which are pseudorandom in a suitable sense. Such a result is now called a relative Szemerédi theorem. A pseudorandom subset of the integers containing the primes as a dense subset. To construct this set, Green and Tao used ideas from Goldston, Pintz, and Yıldırım's work on prime gaps.[5] Once the pseudorandomness of the set is established, the transference principle may be applied, completing the proof. Numerous simplifications to the argument in the original paper[1] have been found. Conlon, Fox & Zhao (2014) provide a modern exposition of the proof. Numerical
