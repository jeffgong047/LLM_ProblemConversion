polygon: See also: Newton polygon Let P(y)=∑ai≠0ai(x)yi(y)=∑_a_i≠0a_i(x)y^i be a polynomial whose nonzero coefficients ai(x)_i(x) are polynomials, power series, or even Puiseux series in x. In this section, the valuation v(ai)(a_i) of ai_i is the lowest exponent of x in ai._i. (Most of what follows applies more generally to coefficients in any valued ring.) For computing the Puiseux series that are roots of P (that is solutions of the functional equation P(y)=0(y)=0), the first thing to do is to compute the valuation of the roots. This is the role of the Newton polygon. Let consider, in a Cartesian plane, the points of coordinates (i,v(ai)).(i,v(a_i)). The Newton polygon of P is the lower convex hull of these points. That is, the edges of the Newton polygon are the line segments joigning two of these points, such that all these points are not below the line supporting the segment (below is, as usually, relative to the value of the second coordinate). Given a Puiseux series y0_0 of valuation v0_0, the valuation of P(y0)(y_0) is at least the minimum of the numbers iv0+v(ai),_0+v(a_i), and is equal to this minimum if this minimum is reached for only one i. So, for y0_0 being a root of P, the minimum must be reached at least twice. That is, there must be two values i1_1 and i2_2 of i such that i1v0+v(ai1)=i2v0+v(ai2),_1v_0+v(a_i_1)=i_2v_0+v(a_i_2), and iv0+v(ai)≥i1v0+v(ai1)_0+v(a_i)_1v_0+v(a_i_1) for every i. That is, (i1,v(ai1))(i_1,v(a_i_1)) and (i2,v(ai2))(i_2,v(a_i_2)) must belong to an edge of the Newton polygon, and v0=−v(ai1)−v(ai2)i1−i2_0=-v(a_i_1)-v(a_i_2)/i_1-i_2 must be the opposite of the slope of this edge. This is a rational number as soon as all valuations v(ai)(a_i) are rational numbers, and this is the reason for introducing rational exponents in Puiseux series. In summary, the valuation of a root of P must be the opposite of a slope of an edge of the Newton polynomial. The initial coefficient of a Puiseux series solution of P(y)=0(y)=0 can easily be deduced. Let ci_i be the initial coefficient of ai(x),_i(x), that is, the coefficient of xv(ai)^v(a_i) in ai(x)._i(x). Let −v0-v_0 be a slope of the Newton polygon, and γx0v0_0^v_0 be the initial term of a corresponding Puiseux series solution of P(y)=0.(y)=0. If no cancellation would occur, then the initial coefficient of P(y)(y) would be ∑i∈Iciγi,∑_ic_iγ^i, where I is the set of the indices i such that (i,v(ai))(i,v(a_i)) belongs to the edge of slope v0_0 of the Newton polygon. So, for having a root, the initial coefficient γγ must be a nonzero root of the polynomial χ(x)=∑i∈Icixiχ(x)=∑_ic_ix^i (this notation will be used in the next section). In summary, the Newton polynomial allows an easy computation of all possible initial terms of Puiseux series that are solutions of P(y)=0.(y)=0. The proof of Newton–Puiseux theorem will consist of starting from these initial terms for computing recursively the next terms of the Puiseux series solutions. Constructive
