characteristic: The Newton–Puiseux theorem is not valid over fields of positive characteristic. For example, the equation X2−X=T−1^2-X=T^-1 has solutions X=T−1/2+12+18T1/2−1128T3/2+⋯=T^-1/2+1/2+1/8T^1/2-1/128T^3/2+⋯ and X=−T−1/2+12−18T1/2+1128T3/2+⋯=-T^-1/2+1/2-1/8T^1/2+1/128T^3/2+⋯ (one readily checks on the first few terms that the sum and product of these two series are 1 and −T−1-T^-1 respectively; this is valid whenever the base field K has characteristic different from 2). As the powers of 2 in the denominators of the coefficients of the previous example might lead one to believe, the statement of the theorem is not true in positive characteristic. The example of the Artin–Schreier equation Xp−X=T−1^p-X=T^-1 shows this: reasoning with valuations shows that X should have valuation −1p-1/p, and if we rewrite it as X=T−1/p+X1=T^-1/p+X_1 then Xp=T−1+X1p,soX1p−X1=T−1/p^p=T^-1+X_1^p,soX_1^p-X_1=T^-1/p and one shows similarly that X1_1 should have valuation −1p2-1/p^2, and proceeding in that way one obtains the series T−1/p+T−1/p2+T−1/p3+⋯;^-1/p+T^-1/p^2+T^-1/p^3+⋯; since this series makes no sense as a Puiseux series—because the exponents have unbounded denominators—the original equation has no solution. However, such Eisenstein equations are essentially the only ones not to have a solution, because, if K is algebraically closed of characteristic p>0>0, then the field of Puiseux series over K is the perfect closure of the maximal tamely ramified extension of K((T))((T)).[4] Similarly to the case of algebraic closure, there is an analogous theorem for real closure: if K is a real closed field, then the field of Puiseux series over K is the real closure of the field of formal Laurent series over K.[5] (This implies the former theorem since any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is the unique quadratic extension of some real-closed field.) There is also an analogous result for p-adic closure: if K is a p-adically closed field with respect to a valuation w, then the field of Puiseux series over K is also p-adically closed.[6] Puiseux expansion of algebraic curves and
