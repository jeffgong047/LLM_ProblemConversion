coefficients: If the base field K is ordered, then the field of Puiseux series over K is also naturally (“lexicographically”) ordered as follows: a non-zero Puiseux series f with 0 is declared positive whenever its valuation coefficient is so. Essentially, this means that any positive rational power of the indeterminate T is made positive, but smaller than any positive element in the base field K. If the base field K is endowed with a valuation w, then we can construct a different valuation on the field of Puiseux series over K by letting the valuation w^(f)ŵ(f) be ω⋅v+w(ck),ω+w(c_k), where v=k/n=k/n is the previously defined valuation (ck_k is the first non-zero coefficient) and ωω is infinitely large (in other words, the value group of w^ŵ is Q×Γℚ×Γ ordered lexicographically, where ΓΓ is the value group of w). Essentially, this means that the previously defined valuation v is corrected by an infinitesimal amount to take into account the valuation w given on the base field. Newton–Puiseux
