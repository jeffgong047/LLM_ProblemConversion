field: Main article: Levi-Civita field The field of Puiseux series is not complete as a metric space. Its completion, called the Levi-Civita field, can be described as follows: it is the field of formal expressions of the form f=∑eceTe,=∑_ec_eT^e, where the support of the coefficients (that is, the set of e such that ce≠0_e≠0) is the range of an increasing sequence of rational numbers that either is finite or tends to +∞+∞. In other words, such series admit exponents of unbounded denominators, provided there are finitely many terms of exponent less than A for any given bound A. For example, ∑k=1+∞Tk+1k∑_k=1^+∞T^k+1/k is not a Puiseux series, but it is the limit of a Cauchy sequence of Puiseux series; in particular, it is the limit of ∑k=1NTk+1k∑_k=1^NT^k+1/k as N→+∞→+∞. However, even this completion is still not "maximally complete" in the sense that it admits non-trivial extensions which are valued fields having the same value group and residue field,[11][12] hence the opportunity of completing it even more.
