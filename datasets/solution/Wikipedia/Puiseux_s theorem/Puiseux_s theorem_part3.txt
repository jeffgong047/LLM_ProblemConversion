Valuation: A nonzero Puiseux series f can be uniquely written as f=∑k=k0+∞ckTk/n=∑_k=k_0^+∞c_kT^k/n with ck0≠0._k_0≠0. The valuation v(f)=k0n(f)=k_0/n of f is the smallest exponent for the natural order of the rational numbers, and the corresponding coefficient ck0_k_0 is called the initial coefficient or valuation coefficient of f. The valuation of the zero series is +∞.+∞. The function v is a valuation and makes the Puiseux series a valued field, with the additive group Qℚ of the rational numbers as its valuation group. As for every valued fields, the valuation defines a ultrametric distance by the formula d(f,g)=exp⁡(−v(f−g)).(f,g)=exp(-v(f-g)). For this distance, the field of Puiseux series is a metric space. The notation f=∑k=k0+∞ckTk/n=∑_k=k_0^+∞c_kT^k/n expresses that a Puiseux is the limit of its partial sums. However, the field of Puiseux series is not complete; see below § Levi–Civita field.
