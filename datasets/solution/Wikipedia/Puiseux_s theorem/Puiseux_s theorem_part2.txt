Definition: If K is a field (such as the complex numbers), a Puiseux series with coefficients in K is an expression of the form f=∑k=k0+∞ckTk/n=∑_k=k_0^+∞c_kT^k/n where n is a positive integer and k0_0 is an integer. In other words, Puiseux series differ from Laurent series in that they allow for fractional exponents of the indeterminate, as long as these fractional exponents have bounded denominator (here n). Just as with Laurent series, Puiseux series allow for negative exponents of the indeterminate as long as these negative exponents are bounded below (here by k0_0). Addition and multiplication are as expected: for example, (T−1+2T−1/2+T1/3+⋯)+(T−5/4−T−1/2+2+⋯)=T−5/4+T−1+T−1/2+2+⋯(T^-1+2T^-1/2+T^1/3+⋯)+(T^-5/4-T^-1/2+2+⋯)=T^-5/4+T^-1+T^-1/2+2+⋯ and (T−1+2T−1/2+T1/3+⋯)⋅(T−5/4−T−1/2+2+⋯)=T−9/4+2T−7/4−T−3/2+T−11/12+4T−1/2+⋯.(T^-1+2T^-1/2+T^1/3+⋯)·(T^-5/4-T^-1/2+2+⋯)=T^-9/4+2T^-7/4-T^-3/2+T^-11/12+4T^-1/2+⋯. One might define them by first "upgrading" the denominator of the exponents to some common denominator N and then performing the operation in the corresponding field of formal Laurent series of T1/N^1/N. The Puiseux series with coefficients in K form a field, which is the union ⋃n>0K((T1/n))⋃_n>0K((T^1/n)) of fields of formal Laurent series in T1/n^1/n (considered as an indeterminate). This yields an alternative definition of the field of Puiseux series in terms of a direct limit. For every positive integer n, let Tn_n be an indeterminate (meant to represent T1/n^1/n), and K((Tn))((T_n)) be the field of formal Laurent series in Tn._n. If m divides n, the mapping Tm↦(Tn)n/m_m↦(T_n)^n/m induces a field homomorphism K((Tm))→K((Tn)),((T_m))((T_n)), and these homomorphisms form a direct system that has the field of Puiseux series as a direct limit. The fact that every field homomorphism is injective shows that this direct limit can be identified with the above union, and that the two definitions are equivalent (up to an isomorphism).
