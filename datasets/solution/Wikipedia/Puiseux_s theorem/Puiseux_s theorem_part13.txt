curves: Let X be an algebraic curve[7] given by an affine equation F(x,y)=0(x,y)=0 over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero, and consider a point p on X which we can assume to be (0,0)(0,0). We also assume that X is not the coordinate axis x=0=0. Then a Puiseux expansion of (the y coordinate of) X at p is a Puiseux series f having positive valuation such that F(x,f(x))=0(x,f(x))=0. More precisely, let us define the branches of X at p to be the points q of the normalization Y of X which map to p. For each such q, there is a local coordinate t of Y at q (which is a smooth point) such that the coordinates x and y can be expressed as formal power series of t, say x=tn+⋯=t^n+⋯ (since K is algebraically closed, we can assume the valuation coefficient to be 1) and y=ctk+⋯=ct^k+⋯: then there is a unique Puiseux series of the form f=cTk/n+⋯=cT^k/n+⋯ (a power series in T1/n^1/n), such that y(t)=f(x(t))(t)=f(x(t)) (the latter expression is meaningful since x(t)1/n=t+⋯(t)^1/n=t+⋯ is a well-defined power series in t). This is a Puiseux expansion of X at p which is said to be associated to the branch given by q (or simply, the Puiseux expansion of that branch of X), and each Puiseux expansion of X at p is given in this manner for a unique branch of X at p.[8][9] This existence of a formal parametrization of the branches of an algebraic curve or function is also referred to as Puiseux's theorem: it has arguably the same mathematical content as the fact that the field of Puiseux series is algebraically closed and is a historically more accurate description of the original author's statement.[10] For example, the curve y2=x3+x2^2=x^3+x^2 (whose normalization is a line with coordinate t and map t↦(t2−1,t3−t)↦(t^2-1,t^3-t)) has two branches at the double point (0,0), corresponding to the points t=+1=+1 and t=−1=-1 on the normalization, whose Puiseux expansions are y=x+12x2−18x3+⋯=x+1/2x^2-1/8x^3+⋯ and y=−x−12x2+18x3+⋯=-x-1/2x^2+1/8x^3+⋯ respectively (here, both are power series because the x coordinate is étale at the corresponding points in the normalization). At the smooth point (−1,0)(-1,0) (which is t=0=0 in the normalization), it has a single branch, given by the Puiseux expansion y=−(x+1)1/2+(x+1)3/2=-(x+1)^1/2+(x+1)^3/2 (the x coordinate ramifies at this point, so it is not a power series). The curve y2=x3^2=x^3 (whose normalization is again a line with coordinate t and map t↦(t2,t3)↦(t^2,t^3)), on the other hand, has a single branch at the cusp point (0,0)(0,0), whose Puiseux expansion is y=x3/2=x^3/2.
