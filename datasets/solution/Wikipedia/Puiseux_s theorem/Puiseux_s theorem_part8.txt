proof: Let suppose that the first term γxv0^v_0 of a Puiseux series solution of P(y)=0(y)=0 has been be computed by the method of the preceding section. It remains to compute z=y−γxv0.=y-^v_0. For this, we set y0=γxv0,_0=^v_0, and write the Taylor expansion of P at z=y−y0:=y-y_0: Q(z)=P(y0+z)=P(y0)+zP′(y0)+⋯+zjP(j)(y0)j!+⋯(z)=P(y_0+z)=P(y_0)+zP'(y_0)+⋯+z^jP^(j)(y_0)/j!+⋯ This is a polynomial in z whose coefficients are Puiseux series in x. One may apply to it the method of the Newton polygon, and iterate for getting the terms of the Puiseux series, one after the other. But some care is required for insuring that v(z)>v0,(z)>v_0, and showing that one get a Puiseux series, that is, that the denominators of the exponents of x remain bounded. The derivation with respect to y does not change the valuation in x of the coefficients; that is, v(P(j)(y0)zj)≥mini(v(ai)+iv0)+j(v(z)−v0),(P^(j)(y_0)z^j)≥min_i(v(a_i)+iv_0)+j(v(z)-v_0), and the equality occurs if and only if χ(j)(γ)≠0,χ^(j)(γ)≠0, where χ(x)χ(x) is the polynomial of the preceding section. If m is the multiplicity of γγ as a root of χ,χ, it results that the inequality is an equality for j=m.=m. The terms such that j>m>m can be forgotten as far as one is concerned by valuations, as v(z)>v0(z)>v_0 and j>m>m imply v(P(j)(y0)zj)≥mini(v(ai)+iv0)+j(v(z)−v0)>v(P(m)(y0)zm).(P^(j)(y_0)z^j)≥min_i(v(a_i)+iv_0)+j(v(z)-v_0)>v(P^(m)(y_0)z^m). This means that, for iterating the method of Newton polygon, one can and one must consider only the part of the Newton polygon whose first coordinates belongs to the interval [0,m].[0,m]. Two cases have to be considered separately and will be the subject of next subsections, the so-called ramified case, where m > 1, and the regular case where m = 1. Regular
