proof: Theorem: Let X be a smooth connected Riemann surface of genus g≥2≥2. Then its automorphism group Aut⁡(X)Aut(X) has size at most 84(g−1)84(g-1). Proof: Assume for now that G=Aut⁡(X)=Aut(X) is finite (this will be proved at the end). Consider the quotient map X→X/G/G. Since G acts by holomorphic functions, the quotient is locally of the form z→zn^n and the quotient X/G/G is a smooth Riemann surface. The quotient map X→X/G/G is a branched cover, and we will see below that the ramification points correspond to the orbits that have a non-trivial stabiliser. Let g0_0 be the genus of X/G/G. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, 2g−2=|G|⋅(2g0−2+∑i=1k(1−1ei))2g-2G|·(2g_0-2+∑_i=1^k(1-1/e_i)) where the sum is over the k ramification points pi∈X/G_i/G for the quotient map X→X/G/G. The ramification index ei_i at pi_i is just the order of the stabiliser group, since eifi=deg⁡(X/X/G)_if_i=(X/ X/G) where fi_i the number of pre-images of pi_i (the number of points in the orbit), and deg⁡(X/X/G)=|G|(X/ X/G)=|G|. By definition of ramification points, ei≥2_i≥2 for all k ramification indices. Now call the righthand side |G|R|G|R and since g≥2≥2 we must have R>0>0. Rearranging the equation we find: If g0≥2_0≥2 then R≥2≥2, and |G|≤(g−1)|G|≤(g-1) If g0=1_0=1, then k≥1≥1 and R≥0+1−1/2=1/2≥0+1-1/2=1/2 so that |G|≤4(g−1)|G|≤4(g-1), If g0=0_0=0, then k≥3≥3 and if k≥5≥5 then R≥−2+k(1−1/2)≥1/2≥-2+k(1-1/2)≥1/2, so that |G|≤4(g−1)|G|≤4(g-1) if k=4=4 then R≥−2+4−1/2−1/2−1/2−1/3=1/6≥-2+4-1/2-1/2-1/2-1/3=1/6, so that |G|≤12(g−1)|G|≤12(g-1), if k=3=3 then write e1=p,e2=q,e3=r_1=p, e_2=q, e_3=r. We may assume 2≤p≤q≤r2≦ leqr. if p≥3≥3 then R≥−2+3−1/3−1/3−1/4=1/12≥-2+3-1/3-1/3-1/4=1/12 so that |G|≤24(g−1)|G|≤24(g-1), if p=2=2 then if q≥4≥4 then R≥−2+3−1/2−1/4−1/5=1/20≥-2+3-1/2-1/4-1/5=1/20 so that |G|≤40(g−1)|G|≤40(g-1), if q=3=3 then R≥−2+3−1/2−1/3−1/7=1/42≥-2+3-1/2-1/3-1/7=1/42 so that |G|≤84(g−1)|G|≤84(g-1). In conclusion, |G|≤84(g−1)|G|≤84(g-1). To show that G is finite, note that G acts on the cohomology H∗(X,C)^*(X,𝐂) preserving the Hodge decomposition and the lattice H1(X,Z)^1(X,𝐙). In particular, its action on V=H0,1(X,C)=H^0,1(X,𝐂) gives a homomorphism h:G→GL⁡(V):G→GL(V) with discrete image h(G)(G). In addition, the image h(G)(G) preserves the natural non-degenerate Hermitian inner product (ω,η)=i∫ω¯∧η(ω,η)=i∫ω̅∧η on V. In particular the image h(G)(G) is contained in the unitary group U⁡(V)⊂GL⁡(V)U(V)⊂GL(V) which is compact. Thus the image h(G)(G) is not just discrete, but finite. It remains to prove that h:G→GL⁡(V):G→GL(V) has finite kernel. In fact, we will prove h is injective. Assume φ∈Gφ acts as the identity on V. If fix⁡(φ)fix(φ) is finite, then by the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, |fix⁡(φ)|=1−2tr⁡(h(φ))+1=2−2tr⁡(idV)=2−2g<0.|fix(φ)|=1-2tr(h(φ))+1=2-2tr(id_V)=2-2g<0. This is a contradiction, and so fix⁡(φ)fix(φ) is infinite. Since fix⁡(φ)fix(φ) is a closed complex sub variety of positive dimension and X is a smooth connected curve (i.e. dimC⁡(X)=1_𝐂(X)=1), we must have fix⁡(φ)=Xfix(φ)=X. Thus φφ is the identity, and we conclude that h is injective and G≅h(G)(G) is finite. Q.E.D. Corollary of the proof: A Riemann surface X of genus g≥2≥2 has 84(g−1)84(g-1) automorphisms if and only if X is a branched cover X→P1→𝐏^1 with three ramification points, of indices 2,3 and 7.
