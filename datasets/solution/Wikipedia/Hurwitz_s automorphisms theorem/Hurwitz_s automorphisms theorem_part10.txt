Notes: ^ Technically speaking, there is an equivalence of categories between the category of compact Riemann surfaces with the orientation-preserving conformal maps and the category of non-singular complex projective algebraic curves with the algebraic morphisms. ^ (Richter) Note each face in the polyhedron consist of multiple faces in the tiling â€“ two triangular faces constitute a square face and so forth, as per this explanatory image.
