engineering: In electrical engineering, Parseval's theorem is often written as: ∫−∞∞|x(t)|2dt=12π∫−∞∞|X(ω)|2dω=∫−∞∞|X(2πf)|2df∫_-∞^∞|x(t)|^2 dt=1/2π∫_-∞^∞|X(ω)|^2 dω=∫_-∞^∞|X(2)|^2 df where X(ω)=Fωx(t)(ω)=ℱ_ω{x(t)} represents the continuous Fourier transform (in normalized, unitary form) of x(t)(t), and ω=2πfω=2 is frequency in radians per second. The interpretation of this form of the theorem is that the total energy of a signal can be calculated by summing power-per-sample across time or spectral power across frequency. For discrete time signals, the theorem becomes: ∑n=−∞∞|x[n]|2=12π∫−ππ|X2π(ϕ)|2dϕ∑_n=-∞^∞|x[n]|^2=1/2π∫_-π^π|X_2π(ϕ)|^2dϕ where X2π_2π is the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of x and ϕϕ represents the angular frequency (in radians per sample) of x. Alternatively, for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the relation becomes: ∑n=0N−1|x[n]|2=1N∑k=0N−1|X[k]|2∑_n=0^N-1|x[n]|^2=1/N∑_k=0^N-1|X[k]|^2 where X[k][k] is the DFT of x[n][n], both of length N. We show the DFT case below. For the other cases, the proof is similar. By using the definition of inverse DFT of X[k][k], we can derive 1N∑k=0N−1|X[k]|2=1N∑k=0N−1X[k]⋅X∗[k]=1N∑k=0N−1[∑n=0N−1x[n]exp⁡(−j2πNkn)]X∗[k]=1N∑n=0N−1x[n][∑k=0N−1X∗[k]exp⁡(−j2πNkn)]=1N∑n=0N−1x[n](N⋅x∗[n])=∑n=0N−1|x[n]|2,1/N∑_k=0^N-1|X[k]|^2 =1/N∑_k=0^N-1X[k]^*[k]=1/N∑_k=0^N-1[∑_n=0^N-1x[n] exp(-j2π/Nk n)] X^*[k] =1/N∑_n=0^N-1x[n][∑_k=0^N-1X^*[k] exp(-j2π/Nk n)]=1/N∑_n=0^N-1x[n](N^*[n]) =∑_n=0^N-1|x[n]|^2, where ∗* represents complex conjugate.
