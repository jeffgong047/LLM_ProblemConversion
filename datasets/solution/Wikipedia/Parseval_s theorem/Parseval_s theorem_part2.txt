theorem: Suppose that A(x)(x) and B(x)(x) are two complex-valued functions on Rℝ of period 2π2π that are square integrable (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) over intervals of period length, with Fourier series A(x)=∑n=−∞∞aneinx(x)=∑_n=-∞^∞a_ne^inx and B(x)=∑n=−∞∞bneinx(x)=∑_n=-∞^∞b_ne^inx respectively. Then ∑n=−∞∞anbn¯=12π∫−ππA(x)B(x)¯dx,∑_n=-∞^∞a_nb_n=1/2π∫_-π^πA(x)B(x) dx, (Eq.1) where i is the imaginary unit and horizontal bars indicate complex conjugation. Substituting A(x)(x) and B(x)¯B(x): ∑n=−∞∞anbn¯=12π∫−ππ(∑n=−∞∞aneinx)(∑n=−∞∞bn¯e−inx)dx=12π∫−ππ(a1ei1x+a2ei2x+⋯)(b1¯e−i1x+b2¯e−i2x+⋯)dx=12π∫−ππ(a1ei1xb1¯e−i1x+a1ei1xb2¯e−i2x+a2ei2xb1¯e−i1x+a2ei2xb2¯e−i2x+⋯)dx=12π∫−ππ(a1b1¯+a1b2¯e−ix+a2b1¯eix+a2b2¯+⋯)dx∑_n=-∞^∞a_nb_n =1/2π∫_-π^π(∑_n=-∞^∞a_ne^inx)(∑_n=-∞^∞b_ne^-inx) dx =1/2π∫_-π^π(a_1e^i1x+a_2e^i2x+⋯)(b_1e^-i1x+b_2e^-i2x+⋯)dx =1/2π∫_-π^π(a_1e^i1xb_1e^-i1x+a_1e^i1xb_2e^-i2x+a_2e^i2xb_1e^-i1x+a_2e^i2xb_2e^-i2x+⋯)dx =1/2π∫_-π^π(a_1b_1+a_1b_2e^-ix+a_2b_1e^ix+a_2b_2+⋯)dx As is the case with the middle terms in this example, many terms will integrate to 00 over a full period of length 2π2π (see harmonics): ∑n=−∞∞anbn¯=12π[a1b1¯x+ia1b2¯e−ix−ia2b1¯eix+a2b2¯x+⋯]−π+π=12π(2πa1b1¯+0+0+2πa2b2¯+⋯)=a1b1¯+a2b2¯+⋯∑_n=-∞^∞a_nb_n =1/2π[a_1b_1x+ia_1b_2e^-ix-ia_2b_1e^ix+a_2b_2x+⋯]_-π^+π =1/2π(2_1b_1+0+0+2_2b_2+⋯) =a_1b_1+a_2b_2+⋯ More generally, if A(x)(x) and B(x)(x) are instead two complex-valued functions on Rℝ of period P that are square integrable (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) over intervals of period length, with Fourier series A(x)=∑n=−∞∞ane2πni(xP)(x)=∑_n=-∞^∞a_ne^2(x/P) and B(x)=∑n=−∞∞bne2πni(xP)(x)=∑_n=-∞^∞b_ne^2(x/P) respectively. Then ∑n=−∞∞anbn¯=1P∫−P/2P/2A(x)B(x)¯dx,∑_n=-∞^∞a_nb_n=1/P∫_-P/2^P/2A(x)B(x) dx, (Eq.2) Even more generally, given an abelian locally compact group G with Pontryagin dual G^, Parseval's theorem says the Pontryagin–Fourier transform is a unitary operator between Hilbert spaces L2(G) and L2(G^) (with integration being against the appropriately scaled Haar measures on the two groups.) When G is the unit circle T, G^ is the integers and this is the case discussed above. When G is the real line Rℝ, G^ is also Rℝ and the unitary transform is the Fourier transform on the real line. When G is the cyclic group Zn, again it is self-dual and the Pontryagin–Fourier transform is what is called discrete Fourier transform in applied contexts. Parseval's theorem can also be expressed as follows: Suppose f(x)(x) is a square-integrable function over [−π,π][-π,π] (i.e., f(x)(x) and f2(x)^2(x) are integrable on that interval), with the Fourier series f(x)≃a02+∑n=1∞(ancos⁡(nx)+bnsin⁡(nx)).(x)≃a_0/2+∑_n=1^∞(a_ncos(nx)+b_nsin(nx)). Then[4][5][6] 1π∫−ππf2(x)dx=a022+∑n=1∞(an2+bn2).1/π∫_-π^πf^2(x) dx=a_0^2/2+∑_n=1^∞(a_n^2+b_n^2). Notation used in
