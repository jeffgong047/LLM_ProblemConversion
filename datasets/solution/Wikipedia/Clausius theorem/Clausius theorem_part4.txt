efficiency: In the heat engine model with two thermal reservoirs (hot and cold reservoirs), the limit of the efficiency of any heat engine η=WQ1η=W/Q_1, where W and Q1_1 are work done by the heat engine and heat transferred from the hot thermal reservoir to the engine, respectively, can be derived by the first law of thermodynamics (i.e., the law of conservation of energy) and the Clausius theorem or inequality. In respecting the abovementioned sign convention of heat, Q1+Q2=W→η=WQ1=1+Q2Q1Q_1+Q_2=W→η=W/Q_1=1+Q_2/Q_1, where Q2_2 is heat transferred from the engine to the cold reservoir. The Clausius inequality Q1T1+Q2T2≤0Q_1/T_1+Q_2/T_2≤0 can be expressed as Q2Q1≤−T2T1Q_2/Q_1≤-T_2/T_1. By substituting this inequality to the above equation results in, η=WQ1≤1−T2T1η=W/Q_1≤1-T_2/T_1. This is the limit of heat engine efficiencies, and the equality of this expression is what is called the Carnot efficiency, that is the efficiency of all reversible heat engines and the maximum efficiency of all heat engines.
