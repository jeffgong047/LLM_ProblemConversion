Proof: The temperature that enters in the denominator of the integrand in the Clausius inequality is the temperature of the external thermal reservoir with which the system exchanges heat. At each instant of the process, the system is in contact with an external reservoir. Because of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in each infinitesimal heat exchange process between the system and the reservoirs, the net change in entropy of the "universe", so to say, is dSTotal=dSSys+dSRes≥0_Total=dS_Sys+dS_Res≥0, where Sys and Res stand for System and Reservoir, respectively. In the proof of the Clausius theorem or inequality, a sign convention of heat is used; in the perspective of an object under consideration, when heat is absorbed by the object then the heat is positive, while when heat leaves from the object then the heat is negative. When the system takes heat from a hotter (hot) reservoir by an infinitesimal amount δQ1_1(≥0≥0), for the net change in entropy dSTotal1_Total_1 to be positive or zero (i.e., non-negative) in this step (called the step 1 here) to fulfill the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the temperature of the hot reservoir THot_Hot needs to be equal to or greater than the temperature of the system at that instant; if the temperature of the system is given by T1_1 at that instant, then dSSys1=δQ1T1_Sys_1=_1/T_1 as the entropy change in the system at the instant, and THot≥T1_Hot_1 forces us to have: −dSRes1=δQ1THot≤δQ1T1=dSSys1-dS_Res_1=_1/T_Hot≤_1/T_1=dS_Sys_1 This means the magnitude of the entropy "loss" from the hot reservoir, |dSRes1|=δQ1THot|dS_Res_1|=_1/T_Hot is equal to or less than the magnitude of the entropy "gain" dSSys1=δQ1T1_Sys_1=_1/T_1(≥0≥0) by the system, so the net entropy change dSTotal1_Total_1 is zero or positive. Similarly, when the system at temperature T2_2 expels heat in magnitude |δQ2|=−δQ2|_2|=-_2 (δQ2≤0_2≤0) into a colder (cold) reservoir (at temperature TCold≤T2_Cold_2) in an infinitesimal step (called the step 2), then again, for the Second Law of Thermodynamics to hold, one would have, in a very similar manner:−dSRes2=δQ2TCold≤δQ2T2=dSSys2-dS_Res_2=_2/T_Cold≤_2/T_2=dS_Sys_2Here, the amount of heat 'absorbed' by the system is given by δQ2_2 ≤0≤0, signifying that heat is actually transferring (leaving) from the system to the cold reservoir, with dSSys2≤0_Sys_2≤0. The magnitude of the entropy gained by the cold reservoir dSRes2=−δQ2Tcold_Res_2=-_2/T_cold is equal to or greater than the magnitude of the entropy loss of the system |dSSys2||dS_Sys_2|, so the net entropy change dSTotal2_Total_2 is also zero or positive in this case. Because the total change in entropy for the system is zero in a thermodynamic cyclic process where all state functions of the system are reset or returned to initial values (values at the process starts) upon the completion of each cycle, if one adds all the infinitesimal steps of heat intake from and heat expulsion to the reservoirs, signified by the previous two equations, with the temperature of each reservoir at each instant given by Tsurr_surr, one gets −∮dSRes=∮δQTsurr≤∮dSSys=0.-_Res=∮/T_surr≤_Sys=0. In particular, ∮δQTsurr≤0,∮/T_surr≤0, which was to be proven (and is now proven). In summary, (the inequality in the third statement below, being obviously guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics, which is the basis of our calculation), ∮dSRes≥0,_Res≥0, ∮dSSys=0_Sys=0 (as a cyclic process), ∮dSTotal=∮dSRes+∮dSSys≥0._Total=_Res+_Sys≥0. For a reversible cyclic process, there is no generation of entropy in each of the infinitesimal heat transfer processes since there is practically no temperature difference between the system and the thermal reservoirs (I.e., the system entropy change and the reservoirs entropy change is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign at any instant.), so the following equality holds, ∮δQrevT=0,∮_rev/T=0, ∮dSRes=0,_Res=0, ∮dSSys=0_Sys=0 (as a cyclic process), ∮dSTotal=∮dSRes+∮dSSys=0._Total=_Res+_Sys=0. The Clausius inequality is a consequence of applying the second law of thermodynamics at each infinitesimal stage of heat transfer, and is thus in a sense a weaker condition than the Second Law itself.
