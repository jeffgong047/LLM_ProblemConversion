The closed integral is carried out along a thermodynamic process path from the initial/final state to the same initial/final state (thermodynamic cycle). In principle, the closed integral can start and end at an arbitrary point along the path. The Clausius theorem or inequality obviously implies ∮dSRes≥0_Res≥0 per thermodynamic cycle, meaning that the entropy of the reservoirs increases or does not change, and never decreases, per cycle. For multiple thermal reservoirs with different temperatures (T1,T2,…,TN)(T_1,T_2,…,T_N) interacting a thermodynamic system undergoing a thermodynamic cycle, the Clausius inequality can be written as the following for expression clarity: −∮dSRes=∮(∑n=1NδQnTn)≤0.-_Res=∮(∑_n=1^N_n/T_n)≤0. where δQn_n is an infinitesimal heat from the reservoir n to the system. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds,[1] and the reversible case is used to introduce the state function known as entropy. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero per cycle, so the fact that this integral is equal to zero per cycle in a reversible process implies that there is some function (entropy) whose infinitesimal change is δQT/T. The generalized "inequality of Clausius"[2] dSsys≥δQTsurr_sys≥/T_surr for dSsys_sys as an infinitesimal change in entropy of a system (denoted by sys) under consideration applies not only to cyclic processes, but to any process that occurs in a closed system. The Clausius inequality is a consequence of applying the second law of thermodynamics at each infinitesimal stage of heat transfer. The Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir.[3] Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around.[4]
