Extension of the Schwarz lemma for hyperbolic geometry In mathematics, the Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem is an extension of the Schwarz lemma for hyperbolic geometry, such as the Poincaré half-plane model. The Schwarz–Pick lemma states that every holomorphic function from the unit disk U to itself, or from the upper half-plane H to itself, will not increase the Poincaré distance between points. The unit disk U with the Poincaré metric has negative Gaussian curvature −1. In 1938, Lars Ahlfors generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces: Theorem (Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick). Let U be the unit disk with Poincaré metric ρρ; let S be a Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric σσ whose Gaussian curvature is ≤ −1; let f:U→S:U be a holomorphic function. Then σ(f(z1),f(z2))≤ρ(z1,z2)σ(f(z_1),f(z_2))≤ρ(z_1,z_2) for all z1,z2∈U._1,z_2. A generalization of this theorem was proved by Shing-Tung Yau in 1973.[1]
