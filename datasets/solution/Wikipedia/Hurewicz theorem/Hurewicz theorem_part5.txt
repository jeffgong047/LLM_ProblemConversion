version: For any triad of spaces (X;A,B)(X;A,B) (i.e., a space X and subspaces A, B) and integer k>2>2 there exists a homomorphism h∗:πk(X;A,B)→Hk(X;A,B)_*π_k(X;A,B)_k(X;A,B) from triad homotopy groups to triad homology groups. Note that Hk(X;A,B)≅Hk(X∪(C(A∪B)))._k(X;A,B)_k(X∪(C(A))). The Triadic Hurewicz Theorem states that if X, A, B, and C=A∩B=A are connected, the pairs (A,C)(A,C) and (B,C)(B,C) are (p−1)(p-1)-connected and (q−1)(q-1)-connected, respectively, and the triad (X;A,B)(X;A,B) is (p+q−2)(p+q-2)-connected, then Hk(X;A,B)=0_k(X;A,B)=0 for k<p+q−2<p+q-2 and Hp+q−1(X;A)_p+q-1(X;A) is obtained from πp+q−1(X;A,B)π_p+q-1(X;A,B) by factoring out the action of π1(A∩B)π_1(A) and the generalised Whitehead products. The proof of this theorem uses a higher homotopy van Kampen type theorem for triadic homotopy groups, which requires a notion of the fundamental catncat^n-group of an n-cube of spaces. Simplicial set
