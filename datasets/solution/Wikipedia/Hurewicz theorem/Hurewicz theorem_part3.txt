version: For any path-connected space X and positive integer n there exists a group homomorphism h∗:πn(X)→Hn(X),_*π_n(X)_n(X), called the Hurewicz homomorphism, from the n-th homotopy group to the n-th homology group (with integer coefficients). It is given in the following way: choose a canonical generator un∈Hn(Sn)_n_n(S^n), then a homotopy class of maps f∈πn(X)∈π_n(X) is taken to f∗(un)∈Hn(X)_*(u_n)_n(X). The Hurewicz theorem states cases in which the Hurewicz homomorphism is an isomorphism. For n≥2≥2, if X is (n−1)(n-1)-connected (that is: πi(X)=0π_i(X)=0 for all i<n<n), then Hi (X)=0H̃_̃ĩ(X)=0 for all i<n<n, and the Hurewicz map h∗:πn(X)→Hn(X)_*π_n(X)_n(X) is an isomorphism.[1]: 366, Thm.4.32 This implies, in particular, that the homological connectivity equals the homotopical connectivity when the latter is at least 1. In addition, the Hurewicz map h∗:πn+1(X)→Hn+1(X)_*π_n+1(X)_n+1(X) is an epimorphism in this case.[1]: 390, ? For n=1=1, the Hurewicz homomorphism induces an isomorphism h ∗:π1(X)/[π1(X),π1(X)]→H1(X)h̃_*π_1(X)/[π_1(X),π_1(X)]_1(X), between the abelianization of the first homotopy group (the fundamental group) and the first homology group.
