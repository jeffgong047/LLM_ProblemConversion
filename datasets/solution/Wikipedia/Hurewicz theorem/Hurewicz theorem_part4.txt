version: For any pair of spaces (X,A)(X,A) and integer k>1>1 there exists a homomorphism h∗:πk(X,A)→Hk(X,A)_*π_k(X,A)_k(X,A) from relative homotopy groups to relative homology groups. The Relative Hurewicz Theorem states that if both X and A are connected and the pair is (n−1)(n-1)-connected then Hk(X,A)=0_k(X,A)=0 for k<n<n and Hn(X,A)_n(X,A) is obtained from πn(X,A)π_n(X,A) by factoring out the action of π1(A)π_1(A). This is proved in, for example, Whitehead (1978) by induction, proving in turn the absolute version and the Homotopy Addition Lemma. This relative Hurewicz theorem is reformulated by Brown & Higgins (1981) as a statement about the morphism πn(X,A)→πn(X∪CA),π_n(X,A)→π_n(X), where CA denotes the cone of A. This statement is a special case of a homotopical excision theorem, involving induced modules for n>2>2 (crossed modules if n=2=2), which itself is deduced from a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem for relative homotopy groups, whose proof requires development of techniques of a cubical higher homotopy groupoid of a filtered space.
