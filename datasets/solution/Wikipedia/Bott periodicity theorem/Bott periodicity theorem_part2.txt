result: Bott showed that if O(∞)(∞) is defined as the inductive limit of the orthogonal groups, then its homotopy groups are periodic:[1] πn(O(∞))≃πn+8(O(∞))π_n(O(∞))≃π_n+8(O(∞)) and the first 8 homotopy groups are as follows: π0(O(∞))≃Z2π1(O(∞))≃Z2π2(O(∞))≃0π3(O(∞))≃Zπ4(O(∞))≃0π5(O(∞))≃0π6(O(∞))≃0π7(O(∞))≃Zπ_0(O(∞)) ≃ℤ_2 π_1(O(∞)) ≃ℤ_2 π_2(O(∞)) ≃0 π_3(O(∞)) ≃ℤ π_4(O(∞)) ≃0 π_5(O(∞)) ≃0 π_6(O(∞)) ≃0 π_7(O(∞)) ≃ℤ Context and
