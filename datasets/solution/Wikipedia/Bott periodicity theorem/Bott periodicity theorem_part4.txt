spaces: For the theory associated to the infinite unitary group, U, the space BU is the classifying space for stable complex vector bundles (a Grassmannian in infinite dimensions). One formulation of Bott periodicity describes the twofold loop space, Ω2BUΩ^2BU of BU. Here, ΩΩ is the loop space functor, right adjoint to suspension and left adjoint to the classifying space construction. Bott periodicity states that this double loop space is essentially BU again; more precisely, Ω2BU≃Z×BUΩ^2BU≃ℤ is essentially (that is, homotopy equivalent to) the union of a countable number of copies of BU. An equivalent formulation is Ω2U≃U.Ω^2U. Either of these has the immediate effect of showing why (complex) topological K-theory is a 2-fold periodic theory. In the corresponding theory for the infinite orthogonal group, O, the space BO is the classifying space for stable real vector bundles. In this case, Bott periodicity states that, for the 8-fold loop space, Ω8BO≃Z×BO;Ω^8BO≃ℤ; or equivalently, Ω8O≃O,Ω^8O, which yields the consequence that KO-theory is an 8-fold periodic theory. Also, for the infinite symplectic group, Sp, the space BSp is the classifying space for stable quaternionic vector bundles, and Bott periodicity states that Ω8BSp≃Z×BSp;Ω^8BSp≃ℤ×BSp; or equivalently Ω8Sp≃Sp.Ω^8Sp≃Sp. Thus both topological real K-theory (also known as KO-theory) and topological quaternionic K-theory (also known as KSp-theory) are 8-fold periodic theories. Geometric model of loop
