spaces: One elegant formulation of Bott periodicity makes use of the observation that there are natural embeddings (as closed subgroups) between the classical groups. The loop spaces in Bott periodicity are then homotopy equivalent to the symmetric spaces of successive quotients, with additional discrete factors of Z. Over the complex numbers: U×U⊂U⊂U×U.. Over the real numbers and quaternions: O×O⊂O⊂U⊂Sp⊂Sp×Sp⊂Sp⊂U⊂O⊂O×O.⊂Sp⊂Sp×Sp⊂Sp. These sequences corresponds to sequences in Clifford algebras – see classification of Clifford algebras; over the complex numbers: C⊕C⊂C⊂C⊕C.ℂ⊕ℂ⊂ℂ⊂ℂ⊕ℂ. Over the real numbers and quaternions: R⊕R⊂R⊂C⊂H⊂H⊕H⊂H⊂C⊂R⊂R⊕R,ℝ⊕ℝ⊂ℝ⊂ℂ⊂ℍ⊂ℍ⊕ℍ⊂ℍ⊂ℂ⊂ℝ⊂ℝ⊕ℝ, where the division algebras indicate "matrices over that algebra". As they are 2-periodic/8-periodic, they can be arranged in a circle, where they are called the Bott periodicity clock and Clifford algebra clock. The Bott periodicity results then refine to a sequence of homotopy equivalences: For complex K-theory: ΩU≃Z×BU=Z×U/(U×U)Ω(Z×BU)≃U=(U×U)/U ≃ℤ=ℤ/(U) Ω(ℤ) =(U)/U For real and quaternionic KO- and KSp-theories: Ω(Z×BO)≃O=(O×O)/OΩ(Z×BSp)≃Sp=(Sp×Sp)/SpΩO≃O/UΩSp≃Sp⁡/UΩ(O/U)≃U/SpΩ(Sp⁡/U)≃U/OΩ(U/Sp)≃Z×BSp=Z×Sp⁡/(Sp×Sp)Ω(U/O)≃Z×BO=Z×O/(O×O)Ω(ℤ) =(O)/O Ω(ℤ×BSp) ≃Sp=(Sp×Sp)/Sp /U ΩSp ≃Sp/U Ω(O/U) /Sp Ω(Sp/U) /O Ω(U/Sp) ≃ℤ×BSp=ℤ×Sp/(Sp×Sp) Ω(U/O) ≃ℤ=ℤ/(O) The resulting spaces are homotopy equivalent to the classical reductive symmetric spaces, and are the successive quotients of the terms of the Bott periodicity clock. These equivalences immediately yield the Bott periodicity theorems.
