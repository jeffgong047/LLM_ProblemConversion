numbers: Riemann's explicit formula for the number of primes less than a given number in terms of a sum over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function says that the magnitude of the oscillations of primes around their expected position is controlled by the real parts of the zeros of the zeta function. In particular the error term in the prime number theorem is closely related to the position of the zeros. For example, if β is the upper bound of the real parts of the zeros, then[4] π(x)−li⁡(x)=O(xβlog⁡x).π(x)-li(x)=O(x^β). It is already known that 1/2 ≤ β ≤ 1.[5] Von Koch (1901) proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies the "best possible" bound for the error of the prime number theorem. A precise version of Koch's result, due to Schoenfeld (1976), says that the Riemann hypothesis implies |π(x)−li⁡(x)|<18πxlog⁡(x),forallx≥2657,|π(x)-li(x)|<1/8π√(x)log(x), forallx≥2657, where π(x)π(x) is the prime-counting function, li⁡(x)li(x) is the logarithmic integral function, and log⁡(x)log(x) is the natural logarithm of x. Schoenfeld (1976) also showed that the Riemann hypothesis implies |ψ(x)−x|<18πxlog2⁡x,forallx≥73.2,|ψ(x)-x|<1/8π√(x)log^2x, forallx≥73.2, where ψ(x)ψ(x) is Chebyshev's second function. Dudek (2014) proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies that for all x≥2≥2 there is a prime p satisfying x−4πxlog⁡x<p≤x-4/π√(x)<p. The constant 4/π may be reduced to (1 + ε) provided that x is taken to be sufficiently large. This is an explicit version of a theorem of Cramér. Growth of arithmetic
