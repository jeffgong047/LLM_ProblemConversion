zeros: The functional equation combined with the argument principle implies that the number of zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part between 0 and T is given by N(T)=1πArg⁡(ξ(s))=1πArg⁡(Γ(s2)π−s2ζ(s)s(s−1)/2)(T)=1/πArg(ξ(s))=1/πArg(Γ(s2)π^-s/2ζ(s)s(s-1)/2) for s=1/2+iT, where the argument is defined by varying it continuously along the line with Im(s)=T, starting with argument 0 at ∞+iT. This is the sum of a large but well understood term 1πArg⁡(Γ(s2)π−s/2s(s−1)/2)=T2πlog⁡T2π−T2π+7/8+O(1/T)1/πArg(Γ(s2)π^-s/2s(s-1)/2)=T/2πlogT/2π-T/2π+7/8+O(1/T) and a small but rather mysterious term S(T)=1πArg⁡(ζ(1/2+iT))=O(log⁡T).(T)=1/πArg(ζ(1/2+iT))=O(). So the density of zeros with imaginary part near T is about log(T)/2π, and the function S describes the small deviations from this. The function S(t) jumps by 1 at each zero of the zeta function, and for t ≥ 8 it decreases monotonically between zeros with derivative close to −log t. Trudgian (2014) proved that, if T>e>e, then |N(T)−T2πlog⁡T2πe|≤0.112log⁡T+0.278log⁡log⁡T+3.385+0.2T|N(T)-T/2πlogT/2|≤0.112+0.278log+3.385+0.2/T. Karatsuba (1996) proved that every interval (T, T+H] for H≥T2782+ε^27/82+ε contains at least H(log⁡T)13e−clog⁡log⁡T()^1/3e^-c√(log) points where the function S(t) changes sign. Selberg (1946) showed that the average moments of even powers of S are given by ∫0T|S(t)|2kdt=(2k)!k!(2π)2kT(log⁡log⁡T)k+O(T(log⁡log⁡T)k−1/2).∫_0^T|S(t)|^2kdt=(2k)!/k!(2π)^2kT(log)^k+O(T(log)^k-1/2). This suggests that S(T)/(log log T)1/2 resembles a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 2π2 (Ghosh (1983) proved this fact). In particular |S(T)| is usually somewhere around (log log T)1/2, but occasionally much larger. The exact order of growth of S(T) is not known. There has been no unconditional improvement to Riemann's original bound S(T)=O(log T), though the Riemann hypothesis implies the slightly smaller bound S(T)=O(log T/log log T).[13] The true order of magnitude may be somewhat less than this, as random functions with the same distribution as S(T) tend to have growth of order about log(T)1/2. In the other direction it cannot be too small: Selberg (1946) showed that S(T) ≠ o((log T)1/3/(log log T)7/3), and assuming the Riemann hypothesis Montgomery showed that S(T) ≠ o((log T)1/2/(log log T)1/2). Numerical calculations confirm that S grows very slowly: |S(T)| < 1 for T < 280, |S(T)| < 2 for T < 6800000, and the largest value of |S(T)| found so far is not much larger than 3.[26] Riemann's estimate S(T) = O(log T) implies that the gaps between zeros are bounded, and Littlewood improved this slightly, showing that the gaps between their imaginary parts tend to 0.
