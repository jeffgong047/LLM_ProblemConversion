theory: Main article: Hilbert–Pólya conjecture Hilbert and Pólya suggested that one way to derive the Riemann hypothesis would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(s) would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups. Odlyzko (1987) showed that the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function shares some statistical properties with the eigenvalues of random matrices drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. This gives some support to the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture. In 1999, Michael Berry and Jonathan Keating conjectured that there is some unknown quantization H^Ĥ of the classical Hamiltonian H = xp so that ζ(1/2+iH^)=0ζ(1/2+iĤ)=0 and even more strongly, that the Riemann zeros coincide with the spectrum of the operator 1/2+iH^1/2+iĤ. This is in contrast to canonical quantization, which leads to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle σxσp≥ℏ2σ_xσ_p≥ħ/2 and the natural numbers as spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator. The crucial point is that the Hamiltonian should be a self-adjoint operator so that the quantization would be a realization of the Hilbert–Pólya program. In a connection with this quantum mechanical problem Berry and Connes had proposed that the inverse of the potential of the Hamiltonian is connected to the half-derivative of the function N(s)=1πArg⁡ξ(1/2+is)(s)=1/πArgξ(1/2+i√(s)) then, in Berry–Connes approach[22] V−1(x)=4πd1/2N(x)dx1/2.^-1(x)=√(4π)d^1/2N(x)/dx^1/2. This yields a Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are the square of the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros, and also that the functional determinant of this Hamiltonian operator is just the Riemann Xi function. In fact the Riemann Xi function would be proportional to the functional determinant (Hadamard product) det(H+1/4+s(s−1))(H+1/4+s(s-1)) as proved by Connes and others, in this approach ξ(s)ξ(0)=det(H+s(s−1)+1/4)det(H+1/4).ξ(s)/ξ(0)=(H+s(s-1)+1/4)/(H+1/4). The analogy with the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields suggests that the Hilbert space containing eigenvectors corresponding to the zeros might be some sort of first cohomology group of the spectrum Spec (Z) of the integers. Deninger (1998) described some of the attempts to find such a cohomology theory.[23] Zagier (1981) constructed a natural space of invariant functions on the upper half plane that has eigenvalues under the Laplacian operator that correspond to zeros of the Riemann zeta function—and remarked that in the unlikely event that one could show the existence of a suitable positive definite inner product on this space, the Riemann hypothesis would follow. Cartier (1982) discussed a related example, where due to a bizarre bug a computer program listed zeros of the Riemann zeta function as eigenvalues of the same Laplacian operator. Schumayer & Hutchinson (2011) surveyed some of the attempts to construct a suitable physical model related to the Riemann zeta function. Lee–Yang
