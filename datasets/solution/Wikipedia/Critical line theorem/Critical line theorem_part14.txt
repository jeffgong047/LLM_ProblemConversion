totient: In 1983 J. L. Nicolas proved that φ(n)<e−γnlog⁡log⁡nφ(n)<e^-γn/log for infinitely many n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function and γ is Euler's constant. Ribenboim remarks that: "The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption."[19] Generalizations and
