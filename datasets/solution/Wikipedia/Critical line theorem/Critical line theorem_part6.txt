functions: The Riemann hypothesis implies strong bounds on the growth of many other arithmetic functions, in addition to the primes counting function above. One example involves the Möbius function μ. The statement that the equation 1ζ(s)=∑n=1∞μ(n)ns1/ζ(s)=∑_n=1^∞μ(n)/n^s is valid for every s with real part greater than 1/2, with the sum on the right hand side converging, is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. From this we can also conclude that if the Mertens function is defined by M(x)=∑n≤xμ(n)(x)=∑_nμ(n) then the claim that M(x)=O(x12+ε)(x)=O(x^1/2+ε) for every positive ε is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (J. E. Littlewood, 1912; see for instance: paragraph 14.25 in Titchmarsh (1986)). (For the meaning of these symbols, see Big O notation.) The determinant of the order n Redheffer matrix is equal to M(n), so the Riemann hypothesis can also be stated as a condition on the growth of these determinants. Littlewood's result has been improved several times since then, by Edmund Landau,[6] Edward Charles Titchmarsh,[7] Helmut Maier and Hugh Montgomery,[8] and Kannan Soundararajan.[9] Soundararajan's result is that M(x)=O(x1/2exp⁡((log⁡x)1/2(log⁡log⁡x)14).(x)=O(x^1/2exp(()^1/2(log)^14). The Riemann hypothesis puts a rather tight bound on the growth of M, since Odlyzko & te Riele (1985) disproved the slightly stronger Mertens conjecture |M(x)|≤x.|M(x)|≤√(x). Another closely related result is due to Björner (2011), that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex determined by the lattice of integers under divisibility is o(n1/2+ϵ)(n^1/2+ϵ) for all ϵ>0ϵ>0 (see incidence algebra). The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to many other conjectures about the rate of growth of other arithmetic functions aside from μ(n). A typical example is Robin's theorem,[10] which states that if σ(n) is the sigma function, given by σ(n)=∑d∣ndσ(n)=∑_dd then σ(n)<eγnlog⁡log⁡nσ(n)<e^γnlog for all n > 5040 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true, where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. A related bound was given by Jeffrey Lagarias in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that: σ(n)<Hn+log⁡(Hn)eHnσ(n)<H_n+log(H_n)e^H_n for every natural number n > 1, where Hn_n is the nth harmonic number.[11] The Riemann hypothesis is also true if and only if the inequality nφ(n)<eγlog⁡log⁡n+eγ(4+γ−log⁡4π)log⁡nn/φ(n)<e^γlog+e^γ(4+γ-log4π)/√() is true for all n ≥ p120569# where φ(n) is Euler's totient function and p120569# is the product of the first 120569 primes.[12] Another example was found by Jérôme Franel, and extended by Landau (see Franel & Landau (1924)). The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to several statements showing that the terms of the Farey sequence are fairly regular. One such equivalence is as follows: if Fn is the Farey sequence of order n, beginning with 1/n and up to 1/1, then the claim that for all ε > 0 ∑i=1m|Fn(i)−im|=O(n12+ϵ)∑_i=1^m|F_n(i)-im|=O(n^1/2+ϵ) is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Here m=∑i=1nϕ(i)=∑_i=1^nϕ(i) is the number of terms in the Farey sequence of order n. For an example from group theory, if g(n) is Landau's function given by the maximal order of elements of the symmetric group Sn of degree n, then Massias, Nicolas & Robin (1988) showed that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound log⁡g(n)<Li−1⁡(n)(n)<√(Li^-1(n)) for all sufficiently large n.
