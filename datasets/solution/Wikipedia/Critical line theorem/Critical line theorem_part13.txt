conjecture: This is the conjecture (first stated in article 303 of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae) that there are only finitely many imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. One way to prove it would be to show that as the discriminant D → −∞ the class number h(D) → ∞. The following sequence of theorems involving the Riemann hypothesis is described in Ireland & Rosen 1990, pp. 358–361: Theorem (Hecke; 1918) — Let D < 0 be the discriminant of an imaginary quadratic number field K. Assume the generalized Riemann hypothesis for L-functions of all imaginary quadratic Dirichlet characters. Then there is an absolute constant C such that h(D)>C|D|log⁡|D|.(D)>C√(|D|)/log|D|. Theorem (Deuring; 1933) — If the RH is false then h(D) > 1 if |D| is sufficiently large. Theorem (Mordell; 1934) — If the RH is false then h(D) → ∞ as D → −∞. Theorem (Heilbronn; 1934) — If the generalized RH is false for the L-function of some imaginary quadratic Dirichlet character then h(D) → ∞ as D → −∞. (In the work of Hecke and Heilbronn, the only L-functions that occur are those attached to imaginary quadratic characters, and it is only for those L-functions that GRH is true or GRH is false is intended; a failure of GRH for the L-function of a cubic Dirichlet character would, strictly speaking, mean GRH is false, but that was not the kind of failure of GRH that Heilbronn had in mind, so his assumption was more restricted than simply GRH is false.) In 1935, Carl Siegel later strengthened the result without using RH or GRH in any way.[citation needed] Growth of Euler's
