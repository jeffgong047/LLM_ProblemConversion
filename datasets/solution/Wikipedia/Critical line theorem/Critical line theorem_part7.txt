function: The Riemann hypothesis has various weaker consequences as well; one is the Lindelöf hypothesis on the rate of growth of the zeta function on the critical line, which says that, for any ε > 0, ζ(12+it)=O(tε),ζ(1/2+it)=O(t^ε), as t→∞→∞. The Riemann hypothesis also implies quite sharp bounds for the growth rate of the zeta function in other regions of the critical strip. For example, it implies that eγ≤limsupt→+∞|ζ(1+it)|log⁡log⁡t≤2eγ^γ≤lim sup_t→+∞|ζ(1+it)|/log≤2e^γ 6π2eγ≤limsupt→+∞1/|ζ(1+it)|log⁡log⁡t≤12π2eγ6/π^2e^γ≤lim sup_t→+∞1/|ζ(1+it)|/log≤12/π^2e^γ so the growth rate of ζ(1+it) and its inverse would be known up to a factor of 2.[13] Large prime gap
