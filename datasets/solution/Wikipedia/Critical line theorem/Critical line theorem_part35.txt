regions: The most extensive computer search by Platt and Trudgian[17] for counter examples of the Riemann hypothesis has verified it for |t|≤3.0001753328⋅1012|t|≤3.0001753328·10^12. Beyond that zero-free regions are known as inequalities concerning σ + i t, which can be zeroes. The oldest version is from De la Vallée-Poussin (1899–1900), who proved there is a region without zeroes that satisfies 1 − σ ≥ C/log(t) for some positive constant C. In other words, zeros cannot be too close to the line σ = 1: there is a zero-free region close to this line. This has been enlarged by several authors using methods such as Vinogradov's mean-value theorem. The most recent paper[27] by Mossinghoff, Trudgian and Yang is from December 2022 and provides four zero-free regions that improved the previous results of Kevin Ford from 2002, Mossinghoff and Trudgian themselves from 2015 and Pace Nielsen's slight improvement of Ford from October 2022: σ≥1−15.558691log⁡|t|σ≥1-1/5.558691log|t| whenever |t|≥2|t|≥2, σ≥1−155.241(log⁡|t|)2/3(log⁡log⁡|t|)1/3σ≥1-1/55.241(log|t|)^2/3(loglog|t|)^1/3 whenever |t|≥3|t|≥3 (largest known region in the bound 3.0001753328⋅1012≤|t|≤exp⁡(64.1)≈6.89⋅10273.0001753328·10^12≤|t|≤exp(64.1)≈6.89·10^27), σ≥1−0.04962−0.01961.15+log⁡3+16log⁡t+log⁡log⁡t0.685+log⁡3+16log⁡t+1.155⋅log⁡log⁡tσ≥1-0.04962-0.0196/1.15+log3+1/6+log/0.685+log3+1/6+1.155·log whenever |t|≥1.88⋅1014|t|≥1.88·10^14 (largest known region in the bound exp⁡(64.1)≤|t|≤exp⁡(1000)≈1.97⋅10434exp(64.1)≤|t|≤exp(1000)≈1.97·10^434) and σ≥1−0.0503527164(log⁡|t|)+7.096+0.0349(27164(log⁡|t|)+7.096)2σ≥1-0.05035/27/164(log|t|)+7.096+0.0349/(27/164(log|t|)+7.096)^2 whenever |t|≥exp⁡(1000)|t|≥exp(1000) (largest known region in its own bound) The paper also has a improvement to the second zero-free region, whose bounds are unknown on account of |t||t| being merely assumed to be "sufficiently large" to fulfill the requirements of the paper's proof.
