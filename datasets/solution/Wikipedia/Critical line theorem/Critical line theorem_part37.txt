conjectures: In 1914 Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it) has infinitely many real zeros. The next two conjectures of Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood on the distance between real zeros of ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it) and on the density of zeros of ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it) on the interval (T,T+H](T,T+H] for sufficiently large T>0>0, and H=Ta+ε=T^a+ε and with as small as possible value of a>0>0, where ε>0ε>0 is an arbitrarily small number, open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function: For any ε>0ε>0 there exists a lower bound T0=T0(ε)>0_0=T_0(ε)>0 such that for T≥T0_0 and H=T14+ε=T^14+ε the interval (T,T+H](T,T+H] contains a zero of odd order of the function ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it). Let N(T)(T) be the total number of real zeros, and N0(T)_0(T) be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function ζ(12+it) ζ(12+it) lying on the interval (0,T](0,T] . For any ε>0ε>0 there exists T0=T0(ε)>0_0=T_0(ε)>0 and some c=c(ε)>0=c(ε)>0, such that for T≥T0_0 and H=T12+ε=T^12+ε the inequality N0(T+H)−N0(T)≥cH_0(T+H)-N_0(T) is true. Selberg's zeta function
