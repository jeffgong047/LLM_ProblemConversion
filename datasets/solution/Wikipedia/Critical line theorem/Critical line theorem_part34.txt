Vallée-Poussin: Hadamard (1896) and de la Vallée-Poussin (1896) independently proved that no zeros could lie on the line Re(s) = 1. Together with the functional equation and the fact that there are no zeros with real part greater than 1, this showed that all non-trivial zeros must lie in the interior of the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1. This was a key step in their first proofs of the prime number theorem. Both the original proofs that the zeta function has no zeros with real part 1 are similar, and depend on showing that if ζ(1+it) vanishes, then ζ(1+2it) is singular, which is not possible. One way of doing this is by using the inequality |ζ(σ)3ζ(σ+it)4ζ(σ+2it)|≥1|ζ(σ)^3ζ(σ+it)^4ζ(σ+2it)|≥1 for σ > 1, t real, and looking at the limit as σ → 1. This inequality follows by taking the real part of the log of the Euler product to see that |ζ(σ+it)|=exp⁡ℜ∑pnp−n(σ+it)n=exp⁡∑pnp−nσcos⁡(tlog⁡pn)n,|ζ(σ+it)|=exp∑_p^np^-n(σ+it)/n=exp∑_p^np^-nσcos(t^n)/n, where the sum is over all prime powers pn, so that |ζ(σ)3ζ(σ+it)4ζ(σ+2it)|=exp⁡∑pnp−nσ3+4cos⁡(tlog⁡pn)+cos⁡(2tlog⁡pn)n|ζ(σ)^3ζ(σ+it)^4ζ(σ+2it)|=exp∑_p^np^-nσ3+4cos(t^n)+cos(2t^n)/n which is at least 1 because all the terms in the sum are positive, due to the inequality 3+4cos⁡(θ)+cos⁡(2θ)=2(1+cos⁡(θ))2≥0.3+4cos(θ)+cos(2θ)=2(1+cos(θ))^2≥0.
