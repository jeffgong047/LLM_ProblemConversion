function: The Riemann zeta function is defined for complex s with real part greater than 1 by the absolutely convergent infinite series ζ(s)=∑n=1∞1ns=11s+12s+13s+⋯ζ(s)=∑_n=1^∞1/n^s=1/1^s+1/2^s+1/3^s+⋯ Leonhard Euler already considered this series in the 1730s for real values of s, in conjunction with his solution to the Basel problem. He also proved that it equals the Euler product ζ(s)=∏pprime11−p−s=11−2−s⋅11−3−s⋅11−5−s⋅11−7−s⋅11−11−s⋯ζ(s)=∏_pprime1/1-p^-s=1/1-2^-s·1/1-3^-s·1/1-5^-s·1/1-7^-s·1/1-11^-s⋯ where the infinite product extends over all prime numbers p.[3] The Riemann hypothesis discusses zeros outside the region of convergence of this series and Euler product. To make sense of the hypothesis, it is necessary to analytically continue the function to obtain a form that is valid for all complex s. Because the zeta function is meromorphic, all choices of how to perform this analytic continuation will lead to the same result, by the identity theorem. A first step in this continuation observes that the series for the zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function satisfy the relation (1−22s)ζ(s)=η(s)=∑n=1∞(−1)n+1ns=11s−12s+13s−⋯,(1-2/2^s)ζ(s)=η(s)=∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n+1/n^s=1/1^s-1/2^s+1/3^s-⋯, within the region of convergence for both series. However, the zeta function series on the right converges not just when the real part of s is greater than one, but more generally whenever s has positive real part. Thus, the zeta function can be redefined as η(s)/(1−2/2s)η(s)/(1-2/2^s), extending it from Re(s) > 1 to a larger domain: Re(s) > 0, except for the points where 1−2/2s1-2/2^s is zero. These are the points s=1+2πin/log⁡2=1+2/log2 where n can be any nonzero integer; the zeta function can be extended to these values too by taking limits (see Dirichlet eta function § Landau's problem with ζ(s) = η(s)/0 and solutions), giving a finite value for all values of s with positive real part except for the simple pole at s = 1. In the strip 0 < Re(s) < 1 this extension of the zeta function satisfies the functional equation ζ(s)=2sπs−1sin⁡(πs2)Γ(1−s)ζ(1−s).ζ(s)=2^sπ^s-1 sin(/2) Gamma(1-s) zeta(1-s). One may then define ζ(s) for all remaining nonzero complex numbers s (Re(s) ≤ 0 and s ≠ 0) by applying this equation outside the strip, and letting ζ(s) equal the right-hand side of the equation whenever s has non-positive real part (and s ≠ 0). If s is a negative even integer then ζ(s) = 0 because the factor sin(πs/2) vanishes; these are the trivial zeros of the zeta function. (If s is a positive even integer this argument does not apply because the zeros of the sine function are cancelled by the poles of the gamma function as it takes negative integer arguments.) The value ζ(0) = −1/2 is not determined by the functional equation, but is the limiting value of ζ(s) as s approaches zero. The functional equation also implies that the zeta function has no zeros with negative real part other than the trivial zeros, so all non-trivial zeros lie in the critical strip where s has real part between 0 and 1.
