conjecture: Main article: Selberg's zeta function conjecture Atle Selberg (1942) investigated the problem of Hardy–Littlewood 2 and proved that for any ε > 0 there exists such T0=T0(ε)>0_0=T_0(ε)>0 and c = c(ε) > 0, such that for T≥T0_0 and H=T0.5+ε=T^0.5+ε the inequality N(T+H)−N(T)≥cHlog⁡T(T+H)-N(T) is true. Selberg conjectured that this could be tightened to H=T0.5=T^0.5. A. A. Karatsuba (1984a, 1984b, 1985) proved that for a fixed ε satisfying the condition 0 < ε < 0.001, a sufficiently large T and H=Ta+ε=T^a+ε, a=2782=13−1246=2782=13-1246, the interval (T, T+H) contains at least cH log(T) real zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it) and therefore confirmed the Selberg conjecture. The estimates of Selberg and Karatsuba can not be improved in respect of the order of growth as T → ∞. Karatsuba (1992) proved that an analog of the Selberg conjecture holds for almost all intervals (T, T+H], H=Tε=T^ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small fixed positive number. The Karatsuba method permits to investigate zeros of the Riemann zeta function on "supershort" intervals of the critical line, that is, on the intervals (T, T+H], the length H of which grows slower than any, even arbitrarily small degree T. In particular, he proved that for any given numbers ε, ε1ε_1 satisfying the conditions 0<ε,ε1<10<ε,ε_1<1 almost all intervals (T, T+H] for H≥exp⁡(log⁡T)ε≥exp{()^ε} contain at least H(log⁡T)1−ε1()^1-ε_1 zeros of the function ζ(12+it)ζ(12+it). This estimate is quite close to the one that follows from the Riemann hypothesis. Numerical
