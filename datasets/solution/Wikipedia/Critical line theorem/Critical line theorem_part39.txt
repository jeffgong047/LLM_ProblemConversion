calculations: The function π−s2Γ(s2)ζ(s)π^-s/2Γ(s2)ζ(s) has the same zeros as the zeta function in the critical strip, and is real on the critical line because of the functional equation, so one can prove the existence of zeros exactly on the real line between two points by checking numerically that the function has opposite signs at these points. Usually one writes ζ(12+it)=Z(t)e−iθ(t)ζ(12+it)=Z(t)e^-iθ(t) where Hardy's Z function and the Riemann–Siegel theta function θ are uniquely defined by this and the condition that they are smooth real functions with θ(0)=0. By finding many intervals where the function Z changes sign one can show that there are many zeros on the critical line. To verify the Riemann hypothesis up to a given imaginary part T of the zeros, one also has to check that there are no further zeros off the line in this region. This can be done by calculating the total number of zeros in the region using Turing's method and checking that it is the same as the number of zeros found on the line. This allows one to verify the Riemann hypothesis computationally up to any desired value of T (provided all the zeros of the zeta function in this region are simple and on the critical line). These calculations can also be used to estimate π(x)π(x) for finite ranges of x. For example, using the latest result from 2020 (zeros up to height 3×10123×10^12), it has been shown that |π(x)−li⁡(x)|<18πxlog⁡(x),for2657≤x≤1.101×1026.|π(x)-li(x)|<1/8π√(x)log(x), for2657≤1.101×10^26. In general, this inequality holds if x≥2657≥2657 and 9.06log⁡log⁡xxlog⁡x≤T,9.06/loglogx√(x/logx), where T is the largest known value such that the Riemann hypothesis is true for all zeros ρρ with ℑ(ρ)∈(0,T](ρ)∈(0,T].[29] Some calculations of zeros of the zeta function are listed below, where the "height" of a zero is the magnitude of its imaginary part, and the height of the nth zero is denoted by γn. So far all zeros that have been checked are on the critical line and are simple. (A multiple zero would cause problems for the zero finding algorithms, which depend on finding sign changes between zeros.) For tables of the zeros, see Haselgrove & Miller (1960) or Odlyzko. Year Number of zeros Author 1859? 3 B. Riemann used the Riemann–Siegel formula (unpublished, but reported in Siegel 1932). 1903 15 J. P. Gram (1903) used Euler–Maclaurin formula and discovered Gram's law. He showed that all 10 zeros with imaginary part at most 50 range lie on the critical line with real part 1/2 by computing the sum of the inverse 10th powers of the roots he found. 1914 79 (γn ≤ 200) R. J. Backlund (1914) introduced a better method of checking all the zeros up to that point are on the line, by studying the argument S(T) of the zeta function. 1925 138 (γn ≤ 300) J. I. Hutchinson (1925) found the first failure of Gram's law, at the Gram point g126. 1935 195 E. C. Titchmarsh (1935) used the recently rediscovered Riemann–Siegel formula, which is much faster than Euler–Maclaurin summation. It takes about O(T3/2+ε) steps to check zeros with imaginary part less than T, while the Euler–Maclaurin method takes about O(T2+ε) steps. 1936 1041 E. C. Titchmarsh (1936) and L. J. Comrie were the last to find zeros by hand. 1953 1104 A. M. Turing (1953) found a more efficient way to check that all zeros up to some point are accounted for by the zeros on the line, by checking that Z has the correct sign at several consecutive Gram points and using the fact that S(T) has average value 0. This requires almost no extra work because the sign of Z at Gram points is already known from finding the zeros, and is still the usual method used. This was the first use of a digital computer to calculate the zeros. 1956 15000 D. H. Lehmer (1956) discovered a few cases where the zeta function has zeros that are "only just" on the line: two zeros of the zeta function are so close together that it is unusually difficult to find a sign change between them. This is called "Lehmer's phenomenon", and first occurs at the zeros with imaginary parts 7005.063 and 7005.101, which differ by only .04 while the average gap between other zeros near this point is about 1. 1956 25000 D.

J. te Riele 1986 1500000001 van de Lune, te Riele & Winter (1986) gave some statistical data about the zeros and give several graphs of Z at places where it has unusual behavior. 1987 A few of large (~1012) height A. M. Odlyzko (1987) computed smaller numbers of zeros of much larger height, around 1012, to high precision to check Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture. 1992 A few of large (~1020) height A. M. Odlyzko (1992) computed a 175 million zeros of heights around 1020 and a few more of heights around 2×1020, and gave an extensive discussion of the results. 1998 10000 of large (~1021) height A. M.
