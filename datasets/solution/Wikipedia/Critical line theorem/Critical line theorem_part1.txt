Conjecture on zeros of the zeta function For the musical term, see Riemannian theory. This plot of Riemann's zeta (ζ) function (here with argument z) shows trivial zeros where ζ(z) = 0, a pole where ζ(z) = ∞∞, the critical line of nontrivial zeros with Re(z) = 1/2 and slopes of absolute values. The real part (red) and imaginary part (blue) of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) along the critical line in the complex plane with real part Re(s) = 1/2. The first nontrivial zeros, where ζ(s) equals zero, occur where both curves touch the horizontal x-axis, for complex numbers with imaginary parts Im(s) equalling ±14.135, ±21.022 and ±25.011. Riemann zeta function along the critical line with Re(s) = 1/2. Real values are shown on the horizontal axis and imaginary values are on the vertical axis). Re(ζ(1/2 + it), Im(ζ(1/2 + it) is plotted with t ranging between −30 and 30.The curve starts for t = -30 at ζ(1/2 - 30 i) = -0.12 + 0.58 i, and end symmetrically below the starting point at ζ(1/2 + 30 i) = -0.12 - 0.58 i.Six zeros of ζ(s) are found along the trajectory when the origin (0,0) is traversed, corresponding to imaginary parts Im(s) = ±14.135, ±21.022 and ±25.011.[1] Animation showing in 3D the Riemann zeta function critical strip (blue, where s has real part between 0 and 1), critical line (red, for real part of s equals 0.5) and zeroes (cross between red and orange): [x,y,z] = [Re(ζ(r + it), Im(ζ(r + it), t] with 0.1 ≤ r ≤ 0.9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 51 Millennium Prize Problems Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture Hodge conjecture Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness P versus NP problem Poincaré conjecture (solved) Riemann hypothesis Yang–Mills existence and mass gap vte In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 1/2. Many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.[2] It is of great interest in number theory because it implies results about the distribution of prime numbers. It was proposed by Bernhard Riemann (1859), after whom it is named. The Riemann hypothesis and some of its generalizations, along with Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture, make up Hilbert's eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of twenty-three unsolved problems; it is also one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, which offers a million dollars to anyone who solves any of them. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is a function whose argument s may be any complex number other than 1, and whose values are also complex. It has zeros at the negative even integers; that is, ζ(s) = 0 when s is one of −2, −4, −6, .... These are called its trivial zeros. The zeta function is also zero for other values of s, which are called nontrivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the locations of these nontrivial zeros, and states that: The real part of every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2. Thus, if the hypothesis is correct, all the nontrivial zeros lie on the critical line consisting of the complex numbers 1/2 + i t, where t is a real number and i is the imaginary unit. Riemann zeta
