theorem: This concerns the sign of the error in the prime number theorem. It has been computed that π(x) < li(x) for all x ≤ 1025 (see this table), and no value of x is known for which π(x) > li(x). In 1914 Littlewood proved that there are arbitrarily large values of x for which π(x)>li⁡(x)+13xlog⁡xlog⁡log⁡log⁡x,π(x)>li(x)+1/3√(x)/loglog, and that there are also arbitrarily large values of x for which π(x)<li⁡(x)−13xlog⁡xlog⁡log⁡log⁡x.π(x)<li(x)-1/3√(x)/loglog. Thus the difference π(x) − li(x) changes sign infinitely many times. Skewes' number is an estimate of the value of x corresponding to the first sign change. Littlewood's proof is divided into two cases: the RH is assumed false (about half a page of Ingham 1932, Chapt. V), and the RH is assumed true (about a dozen pages). Stanisław Knapowski (1962) followed this up with a paper on the number of times Δ(n)Δ(n) changes sign in the interval Δ(n)Δ(n). Gauss's class number
