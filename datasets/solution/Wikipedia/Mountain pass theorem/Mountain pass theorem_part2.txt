Statement: The assumptions of the theorem are: I is a functional from a Hilbert space H to the reals, I∈C1(H,R)^1(H,ℝ) and I′' is Lipschitz continuous on bounded subsets of H, I satisfies the Palais–Smale compactness condition, I[0]=0[0]=0, there exist positive constants r and a such that I[u]≥a[u] if ‖u‖=r‖=r, and there exists v∈H with ‖v‖>r‖>r such that I[v]≤0[v]≤0. If we define: Γ=g∈C([0,1];H)|g(0)=0,g(1)=vΓ={𝐠([0,1];H) | 𝐠(0)=0,𝐠(1)=v} and: c=infg∈Γmax0≤t≤1I[g(t)],=inf_𝐠∈Γmax_0≤1I[𝐠(t)], then the conclusion of the theorem is that c is a critical value of I.
