Visualization: The intuition behind the theorem is in the name "mountain pass." Consider I as describing elevation. Then we know two low spots in the landscape: the origin because I[0]=0[0]=0, and a far-off spot v where I[v]≤0[v]≤0. In between the two lies a range of mountains (at ‖u‖=r‖=r) where the elevation is high (higher than a>0). In order to travel along a path g from the origin to v, we must pass over the mountains—that is, we must go up and then down. Since I is somewhat smooth, there must be a critical point somewhere in between. (Think along the lines of the mean-value theorem.) The mountain pass lies along the path that passes at the lowest elevation through the mountains. Note that this mountain pass is almost always a saddle point. For a proof, see section 8.5 of Evans.
