formulation: Let X be Banach space. The assumptions of the theorem are: Φ∈C(X,R)Φ(X,𝐑) and have a Gateaux derivative Φ′:X→X∗Φ'^* which is continuous when X and X∗^* are endowed with strong topology and weak* topology respectively. There exists r>0>0 such that one can find certain ‖x′‖>rx'>r with max(Φ(0),Φ(x′))<inf‖x‖=rΦ(x)=:m(r)max (Φ(0),Φ(x'))<inf_x=rΦ(x)=:m(r). ΦΦ satisfies weak Palais–Smale condition on x∈X∣m(r)≤Φ(x){x(r)≤Φ(x)}. In this case there is a critical point x¯∈Xx of ΦΦ satisfying m(r)≤Φ(x¯)(r)≤Φ(x). Moreover, if we define Γ=c∈C([0,1],X)∣c(0)=0,c(1)=x′Γ={c([0,1],X) (0)=0, c (1)=x'} then Φ(x¯)=infc∈Γmax0≤t≤1Φ(c(t)).Φ(x)=inf_c ∈ Γmax_0≤1Φ(c (t)). For a proof, see section 5.5 of Aubin and Ekeland.
