History: The early history of this result is entangled with that of the Atiyahâ€“Singer index theorem. There was other input, as is suggested by the alternate name Woods Hole fixed-point theorem that was used in the past (referring properly to the case of isolated fixed points).[1] A 1964 meeting at Woods Hole brought together a varied group: Eichler started the interaction between fixed-point theorems and automorphic forms. Shimura played an important part in this development by explaining this to Bott at the Woods Hole conference in 1964.[2] As Atiyah puts it:[3] [at the conference]...Bott and I learnt of a conjecture of Shimura concerning a generalization of the Lefschetz formula for holomorphic maps. After much effort we convinced ourselves that there should be a general formula of this type [...]; . and they were led to a version for elliptic complexes. In the recollection of William Fulton, who was also present at the conference, the first to produce a proof was Jean-Louis Verdier.
