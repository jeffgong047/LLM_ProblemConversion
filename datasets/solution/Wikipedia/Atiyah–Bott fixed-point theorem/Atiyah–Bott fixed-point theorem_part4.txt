Proofs: In the context of algebraic geometry, the statement applies for smooth and proper varieties over an algebraically closed field. This variant of the Atiyahâ€“Bott fixed point formula was proved by Kondyrev & Prikhodko (2018) by expressing both sides of the formula as appropriately chosen categorical traces. See
