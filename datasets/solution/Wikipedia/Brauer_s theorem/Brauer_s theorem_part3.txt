theorem: Brauer's first main theorem (Brauer 1944, 1956, 1970) states that if G is a finite group and D is a p-subgroup of G, then there is a bijection between the set of (characteristic p) blocks of G with defect group D and blocks of the normalizer NG(D)_G(D) with defect group D. This bijection arises because when H=NG(D)=N_G(D), each block of G with defect group D has a unique Brauer correspondent block of H, which also has defect group D. Brauer's second main
