correspondence: There are many ways to extend the definition which follows, but this is close to the early treatments by Brauer. Let G be a finite group, p be a prime, F be a field of characteristic p. Let H be a subgroup of G which contains QCG(Q)_G(Q) for some p-subgroup Q of G, and is contained in the normalizer NG(Q)_G(Q), where CG(Q)_G(Q) is the centralizer of Q in G. The Brauer homomorphism (with respect to H) is a linear map from the center of the group algebra of G over F to the corresponding algebra for H. Specifically, it is the restriction to Z(FG)(FG) of the (linear) projection from FG to FCG(Q)_G(Q) whose kernel is spanned by the elements of G outside CG(Q)_G(Q). The image of this map is contained in Z(FH)(FH), and it transpires that the map is also a ring homomorphism. Since it is a ring homomorphism, for any block B of FG, the Brauer homomorphism sends the identity element of B either to 0 or to an idempotent element. In the latter case, the idempotent may be decomposed as a sum of (mutually orthogonal) primitive idempotents of Z(FH). Each of these primitive idempotents is the multiplicative identity of some block of FH. The block b of FH is said to be a Brauer correspondent of B if its identity element occurs in this decomposition of the image of the identity of B under the Brauer homomorphism. Brauer's first main
