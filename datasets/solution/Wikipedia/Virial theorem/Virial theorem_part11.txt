Examples: The virial theorem has a particularly simple form for periodic motion. It can be used to perform perturbative calculation for nonlinear oscillators.[7] It can also be used to study motion in a central potential.[4] If the central potential is of the form U∝rn^n, the virial theorem simplifies to ⟨T⟩=n+12⟨U⟩⟩=n+1/2⟩.[citation needed] In particular, for gravitational or electrostatic (Coulomb) attraction, ⟨T⟩=−12⟨U⟩⟩=-1/2⟩.
