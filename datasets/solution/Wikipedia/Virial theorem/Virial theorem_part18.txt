system: In case when in the physical system the pressure field, the electromagnetic and gravitational fields are taken into account, as well as the field of particles’ acceleration, the virial theorem is written in the relativistic form as follows:[23] ⟨Wk⟩≈−0.6∑k=1N⟨Fk⋅rk⟩,_k⟩≈-0.6∑_k=1^N⟨𝐅_k·𝐫_k⟩, where the value Wk ≈ γcT exceeds the kinetic energy of the particles T by a factor equal to the Lorentz factor γc of the particles at the center of the system. Under normal conditions we can assume that γc ≈ 1, then we can see that in the virial theorem the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy not by the coefficient 1/2, but rather by the coefficient close to 0.6. The difference from the classical case arises due to considering the pressure field and the field of particles’ acceleration inside the system, while the derivative of the scalar G is not equal to zero and should be considered as the material derivative. An analysis of the integral theorem of generalized virial makes it possible to find, on the basis of field theory, a formula for the root-mean-square speed of typical particles of a system without using the notion of temperature:[24] vrms=c1−4πηρ0r2c2γc2sin2⁡(rc4πηρ0),_rms=c√(1-4πηρ_0r^2/c^2γ_c^2sin^2(r/c√(4πηρ_0))), where c c is the speed of light, η η is the acceleration field constant, ρ0 ρ_0 is the mass density of particles, r r is the current radius. Unlike the virial theorem for particles, for the electromagnetic field the virial theorem is written as follows:[25] Ekf+2Wf=0, E_kf+2W_f=0, where the energy Ekf=∫Aαjα−gdx1dx2dx3 E_kf=_αj^α√(-g) dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 considered as the kinetic field energy associated with four-current jα^α, and Wf=14μ0∫FαβFαβ−gdx1dx2dx3 W_f=1/4μ_0_αβF^αβ√(-g) dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 sets the potential field energy found through the components of the electromagnetic tensor.
