astrophysics: The virial theorem is frequently applied in astrophysics, especially relating the gravitational potential energy of a system to its kinetic or thermal energy. Some common virial relations are[citation needed] 35GMR=32kBTmp=12v23/5GM/R=3/2k_BT/m_p=1/2v^2 for a mass M, radius R, velocity v, and temperature T. The constants are Newton's constant G, the Boltzmann constant kB, and proton mass mp. Note that these relations are only approximate, and often the leading numerical factors (e.g. 3/5 or 1/2) are neglected entirely. Galaxies and cosmology (virial mass and
