(April 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In the field of quantum mechanics, there exists another form of the virial theorem, applicable to localized solutions to the stationary nonlinear Schrödinger equation or Klein–Gordon equation, is Pokhozhaev's identity,[6] also known as Derrick's theorem. Let g(s)(s) be continuous and real-valued, with g(0)=0(0)=0. Denote G(s)=∫0sg(t)dt(s)=∫_0^sg(t) dt. Let u∈Lloc∞(Rn),∇u∈L2(Rn),G(u(⋅))∈L1(Rn),n∈N,_loc^∞(ℝ^n), ^2(ℝ^n),(u(·))^1(ℝ^n),∈ℕ, be a solution to the equation −∇2u=g(u),-∇^2u=g(u), in the sense of distributions. Then u satisfies the relation (n−22)∫Rn|∇u(x)|2dx=n∫RnG(u(x))dx.(n-2/2)∫_ℝ^n|(x)|^2 dx=n∫_ℝ^nG(u(x)) dx. In special
