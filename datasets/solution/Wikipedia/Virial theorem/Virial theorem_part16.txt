Generalizations: Lord Rayleigh published a generalization of the virial theorem in 1900[12] and was partially reprinted in 1903.[13] Henri Poincaré proved and applied a form of the virial theorem in 1911 to the problem of formation of the Solar System from a proto-stellar cloud (then known as cosmogony).[14] A variational form of the virial theorem was developed in 1945 by Ledoux.[15] A tensor form of the virial theorem was developed by Parker,[16] Chandrasekhar[17] and Fermi.[18] The following generalization of the virial theorem has been established by Pollard in 1964 for the case of the inverse square law:[19][20] 2limτ→+∞⟨T⟩τ=limτ→+∞⟨U⟩τifandonlyiflimτ→+∞τ−2I(τ)=0.2lim_τ→+∞⟩_τ=lim_τ→+∞⟩_τ ifandonlyif lim_τ→+∞τ^-2I(τ)=0 .
