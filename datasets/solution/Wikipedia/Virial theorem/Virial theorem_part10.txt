(April 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)For a single particle in special relativity, it is not the case that T = 1/2p · v. Instead, it is true that T = (γ − 1) mc2, where γ is the Lorentz factor γ=11−v2c2γ=1/√(1-v^2/c^2) and β = v/c. We have, 12p⋅v=12βγmc⋅βc=12γβ2mc2=(γβ22(γ−1))T.1/2𝐩·𝐯 =1/2β·βc =1/2γβ^2mc^2 =(γβ^2/2(γ-1))T . The last expression can be simplified to (1+1−β22)Tor(γ+12γ)T(1+√(1-β^2)/2)T or (γ+1/2γ)T. Thus, under the conditions described in earlier sections (including Newton's third law of motion, Fjk = −Fkj, despite relativity), the time average for N particles with a power law potential is n2⟨VTOT⟩τ=⟨∑k=1N(1+1−βk22)Tk⟩τ=⟨∑k=1N(γk+12γk)Tk⟩τ.n/2_TOT⟩_τ=⟨∑_k=1^N(1+√(1-β_k^2)/2)T_k⟩_τ=⟨∑_k=1^N(γ_k+1/2γ_k)T_k⟩_τ . In particular, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is no longer fixed, but necessarily falls into an interval: 2⟨TTOT⟩n⟨VTOT⟩∈[1,2],2_TOT⟩/n_TOT⟩∈[1,2] , where the more relativistic systems exhibit the larger ratios.
