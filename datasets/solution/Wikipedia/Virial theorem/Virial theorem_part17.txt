fields: The virial theorem can be extended to include electric and magnetic fields. The result is[22] 12d2Idt2+∫Vxk∂Gk∂td3r=2(T+U)+WE+WM−∫xk(pik+Tik)dSi,1/2d^2I/dt^2+∫_Vx_k_k/ d^3r=2(T+U)+W^E+W^M-_k(p_ik+T_ik) dS_i, where I is the moment of inertia, G is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field, T is the kinetic energy of the "fluid", U is the random "thermal" energy of the particles, WE and WM are the electric and magnetic energy content of the volume considered. Finally, pik is the fluid-pressure tensor expressed in the local moving coordinate system pik=Σnσmσ⟨vivk⟩σ−ViVkΣmσnσ,_ik=^σm^σ_iv_k⟩^σ-V_iV_k^σn^σ, and Tik is the electromagnetic stress tensor, Tik=(ε0E22+B22μ0)δik−(ε0EiEk+BiBkμ0)._ik=(ε_0E^2/2+B^2/2μ_0)δ_ik-(ε_0E_iE_k+B_iB_k/μ_0). A plasmoid is a finite configuration of magnetic fields and plasma. With the virial theorem it is easy to see that any such configuration will expand if not contained by external forces. In a finite configuration without pressure-bearing walls or magnetic coils, the surface integral will vanish. Since all the other terms on the right hand side are positive, the acceleration of the moment of inertia will also be positive. It is also easy to estimate the expansion time τ. If a total mass M is confined within a radius R, then the moment of inertia is roughly MR2, and the left hand side of the virial theorem is MR2/τ2. The terms on the right hand side add up to about pR3, where p is the larger of the plasma pressure or the magnetic pressure. Equating these two terms and solving for τ, we find τ∼Rcs,τ ∼R/c_s, where cs is the speed of the ion acoustic wave (or the Alfvén wave, if the magnetic pressure is higher than the plasma pressure). Thus the lifetime of a plasmoid is expected to be on the order of the acoustic (or Alfvén) transit time. Relativistic uniform
