radius): Main article: Virial mass In astronomy, the mass and size of a galaxy (or general overdensity) is often defined in terms of the "virial mass" and "virial radius" respectively. Because galaxies and overdensities in continuous fluids can be highly extended (even to infinity in some models, such as an isothermal sphere), it can be hard to define specific, finite measures of their mass and size. The virial theorem, and related concepts, provide an often convenient means by which to quantify these properties. In galaxy dynamics, the mass of a galaxy is often inferred by measuring the rotation velocity of its gas and stars, assuming circular Keplerian orbits. Using the virial theorem, the velocity dispersion σ can be used in a similar way. Taking the kinetic energy (per particle) of the system as T = 1/2v2 ~ 3/2σ2, and the potential energy (per particle) as U ~ 3/5 GM/R we can write GMR≈σ2.GM/R≈σ^2. Here R is the radius at which the velocity dispersion is being measured, and M is the mass within that radius. The virial mass and radius are generally defined for the radius at which the velocity dispersion is a maximum, i.e. GMvirRvir≈σmax2.GM_vir/R_vir≈σ_max^2. As numerous approximations have been made, in addition to the approximate nature of these definitions, order-unity proportionality constants are often omitted (as in the above equations). These relations are thus only accurate in an order of magnitude sense, or when used self-consistently. An alternate definition of the virial mass and radius is often used in cosmology where it is used to refer to the radius of a sphere, centered on a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, within which virial equilibrium holds. Since this radius is difficult to determine observationally, it is often approximated as the radius within which the average density is greater, by a specified factor, than the critical density ρcrit=3H28πGρ_crit=3H^2/8 where H is the Hubble parameter and G is the gravitational constant. A common choice for the factor is 200, which corresponds roughly to the typical over-density in spherical top-hat collapse (see Virial mass), in which case the virial radius is approximated as rvir≈r200=r,ρ=200⋅ρcrit._vir_200=r, ρ=200·ρ_crit. The virial mass is then defined relative to this radius as Mvir≈M200=43πr2003⋅200ρcrit._vir_200=4/3_200^3·200ρ_crit.
