case: Consider N = 2 particles with equal mass m, acted upon by mutually attractive forces. Suppose the particles are at diametrically opposite points of a circular orbit with radius r. The velocities are v1(t) and v2(t) = −v1(t), which are normal to forces F1(t) and F2(t) = −F1(t). The respective magnitudes are fixed at v and F. The average kinetic energy of the system in an interval of time from t1 to t2 is ⟨T⟩=1t2−t1∫t1t2∑k=1N12mk|vk(t)|2dt=1t2−t1∫t1t2(12m|v1(t)|2+12m|v2(t)|2)dt=mv2.⟩=1/t_2-t_1∫_t_1^t_2∑_k=1^N1/2m_k|𝐯_k(t)|^2dt=1/t_2-t_1∫_t_1^t_2(1/2m|𝐯_1(t)|^2+1/2m|𝐯_2(t)|^2)dt=mv^2. Taking center of mass as the origin, the particles have positions r1(t) and r2(t) = −r1(t) with fixed magnitude r. The attractive forces act in opposite directions as positions, so F1(t) ⋅ r1(t) = F2(t) ⋅ r2(t) = −Fr. Applying the centripetal force formula F = mv2/r results in: −12∑k=1N⟨Fk⋅rk⟩=−12(−Fr−Fr)=Fr=mv2r⋅r=mv2=⟨T⟩,-1/2∑_k=1^N⟨𝐅_k·𝐫_k⟩=-1/2(-Fr-Fr)=Fr=mv^2/r=mv^2=⟩, as required. Note: If the origin is displaced then we'd obtain the same result. This is because the dot product of the displacement with equal and opposite forces F1(t), F2(t) results in net cancellation.
