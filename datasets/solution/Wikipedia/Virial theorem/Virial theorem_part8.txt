mechanics: Although originally derived for classical mechanics, the virial theorem also holds for quantum mechanics, as first shown by Fock[5] using the Ehrenfest theorem. Evaluate the commutator of the Hamiltonian H=V(Xi)+∑nPn22m=V({X_i})+∑_nP_n^2/2m with the position operator Xn and the momentum operator Pn=−iℏddXn_n=-iħd/dX_n of particle n, [H,XnPn]=Xn[H,Pn]+[H,Xn]Pn=iℏXndVdXn−iℏPn2m.[H,X_nP_n]=X_n[H,P_n]+[H,X_n]P_n=i_ndV/dX_n-iħP_n^2/m . Summing over all particles, one finds for Q=∑nXnPn=∑_nX_nP_n the commutator amounts to iℏ[H,Q]=2T−∑nXndVdXni/ħ[H,Q]=2T-∑_nX_ndV/dX_n where T=∑nPn22m=∑_nP_n^2/2m is the kinetic energy. The left-hand side of this equation is just dQ/dt, according to the Heisenberg equation of motion. The expectation value ⟨dQ/dt⟩ of this time derivative vanishes in a stationary state, leading to the quantum virial theorem, 2⟨T⟩=∑n⟨XndVdXn⟩.2⟩=∑_n_ndV/dX_n⟩ . Pokhozhaev's
