analysis: He approximated the Coma cluster as a spherical "gas" of N stars of roughly equal mass m, which gives ⟨T⟩=12Nm⟨v2⟩⟩=1/2Nm^2⟩. The total gravitational potential energy of the cluster is U=−∑i<jGm2ri,j=-∑_i<jGm^2/r_i,j, giving ⟨U⟩=−Gm2∑i<j⟨1/ri,j⟩⟩=-Gm^2∑_i<j⟨1/r_i,j⟩. Assuming the motion of the stars are all the same over a long enough time (ergodicity), ⟨U⟩=−12N2Gm2⟨1/r⟩⟩=-1/2N^2Gm^2⟨1/r⟩. Zwicky estimated ⟨U⟩⟩ as the gravitational potential of a uniform ball of constant density, giving ⟨U⟩=−35GN2m2R⟩=-3/5GN^2m^2/R. So by the virial theorem, the total mass of the cluster isNm=5⟨v2⟩3G⟨1r⟩=5^2⟩/3G⟨1/r⟩
