forces: In a common special case, the potential energy V between two particles is proportional to a power n of their distance rij Vjk=αrjkn,_jk=_jk^n, where the coefficient α and the exponent n are constants. In such cases, the virial is given by the equation −12∑k=1NFk⋅rk=12∑k=1N∑j<kdVjkdrjkrjk=12∑k=1N∑j<knαrjkn−1rjk=12∑k=1N∑j<knVjk=n2VTOT-1/2 ∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k =1/2 ∑_k=1^N∑_j<kdV_jk/dr_jkr_jk =1/2 ∑_k=1^N∑_j<kn_jk^n-1r_jk =1/2 ∑_k=1^N∑_j<knV_jk=n/2 V_TOT where VTOT is the total potential energy of the system VTOT=∑k=1N∑j<kVjk._TOT=∑_k=1^N∑_j<kV_jk . Thus, we have dGdt=2T+∑k=1NFk⋅rk=2T−nVTOT.dG/dt=2T+∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k=2T-nV_TOT . For gravitating systems the exponent n equals −1, giving Lagrange's identity dGdt=12d2Idt2=2T+VTOTdG/dt=1/2d^2I/dt^2=2T+V_TOT which was derived by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and extended by Carl Jacobi.
