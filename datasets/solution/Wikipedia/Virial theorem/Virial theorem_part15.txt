Data: Zwicky1933_1933[9] estimated that there are N=800=800 galaxies in the cluster, each having observed stellar mass m=109M⊙=10^9M_⊙ (suggested by Hubble), and the cluster has radius R=106ly=10^6ly. He also measured the radial velocities of the galaxies by doppler shifts in galactic spectra to be ⟨vr2⟩=(1000km/s)2_r^2⟩=(1000km/s)^2. Assuming equipartition of kinetic energy, ⟨v2⟩=3⟨vr2⟩^2⟩=3_r^2⟩. By the virial theorem, the total mass of the cluster should be 5R⟨vr2⟩G≈3.6×1014M⊙5R_r^2⟩/G≈3.6×10^14M_⊙. However, the observed mass is Nm=8×1011M⊙=8×10^11M_⊙, meaning the total mass is 450 times that of observed mass.
