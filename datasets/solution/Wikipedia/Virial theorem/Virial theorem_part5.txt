particles: The total force Fk on particle k is the sum of all the forces from the other particles j in the system Fk=∑j=1NFjk𝐅_k=∑_j=1^N𝐅_jk where Fjk is the force applied by particle j on particle k. Hence, the virial can be written −12∑k=1NFk⋅rk=−12∑k=1N∑j=1NFjk⋅rk.-1/2 ∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k=-1/2 ∑_k=1^N∑_j=1^N𝐅_jk·𝐫_k . Since no particle acts on itself (i.e., Fjj = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ N), we split the sum in terms below and above this diagonal and we add them together in pairs: ∑k=1NFk⋅rk=∑k=1N∑j=1NFjk⋅rk=∑k=2N∑j=1k−1(Fjk⋅rk+Fkj⋅rj)=∑k=2N∑j=1k−1(Fjk⋅rk−Fjk⋅rj)=∑k=2N∑j=1k−1Fjk⋅(rk−rj)∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k =∑_k=1^N∑_j=1^N𝐅_jk·𝐫_k=∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1(𝐅_jk·𝐫_k+𝐅_kj·𝐫_j) =∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1(𝐅_jk·𝐫_k-𝐅_jk·𝐫_j)=∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1𝐅_jk·(𝐫_k-𝐫_j) where we have assumed that Newton's third law of motion holds, i.e., Fjk = −Fkj (equal and opposite reaction). It often happens that the forces can be derived from a potential energy Vjk that is a function only of the distance rjk between the point particles j and k. Since the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, we have in this case Fjk=−∇rkVjk=−dVjkdrjk(rk−rjrjk),𝐅_jk=-∇_𝐫_kV_jk=-dV_jk/dr_jk(𝐫_k-𝐫_j/r_jk), which is equal and opposite to Fkj = −∇rjVkj = −∇rjVjk, the force applied by particle k on particle j, as may be confirmed by explicit calculation. Hence, ∑k=1NFk⋅rk=∑k=2N∑j=1k−1Fjk⋅(rk−rj)=−∑k=2N∑j=1k−1dVjkdrjk|rk−rj|2rjk=−∑k=2N∑j=1k−1dVjkdrjkrjk.∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k =∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1𝐅_jk·(𝐫_k-𝐫_j) =-∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1dV_jk/dr_jk|𝐫_k-𝐫_j|^2/r_jk =-∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1dV_jk/dr_jkr_jk. Thus, we have dGdt=2T+∑k=1NFk⋅rk=2T−∑k=2N∑j=1k−1dVjkdrjkrjk.dG/dt=2T+∑_k=1^N𝐅_k·𝐫_k=2T-∑_k=2^N∑_j=1^k-1dV_jk/dr_jkr_jk. Special case of power-law
