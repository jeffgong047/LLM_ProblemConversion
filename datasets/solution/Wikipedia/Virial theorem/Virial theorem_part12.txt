law: Consider a container filled with ideal gas consisting of point masses. The force inflicted on the point masses is the negative of the forces inflicted on the wall of the container, which is of form dF=−n^PdA𝐅=-𝐧̂PdA, where n^𝐧̂ is the unit normal vector pointing outwards. Then the virial theorem states⟨T⟩=−12⟨∑iFi⋅ri⟩=P2∫n^⋅rdA⟩=-1/2⟨∑_i𝐅_i·𝐫_i⟩=P/2∫𝐧̂·𝐫dABy divergence theorem, ∫n^⋅rdA=∫∇⋅rdV=3∫dV=3V∫𝐧̂·𝐫dA=∫∇·𝐫dV=3=3V. And since the average total kinetic energy ⟨T⟩=N⟨12mv2⟩=N⋅32kT⟩=N⟨1/2mv^2⟩=N·3/2kT, we have PV=NkT=NkT.[8] Dark
