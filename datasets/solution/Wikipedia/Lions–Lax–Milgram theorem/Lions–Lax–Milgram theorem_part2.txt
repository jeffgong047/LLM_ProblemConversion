theorem: Let H be a Hilbert space and V a normed space. Let B : H × V → R be a continuous, bilinear function. Then the following are equivalent: (coercivity) for some constant c > 0,[citation needed] inf‖v‖V=1sup‖h‖H≤1|B(h,v)|≥c;inf_v_V=1sup_h_H≤1|B(h,v)|; (existence of a "weak inverse") for each continuous linear functional f ∈ V∗, there is an element h ∈ H such that B(h,v)=⟨f,v⟩forallv∈V.(h,v)=,v⟩v.
