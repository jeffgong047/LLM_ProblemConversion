results: The Lions–Lax–Milgram theorem can be applied by using the following result, the hypotheses of which are quite common and easy to verify in practical applications: Suppose that V is continuously embedded in H and that B is V-elliptic, i.e. for some c > 0 and all v ∈ V, ‖v‖H≤c‖v‖V;v_Hv_V; for some α > 0 and all v ∈ V, B(v,v)≥α‖v‖V2.(v,v)≥αv_V^2. Then the above coercivity condition (and hence the existence result) holds. Importance and
