Argument: If we use direction cosines describing the bent light rays, we can write a vector field on (u,v)(u,v) plane V:(s,w):(s,w). However, only in some specific directions V0:(s0,w0)_0:(s_0,w_0), will the bent light rays reach the observer, i.e., the images only form where D=δV=0|(s0,w0)==0|_(s_0,w_0). Then we can directly apply the Poincaré–Hopf theorem χ=∑indexD=constantχ=∑index_D=constant. The index of sources and sinks is +1, and that of saddle points is −1. So the Euler characteristic equals the difference between the number of positive indices n+_+ and the number of negative indices n−_-. For the far field case, there is only one image, i.e., χ=n+−n−=1χ=n_+-n_-=1. So the total number of images is N=n++n−=2n−+1=n_++n_-=2n_-+1, i.e., odd. The strict proof needs Uhlenbeck's Morse theory of null geodesics.
