Applications: It follows from the Mostow rigidity theorem that the group of isometries of a finite-volume hyperbolic n-manifold M (for n>2) is finite and isomorphic to Out⁡(π1(M))Out(π_1(M)). Mostow rigidity was also used by Thurston to prove the uniqueness of circle packing representations of triangulated planar graphs[citation needed]. A consequence of Mostow rigidity of interest in geometric group theory is that there exist hyperbolic groups which are quasi-isometric but not commensurable to each other. See
