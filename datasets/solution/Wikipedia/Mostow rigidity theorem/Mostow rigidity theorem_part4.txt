form: The group of isometries of hyperbolic space Hnℍ^n can be identified with the Lie group PO(n,1)PO(n,1) (the projective orthogonal group of a quadratic form of signature (n,1)(n,1). Then the following statement is equivalent to the one above. Let n≥3≥3 and ΓΓ and ΛΛ be two lattices in PO(n,1)PO(n,1) and suppose that there is a group isomorphism f:Γ→ΛΓ→Λ. Then ΓΓ and ΛΛ are conjugate in PO(n,1)PO(n,1). That is, there exists a g∈PO(n,1)∈PO(n,1) such that Λ=gΓg−1Λ=g^-1. In greater
