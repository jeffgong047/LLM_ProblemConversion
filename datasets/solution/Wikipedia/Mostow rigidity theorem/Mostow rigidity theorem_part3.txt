form: Let Hnℍ^n be the n-dimensional hyperbolic space. A complete hyperbolic manifold can be defined as a quotient of Hnℍ^n by a group of isometries acting freely and properly discontinuously (it is equivalent to define it as a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature -1 which is complete). It is of finite volume if the integral of a volume form is finite (which is the case, for example, if it is compact). The Mostow rigidity theorem may be stated as: Suppose M and N are complete finite-volume hyperbolic manifolds of dimension n≥3≥3. If there exists an isomorphism f:π1(M)→π1(N)π_1(M)→π_1(N) then it is induced by a unique isometry from M to N. Here π1(X)π_1(X) is the fundamental group of a manifold X. If X is an hyperbolic manifold obtained as the quotient of Hnℍ^n by a group ΓΓ then π1(X)≅Γπ_1(X)≅Γ. An equivalent statement is that any homotopy equivalence from M to N can be homotoped to a unique isometry. The proof actually shows that if N has greater dimension than M then there can be no homotopy equivalence between them. Algebraic
