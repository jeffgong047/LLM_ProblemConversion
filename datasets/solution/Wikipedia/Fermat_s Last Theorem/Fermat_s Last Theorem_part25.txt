equation: The generalized Fermat equation generalizes the statement of Fermat's last theorem by considering positive integer solutions a, b, c, m, n, k satisfying[146] am+bn=ck.^m+b^n=c^k. (1) In particular, the exponents m, n, k need not be equal, whereas Fermat's last theorem considers the case m = n = k. The Beal conjecture, also known as the Mauldin conjecture[147] and the Tijdeman-Zagier conjecture,[148][149][150] states that there are no solutions to the generalized Fermat equation in positive integers a, b, c, m, n, k with a, b, and c being pairwise coprime and all of m, n, k being greater than 2.[151] The Fermatâ€“Catalan conjecture generalizes Fermat's last theorem with the ideas of the Catalan conjecture.[152][153] The conjecture states that the generalized Fermat equation has only finitely many solutions (a, b, c, m, n, k) with distinct triplets of values (am, bn, ck), where a, b, c are positive coprime integers and m, n, k are positive integers satisfying 1m+1n+1k<1.1/m+1/n+1/k<1. (2) The statement is about the finiteness of the set of solutions because there are 10 known solutions.[146] Inverse Fermat
