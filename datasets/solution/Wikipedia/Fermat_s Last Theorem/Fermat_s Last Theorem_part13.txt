exponents: After Fermat proved the special case n = 4, the general proof for all n required only that the theorem be established for all odd prime exponents.[69] In other words, it was necessary to prove only that the equation an + bn = cn has no positive integer solutions (a, b, c) when n is an odd prime number. This follows because a solution (a, b, c) for a given n is equivalent to a solution for all the factors of n. For illustration, let n be factored into d and e, n = de. The general equation an + bn = cn implies that (ad, bd, cd) is a solution for the exponent e (ad)e + (bd)e = (cd)e. Thus, to prove that Fermat's equation has no solutions for n > 2, it would suffice to prove that it has no solutions for at least one prime factor of every n. Each integer n > 2 is divisible by 4 or by an odd prime number (or both). Therefore, Fermat's Last Theorem could be proved for all n if it could be proved for n = 4 and for all odd primes p. In the two centuries following its conjecture (1637–1839), Fermat's Last Theorem was proved for three odd prime exponents p = 3, 5 and 7. The case p = 3 was first stated by Abu-Mahmud Khojandi (10th century), but his attempted proof of the theorem was incorrect.[70] In 1770, Leonhard Euler gave a proof of p = 3,[71] but his proof by infinite descent[72] contained a major gap.[73] However, since Euler himself had proved the lemma necessary to complete the proof in other work, he is generally credited with the first proof.[74] Independent proofs were published[75] by Kausler (1802),[45] Legendre (1823, 1830),[47][76] Calzolari (1855),[77] Gabriel Lamé (1865),[78] Peter Guthrie Tait (1872),[79] Günther (1878),[80][full citation needed] Gambioli (1901),[56] Krey (1909),[81][full citation needed] Rychlík (1910),[61] Stockhaus (1910),[82] Carmichael (1915),[83] Johannes van der Corput (1915),[84] Axel Thue (1917),[85][full citation needed] and Duarte (1944).[86] The case p = 5 was proved[87] independently by Legendre and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet around 1825.[88] Alternative proofs were developed[89] by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1875, posthumous),[90] Lebesgue (1843),[91] Lamé (1847),[92] Gambioli (1901),[56][93] Werebrusow (1905),[94][full citation needed] Rychlík (1910),[95][dubious – discuss][full citation needed] van der Corput (1915),[84] and Guy Terjanian (1987).[96] The case p = 7 was proved[97] by Lamé in 1839.[98] His rather complicated proof was simplified in 1840 by Lebesgue,[99] and still simpler proofs[100] were published by Angelo Genocchi in 1864, 1874 and 1876.[101] Alternative proofs were developed by Théophile Pépin (1876)[102] and Edmond Maillet (1897).[103] Fermat's Last Theorem was also proved for the exponents n = 6, 10, and 14. Proofs for n = 6 were published by Kausler,[45] Thue,[104] Tafelmacher,[105] Lind,[106] Kapferer,[107] Swift,[108] and Breusch.[109] Similarly, Dirichlet[110] and Terjanian[111] each proved the case n = 14, while Kapferer[107] and Breusch[109] each proved the case n = 10. Strictly speaking, these proofs are unnecessary, since these cases follow from the proofs for n = 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Nevertheless, the reasoning of these even-exponent proofs differs from their odd-exponent counterparts. Dirichlet's proof for n = 14 was published in 1832, before Lamé's 1839 proof for n = 7.[112] All proofs for specific exponents used Fermat's technique of infinite descent,[citation needed] either in its original form, or in the form of descent on elliptic curves or abelian varieties. The details and auxiliary arguments, however, were often ad hoc and tied to the individual exponent under consideration.[113] Since they became ever more complicated as p increased, it seemed unlikely that the general case of Fermat's Last Theorem could be proved by building upon the proofs for individual exponents.[113] Although some general results on Fermat's Last Theorem were published in the early 19th century by Niels Henrik Abel and Peter Barlow,[114][115] the first significant work on the general theorem was done by Sophie Germain.[116] Early modern
