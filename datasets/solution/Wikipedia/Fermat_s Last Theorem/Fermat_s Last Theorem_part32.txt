conjecture: Main article: abc conjecture ยง Some consequences The abc conjecture roughly states that if three positive integers a, b and c (hence the name) are coprime and satisfy a + b = c, then the radical d of abc is usually not much smaller than c. In particular, the abc conjecture in its most standard formulation implies Fermat's last theorem for n that are sufficiently large.[160][161][162] The modified Szpiro conjecture is equivalent to the abc conjecture and therefore has the same implication.[163][162] An effective version of the abc conjecture, or an effective version of the modified Szpiro conjecture, implies Fermat's Last Theorem outright.[162] Prizes and incorrect
