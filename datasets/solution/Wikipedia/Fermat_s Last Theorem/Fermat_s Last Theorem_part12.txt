4: Only one relevant proof by Fermat has survived, in which he uses the technique of infinite descent to show that the area of a right triangle with integer sides can never equal the square of an integer.[40][41] His proof is equivalent to demonstrating that the equation x4−y4=z2^4-y^4=z^2 has no primitive solutions in integers (no pairwise coprime solutions). In turn, this proves Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 4, since the equation a4 + b4 = c4 can be written as c4 − b4 = (a2)2. Alternative proofs of the case n = 4 were developed later[42] by Frénicle de Bessy (1676),[43] Leonhard Euler (1738),[44] Kausler (1802),[45] Peter Barlow (1811),[46] Adrien-Marie Legendre (1830),[47] Schopis (1825),[48] Olry Terquem (1846),[49] Joseph Bertrand (1851),[50] Victor Lebesgue (1853, 1859, 1862),[51] Théophile Pépin (1883),[52] Tafelmacher (1893),[53] David Hilbert (1897),[54] Bendz (1901),[55] Gambioli (1901),[56] Leopold Kronecker (1901),[57] Bang (1905),[58] Sommer (1907),[59] Bottari (1908),[60] Karel Rychlík (1910),[61] Nutzhorn (1912),[62] Robert Carmichael (1913),[63] Hancock (1931),[64] Gheorghe Vrănceanu (1966),[65] Grant and Perella (1999),[66] Barbara (2007),[67] and Dolan (2011).[68] Other
