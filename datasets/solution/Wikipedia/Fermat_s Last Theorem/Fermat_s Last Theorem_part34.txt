culture: Main article: Fermat's Last Theorem in fictionThe popularity of the theorem outside science has led to it being described as achieving "that rarest of mathematical accolades: A niche role in pop culture."[174]Czech postage stamp commemorating Wiles' proof Arthur Porges' 1954 short story "The Devil and Simon Flagg" features a mathematician who bargains with the Devil that the latter cannot produce a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem within twenty-four hours.[175] In The Simpsons episode "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace", Homer Simpson writes the equation 398712+436512=4472123987^12+4365^12=4472^12 on a blackboard, which appears to be a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. The equation is wrong, but it appears to be correct if entered in a calculator with 10 significant figures.[176] In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Royale", Captain Picard states that the theorem is still unproven in the 24th century. The proof was released 5 years after the episode originally aired.[177] See
