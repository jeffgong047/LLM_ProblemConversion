Germain: In the early 19th century, Sophie Germain developed several novel approaches to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all exponents.[117] First, she defined a set of auxiliary primes θθ constructed from the prime exponent p by the equation θ=2hp+1θ=2hp+1, where h is any integer not divisible by three. She showed that, if no integers raised to the pth^th power were adjacent modulo θθ (the non-consecutivity condition), then θθ must divide the product xyz. Her goal was to use mathematical induction to prove that, for any given p, infinitely many auxiliary primes θθ satisfied the non-consecutivity condition and thus divided xyz; since the product xyz can have at most a finite number of prime factors, such a proof would have established Fermat's Last Theorem. Although she developed many techniques for establishing the non-consecutivity condition, she did not succeed in her strategic goal. She also worked to set lower limits on the size of solutions to Fermat's equation for a given exponent p, a modified version of which was published by Adrien-Marie Legendre. As a byproduct of this latter work, she proved Sophie Germain's theorem, which verified the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (namely, the case in which p does not divide xyz) for every odd prime exponent less than 270270,[117][118] and for all primes p such that at least one of 2p+12p+1, 4p+14p+1, 8p+18p+1, 10p+110p+1, 14p+114p+1 and 16p+116p+1 is prime (specially, the primes p such that 2p+12p+1 is prime are called Sophie Germain primes). Germain tried unsuccessfully to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all even exponents, specifically for n=2p=2p, which was proved by Guy Terjanian in 1977.[119] In 1985, Leonard Adleman, Roger Heath-Brown and Étienne Fouvry proved that the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds for infinitely many odd primes p.[120] Ernst Kummer and the theory of
