developments: The full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by Diamond (1996),[10] Conrad et al. (1999),[11] and Breuil et al. (2001)[12] who, building on Wiles's work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. The now fully proved conjecture became known as the modularity theorem. Several other theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem also follow from the same reasoning, using the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime n-th powers, n ≥ 3. (The case n = 3 was already known by Euler.) Relationship to other problems and
