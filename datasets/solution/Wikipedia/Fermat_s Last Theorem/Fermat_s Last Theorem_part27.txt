exponents: For the Diophantine equation an/m+bn/m=cn/m^n/m+b^n/m=c^n/m with n not equal to 1, Bennett, Glass, and SzÃ©kely proved in 2004 for n > 2, that if n and m are coprime, then there are integer solutions if and only if 6 divides m, and a1/m^1/m, b1/m,^1/m, and c1/m^1/m are different complex 6th roots of the same real number.[156] Negative integer
