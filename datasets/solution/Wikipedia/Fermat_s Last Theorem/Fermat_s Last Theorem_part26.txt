equation: When we allow the exponent n to be the reciprocal of an integer, i.e. n = 1/m for some integer m, we have the inverse Fermat equation a1/m+b1/m=c1/m.^1/m+b^1/m=c^1/m. All solutions of this equation were computed by Hendrik Lenstra in 1992.[154] In the case in which the mth roots are required to be real and positive, all solutions are given by[155] a=rsm=rs^m b=rtm=rt^m c=r(s+t)m=r(s+t)^m for positive integers r, s, t with s and t coprime.
