Footnotes: ^ If the exponent n were not prime or 4, then it would be possible to write n either as a product of two smaller integers (n = PQ), in which P is a prime number greater than 2, and then an = aPQ = (aQ)P for each of a, b, and c. That is, an equivalent solution would also have to exist for the prime power P that is smaller than n; or else as n would be a power of 2 greater than 4, and writing n = 4Q, the same argument would hold. ^ For example, ((jr+1)s)r+(j(jr+1)s)r=(jr+1)rs+1.((j^r+1)^s)^r+(j(j^r+1)^s)^r=(j^r+1)^rs+1. ^ This elliptic curve was first suggested in the 1960s by Yves Hellegouarch [de], but he did not call attention to its non-modularity.
