−2: The case n = −2 also has an infinitude of solutions, and these have a geometric interpretation in terms of right triangles with integer sides and an integer altitude to the hypotenuse.[158][159] All primitive solutions to a−2+b−2=d−2^-2+b^-2=d^-2 are given by a=(v2−u2)(v2+u2),=(v^2-u^2)(v^2+u^2), b=2uv(v2+u2),=2uv(v^2+u^2), d=2uv(v2−u2),=2uv(v^2-u^2), for coprime integers u, v with v > u. The geometric interpretation is that a and b are the integer legs of a right triangle and d is the integer altitude to the hypotenuse. Then the hypotenuse itself is the integer c=(v2+u2)2,=(v^2+u^2)^2, so (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple. n <
