conjecture: In the 1920s, Louis Mordell posed a conjecture that implied that Fermat's equation has at most a finite number of nontrivial primitive integer solutions, if the exponent n is greater than two.[122] This conjecture was proved in 1983 by Gerd Faltings,[123] and is now known as Faltings's theorem.
