integer: Every positive integer n > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers n=p1n1p2n2⋯pknk=∏i=1kpini,=p_1^n_1p_2^n_2_k^n_k=∏_i=1^kp_i^n_i, where p1 < p2 < ... < pk are primes and the ni are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to k = 0). This representation is called the canonical representation[10] of n, or the standard form[11][12] of n. For example, 999 = 33×37, 1000 = 23×53, 1001 = 7×11×13. Factors p0 = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of n (for example, 1000 = 23×30×53). In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers, as n=2n13n25n37n4⋯=∏i=1∞pini,=2^n_13^n_25^n_37^n_4⋯=∏_i=1^∞p_i^n_i, where a finite number of the ni are positive integers, and the others are zero. Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive rational numbers. Arithmetic
