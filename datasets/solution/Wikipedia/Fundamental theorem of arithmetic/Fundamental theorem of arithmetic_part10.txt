lemma: The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma.[13] The proof that follows is inspired by Euclid's original version of the Euclidean algorithm. Assume that s is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. Incidentally, this implies that s, if it exists, must be a composite number greater than 11. Now, say s=p1p2⋯pm=q1q2⋯qn.s =p_1p_2_m =q_1q_2_n. Every pi_i must be distinct from every qj._j. Otherwise, if say pi=qj,_i=q_j, then there would exist some positive integer t=s/pi=s/qj=s/p_i=s/q_j that is smaller than s and has two distinct prime factorizations. One may also suppose that p1<q1,_1<q_1, by exchanging the two factorizations, if needed. Setting P=p2⋯pm=p_2_m and Q=q2⋯qn,=q_2_n, one has s=p1P=q1Q.=p_1P=q_1Q. Also, since p1<q1,_1<q_1, one has Q<P.<P. It then follows that s−p1Q=(q1−p1)Q=p1(P−Q)<s.-p_1Q=(q_1-p_1)Q=p_1(P-Q)<s. As the positive integers less than s have been supposed to have a unique prime factorization, p1_1 must occur in the factorization of either q1−p1_1-p_1 or Q. The latter case is impossible, as Q, being smaller than s, must have a unique prime factorization, and p1_1 differs from every qj._j. The former case is also impossible, as, if p1_1 is a divisor of q1−p1,_1-p_1, it must be also a divisor of q1,_1, which is impossible as p1_1 and q1_1 are distinct primes. Therefore, there cannot exist a smallest integer with more than a single distinct prime factorization. Every positive integer must either be a prime number itself, which would factor uniquely, or a composite that also factors uniquely into primes, or in the case of the integer 11, not factor into any prime.
