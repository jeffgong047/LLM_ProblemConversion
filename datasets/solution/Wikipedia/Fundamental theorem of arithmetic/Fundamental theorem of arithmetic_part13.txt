Goksel Agargun and E. Mehmet Özkan. "A Historical Survey of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic" (PDF). Historia Mathematica: 209. One could say that Euclid takes the first step on the way to the existence of prime factorization, and al-Farisi takes the final step by actually proving the existence of a finite prime factorization in his first proposition. ^ Rashed, Roshdi (2002-09-11).

The famous physicist and mathematician Kamal al-Din al-Farisi compiled a paper in which he set out deliberately to prove the theorem of Ibn Qurra in an algebraic way. This forced him to an understanding of the first arithmetical functions and to a full preparation which led him to state for the first time the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. ^ Long (1972, p. 45) ^ Pettofrezzo & Byrkit (1970, p. 55) ^ Hardy & Wright (2008, § 1.2) ^ Dawson, John W.
