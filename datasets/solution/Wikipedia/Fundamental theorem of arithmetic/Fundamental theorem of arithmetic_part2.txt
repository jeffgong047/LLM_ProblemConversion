History: The fundamental theorem can be derived from Book VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of Euclid's Elements. If two numbers by multiplying one another make some number, and any prime number measure the product, it will also measure one of the original numbers. — Euclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 30 (In modern terminology: if a prime p divides the product ab, then p divides either a or b or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as Euclid's lemma, and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Any composite number is measured by some prime number. — Euclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 31 (In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by infinite descent. Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number. — Euclid, Elements Book VII, Proposition 32 Proposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible. If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any other prime number except those originally measuring it. — Euclid, Elements Book IX, Proposition 14 (In modern terminology: a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by André Weil.[7] Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case. While Euclid took the first step on the way to the existence of prime factorization, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī took the final step[8] and stated for the first time the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.[9] Article 16 of Gauss' Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic.[1]
