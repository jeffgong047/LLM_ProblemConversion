operations: The canonical representations of the product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers a and b can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of a and b themselves: a⋅b=2a1+b13a2+b25a3+b37a4+b4⋯=∏piai+bi,gcd(a,b)=2min(a1,b1)3min(a2,b2)5min(a3,b3)7min(a4,b4)⋯=∏pimin(ai,bi),lcm⁡(a,b)=2max(a1,b1)3max(a2,b2)5max(a3,b3)7max(a4,b4)⋯=∏pimax(ai,bi).2a =2^a_1+b_13^a_2+b_25^a_3+b_37^a_4+b_4⋯ =_i^a_i+b_i, (a,b) =2^min(a_1,b_1)3^min(a_2,b_2)5^min(a_3,b_3)7^min(a_4,b_4)⋯ =_i^min(a_i,b_i), lcm(a,b) =2^max(a_1,b_1)3^max(a_2,b_2)5^max(a_3,b_3)7^max(a_4,b_4)⋯ =_i^max(a_i,b_i). However, integer factorization, especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs. So these formulas have limited use in practice. Arithmetic
