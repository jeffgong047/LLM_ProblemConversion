On when a smooth map between smooth manifolds is a locally trivial fibration
In mathematics, or specifically, in differential topology, Ehresmann's lemma or Ehresmann's fibration theorem states that if a smooth mapping f:M→N, where M and N are smooth manifolds, is

a surjective submersion, and
a proper map (in particular, this condition is always satisfied if M is compact),
then it is a locally trivial fibration. This is a foundational result in differential topology due to Charles Ehresmann, and has many variants.
