theorem: Let x˙=A(t)xẋ=A(t)x be a linear first order differential equation, where x(t)(t) is a column vector of length n and A(t)(t) an n×n periodic matrix with period T (that is A(t+T)=A(t)(t+T)=A(t) for all real values of t). Let ϕ(t)ϕ (t) be a fundamental matrix solution of this differential equation. Then, for all t∈R∈ℝ, ϕ(t+T)=ϕ(t)ϕ−1(0)ϕ(T).ϕ(t+T)=ϕ(t)ϕ^-1(0)ϕ(T). Here ϕ−1(0)ϕ(T)ϕ^-1(0)ϕ(T) is known as the monodromy matrix. In addition, for each matrix B (possibly complex) such that eTB=ϕ−1(0)ϕ(T),^TB=ϕ^-1(0)ϕ(T), there is a periodic (period T) matrix function t↦P(t)(t) such that ϕ(t)=P(t)etBforallt∈R.ϕ(t)=P(t)e^tBforallt∈ℝ. Also, there is a real matrix R and a real periodic (period-2T2T) matrix function t↦Q(t)(t) such that ϕ(t)=Q(t)etRforallt∈R.ϕ(t)=Q(t)e^tRforallt∈ℝ. In the above B, P, Q and R are n×n matrices.
