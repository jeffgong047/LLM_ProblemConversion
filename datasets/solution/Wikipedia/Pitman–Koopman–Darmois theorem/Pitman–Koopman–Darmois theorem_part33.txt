Footnotes: ^ For example, the family of normal distributions includes the standard normal distribution N(0, 1) with mean 0 and variance 1, as well as other normal distributions with different mean and variance. ^ "Partition function" is often used in statistics as a synonym of "normalization factor". ^ These distributions are often not themselves exponential families. Common examples of non-exponential families arising from exponential ones are the Student's t-distribution, beta-binomial distribution and Dirichlet-multinomial distribution.
