distribution: As an example of a discrete exponential family, consider the binomial distribution with known number of trials n. The probability mass function for this distribution is f(x)=(nx)px(1−p)n−x,x∈0,1,2,…,n.(x)=np^x(1-p)^n-x,∈{0,1,2,…,n}. This can equivalently be written as f(x)=(nx)exp⁡(xlog⁡(p1−p)+nlog⁡(1−p)),(x)=nexp(xlog(p/1-p)+nlog(1-p)), which shows that the binomial distribution is an exponential family, whose natural parameter is η=log⁡p1−p.η=logp/1-p. This function of p is known as logit. Table of
