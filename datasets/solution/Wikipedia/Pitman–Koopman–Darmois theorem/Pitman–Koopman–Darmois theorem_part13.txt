variance: Next, consider the case of a normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. The probability density function is then f(y;μ,σ)=12πσ2e−(y−μ)2/2σ2.(y;μ,σ)=1/√(2πσ^2)e^-(y-μ)^2/2σ^2. This is an exponential family which can be written in canonical form by defining η=[μσ2,−12σ2]h(y)=12πT(y)=(y,y2)TA(η)=μ22σ2+log⁡|σ|=−η124η2+12log⁡|12η2|η =[ μ/σ^2, -1/2σ^2 ] h(y) =1/√(2π) T(y) =(y,y^2)^T A(η) =μ^2/2σ^2+log|σ|=-η_1^2/4η_2+1/2log|1/2η_2| Binomial
