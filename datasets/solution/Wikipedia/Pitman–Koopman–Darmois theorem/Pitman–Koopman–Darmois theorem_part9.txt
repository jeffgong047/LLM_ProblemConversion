Interpretation: In the definitions above, the functions T(x), η(θ), and A(η) were arbitrary. However, these functions have important interpretations in the resulting probability distribution. T(x) is a sufficient statistic of the distribution. For exponential families, the sufficient statistic is a function of the data that holds all information the data x provides with regard to the unknown parameter values. This means that, for any data sets x and y, the likelihood ratio is the same, that is f(x;θ1)f(x;θ2)=f(y;θ1)f(y;θ2)f(x;θ_1)/f(x;θ_2)=f(y;θ_1)/f(y;θ_2) if T(x) = T(y) . This is true even if x and y are not equal to each other. The dimension of T(x) equals the number of parameters of θ and encompasses all of the information regarding the data related to the parameter θ. The sufficient statistic of a set of independent identically distributed data observations is simply the sum of individual sufficient statistics, and encapsulates all the information needed to describe the posterior distribution of the parameters, given the data (and hence to derive any desired estimate of the parameters). (This important property is discussed further below.) η is called the natural parameter. The set of values of η for which the function fX(x;η)_X(x;η) is integrable is called the natural parameter space. It can be shown that the natural parameter space is always convex. A(η) is called the log-partition function[b] because it is the logarithm of a normalization factor, without which fX(x;θ)_X(x;θ) would not be a probability distribution: A(η)=log⁡(∫Xh(x)exp⁡(η(θ)⋅T(x))dx)(η)=log(∫_Xh(x) exp(η(θ)(x)) dx) The function A is important in its own right, because the mean, variance and other moments of the sufficient statistic T(x) can be derived simply by differentiating A(η). For example, because log(x) is one of the components of the sufficient statistic of the gamma distribution, E⁡[log⁡x]ℰ[] can be easily determined for this distribution using A(η). Technically, this is true because K(u∣η)=A(η+u)−A(η),(u|η)=A(η+u)-A(η) , is the cumulant generating function of the sufficient statistic.
