2: As another example consider a real valued random variable X with density pθ(x)=θe−x(1+e−x)θ+1_θ(x)=^-x/(1+e^-x)^θ+1 indexed by shape parameter θ∈(0,∞)θ∈(0,∞) (this is called the skew-logistic distribution). The density can be rewritten as e−x1+e−xexp⁡(−θlog⁡(1+e−x)+log⁡(θ))e^-x/1+e^-xexp(-θlog(1+e^-x)+log(θ)) Notice this is an exponential family with natural parameter η=−θ,η=-θ, sufficient statistic T=log⁡(1+e−x),=log(1+e^-x), and log-partition function A(η)=−log⁡(θ)=−log⁡(−η)(η)=-log(θ)=-log(-η) So using the first identity, E⁡(log⁡(1+e−X))=E⁡(T)=∂A(η)∂η=∂∂η[−log⁡(−η)]=1−η=1θ,E(log(1+e^-X))=E(T)=(η)/∂η=∂/∂η[-log(-η)]=1/-η=1/θ, and using the second identity var⁡(log⁡(1+e−X))=∂2A(η)∂η2=∂∂η[1−η]=1(−η)2=1θ2.var(log(1+e^-X))=∂^2A(η)/∂η^2=∂/∂η[1/-η]=1/(-η)^2=1/θ^2. This example illustrates a case where using this method is very simple, but the direct calculation would be nearly impossible. Example
