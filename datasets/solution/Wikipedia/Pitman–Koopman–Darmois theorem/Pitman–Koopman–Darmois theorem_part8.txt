formulation: We use cumulative distribution functions (CDF) in order to encompass both discrete and continuous distributions. Suppose H is a non-decreasing function of a real variable. Then Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals with respect to dH(x)d H(𝐱) are integrals with respect to the reference measure of the exponential family generated by H . Any member of that exponential family has cumulative distribution function dF(x∣θ)=exp⁡(η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ))dH(x).d F( 𝐱|θ )=exp( η(θ)·𝐓(𝐱) - A(θ) ) d H(𝐱) . H(x) is a Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrator for the reference measure. When the reference measure is finite, it can be normalized and H is actually the cumulative distribution function of a probability distribution. If F is absolutely continuous with a density f(x)(x) with respect to a reference measure dx d x (typically Lebesgue measure), one can write dF(x)=f(x)dx d F(x)=f(x) d x . In this case, H is also absolutely continuous and can be written dH(x)=h(x)dx d H(x)=h(x) d x so the formulas reduce to that of the previous paragraphs. If F is discrete, then H is a step function (with steps on the support of F). Alternatively, we can write the probability measure directly as P(dx∣θ)=exp⁡(η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ))μ(dx).( d 𝐱|θ )=exp( η(θ)·𝐓(𝐱)-A(θ) ) μ(d 𝐱) . for some reference measure μμ .
