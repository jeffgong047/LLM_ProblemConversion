variable: The vector-parameter form over a single scalar-valued random variable can be trivially expanded to cover a joint distribution over a vector of random variables. The resulting distribution is simply the same as the above distribution for a scalar-valued random variable with each occurrence of the scalar x replaced by the vector x=(x1,x2,⋯,xk)T.𝐱=(x_1,x_2,⋯,x_k)^𝖳 . The dimensions k of the random variable need not match the dimension d of the parameter vector, nor (in the case of a curved exponential function) the dimension s of the natural parameter ηη and sufficient statistic T(x) . The distribution in this case is written as fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp(∑i=1sηi(θ)Ti(x)−A(θ))_X(𝐱|θ)=h(𝐱) exp( ∑_i=1^sη_i(θ)T_i(𝐱)-A(θ) ) Or more compactly as fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp(η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ))_X( 𝐱|θ )=h(𝐱) exp( η(θ)·𝐓(𝐱)-A(θ) ) Or alternatively as fX(x∣θ)=g(θ)h(x)exp(η(θ)⋅T(x))_X( 𝐱|θ )=g(θ) h(𝐱) exp( η(θ)·𝐓(𝐱) ) Measure-theoretic
