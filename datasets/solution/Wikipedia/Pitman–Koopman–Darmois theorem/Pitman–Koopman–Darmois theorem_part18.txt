statistic: Now, the moment-generating function of T(x) is MT(u)≡E[eu⊤T(x)∣η]=∫xh(x)e(η+u)⊤T(x)−A(η)dx=eA(η+u)−A(η)_T(u)[e^u^⊤T(x)|η]=∫_xh(x)e^(η+u)^⊤T(x)-A(η) dx=e^A(η+u)-A(η) proving the earlier statement that K(u∣η)=A(η+u)−A(η)(u|η)=A(η+u)-A(η) is the cumulant generating function for T. An important subclass of exponential families are the natural exponential families, which have a similar form for the moment-generating function for the distribution of x. Differential identities for
