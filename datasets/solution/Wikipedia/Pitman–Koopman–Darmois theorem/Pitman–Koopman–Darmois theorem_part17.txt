distribution: We start with the normalization of the probability distribution. In general, any non-negative function f(x) that serves as the kernel of a probability distribution (the part encoding all dependence on x) can be made into a proper distribution by normalizing: i.e. p(x)=1Zf(x)(x)=1/Zf(x) where Z=∫xf(x)dx.=∫_xf(x) dx. The factor Z is sometimes termed the normalizer or partition function, based on an analogy to statistical physics. In the case of an exponential family where p(x;η)=g(η)h(x)eη⋅T(x),(x;η)=g(η)h(x)e^η·𝐓(x), the kernel is K(x)=h(x)eη⋅T(x)(x)=h(x)e^η·𝐓(x) and the partition function is Z=∫xh(x)eη⋅T(x)dx.=∫_xh(x)e^η·𝐓(x) dx. Since the distribution must be normalized, we have 1=∫xg(η)h(x)eη⋅T(x)dx=g(η)∫xh(x)eη⋅T(x)dx=g(η)Z.1=∫_xg(η)h(x)e^η·𝐓(x) dx=g(η)∫_xh(x)e^η·𝐓(x) dx=g(η)Z. In other words, g(η)=1Z(η)=1/Z or equivalently A(η)=−log⁡g(η)=log⁡Z.(η)=-(η)=. This justifies calling A the log-normalizer or log-partition function. Moment-generating function of the sufficient
