Properties: Exponential families have a large number of properties that make them extremely useful for statistical analysis. In many cases, it can be shown that only exponential families have these properties. Examples: Exponential families are the only families with sufficient statistics that can summarize arbitrary amounts of independent identically distributed data using a fixed number of values. (Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem) Exponential families have conjugate priors, an important property in Bayesian statistics. The posterior predictive distribution of an exponential-family random variable with a conjugate prior can always be written in closed form (provided that the normalizing factor of the exponential-family distribution can itself be written in closed form).[c] In the mean-field approximation in variational Bayes (used for approximating the posterior distribution in large Bayesian networks), the best approximating posterior distribution of an exponential-family node (a node is a random variable in the context of Bayesian networks) with a conjugate prior is in the same family as the node.[8] Given an exponential family defined by fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp[θ⋅T(x)−A(θ)]_X(x|θ)=h(x) exp[ θ(x)-A(θ) ], where ΘΘ is the parameter space, such that θ∈Θ⊂Rkθ∈Θ⊂ℝ^k. Then If ΘΘ has nonempty interior in Rkℝ^k, then given any IID samples X1,...,Xn∼fX_1,...,X_n_X, the statistic T(X1,...,Xn):=∑i=1nT(Xi)(X_1,...,X_n):=∑_i=1^nT(X_i) is a complete statistic for θθ.[9][10] T is a minimal statistic for θθ iff for all θ1,θ2∈Θθ_1,θ_2∈Θ, and x1,x2_1,x_2 in the support of X, if (θ1−θ2)⋅(T(x1)−T(x2))=0(θ_1-θ_2)·(T(x_1)-T(x_2))=0, then θ1=θ2θ_1=θ_2 or x1=x2_1=x_2.[11]
