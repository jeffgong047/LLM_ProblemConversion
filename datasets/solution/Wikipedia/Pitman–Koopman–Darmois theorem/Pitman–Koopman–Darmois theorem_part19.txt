cumulants: In particular, using the properties of the cumulant generating function, E⁡(Tj)=∂A(η)∂ηjE(T_j)=(η)/∂η_j and cov⁡(Ti,Tj)=∂2A(η)∂ηi∂ηj.cov(T_i,_j)=∂^2A(η)/∂η_i ∂η_j. The first two raw moments and all mixed second moments can be recovered from these two identities. Higher-order moments and cumulants are obtained by higher derivatives. This technique is often useful when T is a complicated function of the data, whose moments are difficult to calculate by integration. Another way to see this that does not rely on the theory of cumulants is to begin from the fact that the distribution of an exponential family must be normalized, and differentiate. We illustrate using the simple case of a one-dimensional parameter, but an analogous derivation holds more generally. In the one-dimensional case, we have p(x)=g(η)h(x)eηT(x).(x)=g(η)h(x)e^(x). This must be normalized, so 1=∫xp(x)dx=∫xg(η)h(x)eηT(x)dx=g(η)∫xh(x)eηT(x)dx.1=∫_xp(x) dx=∫_xg(η)h(x)e^(x) dx=g(η)∫_xh(x)e^(x) dx. Take the derivative of both sides with respect to η: 0=g(η)ddη∫xh(x)eηT(x)dx+g′(η)∫xh(x)eηT(x)dx=g(η)∫xh(x)(ddηeηT(x))dx+g′(η)∫xh(x)eηT(x)dx=g(η)∫xh(x)eηT(x)T(x)dx+g′(η)∫xh(x)eηT(x)dx=∫xT(x)g(η)h(x)eηT(x)dx+g′(η)g(η)∫xg(η)h(x)eηT(x)dx=∫xT(x)p(x)dx+g′(η)g(η)∫xp(x)dx=E⁡[T(x)]+g′(η)g(η)=E⁡[T(x)]+ddηlog⁡g(η)0 =g(η)d/dη∫_xh(x)e^(x) dx+g'(η)∫_xh(x)e^(x) dx =g(η)∫_xh(x)(d/dηe^(x)) dx+g'(η)∫_xh(x)e^(x) dx =g(η)∫_xh(x)e^(x)T(x) dx+g'(η)∫_xh(x)e^(x) dx =∫_xT(x)g(η)h(x)e^(x) dx+g'(η)/g(η)∫_xg(η)h(x)e^(x) dx =∫_xT(x)p(x) dx+g'(η)/g(η)∫_xp(x) dx =E[T(x)]+g'(η)/g(η) =E[T(x)]+d/dη(η) Therefore, E⁡[T(x)]=−ddηlog⁡g(η)=ddηA(η).E[T(x)]=-d/dη(η)=d/dηA(η).
