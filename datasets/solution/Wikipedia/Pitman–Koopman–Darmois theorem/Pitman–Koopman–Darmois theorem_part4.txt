parameter: A single-parameter exponential family is a set of probability distributions whose probability density function (or probability mass function, for the case of a discrete distribution) can be expressed in the form fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp[η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ)]_X(x|θ)=h(x) exp[ η(θ)(x)-A(θ) ] where T(x), h(x), η(θ), and A(θ) are known functions. The function h(x) must of course be non-negative. An alternative, equivalent form often given is fX(x∣θ)=h(x)g(θ)exp[η(θ)⋅T(x)]_X(x|θ)=h(x) g(θ) exp[ η(θ)(x) ] or equivalently fX(x∣θ)=exp[η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ)+B(x)]_X(x|θ)=exp[ η(θ)(x)-A(θ)+B(x) ] The value θ is called the parameter of the family. In addition, the support of fX(x∣θ)_X(x|θ) (i.e. the set of all x for which fX(x∣θ)_X(x|θ) is greater than 0) does not depend on θθ.[7] This can be used to exclude a parametric family distribution from being an exponential family. For example, the Pareto distribution has a pdf which is defined for x≥xm_m (xm_m being the scale parameter) and its support, therefore, has a lower limit of xm_m. Since the support of fα,xm(x)_α,x_m(x) is dependent on the value of the parameter, the family of Pareto distributions does not form an exponential family of distributions (at least when xm_m is unknown). Often x is a vector of measurements, in which case T(x) may be a function from the space of possible values of x to the real numbers. More generally, η(θ) and T(x) can each be vector-valued such that η′(θ)⋅T(x)η'(θ)(x) is real-valued. However, see the discussion below on vector parameters, regarding the curved exponential family. If η(θ) = θ, then the exponential family is said to be in canonical form. By defining a transformed parameter η = η(θ), it is always possible to convert an exponential family to canonical form. The canonical form is non-unique, since η(θ) can be multiplied by any nonzero constant, provided that T(x) is multiplied by that constant's reciprocal, or a constant c can be added to η(θ) and h(x) multiplied by exp[−c⋅T(x)]exp[-c(x) ] to offset it. In the special case that η(θ) = θ and T(x) = x then the family is called a natural exponential family. Even when x is a scalar, and there is only a single parameter, the functions η(θ) and T(x) can still be vectors, as described below. The function A(θ), or equivalently g(θ), is automatically determined once the other functions have been chosen, since it must assume a form that causes the distribution to be normalized (sum or integrate to one over the entire domain). Furthermore, both of these functions can always be written as functions of η, even when η(θ) is not a one-to-one function, i.e. two or more different values of θ map to the same value of η(θ), and hence η(θ) cannot be inverted. In such a case, all values of θ mapping to the same η(θ) will also have the same value for A(θ) and g(θ). Factorization of the variables
