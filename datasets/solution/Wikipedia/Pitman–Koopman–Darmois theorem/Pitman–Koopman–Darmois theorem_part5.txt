involved: What is important to note, and what characterizes all exponential family variants, is that the parameter(s) and the observation variable(s) must factorize (can be separated into products each of which involves only one type of variable), either directly or within either part (the base or exponent) of an exponentiation operation. Generally, this means that all of the factors constituting the density or mass function must be of one of the following forms: f(x),g(θ),cf(x),cg(θ),[f(x)]c,[g(θ)]c,[f(x)]g(θ),[g(θ)]f(x),[f(x)]h(x)g(θ),or[g(θ)]h(x)j(θ),(x),g(θ),c^f(x),c^g(θ),[f(x)]^c,[g(θ)]^c,[f(x)]^g(θ),[g(θ)]^f(x),[f(x)]^h(x)g(θ),or[g(θ)]^h(x)j(θ), where f and h are arbitrary functions of x; g and j are arbitrary functions of θ; and c is an arbitrary "constant" expression (i.e. an expression not involving x or θ). There are further restrictions on how many such factors can occur. For example, the two expressions: [f(x)g(θ)]h(x)j(θ),[f(x)]h(x)j(θ)[g(θ)]h(x)j(θ),[f(x)g(θ)]^h(x)j(θ), [f(x)]^h(x)j(θ)[g(θ)]^h(x)j(θ), are the same, i.e. a product of two "allowed" factors. However, when rewritten into the factorized form, [f(x)g(θ)]h(x)j(θ)=[f(x)]h(x)j(θ)[g(θ)]h(x)j(θ)=e[h(x)log⁡f(x)]j(θ)+h(x)[j(θ)log⁡g(θ)],[f(x)g(θ)]^h(x)j(θ)=[f(x)]^h(x)j(θ)[g(θ)]^h(x)j(θ)=e^[h(x)(x)]j(θ)+h(x)[j(θ)(θ)], it can be seen that it cannot be expressed in the required form. (However, a form of this sort is a member of a curved exponential family, which allows multiple factorized terms in the exponent.[citation needed]) To see why an expression of the form [f(x)]g(θ)[f(x)]^g(θ) qualifies, [f(x)]g(θ)=eg(θ)log⁡f(x)[f(x)]^g(θ)=e^g(θ)(x) and hence factorizes inside of the exponent. Similarly, [f(x)]h(x)g(θ)=eh(x)g(θ)log⁡f(x)=e[h(x)log⁡f(x)]g(θ)[f(x)]^h(x)g(θ)=e^h(x)g(θ)(x)=e^[h(x)(x)]g(θ) and again factorizes inside of the exponent. A factor consisting of a sum where both types of variables are involved (e.g. a factor of the form 1+f(x)g(θ)1+f(x)g(θ)) cannot be factorized in this fashion (except in some cases where occurring directly in an exponent); this is why, for example, the Cauchy distribution and Student's t distribution are not exponential families.
