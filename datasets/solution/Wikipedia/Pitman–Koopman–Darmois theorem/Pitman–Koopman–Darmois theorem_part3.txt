distributions: Exponential families include many of the most common distributions. Among many others, exponential families includes the following:[6] normal exponential gamma chi-squared beta Dirichlet Bernoulli categorical Poisson Wishart inverse Wishart geometric A number of common distributions are exponential families, but only when certain parameters are fixed and known. For example: binomial (with fixed number of trials) multinomial (with fixed number of trials) negative binomial (with fixed number of failures) Notice that in each case, the parameters which must be fixed determine a limit on the size of observation values. Examples of common distributions that are not exponential families are Student's t, most mixture distributions, and even the family of uniform distributions when the bounds are not fixed. See the section below on examples for more discussion. Scalar
