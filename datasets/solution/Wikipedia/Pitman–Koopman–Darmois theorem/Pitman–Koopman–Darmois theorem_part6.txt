parameter: The definition in terms of one real-number parameter can be extended to one real-vector parameter θ≡[θ1,θ2,…,θs]T.θ≡[ θ_1, θ_2, …, θ_s ]^𝖳 . A family of distributions is said to belong to a vector exponential family if the probability density function (or probability mass function, for discrete distributions) can be written as fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp⁡(∑i=1sηi(θ)Ti(x)−A(θ)),_X(x|θ)=h(x) exp(∑_i=1^sη_i(θ)T_i(x)-A(θ)) , or in a more compact form, fX(x∣θ)=h(x)exp⁡(η(θ)⋅T(x)−A(θ))_X(x|θ)=h(x) exp(η(θ)·𝐓(x)-A(θ)) This form writes the sum as a dot product of vector-valued functions η(θ)η(θ) and T(x)𝐓(x) . An alternative, equivalent form often seen is fX(x∣θ)=h(x)g(θ)exp⁡(η(θ)⋅T(x))_X(x|θ)=h(x) g(θ) exp(η(θ)·𝐓(x)) As in the scalar valued case, the exponential family is said to be in canonical form if ηi(θ)=θi∀i. η_i(θ)=θ_i . A vector exponential family is said to be curved if the dimension of θ≡[θ1,θ2,…,θd]Tθ≡[ θ_1, θ_2, …, θ_d ]^𝖳 is less than the dimension of the vector η(θ)≡[η1(θ),η2(θ),…,ηs(θ)]T.η(θ)≡[ η_1(θ), η_2(θ), …, η_s(θ) ]^𝖳 . That is, if the dimension, d, of the parameter vector is less than the number of functions, s, of the parameter vector in the above representation of the probability density function. Most common distributions in the exponential family are not curved, and many algorithms designed to work with any exponential family implicitly or explicitly assume that the distribution is not curved. Just as in the case of a scalar-valued parameter, the function A(θ)(θ) or equivalently g(θ)(θ) is automatically determined by the normalization constraint, once the other functions have been chosen. Even if η(θ)η(θ) is not one-to-one, functions A(η)(η) and g(η)(η) can be defined by requiring that the distribution is normalized for each value of the natural parameter ηη. This yields the canonical form fX(x∣η)=h(x)exp⁡(η⋅T(x)−A(η)),_X(x|η)=h(x) exp(η·𝐓(x)-A(η)), or equivalently fX(x∣η)=h(x)g(η)exp⁡(η⋅T(x))._X(x|η)=h(x) g(η) exp(η·𝐓(x)). The above forms may sometimes be seen with ηTT(x)η^𝖳𝐓(x) in place of η⋅T(x)η·𝐓(x) . These are exactly equivalent formulations, merely using different notation for the dot product.
