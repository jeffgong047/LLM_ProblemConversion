variance: As a first example, consider a random variable distributed normally with unknown mean μ and known variance σ2. The probability density function is then fσ(x;μ)=12πσ2e−(x−μ)2/(2σ2)._σ(x;μ)=1/√(2πσ^2)e^-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2). This is a single-parameter exponential family, as can be seen by setting hσ(x)=12πσ2e−x2/(2σ2)Tσ(x)=xσAσ(μ)=μ22σ2ησ(μ)=μσ.h_σ(x) =1/√(2πσ^2)e^-x^2/(2σ^2) T_σ(x) =x/σ A_σ(μ) =μ^2/2σ^2 η_σ(μ) =μ/σ. If σ = 1 this is in canonical form, as then η(μ) = μ. Normal distribution: unknown mean and unknown
