The Skoda–El Mir theorem is a theorem of complex geometry, stated as follows: Theorem (Skoda,[1] El Mir,[2] Sibony[3]). Let X be a complex manifold, and E a closed complete pluripolar set in X. Consider a closed positive current ΘΘ on X∖E which is locally integrable around E. Then the trivial extension of ΘΘ to X is closed on X.
