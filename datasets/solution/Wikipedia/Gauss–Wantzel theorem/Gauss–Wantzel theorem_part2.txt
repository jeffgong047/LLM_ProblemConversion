constructibility: Number of sides of known constructible polygons having up to 1000 sides (bold) or odd side count (red) Construction of the regular 17-gon Some regular polygons are easy to construct with compass and straightedge; others are not. The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to construct a regular polygon with 3, 4, or 5 sides,[1]: p. xi and they knew how to construct a regular polygon with double the number of sides of a given regular polygon.[1]: pp. 49–50 This led to the question being posed: is it possible to construct all regular polygons with compass and straightedge? If not, which n-gons (that is, polygons with n edges) are constructible and which are not? Carl Friedrich Gauss proved the constructibility of the regular 17-gon in 1796. Five years later, he developed the theory of Gaussian periods in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. This theory allowed him to formulate a sufficient condition for the constructibility of regular polygons. Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also necessary,[2] but never published his proof. A full proof of necessity was given by Pierre Wantzel in 1837. The result is known as the Gauss–Wantzel theorem: A regular n-gon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if n is a power of 2 or the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes. A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form 2(2m)+1.2^(2^m)+1. In order to reduce a geometric problem to a problem of pure number theory, the proof uses the fact that a regular n-gon is constructible if and only if the cosine cos⁡(2π/n)cos(2π/n) is a constructible number—that is, can be written in terms of the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots. Equivalently, a regular n-gon is constructible if any root of the nth cyclotomic polynomial is constructible. Detailed results by Gauss's
