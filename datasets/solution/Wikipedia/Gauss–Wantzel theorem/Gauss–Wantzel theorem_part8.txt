constructions: The concept of constructibility as discussed in this article applies specifically to compass and straightedge constructions. More constructions become possible if other tools are allowed. The so-called neusis constructions, for example, make use of a marked ruler. The constructions are a mathematical idealization and are assumed to be done exactly. A regular polygon with n sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if n=2r3sp1p2⋯pk,=2^r3^sp_1p_2_k, where r, s, k ≥ 0 and where the pi are distinct Pierpont primes greater than 3 (primes of the form 2t3u+1).2^t3^u+1).[8]: Thm. 2 These polygons are exactly the regular polygons that can be constructed with Conic section, and the regular polygons that can be constructed with paper folding. The first numbers of sides of these polygons are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45, 48, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 63, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 90, 91, 95, 96, 97, 102, 104, 105, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 117, 119, 120, 126, 128, 130, 133, 135, 136, 140, 144, 146, 148, 152, 153, 156, 160, 162, 163, 168, 170, 171, 180, 182, 185, 189, 190, 192, 193, 194, 195, 204, 208, 210, 216, 218, 219, 221, 222, 224, 228, 234, 238, 240, 243, 247, 252, 255, 256, 257, 259, 260, 266, 270, 272, 273, 280, 285, 288, 291, 292, 296, ...
