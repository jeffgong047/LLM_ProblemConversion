constructions: Compass and straightedge constructions are known for all known constructible polygons. If n = pq with p = 2 or p and q coprime, an n-gon can be constructed from a p-gon and a q-gon. If p = 2, draw a q-gon and bisect one of its central angles. From this, a 2q-gon can be constructed. If p > 2, inscribe a p-gon and a q-gon in the same circle in such a way that they share a vertex. Because p and q are coprime, there exists integers a and b such that ap + bq = 1. Then 2aπ/q + 2bπ/p = 2π/pq. From this, a pq-gon can be constructed. Thus one only has to find a compass and straightedge construction for n-gons where n is a Fermat prime. The construction for an equilateral triangle is simple and has been known since antiquity; see Equilateral triangle. Constructions for the regular pentagon were described both by Euclid (Elements, ca. 300 BC), and by Ptolemy (Almagest, ca. 150 AD). Although Gauss proved that the regular 17-gon is constructible, he did not actually show how to do it. The first construction is due to Erchinger, a few years after Gauss' work. The first explicit constructions of a regular 257-gon were given by Magnus Georg Paucker (1822)[5] and Friedrich Julius Richelot (1832).[6] A construction for a regular 65537-gon was first given by Johann Gustav Hermes (1894). The construction is very complex; Hermes spent 10 years completing the 200-page manuscript.[7]
