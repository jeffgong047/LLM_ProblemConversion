Setup: Let π:E⟶Bπ be a fibre bundle with fibre F. Assume that for each degree p, the singular cohomology rational vector space Hp(F)=Hp(F;Q)^p(F)=H^p(F;ℚ) is finite-dimensional, and that the inclusion ι:F⟶Eι induces a surjection in rational cohomology ι∗:H∗(E)⟶H∗(F)ι^*^*(E)^*(F). Consider a section of this surjection s:H∗(F)⟶H∗(E)^*(F)^*(E), by definition, this map satisfies ι∗∘s=Idι^*=Id. The Leray–Hirsch
