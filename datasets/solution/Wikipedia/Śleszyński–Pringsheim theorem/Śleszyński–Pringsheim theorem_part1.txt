Criterion for convergence of continued fractions In mathematics, the Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem is a statement about convergence of certain continued fractions. It was discovered by Ivan Śleszyński[1] and Alfred Pringsheim[2] in the late 19th century.[3] It states that if an_n, bn_n, for n=1,2,3,…=1,2,3,… are real numbers and |bn|≥|an|+1|b_n|≥|a_n|+1 for all n, then a1b1+a2b2+a3b3+⋱a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3+⋱ converges absolutely to a number f satisfying 0<|f|<10<|f|<1,[4] meaning that the series f=∑nAnBn−An−1Bn−1,=∑_n{A_n/B_n-A_n-1/B_n-1}, where An/Bn_n/B_n are the convergents of the continued fraction, converges absolutely.
