theorems: We look at the proof for the upper bound and the maximum of f. By applying these results to the function âˆ’f-f, the existence of the lower bound and the result for the minimum of f follows. Also note that everything in the proof is done within the context of the real numbers. We first prove the boundedness theorem, which is a step in the proof of the extreme value theorem. The basic steps involved in the proof of the extreme value theorem are: Prove the boundedness theorem. Find a sequence so that its image converges to the supremum of f. Show that there exists a subsequence that converges to a point in the domain. Use continuity to show that the image of the subsequence converges to the supremum. Proof of the boundedness
