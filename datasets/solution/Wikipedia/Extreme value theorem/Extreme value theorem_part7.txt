proof: Statement If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it is bounded on [a,b][a,b] Proof Consider the set B of points p in [a,b][a,b] such that f(x)(x) is bounded on [a,p][a,p]. We note that a is one such point, for f(x)(x) is bounded on [a,a][a,a] by the value f(a)(a). If e>a>a is another point, then all points between a and e also belong to B. In other words B is an interval closed at its left end by a. Now f is continuous on the right at a, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(a)|<1|f(x)-f(a)|<1 for all x in [a,a+δ][a,a+δ]. Thus f is bounded by f(a)−1(a)-1 and f(a)+1(a)+1 on the interval [a,a+δ][a,a+δ] so that all these points belong to B. So far, we know that B is an interval of non-zero length, closed at its left end by a. Next, B is bounded above by b. Hence the set B has a supremum in [a,b][a,b] ; let us call it s. From the non-zero length of B we can deduce that s>a>a. Suppose s<b<b. Now f is continuous at s, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<1|f(x)-f(s)|<1 for all x in [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ] so that f is bounded on this interval. But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point belonging to B, e say, which is greater than s−δ/2-δ/2. Thus f is bounded on [a,e][a,e] which overlaps [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ] so that f is bounded on [a,s+δ][a,s+δ]. This however contradicts the supremacy of s. We must therefore have s=b=b. Now f is continuous on the left at s, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<1|f(x)-f(s)|<1 for all x in [s−δ,s][s-δ,s] so that f is bounded on this interval. But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point belonging to B, e say, which is greater than s−δ/2-δ/2. Thus f is bounded on [a,e][a,e] which overlaps [s−δ,s][s-δ,s] so that f is bounded on [a,s][a,s]. ∎ Proof of the extreme value
