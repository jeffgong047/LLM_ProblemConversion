apply: The following examples show why the function domain must be closed and bounded in order for the theorem to apply. Each fails to attain a maximum on the given interval. f(x)=x(x)=x defined over [0,∞)[0,∞) is not bounded from above. f(x)=x1+x(x)=x/1+x defined over [0,∞)[0,∞) is bounded but does not attain its least upper bound 11. f(x)=1x(x)=1/x defined over (0,1](0,1] is not bounded from above. f(x)=1−x(x)=1-x defined over (0,1](0,1] is bounded but never attains its least upper bound 11. Defining f(0)=0(0)=0 in the last two examples shows that both theorems require continuity on [a,b][a,b]. Generalization to metric and topological
