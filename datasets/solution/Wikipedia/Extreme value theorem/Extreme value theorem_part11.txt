principles: Statement If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it attains its supremum on [a,b][a,b] Proof By the Boundedness Theorem, f(x)(x) is bounded above on [a,b][a,b] and by the completeness property of the real numbers has a supremum in [a,b][a,b]. Let us call it M, or M[a,b][a,b]. It is clear that the restriction of f to the subinterval [a,x][a,x] where x≤b has a supremum M[a,x][a,x] which is less than or equal to M, and that M[a,x][a,x] increases from f(a)(a) to M as x increases from a to b. If f(a)=M(a)=M then we are done. Suppose therefore that f(a)<M(a)<M and let d=M−f(a)=M-f(a). Consider the set L of points x in [a,b][a,b] such that M[a,x]<M[a,x]<M. Clearly a∈L ; moreover if e>a>a is another point in L then all points between a and e also belong to L because M[a,x][a,x] is monotonic increasing. Hence L is a non-empty interval, closed at its left end by a. Now f is continuous on the right at a, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(a)|<d/2|f(x)-f(a)|<d/2 for all x in [a,a+δ][a,a+δ]. Thus f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [a,a+δ][a,a+δ] so that all these points belong to L. Next, L is bounded above by b and has therefore a supremum in [a,b][a,b]: let us call it s. We see from the above that s>a>a. We will show that s is the point we are seeking i.e. the point where f attains its supremum, or in other words f(s)=M(s)=M. Suppose the contrary viz. f(s)<M(s)<M. Let d=M−f(s)=M-f(s) and consider the following two cases: s<b<b. As f is continuous at s, there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<d/2|f(x)-f(s)|<d/2 for all x in [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ]. This means that f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ]. But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point, e say, belonging to L which is greater than s−δ-δ. By the definition of L, M[a,e]<M[a,e]<M. Let d1=M−M[a,e]_1=M-M[a,e] then for all x in [a,e][a,e], f(x)≤M−d1(x)-d_1. Taking d2_2 to be the minimum of d/2/2 and d1_1, we have f(x)≤M−d2(x)-d_2 for all x in [a,s+δ][a,s+δ]. Hence M[a,s+δ]<M[a,s+δ]<M so that s+δ∈L+δ. This however contradicts the supremacy of s and completes the proof. s=b=b. As f is continuous on the left at s, there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<d/2|f(x)-f(s)|<d/2 for all x in [s−δ,s][s-δ,s]. This means that f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [s−δ,s][s-δ,s]. But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point, e say, belonging to L which is greater than s−δ-δ. By the definition of L, M[a,e]<M[a,e]<M. Let d1=M−M[a,e]_1=M-M[a,e] then for all x in [a,e][a,e], f(x)≤M−d1(x)-d_1. Taking d2_2 to be the minimum of d/2/2 and d1_1, we have f(x)≤M−d2(x)-d_2 for all x in [a,b][a,b]. This contradicts the supremacy of M and completes the proof. Extension to semi-continuous
