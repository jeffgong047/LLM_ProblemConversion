spaces: When moving from the real line Rℝ to metric spaces and general topological spaces, the appropriate generalization of a closed bounded interval is a compact set. A set K is said to be compact if it has the following property: from every collection of open sets Uα_α such that ⋃Uα⊃K_α, a finite subcollection Uα1,…,Uαn_α_1,…,U_α_ncan be chosen such that ⋃i=1nUαi⊃K⋃_i=1^nU_α_i. This is usually stated in short as "every open cover of K has a finite subcover". The Heine–Borel theorem asserts that a subset of the real line is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded. Correspondingly, a metric space has the Heine–Borel property if every closed and bounded set is also compact. The concept of a continuous function can likewise be generalized. Given topological spaces V,W,, a function f:V→W:V is said to be continuous if for every open set U⊂W, f−1(U)⊂V^-1(U) is also open. Given these definitions, continuous functions can be shown to preserve compactness:[2] Theorem. If V,W, are topological spaces, f:V→W:V is a continuous function, and K⊂V is compact, then f(K)⊂W(K) is also compact. In particular, if W=R=ℝ, then this theorem implies that f(K)(K) is closed and bounded for any compact set K, which in turn implies that f attains its supremum and infimum on any (nonempty) compact set K. Thus, we have the following generalization of the extreme value theorem:[2] Theorem. If K is a compact set and f:K→R:K→ℝ is a continuous function, then f is bounded and there exist p,q∈K,q such that f(p)=supx∈Kf(x)(p)=sup_xf(x) and f(q)=infx∈Kf(x)(q)=inf_xf(x). Slightly more generally, this is also true for an upper semicontinuous function. (see compact space#Functions and compact spaces). Proving the
