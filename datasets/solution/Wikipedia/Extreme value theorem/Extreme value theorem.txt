A continuous function f(x)(x) on the closed interval [a,b][a,b] showing the absolute max (red) and the absolute min (blue).
In calculus, the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b][a,b], then f must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers c and d in [a,b][a,b] such that:
f(c)≥f(x)≥f(d)∀x∈[a,b](c)(x)(d)  ∈[a,b]
The extreme value theorem is more specific than the related  boundedness theorem, which states merely that a continuous function f on the closed interval [a,b][a,b] is bounded on that interval; that is, there exist real numbers m and M such that:
m≤f(x)≤M∀x∈[a,b].(x)  ∈[a,b].
This does not say that M and m are necessarily the maximum and minimum values of f on the interval [a,b],[a,b], which is what the extreme value theorem stipulates must also be the case.
The extreme value theorem is used to prove Rolle's theorem.  In a formulation due to Karl Weierstrass, this theorem states that a continuous function from a non-empty compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum.


History[edit]
The extreme value theorem was originally proven by Bernard Bolzano in the 1830s in a work Function Theory but the work remained unpublished until 1930. Bolzano's proof consisted of showing that a continuous function on a closed interval was bounded, and then showing that the function attained a maximum and a minimum value.  Both proofs involved what is known today as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem.[1]

Functions to which the theorem does not apply[edit]
The following examples show why the function domain must be closed and bounded in order for the theorem to apply.  Each fails to attain a maximum on the given interval.

f(x)=x(x)=x defined over [0,∞)[0,∞) is not bounded from above.
f(x)=x1+x(x)=x/1+x defined over [0,∞)[0,∞) is bounded but does not attain its least upper bound 11.
f(x)=1x(x)=1/x defined over (0,1](0,1] is not bounded from above.
f(x)=1−x(x)=1-x defined over (0,1](0,1] is bounded but never attains its least upper bound 11.
Defining f(0)=0(0)=0 in the last two examples shows that both theorems require continuity on [a,b][a,b].

Generalization to metric and topological spaces[edit]
When moving from the real line Rℝ to metric spaces and general topological spaces, the appropriate generalization of a closed bounded interval is a compact set. A set K is said to be compact if it has the following property: from every collection of open sets Uα_α such that  ⋃Uα⊃K_α, a finite subcollection Uα1,…,Uαn_α_1,…,U_α_ncan be chosen such that ⋃i=1nUαi⊃K⋃_i=1^nU_α_i. This is usually stated in short as "every open cover of K has a finite subcover". The Heine–Borel theorem asserts that a subset of the real line is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.  Correspondingly, a metric space has the Heine–Borel property if every closed and bounded set is also   compact.
The concept of a continuous function can likewise be generalized.  Given topological spaces V,W,, a function f:V→W:V is said to be continuous if for every open set U⊂W, f−1(U)⊂V^-1(U) is also open.  Given these definitions, continuous functions can be shown to preserve compactness:[2]
Theorem. If V,W, are topological spaces, f:V→W:V is a continuous function, and K⊂V is compact, then f(K)⊂W(K) is also compact.
In particular, if W=R=ℝ, then this theorem implies that f(K)(K) is closed and bounded for any compact set K, which in turn implies that f attains its supremum and infimum on any (nonempty) compact set K.  Thus, we have the following generalization of the extreme value theorem:[2]
Theorem. If K is a compact set and f:K→R:K→ℝ is a continuous function, then f is bounded and there exist p,q∈K,q such that f(p)=supx∈Kf(x)(p)=sup_xf(x) and f(q)=infx∈Kf(x)(q)=inf_xf(x).
Slightly more generally, this is also true for an upper semicontinuous function. (see compact space#Functions and compact spaces).

Proving the theorems[edit]
We look at the proof for the upper bound and the maximum of f. By applying these results to the function −f-f, the existence of the lower bound and the result for the minimum of f follows. Also note that everything in the proof is done within the context of the real numbers.
We first prove the boundedness theorem, which is a step in the proof of the extreme value theorem. The basic steps involved in the proof of the extreme value theorem are:

Prove the boundedness theorem.
Find a sequence so that its image converges to the supremum of f.
Show that there exists a subsequence that converges to a point in the domain.
Use continuity to show that the image of the subsequence converges to the supremum.
Proof of the boundedness theorem[edit]
Statement     If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it is bounded on [a,b][a,b]
Suppose the function f  is not bounded above on the interval [a,b][a,b].  Then, for every natural number n, there exists an xn∈[a,b]_n∈[a,b] such that f(xn)>n(x_n)>n. This defines a sequence (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ. Because [a,b][a,b] is bounded, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem implies that there exists a convergent subsequence (xnk)k∈N(x_n_k)_k∈ℕ of (xn)(x_n). Denote its limit by x. As [a,b][a,b] is closed, it contains x.  Because f is continuous at x, we know that f(xnk)(x_n_k) converges to the real number f(x)(x) (as f is sequentially continuous at x). But f(xnk)>nk≥k(x_n_k)>n_k for every k, which implies that f(xnk)(x_n_k) diverges to +∞+∞, a contradiction. Therefore, f is bounded above on [a,b][a,b]. ◻

Alternative proof[edit]
Statement     If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it is bounded on [a,b][a,b]
Proof      Consider the set B of points p in [a,b][a,b] such that f(x)(x) is bounded on [a,p][a,p].  We note that a is one such point, for f(x)(x) is bounded on [a,a][a,a] by the value f(a)(a).  If e>a>a is another point, then all points between a and e also belong to B.  In other words B is an interval closed at its left end by a.
Now f is continuous on the right at a, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(a)|<1|f(x)-f(a)|<1 for all x in [a,a+δ][a,a+δ]. Thus f is bounded by f(a)−1(a)-1 and f(a)+1(a)+1 on the interval [a,a+δ][a,a+δ] so that all these points belong to B.
So far, we know that B is an interval of non-zero length, closed at its left end by a.
Next, B is bounded above by b.  Hence the set B has a supremum in [a,b][a,b] ; let us call it s. From the non-zero length of B we can deduce that s>a>a.
Suppose s<b<b.  Now f is continuous at s, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<1|f(x)-f(s)|<1 for all x in [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ] so that f is bounded on this interval.  But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point belonging to B, e say, which is greater than s−δ/2-δ/2.  Thus f is bounded on [a,e][a,e] which overlaps [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ] so that f is bounded on [a,s+δ][a,s+δ].  This however contradicts the supremacy of s.
We must therefore have s=b=b.  Now f is continuous on the left at s, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<1|f(x)-f(s)|<1 for all x in [s−δ,s][s-δ,s] so that f is bounded on this interval.  But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point belonging to B, e say, which is greater than s−δ/2-δ/2.  Thus f is bounded on [a,e][a,e] which overlaps [s−δ,s][s-δ,s] so that f is bounded on [a,s][a,s].   
∎

Proof of the extreme value theorem[edit]
By the boundedness theorem, f is bounded from above, hence, by the  Dedekind-completeness of the real numbers, the least upper bound (supremum) M of f exists. It is necessary to find a point d in [a, b] such that M = f(d). Let n be a natural number. As M is the least upper bound, M – 1/n is not an upper bound for f. Therefore, there exists dn in [a, b] so that M – 1/n < f(dn). This defines a sequence {dn}. Since M is an upper bound for f, we have M – 1/n < f(dn) ≤ M for all n.  Therefore, the sequence {f(dn)} converges to M.
The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem tells us that there exists a subsequence {dnk_n_k}, which converges to some d and, as [a, b] is closed, d is in [a, b]. Since f is continuous at d, the sequence {f(dnk_n_k)} converges to f(d). But {f(dnk)} is a subsequence of {f(dn)} that converges to M, so M = f(d). Therefore, f attains its supremum M at d. ∎

Alternative proof of the extreme value theorem[edit]
The set {y ∈ R : y = f(x) for some x ∈ [a,b]} is a bounded set. Hence, its least upper bound exists by least upper bound property of the real numbers. Let M = sup(f(x)) on [a, b].  If there is no point x on [a, b] so that f(x) = M ,then
f(x) < M on [a, b].  Therefore, 1/(M − f(x)) is continuous on [a, b].
However, to every positive number ε, there is always some x in [a, b] such that M − f(x) < ε because M is the least upper bound. Hence, 1/(M − f(x)) > 1/ε, which means that 1/(M − f(x)) is not bounded.  Since every continuous function on a [a, b] is bounded, this contradicts the conclusion that 1/(M − f(x)) was continuous on [a, b].  Therefore, there must be a point x in [a, b] such that f(x) = M. ∎

Proof using the hyperreals[edit]
In the setting of non-standard calculus, let N  be an infinite hyperinteger.  The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension.  Consider its partition into N subintervals of equal infinitesimal length 1/N, with partition points xi = i /N as i "runs" from 0 to N.  The function ƒ  is also naturally extended to a function ƒ* defined on the hyperreals between 0 and 1.  Note that in the standard setting (when N  is finite), a point with the maximal value of ƒ can always be chosen among the N+1 points xi, by induction.  Hence, by the transfer principle, there is a hyperinteger i0 such that 0 ≤ i0 ≤ N and f∗(xi0)≥f∗(xi)^*(x_i_0)^*(x_i)  for all i = 0, ..., N.  Consider the real point
c=st(xi0)=𝐬𝐭(x_i_0)
where st is the standard part function.  An arbitrary real point x lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely x∈[xi,xi+1]∈[x_i,x_i+1], so that  st(xi) = x.  Applying st to the inequality f∗(xi0)≥f∗(xi)^*(x_i_0)^*(x_i), we obtain st(f∗(xi0))≥st(f∗(xi))𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i_0))≥𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i)).  By continuity of ƒ  we have

st(f∗(xi0))=f(st(xi0))=f(c)𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i_0))=f(𝐬𝐭(x_i_0))=f(c).
Hence ƒ(c) ≥ ƒ(x), for all real x, proving c to be a maximum of ƒ.[3]

Proof from first principles[edit]
Statement       If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it attains its supremum on [a,b][a,b]
Proof         By the Boundedness Theorem, f(x)(x) is bounded above on [a,b][a,b] and by the completeness property of the real numbers has a supremum in [a,b][a,b].  Let us call it M, or M[a,b][a,b].  It is clear that the restriction of f to the subinterval [a,x][a,x] where x≤b has a supremum M[a,x][a,x] which is less than or equal to M, and that M[a,x][a,x] increases from f(a)(a) to M as x increases from a to b.
If f(a)=M(a)=M then we are done.  Suppose therefore that f(a)<M(a)<M and let d=M−f(a)=M-f(a).   Consider the set L of points x in [a,b][a,b] such that M[a,x]<M[a,x]<M.
Clearly  a∈L ; moreover if e>a>a is another point in L then all points between a and e also belong to L because M[a,x][a,x] is monotonic increasing.  Hence L is a non-empty interval, closed at its left end by a.
Now f is continuous on the right at a, hence there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(a)|<d/2|f(x)-f(a)|<d/2 for all x in [a,a+δ][a,a+δ]. Thus f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [a,a+δ][a,a+δ] so that all these points belong to L.
Next, L is bounded above by b and has therefore a supremum in [a,b][a,b]:  let us call it s.   We see from the above that s>a>a.  We will show that s is the point we are seeking i.e. the point where f attains its supremum, or in other words f(s)=M(s)=M.
Suppose the contrary viz. f(s)<M(s)<M.  Let d=M−f(s)=M-f(s) and consider the following two cases:

s<b<b.   As f is continuous  at s, there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<d/2|f(x)-f(s)|<d/2 for all x in [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ].    This means that f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [s−δ,s+δ][s-δ,s+δ].   But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point, e say, belonging to L which is greater than s−δ-δ.  By the definition of L, M[a,e]<M[a,e]<M.  Let  d1=M−M[a,e]_1=M-M[a,e] then for all x in [a,e][a,e], f(x)≤M−d1(x)-d_1.  Taking d2_2 to be the minimum of d/2/2 and d1_1, we have f(x)≤M−d2(x)-d_2 for all x in [a,s+δ][a,s+δ].  Hence M[a,s+δ]<M[a,s+δ]<M so that s+δ∈L+δ.  This however contradicts the supremacy of s and completes the proof.
s=b=b.    As f is continuous on the left at s, there exists δ>0δ>0 such that |f(x)−f(s)|<d/2|f(x)-f(s)|<d/2 for all x in [s−δ,s][s-δ,s].    This means that f is less than M−d/2-d/2 on the interval [s−δ,s][s-δ,s].   But it follows from the supremacy of s that there exists a point, e say, belonging to L which is greater than s−δ-δ.  By the definition of L, M[a,e]<M[a,e]<M.  Let  d1=M−M[a,e]_1=M-M[a,e] then for all x in [a,e][a,e], f(x)≤M−d1(x)-d_1.  Taking d2_2 to be the minimum of d/2/2 and d1_1, we have f(x)≤M−d2(x)-d_2 for all x in [a,b][a,b].  This contradicts the supremacy of M and completes the proof.
Extension to semi-continuous functions[edit]
If the continuity of the function f is weakened to semi-continuity, then the corresponding half of the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem hold and the values –∞ or +∞, respectively, from the extended real number line can be allowed as possible values. More precisely:
Theorem: If a function f : [a, b] → [–∞, ∞) is upper semi-continuous, meaning that
limsupy→xf(y)≤f(x)lim sup_yf(y)(x)
for all x in [a,b], then f is bounded above and attains its supremum.
Proof: If f(x) = –∞ for all x in [a,b], then the supremum is also –∞ and the theorem is true. In all other cases, the proof is a slight modification of the proofs given above. In the proof of the boundedness theorem, the  upper semi-continuity of f at x only implies that the limit superior of the subsequence {f(xnk)} is bounded above by f(x) < ∞, but that is enough to obtain the contradiction. In the proof of the extreme value theorem, upper semi-continuity of f at d implies that the limit superior of the subsequence {f(dnk)} is bounded above by f(d), but this suffices to conclude that f(d) = M. ∎
Applying this result to −f proves:
Theorem: If a function f : [a, b] → (–∞, ∞] is lower semi-continuous, meaning that
liminfy→xf(y)≥f(x)lim inf_yf(y)(x)
for all x in [a,b], then f is bounded below and attains its infimum.
A real-valued function is upper as well as lower semi-continuous, if and only if it is continuous in the usual sense. Hence these two theorems imply the boundedness theorem and the extreme value theorem.
