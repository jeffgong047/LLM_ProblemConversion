hyperreals: In the setting of non-standard calculus, let N be an infinite hyperinteger. The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension. Consider its partition into N subintervals of equal infinitesimal length 1/N, with partition points xi = i /N as i "runs" from 0 to N. The function ƒ is also naturally extended to a function ƒ* defined on the hyperreals between 0 and 1. Note that in the standard setting (when N is finite), a point with the maximal value of ƒ can always be chosen among the N+1 points xi, by induction. Hence, by the transfer principle, there is a hyperinteger i0 such that 0 ≤ i0 ≤ N and f∗(xi0)≥f∗(xi)^*(x_i_0)^*(x_i) for all i = 0, ..., N. Consider the real point c=st(xi0)=𝐬𝐭(x_i_0) where st is the standard part function. An arbitrary real point x lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely x∈[xi,xi+1]∈[x_i,x_i+1], so that st(xi) = x. Applying st to the inequality f∗(xi0)≥f∗(xi)^*(x_i_0)^*(x_i), we obtain st(f∗(xi0))≥st(f∗(xi))𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i_0))≥𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i)). By continuity of ƒ we have st(f∗(xi0))=f(st(xi0))=f(c)𝐬𝐭(f^*(x_i_0))=f(𝐬𝐭(x_i_0))=f(c). Hence ƒ(c) ≥ ƒ(x), for all real x, proving c to be a maximum of ƒ.[3] Proof from first
