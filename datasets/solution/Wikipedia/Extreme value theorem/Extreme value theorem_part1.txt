(June 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A continuous function f(x)(x) on the closed interval [a,b][a,b] showing the absolute max (red) and the absolute min (blue). In calculus, the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b][a,b], then f must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers c and d in [a,b][a,b] such that: f(c)≥f(x)≥f(d)∀x∈[a,b](c)(x)(d) ∈[a,b] The extreme value theorem is more specific than the related boundedness theorem, which states merely that a continuous function f on the closed interval [a,b][a,b] is bounded on that interval; that is, there exist real numbers m and M such that: m≤f(x)≤M∀x∈[a,b].(x) ∈[a,b]. This does not say that M and m are necessarily the maximum and minimum values of f on the interval [a,b],[a,b], which is what the extreme value theorem stipulates must also be the case. The extreme value theorem is used to prove Rolle's theorem. In a formulation due to Karl Weierstrass, this theorem states that a continuous function from a non-empty compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum.
