theorem: Statement If f(x)(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] then it is bounded on [a,b][a,b] Suppose the function f is not bounded above on the interval [a,b][a,b]. Then, for every natural number n, there exists an xn∈[a,b]_n∈[a,b] such that f(xn)>n(x_n)>n. This defines a sequence (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ. Because [a,b][a,b] is bounded, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem implies that there exists a convergent subsequence (xnk)k∈N(x_n_k)_k∈ℕ of (xn)(x_n). Denote its limit by x. As [a,b][a,b] is closed, it contains x. Because f is continuous at x, we know that f(xnk)(x_n_k) converges to the real number f(x)(x) (as f is sequentially continuous at x). But f(xnk)>nk≥k(x_n_k)>n_k for every k, which implies that f(xnk)(x_n_k) diverges to +∞+∞, a contradiction. Therefore, f is bounded above on [a,b][a,b]. ◻ Alternative
