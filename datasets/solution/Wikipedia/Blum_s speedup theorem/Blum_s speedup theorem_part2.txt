theorem: Given a Blum complexity measure (φ,Φ)(φ,Φ) and a total computable function f with two parameters, then there exists a total computable predicate g (a boolean valued computable function) so that for every program i for g, there exists a program j for g so that for almost all x f(x,Φj(x))≤Φi(x)(x,Φ_j(x))≤Φ_i(x) f is called the speedup function. The fact that it may be as fast-growing as desired (as long as it is computable) means that the phenomenon of always having a program of smaller complexity remains even if by "smaller" we mean "significantly smaller" (for instance, quadratically smaller, exponentially smaller).
