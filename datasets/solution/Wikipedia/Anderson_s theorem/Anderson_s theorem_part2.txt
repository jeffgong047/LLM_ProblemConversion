theorem: Let K be a convex body in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn that is symmetric with respect to reflection in the origin, i.e. K = −K. Let f : Rn → R be a non-negative, symmetric, globally integrable function; i.e. f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ Rn; f(x) = f(−x) for all x ∈ Rn; ∫Rnf(x)dx<+∞.∫_ℝ^nf(x) dx<+∞. Suppose also that the super-level sets L(f, t) of f, defined by L(f,t)=x∈Rn|f(x)≥t,(f,t)={x∈ℝ^n|f(x)}, are convex subsets of Rn for every t ≥ 0. (This property is sometimes referred to as being unimodal.) Then, for any 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 and y ∈ Rn, ∫Kf(x+cy)dx≥∫Kf(x+y)dx.∫_Kf(x+cy) dx≥∫_Kf(x+y) dx. Application to probability
