theory: Given a probability space (Ω, Σ, Pr), suppose that X : Ω → Rn is an Rn-valued random variable with probability density function f : Rn → [0, +∞) and that Y : Ω → Rn is an independent random variable. The probability density functions of many well-known probability distributions are p-concave for some p, and hence unimodal. If they are also symmetric (e.g. the Laplace and normal distributions), then Anderson's theorem applies, in which case Pr(X∈K)≥Pr(X+Y∈K)(X)≥(X+Y) for any origin-symmetric convex body K ⊆ Rn.
