On when a function on convex body K does not decrease if K is translated inwards This article is about Anderson's theorem in mathematics. For the Anderson orthogonality theorem in physics, see Anderson orthogonality theorem. For the superconductivity theorem, see Anderson's theorem (superconductivity). In mathematics, Anderson's theorem is a result in real analysis and geometry which says that the integral of an integrable, symmetric, unimodal, non-negative function f over an n-dimensional convex body K does not decrease if K is translated inwards towards the origin. This is a natural statement, since the graph of f can be thought of as a hill with a single peak over the origin; however, for n â‰¥ 2, the proof is not entirely obvious, as there may be points x of the body K where the value f(x) is larger than at the corresponding translate of x. Anderson's theorem, named after Theodore Wilbur Anderson, also has an interesting application to probability theory. Statement of the
