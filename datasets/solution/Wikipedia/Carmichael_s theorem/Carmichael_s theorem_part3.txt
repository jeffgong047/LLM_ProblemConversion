cases: The only exceptions in Fibonacci case for n up to 12 are: F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1, which have no prime divisors F(6) = 8, whose only prime divisor is 2 (which is F(3)) F(12) = 144, whose only prime divisors are 2 (which is F(3)) and 3 (which is F(4)) The smallest primitive prime divisor of F(n) are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7, 17, 11, 89, 1, 233, 29, 61, 47, 1597, 19, 37, 41, 421, 199, 28657, 23, 3001, 521, 53, 281, 514229, 31, 557, 2207, 19801, 3571, 141961, 107, 73, 9349, 135721, 2161, 2789, 211, 433494437, 43, 109441, ... (sequence A001578 in the OEIS) Carmichael's theorem says that every Fibonacci number, apart from the exceptions listed above, has at least one primitive prime divisor. If n > 1, then the nth Pell number has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any earlier Pell number. The smallest primitive prime divisor of nth Pell number are 1, 2, 5, 3, 29, 7, 13, 17, 197, 41, 5741, 11, 33461, 239, 269, 577, 137, 199, 37, 19, 45697, 23, 229, 1153, 1549, 79, 53, 113, 44560482149, 31, 61, 665857, 52734529, 103, 1800193921, 73, 593, 9369319, 389, 241, ...
