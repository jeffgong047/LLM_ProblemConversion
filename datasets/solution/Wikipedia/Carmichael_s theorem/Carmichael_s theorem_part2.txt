Statement: Given two relatively prime integers P and Q, such that D=P2−4Q>0=P^2-4Q>0 and PQ ≠ 0, let Un(P, Q) be the Lucas sequence of the first kind defined by U0(P,Q)=0,U1(P,Q)=1,Un(P,Q)=P⋅Un−1(P,Q)−Q⋅Un−2(P,Q)forn>1.U_0(P,Q) =0, U_1(P,Q) =1, U_n(P,Q) =P_n-1(P,Q)-Q_n-2(P,Q) n>1. Then, for n ≠ 1, 2, 6, Un(P, Q) has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any Um(P, Q) with m < n, except U12(1, −1) = F(12) = 144, U12(−1, −1) = −F(12) = −144. Such a prime p is called a characteristic factor or a primitive prime divisor of Un(P, Q). Indeed, Carmichael showed a slightly stronger theorem: For n ≠ 1, 2, 6, Un(P, Q) has at least one primitive prime divisor not dividing D[2] except U3(1, −2) = U3(−1, −2) = 3, U5(1, −1) = U5(−1, −1) = F(5) = 5, U12(1, −1) = F(12) = 144, U12(−1, −1) = −F(12) = −144. Note that D should be greater than 0; thus the cases U13(1, 2), U18(1, 2) and U30(1, 2), etc. are not included, since in this case D = −7 < 0. Fibonacci and Pell
