theorem: Let X and Y be Riemann surfaces, and let f:X→Y:X be a non-constant holomorphic map. Fix a point a∈X and set b:=f(a)∈Y:=f(a). Then there exist k∈N∈ℕ and charts ψ1:U1→V1ψ_1:U_1_1 on X and ψ2:U2→V2ψ_2:U_2_2 on Y such that ψ1(a)=ψ2(b)=0ψ_1(a)=ψ_2(b)=0; and ψ2∘f∘ψ1−1:V1→V2ψ_2∘ψ_1^-1:V_1_2 is z↦zk.^k. This theorem gives rise to several definitions: We call k the multiplicity of f at a. Some authors denote this ν(f,a)ν(f,a). If k>1>1, the point a is called a branch point of f. If f has no branch points, it is called unbranched. See also unramified morphism.
