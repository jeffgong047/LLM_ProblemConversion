theory: Classical results of Bernhard Riemann describe Θ in another way, in the case that A is the Jacobian variety J of an algebraic curve (compact Riemann surface) C. There is, for a choice of base point P on C, a standard mapping of C to J, by means of the interpretation of J as the linear equivalence classes of divisors on C of degree 0. That is, Q on C maps to the class of Q − P. Then since J is an algebraic group, C may be added to itself k times on J, giving rise to subvarieties Wk. If g is the genus of C, Riemann proved that Θ is a translate on J of Wg − 1. He also described which points on Wg − 1 are non-singular: they correspond to the effective divisors D of degree g − 1 with no associated meromorphic functions other than constants. In more classical language, these D do not move in a linear system of divisors on C, in the sense that they do not dominate the polar divisor of a non constant function. Riemann further proved the Riemann singularity theorem, identifying the multiplicity of a point p = class(D) on Wg − 1 as the number of linearly independent meromorphic functions with pole divisor dominated by D, or equivalently as h0(O(D)), the number of linearly independent global sections of the holomorphic line bundle associated to D as Cartier divisor on C.
