PA: A structure M in the language of PA is recursive if there are recursive functions ⊕⊕ and ⊗⊗ from N×Nℕ×ℕ to Nℕ, a recursive two-place relation <M on Nℕ, and distinguished constants n0,n1_0,n_1 such that (N,⊕,⊗,<M,n0,n1)≅M,(ℕ,⊕,⊗,<_M,n_0,n_1), where ≅≅ indicates isomorphism and Nℕ is the set of (standard) natural numbers. Because the isomorphism must be a bijection, every recursive model is countable. There are many nonisomorphic countable nonstandard models of PA. Statement of the
