Not to be confused with Tennenbaum's construction of a computable copy of ω+ω∗ω+ω^* having no computable infinite ascending or descending chains. Tennenbaum's theorem, named for Stanley Tennenbaum who presented the theorem in 1959, is a result in mathematical logic that states that no countable nonstandard model of first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can be recursive (Kaye 1991:153ff).
