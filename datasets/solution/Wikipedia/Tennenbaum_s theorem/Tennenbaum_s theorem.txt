Not to be confused with Tennenbaum's construction of a computable copy of ω+ω∗ω+ω^* having no computable infinite ascending or descending chains.
Tennenbaum's theorem, named for Stanley Tennenbaum who presented the theorem in 1959, is a result in mathematical logic that states that no countable nonstandard model of first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can be recursive (Kaye 1991:153ff). 


Recursive structures for PA[edit]
A structure M in the language of PA is recursive if there are recursive functions ⊕⊕ and ⊗⊗ from N×Nℕ×ℕ to Nℕ, a recursive two-place relation <M on Nℕ, and distinguished constants n0,n1_0,n_1 such that

(N,⊕,⊗,<M,n0,n1)≅M,(ℕ,⊕,⊗,<_M,n_0,n_1),
where ≅≅ indicates isomorphism and Nℕ is the set of (standard) natural numbers. Because the isomorphism must be a bijection, every recursive model is countable. There are many nonisomorphic countable nonstandard models of PA.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Tennenbaum's theorem states that no countable nonstandard model of PA is recursive. Moreover, neither the addition nor the multiplication of such a model can be recursive.

Proof sketch[edit]
This sketch follows the argument presented by Kaye (1991).   The first step in the proof is to show that, if M is any countable nonstandard model of PA, then the standard system of M (defined below) contains at least one nonrecursive set S.  The second step is to show that, if either the addition or multiplication operation on M were recursive, then this set S would be recursive, which is a contradiction. 
Through the methods used to code ordered tuples, each element x∈M can be viewed as a code for a set Sx_x of elements of M. In particular, if we let pi_i be the ith prime in M, then z∈Sx↔M⊨pz|x_x_z|x.   Each set Sx_x will be bounded in M, but if x is nonstandard then the set Sx_x may contain infinitely many standard natural numbers. The standard system of the model is the collection Sx∩N:x∈M{S_x∩ℕ:x}.   It can be shown that the standard system of any nonstandard model of PA contains a nonrecursive set, either by appealing to the incompleteness theorem or by directly considering a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets (Kaye 1991:154).    These are disjoint r.e. sets A,B⊆N,B⊆ℕ so that there is no recursive set C⊆N⊆ℕ with A⊆C and B∩C=∅=∅. 
For the latter construction, begin with a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets A and B.  For natural number x there is a y such that, for all i < x, if i∈A then pi|y_i|y and if i∈B then pi∤y_i. By the overspill property, this means that there is some nonstandard x in M for which there is a (necessarily nonstandard) y in M so that, for every m∈M with m<Mx<_Mx, we have

M⊨(m∈A→pm|y)∧(m∈B→pm∤y)(m⊤_m|y)(m⊤_m)
Let S=N∩Sy=ℕ_y be the corresponding set in the standard system of M. Because A and B are r.e., one can show that A⊆S and B∩S=∅=∅. Hence S is a separating set for A and B, and by the choice of A and B this means S is nonrecursive. 
Now, to prove Tennenbaum's theorem, begin with a nonstandard countable model M and an element a in M so that S=N∩Sa=ℕ_a is nonrecursive. The proof method shows that, because of the way the standard system is defined, it is possible to compute the characteristic function of the set S using the addition function ⊕⊕ of M as an oracle.  In particular, if n0_0 is the element of M corresponding to 0, and n1_1 is the element of M corresponding to 1, then for each i∈N∈ℕ we can compute ni=n1⊕⋯⊕n1_i=n_1⊕⋯_1 (i times).  To decide if a number n is in S, first compute p, the nth prime in Nℕ. Then, search for an element y of M so that 

a=y⊕y⊕⋯⊕y⏟ptimes⊕ni=y⊕⋯_ptimes_i
for some i<p<p. This search will halt because the Euclidean algorithm can be applied to any model of PA.  Finally, we have n∈S if and only if the i found in the search was 0. Because S is not recursive, this means that the addition operation on M is nonrecursive. 
A similar argument shows that it is possible to compute the characteristic function of S using the multiplication of M as an oracle, so the multiplication operation on M is also nonrecursive (Kaye 1991:154).
