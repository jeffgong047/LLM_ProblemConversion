sketch: This sketch follows the argument presented by Kaye (1991). The first step in the proof is to show that, if M is any countable nonstandard model of PA, then the standard system of M (defined below) contains at least one nonrecursive set S. The second step is to show that, if either the addition or multiplication operation on M were recursive, then this set S would be recursive, which is a contradiction. Through the methods used to code ordered tuples, each element x∈M can be viewed as a code for a set Sx_x of elements of M. In particular, if we let pi_i be the ith prime in M, then z∈Sx↔M⊨pz|x_x_z|x. Each set Sx_x will be bounded in M, but if x is nonstandard then the set Sx_x may contain infinitely many standard natural numbers. The standard system of the model is the collection Sx∩N:x∈M{S_x∩ℕ:x}. It can be shown that the standard system of any nonstandard model of PA contains a nonrecursive set, either by appealing to the incompleteness theorem or by directly considering a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets (Kaye 1991:154). These are disjoint r.e. sets A,B⊆N,B⊆ℕ so that there is no recursive set C⊆N⊆ℕ with A⊆C and B∩C=∅=∅. For the latter construction, begin with a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets A and B. For natural number x there is a y such that, for all i < x, if i∈A then pi|y_i|y and if i∈B then pi∤y_i. By the overspill property, this means that there is some nonstandard x in M for which there is a (necessarily nonstandard) y in M so that, for every m∈M with m<Mx<_Mx, we have M⊨(m∈A→pm|y)∧(m∈B→pm∤y)(m⊤_m|y)(m⊤_m) Let S=N∩Sy=ℕ_y be the corresponding set in the standard system of M. Because A and B are r.e., one can show that A⊆S and B∩S=∅=∅. Hence S is a separating set for A and B, and by the choice of A and B this means S is nonrecursive. Now, to prove Tennenbaum's theorem, begin with a nonstandard countable model M and an element a in M so that S=N∩Sa=ℕ_a is nonrecursive. The proof method shows that, because of the way the standard system is defined, it is possible to compute the characteristic function of the set S using the addition function ⊕⊕ of M as an oracle. In particular, if n0_0 is the element of M corresponding to 0, and n1_1 is the element of M corresponding to 1, then for each i∈N∈ℕ we can compute ni=n1⊕⋯⊕n1_i=n_1⊕⋯_1 (i times). To decide if a number n is in S, first compute p, the nth prime in Nℕ. Then, search for an element y of M so that a=y⊕y⊕⋯⊕y⏟ptimes⊕ni=y⊕⋯_ptimes_i for some i<p<p. This search will halt because the Euclidean algorithm can be applied to any model of PA. Finally, we have n∈S if and only if the i found in the search was 0. Because S is not recursive, this means that the addition operation on M is nonrecursive. A similar argument shows that it is possible to compute the characteristic function of S using the multiplication of M as an oracle, so the multiplication operation on M is also nonrecursive (Kaye 1991:154).
