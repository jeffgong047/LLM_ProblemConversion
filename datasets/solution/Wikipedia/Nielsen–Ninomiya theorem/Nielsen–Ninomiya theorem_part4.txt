schemes: The Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem can be generalized to all possible regularization schemes, not just lattice regularization.[4] This general no-go theorem states that no regularized chiral fermion theory can satisfy all the following conditions Invariance under at least the global part of the gauge group. Different number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl species for a given combination of generators. The correct chiral anomaly. An action bilinear in Weyl fields. A short proof by contradiction points out that the Noether current acquired from some of assumptions is conserved, while other assumptions imply that it is not. Every regularization scheme must violate one or more of the conditions. For lattice regularization the Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem leads to the same result under even weaker assumptions where the requirement for the correct chiral anomaly is replaced by an assumption of locality of interactions. Dimensional regularization depends on the particular implementation of chirality. If the γ5γ_5 matrix is defined as γ[1γ2⋯γ4+ϵ]γ_[1γ_2⋯γ_4+ϵ] for infinitesimal ϵϵ then this leads to a vanishing chiral anomaly, while using γ[1γ2γ3γ4]γ_[1γ_2γ_3γ_4] breaks global invariance. Meanwhile, Pauli–Villars regularization breaks global invariance since it introduces a regulator mass. See
