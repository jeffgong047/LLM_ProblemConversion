summary: The simplified Euclidean version of the theorem has a much shorter proof, relying on a key theorem from differential topology known as the Poincaré–Hopf theorem.[9] It can be summarized as follows. From the locality assumption, the Fourier transform of the inverse propagator Fμ(k)_μ(k) must be a continuous vector field on the Brillouin zone whose isolated zeros correspond to different species of particles of the theory. Around each zero the vector field behavior is either a saddle singularity or a sink/source singularity. This is captured by the index of the vector field at the zero which takes the values ±1±1 for the two cases. It can be shown that the two cases determine whether the particle is left-handed or right-handed. The Poincaré–Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices of a vector field on a manifold is equal the Euler characteristic of that manifold. In this case, the vector field lives on the Brillouin zone which is topologically a 4-torus which has Euler characteristic zero. Therefore, there must be an equal number of left-handed and right-handed particles. General regularization
