Three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem Tetrahedron with a right-angle corner in O In mathematics, De Gua's theorem is a three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem named after Jean Paul de Gua de Malves. It states that if a tetrahedron has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces: AABC2=AABO2+AACO2+ABCO2_ABC^2=A_ABO^2+A_ACO^2+A_BCO^2De Gua's theorem can be applied for proving a special case of Heron's formula.[1]
