Generalizations: The Pythagorean theorem and de Gua's theorem are special cases (n = 2, 3) of a general theorem about n-simplices with a right-angle corner, proved by P. S. Donchian and H. S. M. Coxeter in 1935.[2] This, in turn, is a special case of a yet more general theorem by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer (1974),[3] which can be stated as follows. Let U be a measurable subset of a k-dimensional affine subspace of Rnℝ^n (so k≤n). For any subset I⊆1,…,n⊆{1,…,n} with exactly k elements, let UI_I be the orthogonal projection of U onto the linear span of ei1,…,eik_i_1,…,e_i_k, where I=i1,…,ik={i_1,…,i_k} and e1,…,en_1,…,e_n is the standard basis for Rnℝ^n. Then volk2⁡(U)=∑Ivolk2⁡(UI),vol_k^2(U)=∑_Ivol_k^2(U_I), where volk⁡(U)vol_k(U) is the k-dimensional volume of U and the sum is over all subsets I⊆1,…,n⊆{1,…,n} with exactly k elements. De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to n-simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where k = n−1 and U is an (n−1)-simplex in Rnℝ^n with vertices on the co-ordinate axes. For example, suppose n = 3, k = 2 and U is the triangle △ABC in R3ℝ^3 with vertices A, B and C lying on the x1_1-, x2_2- and x3_3-axes, respectively. The subsets I of 1,2,3{1,2,3} with exactly 2 elements are 2,3{2,3}, 1,3{1,3} and 1,2{1,2}. By definition, U2,3_{2,3} is the orthogonal projection of U=△ABC= onto the x2x3_2x_3-plane, so U2,3_{2,3} is the triangle △OBC with vertices O, B and C, where O is the origin of R3ℝ^3. Similarly, U1,3=△AOC_{1,3}= and U1,2=△ABO_{1,2}=, so the Conant–Beyer theorem says vol22⁡(△ABC)=vol22⁡(△OBC)+vol22⁡(△AOC)+vol22⁡(△ABO),vol_2^2()=vol_2^2()+vol_2^2()+vol_2^2(), which is de Gua's theorem. The generalisation of de Gua's theorem to n-simplices with right-angle corners can also be obtained as a special case from the Cayley–Menger determinant formula. De Gua's theorem can also be generalized to arbitrary tetrahedra and to pyramids.[4][5]
