Three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem
Tetrahedron with a right-angle corner in O
In mathematics, De Gua's theorem is a three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem named after Jean Paul de Gua de Malves. It states that if a tetrahedron has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces:
AABC2=AABO2+AACO2+ABCO2_ABC^2=A_ABO^2+A_ACO^2+A_BCO^2De Gua's theorem can be applied for proving a special case of Heron's formula.[1]

Generalizations[edit]
The Pythagorean theorem and de Gua's theorem are special cases (n = 2, 3) of a general theorem about n-simplices with a right-angle corner, proved by P. S. Donchian and H. S. M. Coxeter in 1935.[2] This, in turn, is a special case of a yet more general theorem by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer (1974),[3] which can be stated as follows.
Let U be a measurable subset of a k-dimensional affine subspace of Rnℝ^n (so k≤n).  For any subset I⊆1,…,n⊆{1,…,n} with exactly k elements, let UI_I be the orthogonal projection of U onto the linear span of ei1,…,eik_i_1,…,e_i_k, where I=i1,…,ik={i_1,…,i_k} and e1,…,en_1,…,e_n is the standard basis for Rnℝ^n.  Then
volk2⁡(U)=∑Ivolk2⁡(UI),vol_k^2(U)=∑_Ivol_k^2(U_I),
where volk⁡(U)vol_k(U) is the k-dimensional volume of U and the sum is over all subsets I⊆1,…,n⊆{1,…,n} with exactly k elements.
De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to n-simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where k = n−1 and U is an (n−1)-simplex in Rnℝ^n with vertices on the co-ordinate axes.  For example, suppose n = 3, k = 2 and U is the triangle △ABC in R3ℝ^3 with vertices A, B and C lying on the x1_1-, x2_2- and x3_3-axes, respectively.  The subsets I of 1,2,3{1,2,3} with exactly 2 elements are 2,3{2,3}, 1,3{1,3} and 1,2{1,2}.  By definition, U2,3_{2,3} is the orthogonal projection of U=△ABC= onto the x2x3_2x_3-plane, so U2,3_{2,3} is the triangle △OBC with vertices O, B and C, where O is the origin of R3ℝ^3.  Similarly, U1,3=△AOC_{1,3}= and U1,2=△ABO_{1,2}=, so the Conant–Beyer theorem says
vol22⁡(△ABC)=vol22⁡(△OBC)+vol22⁡(△AOC)+vol22⁡(△ABO),vol_2^2()=vol_2^2()+vol_2^2()+vol_2^2(),
which is de Gua's theorem.
The generalisation of de Gua's theorem to n-simplices with right-angle corners can also be obtained as a special case from the Cayley–Menger determinant formula.
De Gua's theorem can also be generalized to arbitrary tetrahedra and to pyramids.[4][5]

History[edit]
Jean Paul de Gua de Malves (1713–85) published the theorem in 1783, but around the same time a slightly more general version was published by another French mathematician, Charles de Tinseau d'Amondans (1746–1818), as well. However the theorem had also  been known much earlier to Johann Faulhaber (1580–1635) and René Descartes (1596–1650).[6][7]
