theorem: Let (X,d)(X,d) be a complete metric space. Let T:X→X:X and f:X→[0,+∞):X→[0,+∞) be a lower semicontinuous function from X into the non-negative real numbers. Suppose that, for all points x in X,, d(x,T(x))≤f(x)−f(T(x)).(x,T(x))(x)-f(T(x)). Then T has a fixed point in X;; that is, a point x0_0 such that T(x0)=x0.(x_0)=x_0. The proof of this result utilizes Zorn's lemma to guarantee the existence of a minimal element which turns out to be a desired fixed point.[6]
