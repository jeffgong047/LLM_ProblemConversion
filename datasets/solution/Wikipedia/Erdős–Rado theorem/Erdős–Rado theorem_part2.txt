theorem: If r ≥ 0 is finite and κ is an infinite cardinal, then expr⁡(κ)+⟶(κ+)κr+1exp_r(κ)^+⟶(κ^+)_κ^r+1 where exp0(κ) = κ and inductively expr+1(κ)=2expr(κ). This is sharp in the sense that expr(κ)+ cannot be replaced by expr(κ) on the left hand side. The above partition symbol describes the following statement. If f is a coloring of the r+1-element subsets of a set of cardinality expr(κ)+, in κ many colors, then there is a homogeneous set of cardinality κ+ (a set, all whose r+1-element subsets get the same f-value).
