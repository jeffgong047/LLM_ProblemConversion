Theorem in combinatorial set theory extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets In partition calculus, part of combinatorial set theory, a branch of mathematics, the Erdős–Rado theorem is a basic result extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets. It is named after Paul Erdős and Richard Rado.[1] It is sometimes also attributed to Đuro Kurepa who proved it under the additional assumption of the generalised continuum hypothesis,[2][better source needed] and hence the result is sometimes also referred to as the Erdős–Rado–Kurepa theorem.
