Theorem in combinatorial set theory extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets
In partition calculus, part of combinatorial set theory, a branch of mathematics, the Erdős–Rado theorem  is a basic result extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets. It is named after Paul Erdős and Richard Rado.[1] It is sometimes also attributed to Đuro Kurepa who proved it under the additional assumption of the generalised continuum hypothesis,[2][better source needed] and hence the result is sometimes also referred to as the Erdős–Rado–Kurepa theorem.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
If r ≥ 0  is finite and κ is an infinite cardinal, then

expr⁡(κ)+⟶(κ+)κr+1exp_r(κ)^+⟶(κ^+)_κ^r+1
where exp0(κ) = κ and inductively expr+1(κ)=2expr(κ). This is sharp in the sense that expr(κ)+ cannot be replaced by expr(κ) on the left hand side.
The above partition symbol describes the following statement. If f is a coloring of the r+1-element subsets of a set of cardinality expr(κ)+,  in κ many colors, then there is a homogeneous set of cardinality κ+ (a set, all whose r+1-element subsets get the same f-value).
