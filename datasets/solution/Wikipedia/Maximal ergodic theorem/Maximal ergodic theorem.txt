The maximal ergodic theorem is a theorem in ergodic theory, a discipline within mathematics.
Suppose that (X,B,μ)(X,ℬ,μ) is a probability space, that T:X→X:X is a (possibly noninvertible) measure-preserving transformation, and that f∈L1(μ,R)^1(μ,ℝ). Define f∗^* by

f∗=supN≥11N∑i=0N−1f∘Ti.^*=sup_N≥11/N∑_i=0^N-1f^i.
Then the maximal ergodic theorem states that

∫f∗>λfdμ≥λ⋅μf∗>λ∫_f^*>λf dμ≥λ·μ{f^*>λ}
for any λ ∈ R.
This theorem is used to prove the point-wise ergodic theorem.
