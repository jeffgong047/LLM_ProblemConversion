detection: In collision detection, the hyperplane separation theorem is usually used in the following form: Separating axis theorem â€” Two closed convex objects are disjoint if there exists a line ("separating axis") onto which the two objects' projections are disjoint. Regardless of dimensionality, the separating axis is always a line. For example, in 3D, the space is separated by planes, but the separating axis is perpendicular to the separating plane. The separating axis theorem can be applied for fast collision detection between polygon meshes. Each face's normal or other feature direction is used as a separating axis. Note that this yields possible separating axes, not separating lines/planes. In 3D, using face normals alone will fail to separate some edge-on-edge non-colliding cases. Additional axes, consisting of the cross-products of pairs of edges, one taken from each object, are required.[7] For increased efficiency, parallel axes may be calculated as a single axis. See
