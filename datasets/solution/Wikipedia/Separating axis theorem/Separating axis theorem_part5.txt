uniqueness: The theorem does not apply if one of the bodies is not convex. If one of A or B is not convex, then there are many possible counterexamples. For example, A and B could be concentric circles. A more subtle counterexample is one in which A and B are both closed but neither one is compact. For example, if A is a closed half plane and B is bounded by one arm of a hyperbola, then there is no strictly separating hyperplane: A=(x,y):x≤0={(x,y):x≤0} B=(x,y):x>0,y≥1/x.={(x,y):x>0,y≥1/x}.} (Although, by an instance of the second theorem, there is a hyperplane that separates their interiors.) Another type of counterexample has A compact and B open. For example, A can be a closed square and B can be an open square that touches A. In the first version of the theorem, evidently the separating hyperplane is never unique. In the second version, it may or may not be unique. Technically a separating axis is never unique because it can be translated; in the second version of the theorem, a separating axis can be unique up to translation. The horn angle provides a good counterexample to many hyperplane separations. For example, in R2ℝ^2, the unit disk is disjoint from the open interval ((1,0),(1,1))((1,0),(1,1)), but the only line separating them contains the entirety of ((1,0),(1,1))((1,0),(1,1)). This shows that if A is closed and B is relatively open, then there does not necessarily exist a separation that is strict for B. However, if A is closed polytope then such a separation exists.[6] More
