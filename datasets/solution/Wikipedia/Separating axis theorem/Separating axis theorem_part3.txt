intersections: If the sets A,B,B have possible intersections, but their relative interiors are disjoint, then the proof of the first case still applies with no change, thus yielding: Separation theorem II — Let A and B be two nonempty convex subsets of Rnℝ^n with disjoint relative interiors. Then there exist a nonzero vector v and a real number c such that ⟨x,v⟩≥cand⟨y,v⟩≤c,v⟩ and,v⟩ in particular, we have the supporting hyperplane theorem. Supporting hyperplane theorem — if A is a convex set in Rn,ℝ^n, and a0_0 is a point on the boundary of A, then there exists a supporting hyperplane of A containing a0_0. Proof If the affine span of A is not all of Rnℝ^n, then extend the affine span to a supporting hyperplane. Else, relint(A)=int(A)relint(A)=int(A) is disjoint from relint(a0)=a0relint({a_0})={a_0}, so apply the above theorem. Converse of
