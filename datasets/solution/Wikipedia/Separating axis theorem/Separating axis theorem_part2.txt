proof: Hyperplane separation theorem[4] — Let A and B be two disjoint nonempty convex subsets of Rnℝ^n. Then there exist a nonzero vector v and a real number c such that ⟨x,v⟩≥cand⟨y,v⟩≤c,v⟩ and,v⟩ for all x in A and y in B; i.e., the hyperplane ⟨⋅,v⟩=c⟨·,v⟩=c, v the normal vector, separates A and B. If both sets are closed, and at least one of them is compact, then the separation can be strict, that is, ⟨x,v⟩>c1and⟨y,v⟩<c2,v⟩>c_1 and,v⟩<c_2 for some c1>c2_1>c_2 In all cases, assume A,B,B to be disjoint, nonempty, and convex subsets of Rnℝ^n. The summary of the results are as follows: summary table A B ⟨x,v⟩,v⟩ ⟨y,v⟩,v⟩ ≥c ≤c closed compact closed >c1>c_1 <c2<c_2 with c2<c1_2<c_1 closed closed compact >c1>c_1 <c2<c_2 with c2<c1_2<c_1 open >c>c ≤c open open >c>c <c<c The number of dimensions must be finite. In infinite-dimensional spaces there are examples of two closed, convex, disjoint sets which cannot be separated by a closed hyperplane (a hyperplane where a continuous linear functional equals some constant) even in the weak sense where the inequalities are not strict.[5] Here, the compactness in the hypothesis cannot be relaxed; see an example in the section Counterexamples and uniqueness. This version of the separation theorem does generalize to infinite-dimension; the generalization is more commonly known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem. The proof is based on the following lemma: Lemma — Let A and B be two disjoint closed subsets of Rnℝ^n, and assume A is compact. Then there exist points a0∈A_0 and b0∈B_0 minimizing the distance ‖a−b‖a-b over a∈A and b∈B. Proof of lemma Let a∈A and b∈B be any pair of points, and let r1=‖b−a‖_1=b-a. Since A is compact, it is contained in some ball centered on a; let the radius of this ball be r2_2. Let S=B∩Br1+r2(a)¯=B∩B_r_1+r_2(a) be the intersection of B with a closed ball of radius r1+r2_1+r_2 around a. Then S is compact and nonempty because it contains b. Since the distance function is continuous, there exist points a0_0 and b0_0 whose distance ‖a0−b0‖a_0-b_0 is the minimum over all pairs of points in A×S. It remains to show that a0_0 and b0_0 in fact have the minimum distance over all pairs of points in A×B. Suppose for contradiction that there exist points a′' and b′' such that ‖a′−b′‖<‖a0−b0‖a'-b'<a_0-b_0. Then in particular, ‖a′−b′‖<r1a'-b'<r_1, and by the triangle inequality, ‖a−b′‖≤‖a′−b′‖+‖a−a′‖<r1+r2a-b'≤a'-b'+a-a'<r_1+r_2. Therefore b′' is contained in S, which contradicts the fact that a0_0 and b0_0 had minimum distance over A×S. ◻□ Proof illustration. Proof of theorem We first prove the second case. (See the diagram.) WLOG, A is compact. By the lemma, there exist points a0∈A_0 and b0∈B_0 of minimum distance to each other. Since A and B are disjoint, we have a0≠b0_0_0. Now, construct two hyperplanes LA,LB_A,L_B perpendicular to line segment [a0,b0][a_0,b_0], with LA_A across a0_0 and LB_B across b0_0. We claim that neither A nor B enters the space between LA,LB_A,L_B, and thus the perpendicular hyperplanes to (a0,b0)(a_0,b_0) satisfy the requirement of the theorem. Algebraically, the hyperplanes LA,LB_A,L_B are defined by the vector v:=b0−a0:=b_0-a_0, and two constants cA:=⟨v,a0⟩<cB:=⟨v,b0⟩_A:=,a_0⟩<c_B:=,b_0⟩, such that LA=x:⟨v,x⟩=cA,LB=x:⟨v,x⟩=cB_A={x:,x⟩=c_A},L_B={x:,x⟩=c_B}. Our claim is that ∀a∈A,⟨v,a⟩≤cA,,a⟩_A and ∀b∈B,⟨v,b⟩≥cB,,b⟩_B. Suppose there is some a∈A such that ⟨v,a⟩>cA,a⟩>c_A, then let a′' be the foot of perpendicular from b0_0 to the line segment [a0,a][a_0,a]. Since A is convex, a′' is inside A, and by planar geometry, a′' is closer to b0_0 than a0_0, contradiction. Similar argument applies to B. Now for the first case. Approach both A,B,B from the inside by A1⊆A2⊆⋯⊆A_1_2⊆⋯ and B1⊆B2⊆⋯⊆B_1_2⊆⋯, such that each Ak,Bk_k,B_k is closed and compact, and the unions are the relative interiors relint(A),relint(B)relint(A),relint(B). (See relative interior page for details.) Now by the second case, for each pair Ak,Bk_k,B_k there exists some unit vector vk_k and real number ck_k, such that ⟨vk,Ak⟩<ck<⟨vk,Bk⟩_k,A_k⟩<c_k<_k,B_k⟩. Since the unit sphere is compact, we can take a convergent subsequence, so that vk→v_k. Let cA:=supa∈A⟨v,a⟩,cB:=infb∈B⟨v,b⟩_A:=sup_a,a⟩,c_B:=inf_b,b⟩. We claim that cA≤cB_A_B, thus separating A,B,B. Assume not, then there exists some a∈A,b∈B,b such that ⟨v,a⟩>⟨v,b⟩,a⟩>,b⟩, then since vk→v_k, for large enough k, we have ⟨vk,a⟩>⟨vk,b⟩_k,a⟩>_k,b⟩, contradiction. Since a separating hyperplane cannot intersect the interiors of open convex sets, we have a corollary: Separation theorem I — Let A and B be two disjoint nonempty convex sets. If A is open, then there exist a nonzero vector v and real number c such that ⟨x,v⟩>cand⟨y,v⟩≤c,v⟩>c and,v⟩ for all x in A and y in B. If both sets are open, then there exist a nonzero vector v and real number c such that ⟨x,v⟩>cand⟨y,v⟩<c,v⟩>c and,v⟩<c for all x in A and y in B. Case with possible
