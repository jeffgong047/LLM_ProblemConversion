theorem: Let (V, q) be a quadratic space over a field k. Then it admits a Witt decomposition: (V,q)≃(V0,0)⊕(Va,qa)⊕(Vh,qh),(V,q)≃(V_0,0)⊕(V_a,q_a)⊕(V_h,q_h), where V0 = ker q is the radical of q, (Va, qa) is an anisotropic quadratic space and (Vh, qh) is a split quadratic space. Moreover, the anisotropic summand, termed the core form, and the hyperbolic summand in a Witt decomposition of (V, q) are determined uniquely up to isomorphism.[4] Quadratic forms with the same core form are said to be similar or Witt equivalent.
