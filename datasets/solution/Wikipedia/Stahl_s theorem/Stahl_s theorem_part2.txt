theorem: Let trtr denote the trace of a matrix. If A and B are n×n Hermitian matrices and B is positive semidefinite, define f(t)=tr⁡(exp⁡(A−tB))𝐟(t)=tr(exp(A-tB)), for all real t≥0≥0. Then f𝐟 can be represented as the Laplace transform of a non-negative Borel measure μμ on [0,∞)[0,∞). In other words, for all real t≥0≥0, f𝐟(t) = ∫[0,∞)e−tsdμ(s)∫_[0,∞)e^-ts dμ(s), for some non-negative measure μμ depending upon A and B.[5]
