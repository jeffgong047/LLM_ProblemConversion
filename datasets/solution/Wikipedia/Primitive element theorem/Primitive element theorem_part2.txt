Terminology: Let E/F/F be a field extension. An element α∈Eα is a primitive element for E/F/F if E=F(α),=F(α), i.e. if every element of E can be written as a rational function in αα with coefficients in F. If there exists such a primitive element, then E/F/F is referred to as a simple extension. If the field extension E/F/F has primitive element αα and is of finite degree n=[E:F]=[E:F], then every element x of E can be written uniquely in the form x=fn−1αn−1+⋯+f1α+f0,=f_n-1α^n-1+⋯+f_1α+f_0, where fi∈F_i for all i. That is, the set 1,α,…,αn−1{1,α,…,α^n-1} is a basis for E as a vector space over F.
