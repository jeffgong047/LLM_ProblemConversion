results: Generally, the set of all primitive elements for a finite separable extension E / F is the complement of a finite collection of proper F-subspaces of E, namely the intermediate fields. This statement says nothing in the case of finite fields, for which there is a computational theory dedicated to finding a generator of the multiplicative group of the field (a cyclic group), which is a fortiori a primitive element (see primitive element (finite field)). Where F is infinite, a pigeonhole principle proof technique considers the linear subspace generated by two elements and proves that there are only finitely many linear combinations γ=α+cβγ=α+cβ} with c in F, that fail to generate the subfield containing both elements: as F(α,β)/F(α+cβ)(α,β)/F(α+cβ) is a separable extension, if F(α+cβ)⊊F(α,β)(α+cβ)(α,β) there exists a non-trivial embedding σ:F(α,β)→F¯σ:F(α,β)→F whose restriction to F(α+cβ)(α+cβ) is the identity which means σ(α)+cσ(β)=α+cβσ(α)+cσ(β)=α+cβ and σ(β)≠βσ(β)≠β so that c=σ(α)−αβ−σ(β)=σ(α)-α/β-σ(β). This expression for c can take only [F(α):F][F(β):F][F(α):F][F(β):F] different values. For all other value of c∈F then F(α,β)=F(α+cβ)(α,β)=F(α+cβ). This is almost immediate as a way of showing how Steinitz' result implies the classical result, and a bound for the number of exceptional c in terms of the number of intermediate fields results (this number being something that can be bounded itself by Galois theory and a priori). Therefore, in this case trial-and-error is a possible practical method to find primitive elements.
