theorems: The classical primitive element theorem states: Every separable field extension of finite degree is simple. This theorem applies to algebraic number fields, i.e. finite extensions of the rational numbers Q, since Q has characteristic 0 and therefore every finite extension over Q is separable. The following primitive element theorem (Ernst Steinitz[1]) is more general: A finite field extension E/F/F is simple if and only if there exist only finitely many intermediate fields K with E⊇K⊇F. Using the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the former theorem immediately follows from the latter. Characteristic
