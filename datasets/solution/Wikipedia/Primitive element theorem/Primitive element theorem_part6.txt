Proof: Starting with a simple finite extension E = F(α), let f be the minimal polynomial of α over F. If K is an intermediate subfield, then let g be the minimal polynomial of α over K, and let L be the field generated over F by the coefficients of g. Then since L ⊆ K, the minimal polynomial of α over L must be a multiple of g, so it is g; this implies that the degree of E over L is the same as that over K, but since L ⊆ K, this means that L = K. Since g is a factor of f, this means that there can be no more intermediate fields than factors of f, so there are only finitely many. Going in the other direction, if F is finite, then any finite extension E of F is automatically simple, so assume that F is infinite. Then E is generated over F by a finite number of elements, so it's enough to prove that F(α, β) is simple for any two elements α and β in E. But, considering all fields F(α + x β), where x is an element of F, there are only finitely many, so there must be distinct x0 and x1 in F for which F(α + x0 β) = F(α + x1 β). Then simple algebra shows that F(α + x0 β) = F(α, β). For an alternative proof, observe that each of the finite number of intermediate fields is a proper linear subspace of E over F, and that a finite union of proper linear subspaces of a vector space over an infinite field cannot equal the entire space. Then, taking any element in E that is not in any intermediate field, it must generate the whole of E over F.[2][3] Constructive
