p: For a non-separable extension E/F/F of characteristic p, there is nevertheless a primitive element provided the degree [E : F] is p: indeed, there can be no non-trivial intermediate subfields since their degrees would be factors of the prime p. When [E : F] = p2, there may not be a primitive element (in which case there are infinitely many intermediate fields). The simplest example is E=Fp(T,U)=𝔽_p(T,U), the field of rational functions in two indeterminates T and U over the finite field with p elements, and F=Fp(Tp,Up)=𝔽_p(T^p,U^p). In fact, for any α = g(T,U) in E∖F, the Frobenius endomorphism shows that the element αp lies in F , so α is a root of f(X)=Xp−αp∈F[X](X)=X^p-α^p[X], and α cannot be a primitive element (of degree p2 over F), but instead F(α) is a non-trivial intermediate field.
