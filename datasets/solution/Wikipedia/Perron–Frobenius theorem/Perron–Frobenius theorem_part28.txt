Counterexamples: The matrices L = (100100111)([ 1 0 0; 1 0 0; 1 1 1 ]), P = (100100−111)([ 1 0 0; 1 0 0; -1 1 1 ]), T = (011101110)([ 0 1 1; 1 0 1; 1 1 0 ]), M = (0100010000000100000100100)([ 0 1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 0 1; 0 0 1 0 0 ]) provide simple examples of what can go wrong if the necessary conditions are not met. It is easily seen that the Perron and peripheral projections of L are both equal to P, thus when the original matrix is reducible the projections may lose non-negativity and there is no chance of expressing them as limits of its powers. The matrix T is an example of a primitive matrix with zero diagonal. If the diagonal of an irreducible non-negative square matrix is non-zero then the matrix must be primitive but this example demonstrates that the converse is false. M is an example of a matrix with several missing spectral teeth. If ω = eiπ/3 then ω6 = 1 and the eigenvalues of M are {1,ω2,ω3=-1,ω4} with a dimension 2 eigenspace for +1 so ω and ω5 are both absent. More precisely, since M is block-diagonal cyclic, then the eigenvalues are {1,-1} for the first block, and {1,ω2,ω4} for the lower one[citation needed]
