matrices: Let A be a positive matrix, assume that its spectral radius ρ(A) = 1 (otherwise consider A/ρ(A)). Hence, there exists an eigenvalue λ on the unit circle, and all the other eigenvalues are less or equal 1 in absolute value. Suppose that another eigenvalue λ ≠ 1 also falls on the unit circle. Then there exists a positive integer m such that Am is a positive matrix and the real part of λm is negative. Let ε be half the smallest diagonal entry of Am and set T = Am − εI which is yet another positive matrix. Moreover, if Ax = λx then Amx = λmx thus λm − ε is an eigenvalue of T. Because of the choice of m this point lies outside the unit disk consequently ρ(T) > 1. On the other hand, all the entries in T are positive and less than or equal to those in Am so by Gelfand's formula ρ(T) ≤ ρ(Am) ≤ ρ(A)m = 1. This contradiction means that λ=1 and there can be no other eigenvalues on the unit circle. Absolutely the same arguments can be applied to the case of primitive matrices; we just need to mention the following simple lemma, which clarifies the properties of primitive matrices.
