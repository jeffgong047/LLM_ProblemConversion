formula: Given a positive (or more generally irreducible non-negative matrix) A, one defines the function f on the set of all non-negative non-zero vectors x such that f(x) is the minimum value of [Ax]i / xi taken over all those i such that xi ≠ 0. Then f is a real-valued function, whose maximum is the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue r. For the proof we denote the maximum of f by the value R. The proof requires to show R = r. Inserting the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector v into f, we obtain f(v) = r and conclude r ≤ R. For the opposite inequality, we consider an arbitrary nonnegative vector x and let ξ=f(x). The definition of f gives 0 ≤ ξx ≤ Ax (componentwise). Now, we use the positive right eigenvector w for A for the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue r, then ξ wT x = wT ξx ≤ wT (Ax) = (wT A)x = r wT x . Hence f(x) = ξ ≤ r, which implies R ≤ r.[32] Perron projection as a limit:
