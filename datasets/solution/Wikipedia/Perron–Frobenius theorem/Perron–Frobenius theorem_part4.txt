matrices: There is an extension to matrices with non-negative entries. Since any non-negative matrix can be obtained as a limit of positive matrices, one obtains the existence of an eigenvector with non-negative components; the corresponding eigenvalue will be non-negative and greater than or equal, in absolute value, to all other eigenvalues.[13][14] However, for the example A=(0110)=([ 0 1; 1 0 ]), the maximum eigenvalue r = 1 has the same absolute value as the other eigenvalue −1; while for A=(0100)=([ 0 1; 0 0 ]), the maximum eigenvalue is r = 0, which is not a simple root of the characteristic polynomial, and the corresponding eigenvector (1, 0) is not strictly positive. However, Frobenius found a special subclass of non-negative matrices — irreducible matrices — for which a non-trivial generalization is possible. For such a matrix, although the eigenvalues attaining the maximal absolute value might not be unique, their structure is under control: they have the form ωr, where r is a real strictly positive eigenvalue, and ωω ranges over the complex h' th roots of 1 for some positive integer h called the period of the matrix. The eigenvector corresponding to r has strictly positive components (in contrast with the general case of non-negative matrices, where components are only non-negative). Also all such eigenvalues are simple roots of the characteristic polynomial. Further properties are described below. Classification of
