matrices: The Perron–Frobenius theorem does not apply directly to non-negative matrices. Nevertheless, any reducible square matrix A may be written in upper-triangular block form (known as the normal form of a reducible matrix)[25] PAP−1 = (B1∗∗⋯∗0B2∗⋯∗⋮⋮⋮⋮000⋯∗000⋯Bh)([ B_1 * * ⋯ *; 0 B_2 * ⋯ *; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; 0 0 0 ⋯ *; 0 0 0 ⋯ B_h ]) where P is a permutation matrix and each Bi is a square matrix that is either irreducible or zero. Now if A is non-negative then so too is each block of PAP−1, moreover the spectrum of A is just the union of the spectra of the Bi. The invertibility of A can also be studied. The inverse of PAP−1 (if it exists) must have diagonal blocks of the form Bi−1 so if any Bi isn't invertible then neither is PAP−1 or A. Conversely let D be the block-diagonal matrix corresponding to PAP−1, in other words PAP−1 with the asterisks zeroised. If each Bi is invertible then so is D and D−1(PAP−1) is equal to the identity plus a nilpotent matrix. But such a matrix is always invertible (if Nk = 0 the inverse of 1 − N is 1 + N + N2 + ... + Nk−1) so PAP−1 and A are both invertible. Therefore, many of the spectral properties of A may be deduced by applying the theorem to the irreducible Bi. For example, the Perron root is the maximum of the ρ(Bi). While there will still be eigenvectors with non-negative components it is quite possible that none of these will be positive. Stochastic
