Lemma: Given a non-negative A, assume there exists m, such that Am is positive, then Am+1, Am+2, Am+3,... are all positive. Am+1 = AAm, so it can have zero element only if some row of A is entirely zero, but in this case the same row of Am will be zero. Applying the same arguments as above for primitive matrices, prove the main claim. Power method and the positive
