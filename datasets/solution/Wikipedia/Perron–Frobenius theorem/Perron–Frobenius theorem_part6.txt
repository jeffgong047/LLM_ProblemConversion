matrices: Let A be an irreducible non-negative N×N matrix with period h and spectral radius ρ(A)=rρ(A)=r. Then the following statements hold. The number r∈R+∈ℝ^+ is a positive real number and it is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. It is called Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue. The Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue r is simple. Both right and left eigenspaces associated with r are one-dimensional. A has both a right and a left eigenvectors, respectively v𝐯 and w𝐰, with eigenvalue r and whose components are all positive. Moreover these are the only eigenvectors whose components are all positive are those associated with the eigenvalue r. The matrix A has exactly h (where h is the period) complex eigenvalues with absolute value r. Each of them is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial and is the product of r with an hth root of unity. Let ω=2π/hω=2π/h. Then the matrix A is similar to eiωA^iωA, consequently the spectrum of A is invariant under multiplication by eiω^iω (i.e. to rotations of the complex plane by the angle ωω). If h>1>1 then there exists a permutation matrix P such that PAP−1=(OA1OO…OOOA2O…O⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮OOOO…Ah−1AhOOO…O),^-1=[ O A_1 O O … O; O O A_2 O … O; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; O O O O … A_h-1; A_h O O O … O ], where O denotes a zero matrix and the blocks along the main diagonal are square matrices. Collatz–Wielandt formula: for all non-negative non-zero vectors x𝐱 let f(x)(𝐱) be the minimum value of [Ax]i/xi[A𝐱]_i/x_i taken over all those i such that xi≠0_i≠0. Then f is a real valued function whose maximum is the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue. The Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue satisfies the inequalities mini∑jaij≤r≤maxi∑jaij.min_i∑_ja_ij≤max_i∑_ja_ij. The example A=(001001110)=([ 0 0 1; 0 0 1; 1 1 0 ]) shows that the (square) zero-matrices along the diagonal may be of different sizes, the blocks Aj need not be square, and h need not divide n.
