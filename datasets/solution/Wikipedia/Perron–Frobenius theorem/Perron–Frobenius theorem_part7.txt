properties: Let A be an irreducible non-negative matrix, then: (I+A)n−1 is a positive matrix. (Meyer[12] claim 8.3.5 p. 672). For a non-negative A, this is also a sufficient condition.[16] Wielandt's theorem.[17][clarification needed] If |B|<A, then ρ(B)≤ρ(A). If equality holds (i.e. if μ=ρ(A)eiφ is eigenvalue for B), then B = eiφ D AD−1 for some diagonal unitary matrix D (i.e. diagonal elements of D equals to eiΘl, non-diagonal are zero).[18] If some power Aq is reducible, then it is completely reducible, i.e. for some permutation matrix P, it is true that: PAqP−1=(A1OO…OOA2O…O⋮⋮⋮⋮OOO…Ad)^qP^-1=[ A_1 O O … O; O A_2 O … O; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; O O O … A_d; ], where Ai are irreducible matrices having the same maximal eigenvalue. The number of these matrices d is the greatest common divisor of q and h, where h is period of A.[19] If c(x) = xn + ck1 xn-k1 + ck2 xn-k2 + ... + cks xn-ks is the characteristic polynomial of A in which only the non-zero terms are listed, then the period of A equals the greatest common divisor of k1, k2, ... , ks.[20] Cesàro averages: limk→∞1/k∑i=0,...,kAi/ri=(vwT),lim_k→∞1/k∑_i=0,...,kA^i/r^i=(vw^T), where the left and right eigenvectors for A are normalized so that wTv = 1. Moreover, the matrix v wT is the spectral projection corresponding to r, the Perron projection.[21] Let r be the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue, then the adjoint matrix for (r-A) is positive.[22] If A has at least one non-zero diagonal element, then A is primitive.[23] If 0 ≤ A < B, then rA ≤ rB. Moreover, if B is irreducible, then the inequality is strict: rA < rB. A matrix A is primitive provided it is non-negative and Am is positive for some m, and hence Ak is positive for all k ≥ m. To check primitivity, one needs a bound on how large the minimal such m can be, depending on the size of A:[24] If A is a non-negative primitive matrix of size n, then An2 − 2n + 2 is positive. Moreover, this is the best possible result, since for the matrix M below, the power Mk is not positive for every k < n2 − 2n + 2, since (Mn2 − 2n+1)11 = 0.
