eigenvalue: For any non-negative matrix A its Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue r satisfies the inequality: r≤maxi∑jaij. ≤ max_i∑_ja_ij. This is not specific to non-negative matrices: for any matrix A with an eigenvalue λλ it is true that |λ|≤maxi∑j|aij||λ| ≤ max_i∑_j|a_ij|. This is an immediate corollary of the Gershgorin circle theorem. However another proof is more direct: Any matrix induced norm satisfies the inequality ‖A‖≥|λ|A≥|λ| for any eigenvalue λλ because, if x is a corresponding eigenvector, ‖A‖≥|Ax|/|x|=|λx|/|x|=|λ|A≥|Ax|/|x|=||/|x|=|λ|. The infinity norm of a matrix is the maximum of row sums: ‖A‖∞=max1≤i≤m∑j=1n|aij|.A_∞=max_1∑_j=1^n|a_ij|. Hence the desired inequality is exactly ‖A‖∞≥|λ|A_∞≥|λ| applied to the non-negative matrix A. Another inequality is: mini∑jaij≤r.min_i∑_ja_ij ≤ r. This fact is specific to non-negative matrices; for general matrices there is nothing similar. Given that A is positive (not just non-negative), then there exists a positive eigenvector w such that Aw = rw and the smallest component of w (say wi) is 1. Then r = (Aw)i ≥ the sum of the numbers in row i of A. Thus the minimum row sum gives a lower bound for r and this observation can be extended to all non-negative matrices by continuity. Another way to argue it is via the Collatz-Wielandt formula. One takes the vector x = (1, 1, ..., 1) and immediately obtains the inequality. Further
