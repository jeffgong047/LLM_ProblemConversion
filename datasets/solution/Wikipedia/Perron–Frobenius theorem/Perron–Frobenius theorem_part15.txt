matrices: If A is a positive (or more generally primitive) matrix, then there exists a real positive eigenvalue r (Perronâ€“Frobenius eigenvalue or Perron root), which is strictly greater in absolute value than all other eigenvalues, hence r is the spectral radius of A. This statement does not hold for general non-negative irreducible matrices, which have h eigenvalues with the same absolute eigenvalue as r, where h is the period of A. Proof for positive
