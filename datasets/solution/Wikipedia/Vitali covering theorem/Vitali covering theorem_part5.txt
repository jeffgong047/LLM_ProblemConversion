use: An application of the Vitali lemma is in proving the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality. As in this proof, the Vitali lemma is frequently used when we are, for instance, considering the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure, λdλ_d, of a set E ⊂ Rd, which we know is contained in the union of a certain collection of balls Bj:j∈J{B_j:j}, each of which has a measure we can more easily compute, or has a special property one would like to exploit. Hence, if we compute the measure of this union, we will have an upper bound on the measure of E. However, it is difficult to compute the measure of the union of all these balls if they overlap. By the Vitali lemma, we may choose a subcollection Bj:j∈J′{B_j:j'} which is disjoint and such that ⋃j∈J′5Bj⊃⋃j∈JBj⊃E⋃_j'5B_j⊃⋃_jB_j. Therefore, λd(E)≤λd(⋃j∈JBj)≤λd(⋃j∈J′5Bj)≤∑j∈J′λd(5Bj).λ_d(E)≤λ_d(⋃_jB_j)≤λ_d(⋃_j'5B_j)≤∑_j'λ_d(5B_j). Now, since increasing the radius of a d-dimensional ball by a factor of five increases its volume by a factor of 5d, we know that ∑j∈J′λd(5Bj)=5d∑j∈J′λd(Bj)∑_j'λ_d(5B_j)=5^d∑_j'λ_d(B_j) and thus λd(E)≤5d∑j∈J′λd(Bj).λ_d(E)≤5^d∑_j'λ_d(B_j).
