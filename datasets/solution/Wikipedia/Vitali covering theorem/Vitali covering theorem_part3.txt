version: Theorem (Finite Covering Lemma). Let B1,…,Bn_1,…,B_n be any finite collection of balls contained in an arbitrary metric space. Then there exists a subcollection Bj1,Bj2,…,Bjm_j_1,B_j_2,…,B_j_m of these balls which are disjoint and satisfy B1∪B2∪⋯∪Bn⊆3Bj1∪3Bj2∪⋯∪3Bjm._1_2∪…_n⊆3B_j_1∪3B_j_2∪…∪3B_j_m.Proof: Without loss of generality, we assume that the collection of balls is not empty; that is, n > 0. Let Bj1_j_1 be the ball of largest radius. Inductively, assume that Bj1,…,Bjk_j_1,…,B_j_k have been chosen. If there is some ball in B1,…,Bn_1,…,B_n that is disjoint from Bj1∪Bj2∪⋯∪Bjk_j_1_j_2∪…_j_k, let Bjk+1_j_k+1 be such ball with maximal radius (breaking ties arbitrarily), otherwise, we set m := k and terminate the inductive definition. Now set X:=⋃k=1m3Bjk:=⋃_k=1^m3 B_j_k. It remains to show that Bi⊂X_i for every i=1,2,…,n=1,2,…,n. This is clear if i∈j1,…,jm∈{j_1,…,j_m}. Otherwise, there necessarily is some k∈1,…,m∈{1,…,m} such that Bi_i intersects Bjk_j_k and the radius of Bjk_j_k is at least as large as that of Bi_i. The triangle inequality then easily implies that Bi⊂3Bjk⊂X_i⊂3 B_j_k, as needed. This completes the proof of the finite version. Infinite
