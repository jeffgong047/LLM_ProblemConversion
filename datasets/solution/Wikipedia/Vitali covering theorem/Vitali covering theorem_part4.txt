version: Theorem (Infinite Covering Lemma). Let F𝐅 be an arbitrary collection of balls in a separable metric space such that R:=suprad(B):B∈F<∞:=sup {rad(B):B∈𝐅}<∞ where rad(B)rad(B) denotes the radius of the ball B. Then there exists a countable sub-collection G⊂F𝐆⊂𝐅 such that the balls of G𝐆 are pairwise disjoint, and satisfy⋃B∈FB⊆⋃C∈G5C.⋃_B∈𝐅B⊆⋃_C∈𝐆5 C.And moreover, each B∈F∈𝐅 intersects some C∈G∈𝐆 with B⊂5C⊂5C. Proof: Consider the partition of F into subcollections Fn, n ≥ 0, defined by Fn=B∈F:2−n−1R<rad(B)≤2−nR.𝐅_n={B∈𝐅:2^-n-1R<rad(B)≤2^-nR}. That is, Fn𝐅_n consists of the balls B whose radius is in (2−n−1R, 2−nR]. A sequence Gn, with Gn ⊂ Fn, is defined inductively as follows. First, set H0 = F0 and let G0 be a maximal disjoint subcollection of H0 (such a subcollection exists by Zorn's lemma). Assuming that G0,...,Gn have been selected, let Hn+1=B∈Fn+1:B∩C=∅,∀C∈G0∪G1∪⋯∪Gn,𝐇_n+1={B∈𝐅_n+1:=∅, ∈𝐆_0∪𝐆_1∪…∪𝐆_n}, and let Gn+1 be a maximal disjoint subcollection of Hn+1. The subcollection G:=⋃n=0∞Gn𝐆:=⋃_n=0^∞𝐆_n of F satisfies the requirements of the theorem: G is a disjoint collection, and is thus countable since the given metric space is separable. Moreover, every ball B ∈ F intersects a ball C ∈ G such that B ⊂ 5 C. Indeed, if we are given some B∈F∈𝐅, there must be some n be such that B belongs to Fn. Either B does not belong to Hn, which implies n > 0 and means that B intersects a ball from the union of G0, ..., Gn−1, or B ∈ Hn and by maximality of Gn, B intersects a ball in Gn. In any case, B intersects a ball C that belongs to the union of G0, ..., Gn. Such a ball C must have a radius larger than 2−n−1R. Since the radius of B is less than or equal to 2−nR, we can conclude by the triangle inequality that B ⊂ 5 C, as claimed. From this ⋃B∈FB⊆⋃C∈G5C⋃_B∈𝐅B⊆⋃_C∈𝐆5 C immediately follows, completing the proof.[2] Remarks In the infinite version, the initial collection of balls can be countable or uncountable. In a separable metric space, any pairwise disjoint collection of balls must be countable. In a non-separable space, the same argument shows a pairwise disjoint subfamily exists, but that family need not be countable. The result may fail if the radii are not bounded: consider the family of all balls centered at 0 in Rd; any disjoint subfamily consists of only one ball B, and 5 B does not contain all the balls in this family. The constant 5 is not optimal. If the scale c−n, c > 1, is used instead of 2−n for defining Fn, the final value is 1 + 2c instead of 5. Any constant larger than 3 gives a correct statement of the lemma, but not 3. Using a finer analysis, when the original collection F is a Vitali covering of a subset E of Rd, one shows that the subcollection G, defined in the above proof, covers E up to a Lebesgue-negligible set.[3] Applications and method of
