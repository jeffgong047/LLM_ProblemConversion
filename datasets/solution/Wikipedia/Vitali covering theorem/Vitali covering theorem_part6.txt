theorem: In the covering theorem, the aim is to cover, up to a "negligible set", a given set E ⊆ Rd by a disjoint subcollection extracted from a Vitali covering for E : a Vitali class or Vitali covering V𝒱 for E is a collection of sets such that, for every x ∈ E and δ > 0, there is a set U in the collection V𝒱 such that x ∈ U and the diameter of U is non-zero and less than δ. In the classical setting of Vitali,[1] the negligible set is a Lebesgue negligible set, but measures other than the Lebesgue measure, and spaces other than Rd have also been considered, as is shown in the relevant section below. The following observation is useful: if V𝒱 is a Vitali covering for E and if E is contained in an open set Ω ⊆ Rd, then the subcollection of sets U in V𝒱 that are contained in Ω is also a Vitali covering for E.
