measure: The next covering theorem for the Lebesgue measure λd is due to Lebesgue (1910). A collection V𝒱 of measurable subsets of Rd is a regular family (in the sense of Lebesgue) if there exists a constant C such that diam⁡(V)d≤Cλd(V)diam(V)^d λ_d(V) for every set V in the collection V𝒱. The family of cubes is an example of regular family V𝒱, as is the family V(m)𝒱(m) of rectangles in R2 such that the ratio of sides stays between m−1 and m, for some fixed m ≥ 1. If an arbitrary norm is given on Rd, the family of balls for the metric associated to the norm is another example. To the contrary, the family of all rectangles in R2 is not regular. Theorem — Let E ⊆ Rd be a measurable set with finite Lebesgue measure, and let V𝒱 be a regular family of closed subsets of Rd that is a Vitali covering for E. Then there exists a finite or countably infinite disjoint subcollection Uj⊆V{U_j}⊆𝒱 such that λd(E∖⋃jUj)=0.λ_d(E∖⋃_jU_j)=0. The original result of Vitali (1908) is a special case of this theorem, in which d = 1 and V𝒱 is a collection of intervals that is a Vitali covering for a measurable subset E of the real line having finite measure. The theorem above remains true without assuming that E has finite measure. This is obtained by applying the covering result in the finite measure case, for every integer n ≥ 0, to the portion of E contained in the open annulus Ωn of points x such that n < |x| < n+1.[4] A somewhat related covering theorem is the Besicovitch covering theorem. To each point a of a subset A ⊆ Rd, a Euclidean ball B(a, ra) with center a and positive radius ra is assigned. Then, as in the Vitali theorem, a subcollection of these balls is selected in order to cover A in a specific way. The main differences with the Vitali covering theorem are that on one hand, the disjointness requirement of Vitali is relaxed to the fact that the number Nx of the selected balls containing an arbitrary point x ∈ Rd is bounded by a constant Bd depending only upon the dimension d; on the other hand, the selected balls do cover the set A of all the given centers.[5] Vitali's covering theorem for the Hausdorff
