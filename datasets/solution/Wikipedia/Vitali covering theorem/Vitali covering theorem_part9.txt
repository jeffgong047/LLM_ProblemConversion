theorem: The covering lemma can be used as intermediate step in the proof of the following basic form of the Vitali covering theorem. Theorem — For every subset E of Rd and every Vitali cover of E by a collection F of closed balls, there exists a disjoint subcollection G which covers E up to a Lebesgue-negligible set. Proof: Without loss of generality, one can assume that all balls in F are nondegenerate and have radius less than or equal to 1. By the infinite form of the covering lemma, there exists a countable disjoint subcollection G𝐆 of F such that every ball B ∈ F intersects a ball C ∈ G for which B ⊂ 5 C. Let r > 0 be given, and let Z denote the set of points z ∈ E that are not contained in any ball from G and belong to the open ball B(r) of radius r, centered at 0. It is enough to show that Z is Lebesgue-negligible, for every given r. Let Gr=Cnn𝐆_r={C_n}_n denote the subcollection of those balls in G that meet B(r). Note that Gr𝐆_r may be finite or countably infinite. Let z ∈ Z be fixed. For each N, z does not belong to the closed set K=⋃n≤NCn=⋃_nC_n by the definition of Z. But by the Vitali cover property, one can find a ball B ∈ F containing z, contained in B(r), and disjoint from K. By the property of G, the ball B intersects some ball Ci∈G_i∈𝐆 and is contained in 5Ci5C_i. But because K and B are disjoint, we must have i > N. So z∈5Ci∈5C_i for some i > N, and therefore Z⊂⋃n>N5Cn.⊂⋃_n>N5C_n. This gives for every N the inequality λd(Z)≤∑n>Nλd(5Cn)=5d∑n>Nλd(Cn).λ_d(Z)≤∑_n>Nλ_d(5C_n)=5^d∑_n>Nλ_d(C_n). But since the balls of Gr𝐆_r are contained in B(r+2), and these balls are disjoint we see ∑nλd(Cn)<∞.∑_nλ_d(C_n)<∞. Therefore, the term on the right side of the above inequality converges to 0 as N goes to infinity, which shows that Z is negligible as needed.[7] Infinite-dimensional
