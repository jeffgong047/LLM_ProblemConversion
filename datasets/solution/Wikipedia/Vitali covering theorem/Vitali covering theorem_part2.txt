lemma: Visualization of the lemma in R1ℝ^1. On the top: a collection of balls; the green balls are the disjoint subcollection. On the bottom: the subcollection with three times the radius covers all the balls.There are two basic version of the lemma, a finite version and an infinite version. Both lemmas can be proved in the general setting of a metric space, typically these results are applied to the special case of the Euclidean space Rdℝ^d. In both theorems we will use the following notation: if B=B(x,r)=B(x,r) is a ball and c∈R∈ℝ, we will write cB for the ball B(x,cr)(x,cr). Finite
