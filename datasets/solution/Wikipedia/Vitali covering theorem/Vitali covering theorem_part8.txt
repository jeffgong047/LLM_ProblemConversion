measure: One may have a similar objective when considering Hausdorff measure instead of Lebesgue measure. The following theorem applies in that case.[6] Theorem — Let Hs denote s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, let E ⊆ Rd be an Hs-measurable set and V𝒱 a Vitali class of closed sets for E. Then there exists a (finite or countably infinite) disjoint subcollection Uj⊆V{U_j}⊆𝒱 such that either Hs(E∖⋃jUj)=0^s(E∖⋃_jU_j)=0 or ∑jdiam⁡(Uj)s=∞.∑_jdiam(U_j)^s=∞. Furthermore, if E has finite s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, then for any ε > 0, we may choose this subcollection {Uj} such that Hs(E)≤∑jdiam(Uj)s+ε.^s(E)≤∑_jdiam(U_j)^s+ε. This theorem implies the result of Lebesgue given above. Indeed, when s = d, the Hausdorff measure Hs on Rd coincides with a multiple of the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure. If a disjoint collection Uj{U_j} is regular and contained in a measurable region B with finite Lebesgue measure, then ∑jdiam⁡(Uj)d≤C∑jλd(Uj)≤Cλd(B)<+∞∑_jdiam(U_j)^d∑_jλ_d(U_j) λ_d(B)<+∞ which excludes the second possibility in the first assertion of the previous theorem. It follows that E is covered, up to a Lebesgue-negligible set, by the selected disjoint subcollection. From the covering lemma to the covering
