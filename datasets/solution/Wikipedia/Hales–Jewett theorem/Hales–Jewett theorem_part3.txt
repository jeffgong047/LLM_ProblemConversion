case): We now prove the Hales–Jewett theorem in the special case n = 3, c = 2, H = 8 discussed above. The idea is to reduce this task to that of proving simpler versions of the Hales–Jewett theorem (in this particular case, to the cases n = 2, c = 2, H = 2 and n = 2, c = 6, H = 6). One can prove the general case of the Hales–Jewett theorem by similar methods, using mathematical induction. Each element of the hypercube W83 is a string of eight numbers from 1 to 3, e.g. 13211321 is an element of the hypercube. We are assuming that this hypercube is completely filled with "noughts" and "crosses". We shall use a proof by contradiction and assume that neither the set of noughts nor the set of crosses contains a combinatorial line. If we fix the first six elements of such a string and let the last two vary, we obtain an ordinary tic-tac-toe board, for instance "132113??" gives such a board. For each such board "abcdef??", we consider the positions "abcdef11", "abcdef12", "abcdef22". Each of these must be filled with either a nought or a cross, so by the pigeonhole principle two of them must be filled with the same symbol. Since any two of these positions are part of a combinatorial line, the third element of that line must be occupied by the opposite symbol (since we are assuming that no combinatorial line has all three elements filled with the same symbol). In other words, for each choice of "abcdef" (which can be thought of as an element of the six-dimensional hypercube W63), there are six (overlapping) possibilities: abcdef11 and abcdef12 are noughts; abcdef13 is a cross. abcdef11 and abcdef22 are noughts; abcdef33 is a cross. abcdef12 and abcdef22 are noughts; abcdef32 is a cross. abcdef11 and abcdef12 are crosses; abcdef13 is a nought. abcdef11 and abcdef22 are crosses; abcdef33 is a nought. abcdef12 and abcdef22 are crosses; abcdef32 is a nought. Thus we can partition the six-dimensional hypercube W63 into six classes, corresponding to each of the above six possibilities. (If an element abcdef obeys multiple possibilities, we can choose one arbitrarily, e.g. by choosing the highest one on the above list). Now consider the seven elements 111111, 111112, 111122, 111222, 112222, 122222, 222222 in W63. By the pigeonhole principle, two of these elements must fall into the same class. Suppose for instance 111112 and 112222 fall into class (5), thus 11111211, 11111222, 11222211, 11222222 are crosses and 11111233, 11222233 are noughts. But now consider the position 11333233, which must be filled with either a cross or a nought. If it is filled with a cross, then the combinatorial line 11xxx2xx is filled entirely with crosses, contradicting our hypothesis. If instead it is filled with a nought, then the combinatorial line 11xxx233 is filled entirely with noughts, again contradicting our hypothesis. Similarly if any other two of the above seven elements of W63 fall into the same class. Since we have a contradiction in all cases, the original hypothesis must be false; thus there must exist at least one combinatorial line consisting entirely of noughts or entirely of crosses. The above argument was somewhat wasteful; in fact the same theorem holds for H = 4.[2] If one extends the above argument to general values of n and c, then H will grow very fast; even when c = 2 (which corresponds to two-player tic-tac-toe) the H given by the above argument grows as fast as the Ackermann function. The first primitive recursive bound is due to Saharon Shelah,[3] and is still the best known bound in general for the Hales–Jewett number H = H(n, c). Connections with other
