theorems: Observe that the above argument also gives the following corollary: if we let A be the set of all eight-digit numbers whose digits are all either 1, 2, 3 (thus A contains numbers such as 11333233), and we color A with two colors, then A contains at least one arithmetic progression of length three, all of whose elements are the same color. This is simply because all of the combinatorial lines appearing in the above proof of the Hales–Jewett theorem, also form arithmetic progressions in decimal notation. A more general formulation of this argument can be used to show that the Hales–Jewett theorem generalizes van der Waerden's theorem. Indeed the Hales–Jewett theorem is substantially a stronger theorem. Just as van der Waerden's theorem has a stronger density version in Szemerédi's theorem, the Hales–Jewett theorem also has a density version. In this strengthened version of the Hales–Jewett theorem, instead of coloring the entire hypercube WHn into c colors, one is given an arbitrary subset A of the hypercube WHn with some given density 0 < δ < 1. The theorem states that if H is sufficiently large depending on n and δ, then the set A must necessarily contain an entire combinatorial line. The density Hales–Jewett theorem was originally proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson using ergodic theory.[4] In 2009, the Polymath Project developed a new proof[5][6] of the density Hales–Jewett theorem based on ideas from the proof of the corners theorem.[7] Dodos, Kanellopoulos, and Tyros gave a simplified version of the Polymath proof.[8] The Hales–Jewett is generalized by the Graham–Rothschild theorem, on higher-dimensional combinatorial cubes.
