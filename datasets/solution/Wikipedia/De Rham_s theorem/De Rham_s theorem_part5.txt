n-torus: The n-torus is the Cartesian product: Tn=S1×⋯×S1⏟n^n=S^1×⋯^1_n. Similarly, allowing n≥1≥1 here, we obtain HdRk(Tn)≃R(nk)._dR^k(T^n)≃ℝ^n. We can also find explicit generators for the de Rham cohomology of the torus directly using differential forms. Given a quotient manifold π:X→X/Gπ:X/G and a differential form ω∈Ωk(X)ω∈Ω^k(X) we can say that ωω is G-invariant if given any diffeomorphism induced by G, ⋅g:X→X:X we have (⋅g)∗(ω)=ω()^*(ω)=ω. In particular, the pullback of any form on X/G/G is G-invariant. Also, the pullback is an injective morphism. In our case of Rn/Znℝ^n/ℤ^n the differential forms dxi_i are Znℤ^n-invariant since d(xi+k)=dxi(x_i+k)=dx_i. But, notice that xi+α_i+α for α∈Rα∈ℝ is not an invariant 00-form. This with injectivity implies that [dxi]∈HdR1(Tn)[dx_i]_dR^1(T^n) Since the cohomology ring of a torus is generated by H1^1, taking the exterior products of these forms gives all of the explicit representatives for the de Rham cohomology of a torus.
