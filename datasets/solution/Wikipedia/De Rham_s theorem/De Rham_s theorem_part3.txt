computed: One may often find the general de Rham cohomologies of a manifold using the above fact about the zero cohomology and a Mayerâ€“Vietoris sequence. Another useful fact is that the de Rham cohomology is a homotopy invariant. While the computation is not given, the following are the computed de Rham cohomologies for some common topological objects: The
