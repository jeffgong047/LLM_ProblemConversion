decomposition: Let M be a compact oriented Riemannian manifold. The Hodge decomposition states that any k-form on M uniquely splits into the sum of three L2 components: ω=α+β+γ,ω=α+β+γ, where αα is exact, ββ is co-exact, and γγ is harmonic. One says that a form ββ is co-closed if δβ=0δβ=0 and co-exact if β=δηβ=δη for some form ηη, and that γγ is harmonic if the Laplacian is zero, Δγ=0Δγ=0. This follows by noting that exact and co-exact forms are orthogonal; the orthogonal complement then consists of forms that are both closed and co-closed: that is, of harmonic forms. Here, orthogonality is defined with respect to the L2 inner product on Ωk(M)Ω^k(M): (α,β)=∫Mα∧⋆β.(α,β)=∫_Mα∧⋆β. By use of Sobolev spaces or distributions, the decomposition can be extended for example to a complete (oriented or not) Riemannian manifold.[6] See
