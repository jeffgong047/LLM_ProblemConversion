theorem: Stokes' theorem is an expression of duality between de Rham cohomology and the homology of chains. It says that the pairing of differential forms and chains, via integration, gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology HdRk(M)_dR^k(M) to singular cohomology groups Hk(M;R).^k(M;ℝ). De Rham's theorem, proved by Georges de Rham in 1931, states that for a smooth manifold M, this map is in fact an isomorphism. More precisely, consider the map I:HdRp(M)→Hp(M;R),:H_dR^p(M)^p(M;ℝ), defined as follows: for any [ω]∈HdRp(M)[ω]_dR^p(M), let I(ω) be the element of Hom(Hp(M),R)≃Hp(M;R)Hom(H_p(M),ℝ)^p(M;ℝ) that acts as follows: Hp(M)∋[c]⟼∫cω._p(M)∋[c]⟼∫_cω. The theorem of de Rham asserts that this is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology. The exterior product endows the direct sum of these groups with a ring structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two cohomology rings are isomorphic (as graded rings), where the analogous product on singular cohomology is the cup product. Sheaf-theoretic de Rham
