isomorphism: For any smooth manifold M, let R_ℝ be the constant sheaf on M associated to the abelian group Rℝ; in other words, R_ℝ is the sheaf of locally constant real-valued functions on M. Then we have a natural isomorphism HdR∗(M)≅H∗(M,R_)_dR^*(M)^*(M,ℝ) between the de Rham cohomology and the sheaf cohomology of R_ℝ. (Note that this shows that de Rham cohomology may also be computed in terms of Čech cohomology; indeed, since every smooth manifold is paracompact Hausdorff we have that sheaf cohomology is isomorphic to the Čech cohomology Hˇ∗(U,R_)Ȟ^*(𝒰,ℝ) for any good cover U𝒰 of M.)
