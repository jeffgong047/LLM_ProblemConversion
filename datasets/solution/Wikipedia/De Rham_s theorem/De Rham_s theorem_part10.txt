Proof: The standard proof proceeds by showing that the de Rham complex, when viewed as a complex of sheaves, is an acyclic resolution of R_ℝ. In more detail, let m be the dimension of M and let ΩkΩ^k denote the sheaf of germs of k-forms on M (with Ω0Ω^0 the sheaf of C∞^∞ functions on M). By the Poincaré lemma, the following sequence of sheaves is exact (in the abelian category of sheaves): 0→R_→Ω0→d0Ω1→d1Ω2→d2⋯→dm−1Ωm→0.0→ℝ→Ω^0 Ω^1 Ω^2 … Ω^m→0. This long exact sequence now breaks up into short exact sequences of sheaves 0→imdk−1→⊂Ωk→dkimdk→0,0→im d_k-1 Ω^k im d_k→0, where by exactness we have isomorphisms imdk−1≅kerdkim d_k-1≅ker d_k for all k. Each of these induces a long exact sequence in cohomology. Since the sheaf Ω0Ω^0 of C∞^∞ functions on M admits partitions of unity, any Ω0Ω^0-module is a fine sheaf; in particular, the sheaves ΩkΩ^k are all fine. Therefore, the sheaf cohomology groups Hi(M,Ωk)^i(M,Ω^k) vanish for i>0>0 since all fine sheaves on paracompact spaces are acyclic. So the long exact cohomology sequences themselves ultimately separate into a chain of isomorphisms. At one end of the chain is the sheaf cohomology of R_ℝ and at the other lies the de Rham cohomology. Related
