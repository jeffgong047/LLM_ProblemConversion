proof: As there are non-Desarguesian projective planes in which Desargues's theorem is not true,[5] some extra conditions need to be met in order to prove it. These conditions usually take the form of assuming the existence of sufficiently many collineations of a certain type, which in turn leads to showing that the underlying algebraic coordinate system must be a division ring (skewfield).[6] Relation to Pappus's
