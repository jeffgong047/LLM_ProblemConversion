Notes: ^ Smith (1959, p. 307) ^ Katz (1998, p. 461) ^ (Coxeter 1964) pp. 26â€“27. ^ (Coxeter 1964, pg. 19) ^ The smallest examples of these can be found in Room & Kirkpatrick 1971. ^ (Albert & Sandler 2015), (Hughes & Piper 1973), and (Stevenson 1972). ^ According to (Dembowski 1968, pg. 159, footnote 1), Hessenberg's original proof is not complete; he disregarded the possibility that some additional incidences could occur in the Desargues configuration. A complete proof is provided by Cronheim 1953. ^ Coxeter 1969, p. 238, section 14.3
