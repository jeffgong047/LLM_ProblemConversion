mappings: If K > 1 then the maps x + iy ↦ Kx + iy and x + iy ↦ x + iKy are both quasiconformal and have constant dilatation K. If s > −1 then the map z↦z|z|s |z|^s is quasiconformal (here z is a complex number) and has constant dilatation max(1+s,11+s)max(1+s,1/1+s). When s ≠ 0, this is an example of a quasiconformal homeomorphism that is not smooth. If s = 0, this is simply the identity map. A homeomorphism is 1-quasiconformal if and only if it is conformal. Hence the identity map is always 1-quasiconformal. If f : D → D′ is K-quasiconformal and g : D′ → D′′ is K′-quasiconformal, then g o f is KK′-quasiconformal. The inverse of a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism is K-quasiconformal. The set of 1-quasiconformal maps forms a group under composition. The space of K-quasiconformal mappings from the complex plane to itself mapping three distinct points to three given points is compact. This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.
