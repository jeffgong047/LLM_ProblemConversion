Definition: Suppose f : D → D′ where D and D′ are two domains in C. There are a variety of equivalent definitions, depending on the required smoothness of f. If f is assumed to have continuous partial derivatives, then f is quasiconformal provided it satisfies the Beltrami equation ∂f∂z¯=μ(z)∂f∂z,/∂z̅=μ(z)/, (1) for some complex valued Lebesgue measurable μ satisfying sup |μ| < 1 (Bers 1977). This equation admits a geometrical interpretation. Equip D with the metric tensor ds2=Ω(z)2|dz+μ(z)dz¯|2,^2=Ω(z)^2| dz+μ(z) dz̅|^2, where Ω(z) > 0. Then f satisfies (1) precisely when it is a conformal transformation from D equipped with this metric to the domain D′ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. The function f is then called μ-conformal. More generally, the continuous differentiability of f can be replaced by the weaker condition that f be in the Sobolev space W1,2(D) of functions whose first-order distributional derivatives are in L2(D). In this case, f is required to be a weak solution of (1). When μ is zero almost everywhere, any homeomorphism in W1,2(D) that is a weak solution of (1) is conformal. Without appeal to an auxiliary metric, consider the effect of the pullback under f of the usual Euclidean metric. The resulting metric is then given by |∂f∂z|2|dz+μ(z)dz¯|2|/|^2| dz+μ(z) dz̅|^2 which, relative to the background Euclidean metric dzdz¯z̅, has eigenvalues (1+|μ|)2|∂f∂z|2,(1−|μ|)2|∂f∂z|2.(1+|μ|)^2|/|^2, (1-|μ|)^2|/|^2. The eigenvalues represent, respectively, the squared length of the major and minor axis of the ellipse obtained by pulling back along f the unit circle in the tangent plane. Accordingly, the dilatation of f at a point z is defined by K(z)=1+|μ(z)|1−|μ(z)|.(z)=1+|μ(z)|/1-|μ(z)|. The (essential) supremum of K(z) is given by K=supz∈D|K(z)|=1+‖μ‖∞1−‖μ‖∞=sup_z|K(z)|=1+μ_∞/1-μ_∞ and is called the dilatation of f. A definition based on the notion of extremal length is as follows. If there is a finite K such that for every collection Γ of curves in D the extremal length of Γ is at most K times the extremal length of {f o γ : γ ∈ Γ}. Then f is K-quasiconformal. If f is K-quasiconformal for some finite K, then f is quasiconformal. A few facts about quasiconformal
