GAGA: Let (X,OX)(X,𝒪_X) be a scheme of finite type over C. Then there is a topological space Xan which as a set consists of the closed points of X with a continuous inclusion map λX: Xan → X. The topology on Xan is called the "complex topology" (and is very different from the subspace topology). Suppose φ: X → Y is a morphism of schemes of locally finite type over C. Then there exists a continuous map φan: Xan → Yan such λY ∘ φan = φ ∘ λX. There is a sheaf OXan𝒪_X^an on Xan such that (Xan,OXan)(X^an,𝒪_X^an) is a ringed space and λX: Xan → X becomes a map of ringed spaces. The space (Xan,OXan)(X^an,𝒪_X^an) is called the "analytification" of (X,OX)(X,𝒪_X) and is an analytic space. For every φ: X → Y the map φan defined above is a mapping of analytic spaces. Furthermore, the map φ ↦ φan maps open immersions into open immersions. If X = Spec(C[x1,...,xn]) then Xan = Cn and OXan(U)𝒪_X^an(U) for every polydisc U is a suitable quotient of the space of holomorphic functions on U. For every sheaf Fℱ on X (called algebraic sheaf) there is a sheaf Fanℱ^an on Xan (called analytic sheaf) and a map of sheaves of OX𝒪_X-modules λX∗:F→(λX)∗Fanλ_X^*:ℱ→(λ_X)_*ℱ^an. The sheaf Fanℱ^an is defined as λX−1F⊗λX−1OXOXanλ_X^-1ℱ⊗_λ_X^-1𝒪_X𝒪_X^an. The correspondence F↦Fanℱ↦ℱ^an defines an exact functor from the category of sheaves over (X,OX)(X,𝒪_X) to the category of sheaves of (Xan,OXan)(X^an,𝒪_X^an).The following two statements are the heart of Serre's GAGA theorem[11][12] (as extended by Alexander Grothendieck, Amnon Neeman, and others). If f: X → Y is an arbitrary morphism of schemes of finite type over C and Fℱ is coherent then the natural map (f∗F)an→f∗anFan(f_*ℱ)^an_*^anℱ^an is injective. If f is proper then this map is an isomorphism. One also has isomorphisms of all higher direct image sheaves (Rif∗F)an≅Rif∗anFan(R^if_*ℱ)^an^if_*^anℱ^an in this case.[13] Now assume that Xan is Hausdorff and compact. If F,Gℱ,𝒢 are two coherent algebraic sheaves on (X,OX)(X,𝒪_X) and if f:Fan→Ganℱ^an→𝒢^an is a map of sheaves of OXan𝒪_X^an-modules then there exists a unique map of sheaves of OX𝒪_X-modules φ:F→Gφ:ℱ→𝒢 with f=φan=φ^an. If Rℛ is a coherent analytic sheaf of OXan𝒪_X^an-modules over Xan then there exists a coherent algebraic sheaf Fℱ of OX𝒪_X-modules and an isomorphism Fan≅Rℱ^an≅ℛ. In slightly lesser generality, the GAGA theorem asserts that the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on a complex projective variety X and the category of coherent analytic sheaves on the corresponding analytic space Xan are equivalent. The analytic space Xan is obtained roughly by pulling back to X the complex structure from Cn through the coordinate charts. Indeed, phrasing the theorem in this manner is closer in spirit to Serre's paper, seeing how the full scheme-theoretic language that the above formal statement uses heavily had not yet been invented by the time of GAGA's publication.
