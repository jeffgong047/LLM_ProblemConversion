statement: Let X be a projective complex algebraic variety. Because X is a complex variety, its set of complex points X(C) can be given the structure of a compact complex analytic space. This analytic space is denoted Xan. Similarly, if Fℱ is a sheaf on X, then there is a corresponding sheaf Fanℱ^an on Xan. This association of an analytic object to an algebraic one is a functor. The prototypical theorem relating X and Xan says that for any two coherent sheaves Fℱ and G𝒢 on X, the natural homomorphism: HomOX(F,G)→HomOXan(Fan,Gan)Hom_𝒪_X(ℱ,𝒢)→Hom_𝒪_X^an(ℱ^an,𝒢^an) is an isomorphism. Here OX𝒪_X is the structure sheaf of the algebraic variety X and OXan𝒪_X^an is the structure sheaf of the analytic variety Xan. In other words, the category of coherent sheaves on the algebraic variety X is equivalent to the category of analytic coherent sheaves on the analytic variety Xan, and the equivalence is given on objects by mapping Fℱ to Fanℱ^an. (Note in particular that OXan𝒪_X^an itself is coherent, a result known as the Oka coherence theorem,[1] and also, it was proved in “Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents” (Serre (1955)) that the structure sheaf of the algebraic variety OX𝒪_X is coherent.[2]) Another important statement is as follows: For any coherent sheaf Fℱ on an algebraic variety X the homomorphisms εq:Hq(X,F)→Hq(Xan,Fan)ε_q ^̋q(X,ℱ)^q(X^an,ℱ^an) are isomorphisms for all q's. This means that the q-th cohomology group on X is isomorphic to the cohomology group on Xan. The theorem applies much more generally than stated above (see the formal statement below). It and its proof have many consequences, such as Chow's theorem, the Lefschetz principle and Kodaira vanishing theorem.
