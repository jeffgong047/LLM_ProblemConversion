Theorem: For a given square-free integer n, define An=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=2x2+y2+32z2,Bn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=2x2+y2+8z2,Cn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=8x2+2y2+64z2,Dn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=8x2+2y2+16z2.A_n =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=2x^2+y^2+32z^2}, B_n =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=2x^2+y^2+8z^2}, C_n =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=8x^2+2y^2+64z^2}, D_n =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=8x^2+2y^2+16z^2}. Tunnell's theorem states that supposing n is a congruent number, if n is odd then 2An = Bn and if n is even then 2Cn = Dn. Conversely, if the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture holds true for elliptic curves of the form y2=x3−n2x^2=x^3-n^2x, these equalities are sufficient to conclude that n is a congruent number.
