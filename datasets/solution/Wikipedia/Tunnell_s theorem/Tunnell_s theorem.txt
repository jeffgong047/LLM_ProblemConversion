On the congruent number problem: which integers are the area of a rational right triangle
In number theory, Tunnell's theorem gives a partial resolution to the congruent number problem, and under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, a full resolution.


Congruent number problem[edit]
Main article: Congruent number problem
The congruent number problem asks which positive integers can be the area of a right triangle with all three sides rational.  Tunnell's theorem relates this to the number of integral solutions of a few fairly simple Diophantine equations.

Theorem[edit]
For a given square-free integer n, define

An=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=2x2+y2+32z2,Bn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=2x2+y2+8z2,Cn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=8x2+2y2+64z2,Dn=#(x,y,z)∈Z3∣n=8x2+2y2+16z2.A_n   =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=2x^2+y^2+32z^2},
B_n   =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=2x^2+y^2+8z^2},
C_n   =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=8x^2+2y^2+64z^2},
D_n   =#{(x,y,z)∈ℤ^3=8x^2+2y^2+16z^2}.
Tunnell's theorem states that supposing n is a congruent number, if n is odd then 2An = Bn and if n is even then 2Cn = Dn.  Conversely, if the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture holds true for elliptic curves of the form y2=x3−n2x^2=x^3-n^2x, these equalities are sufficient to conclude that n is a congruent number.

History[edit]
The theorem is named for Jerrold B. Tunnell, a number theorist at Rutgers University, who proved it in Tunnell (1983).

Importance[edit]
The importance of Tunnell's theorem is that the criterion it gives is testable by a finite calculation.  For instance, for a given n, the numbers An,Bn,Cn,Dn_n,B_n,C_n,D_n can be calculated by exhaustively searching through x,y,z,y,z in the range −n,…,n-√(n),…,√(n).
