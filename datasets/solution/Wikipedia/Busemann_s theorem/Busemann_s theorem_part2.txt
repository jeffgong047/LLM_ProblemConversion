theorem: Let K be a convex body in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn containing the origin in its interior. Let S be an (n − 2)-dimensional linear subspace of Rn. For each unit vector θ in S⊥, the orthogonal complement of S, let Sθ denote the (n − 1)-dimensional hyperplane containing θ and S. Define r(θ) to be the (n − 1)-dimensional volume of K ∩ Sθ. Let C be the curve {θr(θ)} in S⊥. Then C forms the boundary of a convex body in S⊥. See
