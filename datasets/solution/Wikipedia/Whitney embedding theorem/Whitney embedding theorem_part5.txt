results: Although every n-manifold embeds in R2n,ℝ^2n, one can frequently do better. Let e(n) denote the smallest integer so that all compact connected n-manifolds embed in Re(n).ℝ^e(n). Whitney's strong embedding theorem states that e(n) ≤ 2n. For n = 1, 2 we have e(n) = 2n, as the circle and the Klein bottle show. More generally, for n = 2k we have e(n) = 2n, as the 2k-dimensional real projective space show. Whitney's result can be improved to e(n) ≤ 2n − 1 unless n is a power of 2. This is a result of André Haefliger and Morris Hirsch (for n > 4) and C. T. C. Wall (for n = 3); these authors used important preliminary results and particular cases proved by Hirsch, William S. Massey, Sergey Novikov and Vladimir Rokhlin.[1] At present the function e is not known in closed-form for all integers (compare to the Whitney immersion theorem, where the analogous number is known).
