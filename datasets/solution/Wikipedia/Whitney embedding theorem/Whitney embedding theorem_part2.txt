proof: The general outline of the proof is to start with an immersion f:M→R2m:M→ℝ^2m with transverse self-intersections. These are known to exist from Whitney's earlier work on the weak immersion theorem. Transversality of the double points follows from a general-position argument. The idea is to then somehow remove all the self-intersections. If M has boundary, one can remove the self-intersections simply by isotoping M into itself (the isotopy being in the domain of f), to a submanifold of M that does not contain the double-points. Thus, we are quickly led to the case where M has no boundary. Sometimes it is impossible to remove the double-points via an isotopy—consider for example the figure-8 immersion of the circle in the plane. In this case, one needs to introduce a local double point. Introducing double-point. Once one has two opposite double points, one constructs a closed loop connecting the two, giving a closed path in R2m.ℝ^2m. Since R2mℝ^2m is simply connected, one can assume this path bounds a disc, and provided 2m > 4 one can further assume (by the weak Whitney embedding theorem) that the disc is embedded in R2mℝ^2m such that it intersects the image of M only in its boundary. Whitney then uses the disc to create a 1-parameter family of immersions, in effect pushing M across the disc, removing the two double points in the process. In the case of the figure-8 immersion with its introduced double-point, the push across move is quite simple (pictured).Cancelling opposite double-points. This process of eliminating opposite sign double-points by pushing the manifold along a disc is called the Whitney Trick. To introduce a local double point, Whitney created immersions αm:Rm→R2mα_m:ℝ^m→ℝ^2m which are approximately linear outside of the unit ball, but containing a single double point. For m = 1 such an immersion is given by α:R1→R2α(t)=(11+t2,t−2t1+t2)α:ℝ^1→ℝ^2 α(t)=(1/1+t^2,-2t/1+t^2) Notice that if α is considered as a map to R3ℝ^3 like so: α(t)=(11+t2,t−2t1+t2,0)α(t)=(1/1+t^2,-2t/1+t^2,0) then the double point can be resolved to an embedding: β(t,a)=(1(1+t2)(1+a2),t−2t(1+t2)(1+a2),ta(1+t2)(1+a2)).β(t,a)=(1/(1+t^2)(1+a^2),-2t/(1+t^2)(1+a^2),{ta/(1+t^2)(1+a^2)). Notice β(t, 0) = α(t) and for a ≠ 0 then as a function of t, β(t, a) is an embedding. For higher dimensions m, there are αm that can be similarly resolved in R2m+1.ℝ^2m+1. For an embedding into R5,ℝ^5, for example, define α2(t1,t2)=(β(t1,t2),t2)=(1(1+t12)(1+t22),t1−2t1(1+t12)(1+t22),t1t2(1+t12)(1+t22),t2).α_2(t_1,t_2)=(β(t_1,t_2),_2)=(1/(1+t_1^2)(1+t_2^2),_1-2t_1/(1+t_1^2)(1+t_2^2),{t_1t_2/(1+t_1^2)(1+t_2^2),_2). This process ultimately leads one to the definition: αm(t1,t2,⋯,tm)=(1u,t1−2t1u,t1t2u,t2,t1t3u,t3,⋯,t1tmu,tm),α_m(t_1,t_2,⋯,t_m)=(1/u,t_1-2t_1/u,t_1t_2/u,t_2,t_1t_3/u,t_3,⋯,t_1t_m/u,t_m), where u=(1+t12)(1+t22)⋯(1+tm2).=(1+t_1^2)(1+t_2^2)⋯(1+t_m^2). The key properties of αm is that it is an embedding except for the double-point αm(1, 0, ... , 0) = αm(−1, 0, ... , 0). Moreover, for |(t1, ... , tm)| large, it is approximately the linear embedding (0, t1, 0, t2, ... , 0, tm). Eventual consequences of the Whitney
