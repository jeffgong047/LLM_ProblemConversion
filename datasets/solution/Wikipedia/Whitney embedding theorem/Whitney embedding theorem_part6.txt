manifolds: One can strengthen the results by putting additional restrictions on the manifold. For example, the n-sphere always embeds in Rn+1ℝ^n+1 – which is the best possible (closed n-manifolds cannot embed in Rnℝ^n). Any compact orientable surface and any compact surface with non-empty boundary embeds in R3,ℝ^3, though any closed non-orientable surface needs R4.ℝ^4. If N is a compact orientable n-dimensional manifold, then N embeds in R2n−1ℝ^2n-1 (for n not a power of 2 the orientability condition is superfluous). For n a power of 2 this is a result of André Haefliger and Morris Hirsch (for n > 4), and Fuquan Fang (for n = 4); these authors used important preliminary results proved by Jacques Boéchat and Haefliger, Simon Donaldson, Hirsch and William S. Massey.[1] Haefliger proved that if N is a compact n-dimensional k-connected manifold, then N embeds in R2n−kℝ^2n-k provided 2k + 3 ≤ n.[1] Isotopy
