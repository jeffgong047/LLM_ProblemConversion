versions: A relatively 'easy' result is to prove that any two embeddings of a 1-manifold into R4ℝ^4 are isotopic (see Knot theory#Higher dimensions). This is proved using general position, which also allows to show that any two embeddings of an n-manifold into R2n+2ℝ^2n+2 are isotopic. This result is an isotopy version of the weak Whitney embedding theorem. Wu proved that for n ≥ 2, any two embeddings of an n-manifold into R2n+1ℝ^2n+1 are isotopic. This result is an isotopy version of the strong Whitney embedding theorem. As an isotopy version of his embedding result, Haefliger proved that if N is a compact n-dimensional k-connected manifold, then any two embeddings of N into R2n−k+1ℝ^2n-k+1 are isotopic provided 2k + 2 ≤ n. The dimension restriction 2k + 2 ≤ n is sharp: Haefliger went on to give examples of non-trivially embedded 3-spheres in R6ℝ^6 (and, more generally, (2d − 1)-spheres in R3dℝ^3d).
