(Nagano–Sussmann): Each orbit Oq0𝒪_q_0 is an immersed submanifold of M. The tangent space to the orbit Oq0𝒪_q_0 at a point q is the linear subspace of TqM_qM spanned by the vectors P∗f(q)_*f(q) where P∗f_*f denotes the pushforward of f by P, f belongs to Fℱ and P is a diffeomorphism of M of the form etkfk∘⋯∘et1f1^t_kf_k∘⋯^t_1f_1 with k∈N,t1,…,tk∈R∈ℕ,_1,…,t_k∈ℝ and f1,…,fk∈F_1,…,f_k∈ℱ. If all the vector fields of the family Fℱ are analytic, then TqOq0=LieqF_q𝒪_q_0=Lie_q ℱ where LieqFLie_q ℱ is the evaluation at q of the Lie algebra generated by Fℱ with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields. Otherwise, the inclusion LieqF⊂TqOq0Lie_q ℱ_q𝒪_q_0 holds true. Corollary (Rashevsky–Chow
