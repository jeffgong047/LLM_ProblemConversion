Definition: Let q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) be a C∞{𝒞^∞ control system, where q belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold M and u belongs to a control set U. Consider the family F=f(⋅,u)∣u∈Uℱ={f(·,u)} and assume that every vector field in Fℱ is complete. For every f∈F∈ℱ and every real t, denote by etf^tf the flow of f at time t. The orbit of the control system q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) through a point q0∈M_0 is the subset Oq0𝒪_q_0 of M defined by Oq0=etkfk∘etk−1fk−1∘⋯∘et1f1(q0)∣k∈N,t1,…,tk∈R,f1,…,fk∈F.𝒪_q_0={e^t_kf_k^t_k-1f_k-1∘⋯^t_1f_1(q_0)∈ℕ,_1,…,t_k∈ℝ,_1,…,f_k∈ℱ}. Remarks The difference between orbits and attainable sets is that, whereas for attainable sets only forward-in-time motions are allowed, both forward and backward motions are permitted for orbits. In particular, if the family Fℱ is symmetric (i.e., f∈F∈ℱ if and only if −f∈F-f∈ℱ), then orbits and attainable sets coincide. The hypothesis that every vector field of Fℱ is complete simplifies the notations but can be dropped. In this case one has to replace flows of vector fields by local versions of them. Orbit theorem
