A mathematical theorem on finite linear groups
In mathematics, the Jordan–Schur theorem also known as Jordan's theorem on finite linear groups is a theorem in its original form due to Camille Jordan. In that form, it states that there is a function ƒ(n) such that given a finite subgroup G of the group GL(n, C) of invertible n-by-n complex matrices, there is a subgroup H of G with the following properties:

H is abelian.
H is a normal subgroup of G.
The index of H in G satisfies (G : H) ≤ ƒ(n).
Schur proved a more general result that applies when G is not assumed to be finite, but just periodic. Schur showed that ƒ(n) may be taken to be 

((8n)1/2 + 1)2n2 − ((8n)1/2 − 1)2n2.[1]
A tighter bound (for n ≥ 3) is due to Speiser, who showed that as long as G is finite, one can take 

ƒ(n) = n! 12n(π(n+1)+1)
where π(n) is the prime-counting function.[1][2]  This was subsequently improved by Hans Frederick Blichfeldt who replaced the 12 with a 6. Unpublished work on the finite case was also done by Boris Weisfeiler.[3] Subsequently, Michael Collins, using the classification of finite simple groups, showed that in the finite case, one can take ƒ(n) = (n + 1)! when n is at least 71, and gave near complete descriptions of the behavior for smaller n.
