theorem: Let T denote some interval (thought of as "time"), and let n∈N∈ℕ. For each k∈N∈ℕ and finite sequence of distinct times t1,…,tk∈T_1,…,t_k, let νt1…tkν_t_1_k be a probability measure on (Rn)k.(ℝ^n)^k. Suppose that these measures satisfy two consistency conditions: 1. for all permutations ππ of 1,…,k{1,…,k} and measurable sets Fi⊆Rn_i⊆ℝ^n, νtπ(1)…tπ(k)(Fπ(1)×⋯×Fπ(k))=νt1…tk(F1×⋯×Fk);ν_t_π(1)_π(k)(F_π(1)×…_π(k))=ν_t_1_k(F_1×…_k); 2. for all measurable sets Fi⊆Rn_i⊆ℝ^n,m∈N∈ℕ νt1…tk(F1×⋯×Fk)=νt1…tk,tk+1,…,tk+m(F1×⋯×Fk×Rn×⋯×Rn⏟m).ν_t_1_k(F_1×…_k)=ν_t_1_k,t_k+1,…,t_k+m(F_1×…_k×ℝ^n×…×ℝ^n_m). Then there exists a probability space (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,ℙ) and a stochastic process X:T×Ω→Rn:T×Ω→ℝ^n such that νt1…tk(F1×⋯×Fk)=P(Xt1∈F1,…,Xtk∈Fk)ν_t_1_k(F_1×…_k)=ℙ(X_t_1_1,…,X_t_k_k) for all ti∈T_i, k∈N∈ℕ and measurable sets Fi⊆Rn_i⊆ℝ^n, i.e. X has νt1…tkν_t_1_k as its finite-dimensional distributions relative to times t1…tk_1_k. In fact, it is always possible to take as the underlying probability space Ω=(Rn)TΩ=(ℝ^n)^T and to take for X the canonical process X:(t,Y)↦Yt(t,Y)_t. Therefore, an alternative way of stating Kolmogorov's extension theorem is that, provided that the above consistency conditions hold, there exists a (unique) measure νν on (Rn)T(ℝ^n)^T with marginals νt1…tkν_t_1_k for any finite collection of times t1…tk_1_k. Kolmogorov's extension theorem applies when T is uncountable, but the price to pay for this level of generality is that the measure νν is only defined on the product σ-algebra of (Rn)T(ℝ^n)^T, which is not very rich.
