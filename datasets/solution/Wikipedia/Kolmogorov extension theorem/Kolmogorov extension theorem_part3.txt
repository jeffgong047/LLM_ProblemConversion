conditions: The two conditions required by the theorem are trivially satisfied by any stochastic process. For example, consider a real-valued discrete-time stochastic process X. Then the probability P(X1>0,X2<0)ℙ(X_1>0,X_2<0) can be computed either as ν1,2(R+×R−)ν_1,2(ℝ_+×ℝ_-) or as ν2,1(R−×R+)ν_2,1(ℝ_-×ℝ_+). Hence, for the finite-dimensional distributions to be consistent, it must hold that ν1,2(R+×R−)=ν2,1(R−×R+)ν_1,2(ℝ_+×ℝ_-)=ν_2,1(ℝ_-×ℝ_+). The first condition generalizes this statement to hold for any number of time points ti_i, and any control sets Fi_i. Continuing the example, the second condition implies that P(X1>0)=P(X1>0,X2∈R)ℙ(X_1>0)=ℙ(X_1>0,X_2∈ℝ). Also this is a trivial condition that will be satisfied by any consistent family of finite-dimensional distributions. Implications of the
