theorem: The Kolmogorov extension theorem gives us conditions for a collection of measures on Euclidean spaces to be the finite-dimensional distributions of some Rnℝ^n-valued stochastic process, but the assumption that the state space be Rnℝ^n is unnecessary. In fact, any collection of measurable spaces together with a collection of inner regular measures defined on the finite products of these spaces would suffice, provided that these measures satisfy a certain compatibility relation. The formal statement of the general theorem is as follows.[2] Let T be any set. Let (Ωt,Ft)t∈T{(Ω_t,ℱ_t)}_t be some collection of measurable spaces, and for each t∈T, let τtτ_t be a Hausdorff topology on ΩtΩ_t. For each finite subset J⊂T, define ΩJ:=∏t∈JΩtΩ_J:=∏_tΩ_t. For subsets I⊂J⊂T, let πIJ:ΩJ→ΩIπ_I^J:Ω_J→Ω_I denote the canonical projection map ω↦ω|Iω↦ω|_I. For each finite subset F⊂T, suppose we have a probability measure μFμ_F on ΩFΩ_F which is inner regular with respect to the product topology (induced by the τtτ_t) on ΩFΩ_F. Suppose also that this collection μF{μ_F} of measures satisfies the following compatibility relation: for finite subsets F⊂G⊂T, we have that μF=(πFG)∗μGμ_F=(π_F^G)_*μ_G where (πFG)∗μG(π_F^G)_*μ_G denotes the pushforward measure of μGμ_G induced by the canonical projection map πFGπ_F^G. Then there exists a unique probability measure μμ on ΩTΩ_T such that μF=(πFT)∗μμ_F=(π_F^T)_*μ for every finite subset F⊂T. As a remark, all of the measures μF,μμ_F,μ are defined on the product sigma algebra on their respective spaces, which (as mentioned before) is rather coarse. The measure μμ may sometimes be extended appropriately to a larger sigma algebra, if there is additional structure involved. Note that the original statement of the theorem is just a special case of this theorem with Ωt=RnΩ_t=ℝ^n for all t∈T, and μt1,...,tk=νt1…tkμ_{t_1,...,t_k}=ν_t_1_k for t1,...,tk∈T_1,...,t_k. The stochastic process would simply be the canonical process (πt)t∈T(π_t)_t, defined on Ω=(Rn)TΩ=(ℝ^n)^T with probability measure P=μ=μ. The reason that the original statement of the theorem does not mention inner regularity of the measures νt1…tkν_t_1_k is that this would automatically follow, since Borel probability measures on Polish spaces are automatically Radon. This theorem has many far-reaching consequences; for example it can be used to prove the existence of the following, among others: Brownian motion, i.e., the Wiener process, a Markov chain taking values in a given state space with a given transition matrix, infinite products of (inner-regular) probability spaces.
