theorem: Fix x′′∈B′′,^''^'', φ1,…,φn∈X′φ_1,…,φ_n^' and ϵ>0.ϵ>0. Examine the set U:=y′′∈X′′:|(x′′−y′′)(φi)|<ϵ,1≤i≤n.:={y^''^'':|(x^''-y^'')(φ_i)|<ϵ,1}. Let J:X→X′′:X^'' be the embedding defined by J(x)=Evx,(x)=Ev_x, where Evx(φ)=φ(x)Ev_x(φ)=φ(x) is the evaluation at x map. Sets of the form U form a base for the weak* topology,[2] so density follows once it is shown J(B)∩U≠∅(B)≠∅ for all such U.. The lemma above says that for any δ>0δ>0 there exists a x∈(1+δ)B∈(1+δ)B such that x′′(φi)=φi(x),^''(φ_i)=φ_i(x), 1≤i≤n,1, and in particular Evx∈U.Ev_x. Since J(B)⊂B′′,(B)^'', we have Evx∈(1+δ)J(B)∩U.Ev_x∈(1+δ)J(B). We can scale to get 11+δEvx∈J(B).1/1+δEv_x(B). The goal is to show that for a sufficiently small δ>0,δ>0, we have 11+δEvx∈J(B)∩U.1/1+δEv_x(B). Directly checking, one has |[x′′−11+δEvx](φi)|=|φi(x)−11+δφi(x)|=δ1+δ|φi(x)|.|[x^''-1/1+δEv_x](φ_i)|=|φ_i(x)-1/1+δφ_i(x)|=δ/1+δ|φ_i(x)|. Note that one can choose M sufficiently large so that ‖φi‖X′≤Mφ_i_X^' for 1≤i≤n.1.[3] Note as well that ‖x‖X≤(1+δ).x_X≤(1+δ). If one chooses δδ so that δM<ϵ,<ϵ, then δ1+δ|φi(x)|≤δ1+δ‖φi‖X′‖x‖X≤δ‖φi‖X′≤δM<ϵ.δ/1+δ|φ_i(x)|≤δ/1+δφ_i_X^'x_X≤δφ_i_X^'≤<ϵ. Hence one gets 11+δEvx∈J(B)∩U1/1+δEv_x(B) as desired. See
