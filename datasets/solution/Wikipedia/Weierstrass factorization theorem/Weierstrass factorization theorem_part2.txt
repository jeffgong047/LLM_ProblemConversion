Motivation: It is clear that any finite set cn{c_n} of points in the complex plane has an associated polynomial p(z)=∏n(z−cn)(z)=∏_n(z-c_n) whose zeroes are precisely at the points of that set. The converse is a consequences of the fundamental theorem of algebra: any polynomial function p(z)(z) in the complex plane has a factorization p(z)=a∏n(z−cn),(z)=a∏_n(z-c_n), where a is a non-zero constant and cn{c_n} is the set of zeroes of p(z)(z).[1] The two forms of the Weierstrass factorization theorem can be thought of as extensions of the above to entire functions. The necessity of additional terms in the product is demonstrated when one considers ∏n(z−cn)∏_n(z-c_n) where the sequence cn{c_n} is not finite. It can never define an entire function, because the infinite product does not converge. Thus one cannot, in general, define an entire function from a sequence of prescribed zeroes or represent an entire function by its zeroes using the expressions yielded by the fundamental theorem of algebra. A necessary condition for convergence of the infinite product in question is that for each z, the factors (z−cn)(z-c_n) must approach 1 as n→∞→∞. So it stands to reason that one should seek a function that could be 0 at a prescribed point, yet remain near 1 when not at that point and furthermore introduce no more zeroes than those prescribed. Weierstrass' elementary factors have these properties and serve the same purpose as the factors (z−cn)(z-c_n) above. The elementary
