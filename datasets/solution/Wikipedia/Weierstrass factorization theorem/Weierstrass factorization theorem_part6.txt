theorem: Let ƒ be an entire function, and let an{a_n} be the non-zero zeros of ƒ repeated according to multiplicity; suppose also that ƒ has a zero at z = 0 of order m ≥ 0.[a] Then there exists an entire function g and a sequence of integers pn{p_n} such that f(z)=zmeg(z)∏n=1∞Epn(zan).(z)=z^me^g(z)∏_n=1^∞E_p_n(z/a_n).[4] Examples of
