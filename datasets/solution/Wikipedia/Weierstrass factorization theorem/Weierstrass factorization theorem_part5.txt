zeroes: Let an{a_n} be a sequence of non-zero complex numbers such that |an|→∞|a_n|→∞. If pn{p_n} is any sequence of nonnegative integers such that for all r>0>0, ∑n=1∞(r/|an|)1+pn<∞,∑_n=1^∞(r/|a_n|)^1+p_n<∞, then the function f(z)=∏n=1∞Epn(z/an)(z)=∏_n=1^∞E_p_n(z/a_n) is entire with zeros only at points an_n. If a number z0_0 occurs in the sequence an{a_n} exactly m times, then function f has a zero at z=z0=z_0 of multiplicity m. The sequence pn{p_n} in the statement of the theorem always exists. For example, we could always take pn=n_n=n and have the convergence. Such a sequence is not unique: changing it at finite number of positions, or taking another sequence p′n ≥ pn, will not break the convergence. The theorem generalizes to the following: sequences in open subsets (and hence regions) of the Riemann sphere have associated functions that are holomorphic in those subsets and have zeroes at the points of the sequence.[2] Also the case given by the fundamental theorem of algebra is incorporated here. If the sequence an{a_n} is finite then we can take pn=0_n=0 and obtain: f(z)=c∏n(z−an) f(z)=c ∏_n(z-a_n). The Weierstrass factorization
