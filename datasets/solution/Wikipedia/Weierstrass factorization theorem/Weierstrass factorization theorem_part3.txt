factors: Consider the functions of the form exp⁡(−zn+1n+1)exp(-z^n+1n+1) for n∈N∈ℕ. At z=0=0, they evaluate to 11 and have a flat slope at order up to n. Right after z=1=1, they sharply fall to some small positive value. In contrast, consider the function 1−z1-z which has no flat slope but, at z=1=1, evaluates to exactly zero. Also note that for |z| < 1, (1−z)=exp⁡(ln⁡(1−z))=exp⁡(−z11−z22−z33+⋯).(1-z)=exp(ln(1-z))=exp(-z^11-z^22-z^33+⋯). Plot of En(x)_n(x) for n = 0,...,4 and x in the interval [-1,1]. The elementary factors,[2] also referred to as primary factors,[3] are functions that combine the properties of zero slope and zero value (see graphic): En(z)=(1−z)ifn=0,(1−z)exp⁡(z11+z22+⋯+znn)otherwise._n(z)=(1-z) ifn=0, (1-z)exp(z^1/1+z^2/2+⋯+z^n/n) otherwise. For |z| < 1 and n>0>0, one may express it as En(z)=exp⁡(−zn+1n+1∑k=0∞zk1+k/(n+1))_n(z)=exp(-z^n+1n+1∑_k=0^∞z^k1+k/(n+1)) and one can read off how those properties are enforced. The utility of the elementary factors En(z)_n(z) lies in the following lemma:[2] Lemma (15.8, Rudin) for |z| ≤ 1, n∈N∈ℕ |1−En(z)|≤|z|n+1.|1-E_n(z)|≤|^n+1. The two forms of the
