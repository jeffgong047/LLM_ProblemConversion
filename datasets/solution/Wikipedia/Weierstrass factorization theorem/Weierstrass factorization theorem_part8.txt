theorem: Main article: Hadamard factorization theorem Define the Hadamard canonical factors En(z):=(1−z)∏k=1nezk/k_n(z):=(1-z)∏_k=1^ne^z^k/kEntire functions of finite order have Hadamard's canonical representation[4]:f(z)=zmeP(z)∏k=1∞Ep(z/ak)(z)=z^me^P(z)∏_k=1^∞E_p(z/a_k)where ak_k are those roots of f that are not zero (ak≠0_k≠0), m is the order of the zero of f at z=0=0 (the case m=0=0 being taken to mean f(0)≠0(0)≠0), P a polynomial (whose degree we shall call q), and p is the smallest non-negative integer such that the series∑n=1∞1|an|p+1∑_n=1^∞1/|a_n|^p+1converges. The non-negative integer g=maxp,q=max{p,q} is called the genus of the entire function f. In this notation, g≤ρ≤g+1≤ρ+1 In other words: If the order ρρ is not an integer, then g=[ρ]=[ρ] is the integer part of ρρ. If the order is a positive integer, then there are two possibilities: g=ρ−1=ρ-1 or g=ρ=ρ. For example, sinsin, coscos and expexp are entire functions of genus g=ρ=1=ρ=1. See
