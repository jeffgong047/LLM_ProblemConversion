Example: For r = 3 and s = 2, the formula tells us that any permutation of three numbers has an increasing subsequence of length three or a decreasing subsequence of length two. Among the six permutations of the numbers 1,2,3: 1,2,3 has an increasing subsequence consisting of all three numbers 1,3,2 has a decreasing subsequence 3,2 2,1,3 has a decreasing subsequence 2,1 2,3,1 has two decreasing subsequences, 2,1 and 3,1 3,1,2 has two decreasing subsequences, 3,1 and 3,2 3,2,1 has three decreasing length-2 subsequences, 3,2, 3,1, and 2,1.
