interpretation: One can interpret the positions of the numbers in a sequence as x-coordinates of points in the Euclidean plane, and the numbers themselves as y-coordinates; conversely, for any point set in the plane, the y-coordinates of the points, ordered by their x-coordinates, forms a sequence of numbers (unless two of the points have equal x-coordinates). With this translation between sequences and point sets, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem can be interpreted as stating that in any set of at least rs − r − s + 2 points we can find a polygonal path of either r − 1 positive-slope edges or s − 1 negative-slope edges. In particular (taking r = s), in any set of at least n points we can find a polygonal path of at least ⌊√n-1⌋ edges with same-sign slopes. For instance, taking r = s = 5, any set of at least 17 points has a four-edge path in which all slopes have the same sign. An example of rs − r − s + 1 points without such a path, showing that this bound is tight, can be formed by applying a small rotation to an (r − 1) by (s − 1) grid. Permutation pattern
