Sufficiently long sequences of numbers have long monotonic subsequences A path of four upward-sloping edges in a set of 17 points. By the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, every set of 17 points has a path of this length that slopes either upward or downward. The 16-point subset with the central point removed has no such path. In mathematics, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem asserts that, given r, s, any sequence of distinct real numbers with length at least (r − 1)(s − 1) + 1 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length r or a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length s. The proof appeared in the same 1935 paper that mentions the Happy Ending problem.[1] It is a finitary result that makes precise one of the corollaries of Ramsey's theorem. While Ramsey's theorem makes it easy to prove that every infinite sequence of distinct real numbers contains a monotonically increasing infinite subsequence or a monotonically decreasing infinite subsequence, the result proved by Paul Erdős and George Szekeres goes further.
