principle: Given a sequence of length (r − 1)(s − 1) + 1, label each number ni in the sequence with the pair (ai, bi), where ai is the length of the longest monotonically increasing subsequence ending with ni and bi is the length of the longest monotonically decreasing subsequence ending with ni. Each two numbers in the sequence are labeled with a different pair: if i < j and ni ≤ nj then ai < aj, and on the other hand if ni ≥ nj then bi < bj. But there are only (r − 1)(s − 1) possible labels if ai is at most r − 1 and bi is at most s − 1, so by the pigeonhole principle there must exist a value of i for which ai or bi is outside this range. If ai is out of range then ni is part of an increasing sequence of length at least r, and if bi is out of range then ni is part of a decreasing sequence of length at least s. Steele (1995) credits this proof to the one-page paper of Seidenberg (1959) and calls it "the slickest and most systematic" of the proofs he surveys.[2][6] Dilworth's
