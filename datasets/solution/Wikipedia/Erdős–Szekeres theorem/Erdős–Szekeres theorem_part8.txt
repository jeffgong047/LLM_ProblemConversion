theorem: Another of the proofs uses Dilworth's theorem on chain decompositions in partial orders, or its simpler dual (Mirsky's theorem). To prove the theorem, define a partial ordering on the members of the sequence, in which x is less than or equal to y in the partial order if x ≤ y as numbers and x is not later than y in the sequence. A chain in this partial order is a monotonically increasing subsequence, and an antichain is a monotonically decreasing subsequence. By Mirsky's theorem, either there is a chain of length r, or the sequence can be partitioned into at most r − 1 antichains; but in that case the largest of the antichains must form a decreasing subsequence with length at least ⌈rs−r−s+2r−1⌉=s.⌈rs-r-s+2/r-1⌉=s. Alternatively, by Dilworth's theorem itself, either there is an antichain of length s, or the sequence can be partitioned into at most s − 1 chains, the longest of which must have length at least r.
