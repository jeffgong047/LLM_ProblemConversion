theorem: Let V be a finite-dimensional complex vector space and λλ be a partition of n. From the representation theory of the symmetric group Sn_n it is known that the partition λλ corresponds to an irreducible representation of Sn_n. Let χλχ^λ be the character of this representation. The tensor v1⊗v2⊗⋯⊗vn∈V⊗n_1_2⊗…_n^ symmetrized by χλχ^λ is defined to be χλ(e)n!∑σ∈Snχλ(σ)vσ(1)⊗vσ(2)⊗⋯⊗vσ(n),χ^λ(e)/n!∑_σ_nχ^λ(σ)v_σ(1)_σ(2)⊗…_σ(n), where e is the identity element of Sn_n. Gamas's theorem states that the above symmetrized tensor is non-zero if and only if it is possible to partition the set of vectors vi{v_i} into linearly independent sets whose sizes are in bijection with the lengths of the columns of the partition λλ.
