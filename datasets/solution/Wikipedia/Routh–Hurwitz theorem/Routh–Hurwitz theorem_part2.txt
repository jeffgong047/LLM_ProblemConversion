Notations: Let f(z) be a polynomial (with complex coefficients) of degree n with no roots on the imaginary axis (i.e. the line Z = ic where i is the imaginary unit and c is a real number). Let us define P0(y)_0(y) (a polynomial of degree n) and P1(y)_1(y) (a nonzero polynomial of degree strictly less than n) by f(iy)=P0(y)+iP1(y)(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y), respectively the real and imaginary parts of f on the imaginary line. Furthermore, let us denote by: p the number of roots of f in the left half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); q the number of roots of f in the right half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); Δarg⁡f(iy)Δ(iy) the variation of the argument of f(iy) when y runs from −∞ to +∞; w(x) is the number of variations of the generalized Sturm chain obtained from P0(y)_0(y) and P1(y)_1(y) by applying the Euclidean algorithm; I−∞+∞r_-∞^+∞r is the Cauchy index of the rational function r over the real line.
