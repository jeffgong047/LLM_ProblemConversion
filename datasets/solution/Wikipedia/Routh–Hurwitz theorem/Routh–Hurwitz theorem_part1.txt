(March 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mathematics, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem gives a test to determine whether all roots of a given polynomial lie in the left half-plane. Polynomials with this property are called Hurwitz stable polynomials. The Routh–Hurwitz theorem is important in dynamical systems and control theory, because the characteristic polynomial of the differential equations of a stable linear system has roots limited to the left half plane (negative eigenvalues). Thus the theorem provides a mathematical test, the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, to determine whether a linear dynamical system is stable without solving the system. The Routh–Hurwitz theorem was proved in 1895, and it was named after Edward John Routh and Adolf Hurwitz.
