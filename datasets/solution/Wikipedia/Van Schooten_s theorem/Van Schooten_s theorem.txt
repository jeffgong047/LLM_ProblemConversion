On lines connecting the vertices of an equilateral triangle to a point on its circumcircle
|PA|=|PB|+|PC||PA|=|PB|+|PC|
Van Schooten's theorem, named after the Dutch mathematician Frans van Schooten, describes a property of equilateral triangles. It states:

For an equilateral triangle △ABC with a point P on its circumcircle the length of longest of the three line segments PA,PB,PC,PB,PC connecting P with the vertices of the triangle equals the sum of the lengths of the other two.
The theorem is a consequence of Ptolemy's theorem for concyclic quadrilaterals. Let a be the side length of the equilateral triangle △ABC and PA the longest line segment. The triangle's vertices together with P form a concyclic quadrilateral and hence Ptolemy's theorem yields:

|BC|⋅|PA|=|AC|⋅|PB|+|AB|⋅|PC|⟺a⋅|PA|=a⋅|PB|+a⋅|PC|   |BC|·|PA|=|AC|·|PB|+|AB|·|PC|
⟺   a·|PA|=a·|PB|+a·|PC|
Dividing the last equation by a delivers Van Schooten's theorem.
