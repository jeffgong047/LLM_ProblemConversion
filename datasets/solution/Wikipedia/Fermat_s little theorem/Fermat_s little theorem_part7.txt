Pseudoprimes: Main article: Pseudoprime If a and p are coprime numbers such that ap−1 − 1 is divisible by p, then p need not be prime. If it is not, then p is called a (Fermat) pseudoprime to base a. The first pseudoprime to base 2 was found in 1820 by Pierre Frédéric Sarrus: 341 = 11 × 31.[12][13] A number p that is a Fermat pseudoprime to base a for every number a coprime to p is called a Carmichael number (for example, 561). Alternately, any number p satisfying the equality gcd(p,∑a=1p−1ap−1)=1(p,∑_a=1^p-1a^p-1)=1 is either a prime or a Carmichael number. Miller–Rabin primality
