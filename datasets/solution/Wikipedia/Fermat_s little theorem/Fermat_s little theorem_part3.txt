history: Main article: Chinese hypothesis Some mathematicians independently made the related hypothesis (sometimes incorrectly called the Chinese hypothesis) that 2p ≡ 2 (mod p) if and only if p is prime. Indeed, the "if" part is true, and it is a special case of Fermat's little theorem. However, the "only if" part is false: For example, 2341 ≡ 2 (mod 341), but 341 = 11 × 31 is a pseudoprime to base 2. See below.
