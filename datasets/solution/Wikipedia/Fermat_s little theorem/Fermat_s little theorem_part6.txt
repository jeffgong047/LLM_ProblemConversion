Converse: The converse of Fermat's little theorem is not generally true, as it fails for Carmichael numbers. However, a slightly stronger form of the theorem is true, and it is known as Lehmer's theorem. The theorem is as follows: If there exists an integer a such that ap−1≡1(modp)^p-1≡1p and for all primes q dividing p − 1 one has a(p−1)/q≢1(modp),^(p-1)/q≢1p, then p is prime. This theorem forms the basis for the Lucas primality test, an important primality test, and Pratt's primality certificate.
