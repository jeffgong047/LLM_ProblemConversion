theorem: Proof without words that a hypercube graph is non-planar using Kuratowski's or Wagner's theorems and finding either K5 (top) or K3,3 (bottom) subgraphs Wagner published both theorems in 1937,[1] subsequent to the 1930 publication of Kuratowski's theorem,[2] according to which a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain as a subgraph a subdivision of one of the same two forbidden graphs K5 and K3,3. In a sense, Kuratowski's theorem is stronger than Wagner's theorem: a subdivision can be converted into a minor of the same type by contracting all but one edge in each path formed by the subdivision process, but converting a minor into a subdivision of the same type is not always possible. However, in the case of the two graphs K5 and K3,3, it is straightforward to prove that a graph that has at least one of these two graphs as a minor also has at least one of them as a subdivision, so the two theorems are equivalent.[3]
