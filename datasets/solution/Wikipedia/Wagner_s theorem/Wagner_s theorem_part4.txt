Implications: One consequence of the stronger version of Wagner's theorem for four-connected graphs is to characterize the graphs that do not have a K5 minor. The theorem can be rephrased as stating that every such graph is either planar or it can be decomposed into simpler pieces. Using this idea, the K5-minor-free graphs may be characterized as the graphs that can be formed as combinations of planar graphs and the eight-vertex Wagner graph, glued together by clique-sum operations. For instance, K3,3 can be formed in this way as a clique-sum of three planar graphs, each of which is a copy of the tetrahedral graph K4. Wagner's theorem is an important precursor to the theory of graph minors, which culminated in the proofs of two deep and far-reaching results: the graph structure theorem (a generalization of Wagner's clique-sum decomposition of K5-minor-free graphs)[4] and the Robertsonâ€“Seymour theorem (a generalization of the forbidden minor characterization of planar graphs, stating that every graph family closed under the operation of taking minors has a characterization by a finite number of forbidden minors).[5] Analogues of Wagner's theorem can also be extended to the theory of matroids: in particular, the same two graphs K5 and K3,3 (along with three other forbidden configurations) appear in a characterization of the graphic matroids by forbidden matroid minors.[6]
