In number theory, Vantieghems theorem is a primality criterion. It states that a natural number n≥3 is prime if and only if ∏1≤k≤n−1(2k−1)≡nmod(2n−1).∏_1-1(2^k-1)(2^n-1). Similarly, n is prime, if and only if the following congruence for polynomials in X holds: ∏1≤k≤n−1(Xk−1)≡n−(Xn−1)/(X−1)mod(Xn−1)∏_1-1(X^k-1)-(X^n-1)/(X-1)(X^n-1) or: ∏1≤k≤n−1(Xk−1)≡nmod(Xn−1)/(X−1).∏_1-1(X^k-1)(X^n-1)/(X-1).
