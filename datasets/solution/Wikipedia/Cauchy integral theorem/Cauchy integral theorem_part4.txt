regions: Let U⊆C⊆ℂ be a simply connected open set, and let f:U→C:U→ℂ be a holomorphic function. Let γ:[a,b]→Uγ:[a,b] be a smooth closed curve. Then: ∫γf(z)dz=0.∫_γf(z) dz=0. (The condition that U be simply connected means that U has no "holes", or in other words, that the fundamental group of U is trivial.) General
