example: In both cases, it is important to remember that the curve γγ does not surround any "holes" in the domain, or else the theorem does not apply. A famous example is the following curve: γ(t)=eitt∈[0,2π],γ(t)=e^it∈[0,2π], which traces out the unit circle. Here the following integral: ∫γ1zdz=2πi≠0,∫_γ1/z dz=2≠0, is nonzero. The Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since f(z)=1/z(z)=1/z is not defined at z=0=0. Intuitively, γγ surrounds a "hole" in the domain of f, so γγ cannot be shrunk to a point without exiting the space. Thus, the theorem does not apply.
