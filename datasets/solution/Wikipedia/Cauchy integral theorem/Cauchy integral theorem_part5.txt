formulation: Let U⊆C⊆ℂ be an open set, and let f:U→C:U→ℂ be a holomorphic function. Let γ:[a,b]→Uγ:[a,b] be a smooth closed curve. If γγ is homotopic to a constant curve, then: ∫γf(z)dz=0.∫_γf(z) dz=0. (Recall that a curve is homotopic to a constant curve if there exists a smooth homotopy (within U) from the curve to the constant curve. Intuitively, this means that one can shrink the curve into a point without exiting the space.) The first version is a special case of this because on a simply connected set, every closed curve is homotopic to a constant curve. Main
