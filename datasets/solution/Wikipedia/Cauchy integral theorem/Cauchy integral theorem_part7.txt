Discussion: As Édouard Goursat showed, Cauchy's integral theorem can be proven assuming only that the complex derivative f′(z)'(z) exists everywhere in U. This is significant because one can then prove Cauchy's integral formula for these functions, and from that deduce these functions are infinitely differentiable. The condition that U be simply connected means that U has no "holes" or, in homotopy terms, that the fundamental group of U is trivial; for instance, every open disk Uz0=z:|z−z0|<r_z_0={z:|z-z_0|<r}, for z0∈C_0∈ℂ, qualifies. The condition is crucial; consider γ(t)=eitt∈[0,2π]γ(t)=e^it∈[0,2π] which traces out the unit circle, and then the path integral ∮γ1zdz=∫02π1eit(ieitdt)=∫02πidt=2πi∮_γ1/z dz=∫_0^2π1/e^it(ie^it dt)=∫_0^2πi dt=2 is nonzero; the Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since f(z)=1/z(z)=1/z is not defined (and is certainly not holomorphic) at z=0=0. One important consequence of the theorem is that path integrals of holomorphic functions on simply connected domains can be computed in a manner familiar from the fundamental theorem of calculus: let U be a simply connected open subset of Cℂ, let f:U→C:U→ℂ be a holomorphic function, and let γγ be a piecewise continuously differentiable path in U with start point a and end point b. If F is a complex antiderivative of f, then ∫γf(z)dz=F(b)−F(a).∫_γf(z) dz=F(b)-F(a). The Cauchy integral theorem is valid with a weaker hypothesis than given above, e.g. given U, a simply connected open subset of Cℂ, we can weaken the assumptions to f being holomorphic on U and continuous on U¯U and γγ a rectifiable simple loop in U¯U.[1] The Cauchy integral theorem leads to Cauchy's integral formula and the residue theorem.
