Proof: If one assumes that the partial derivatives of a holomorphic function are continuous, the Cauchy integral theorem can be proven as a direct consequence of Green's theorem and the fact that the real and imaginary parts of f=u+iv=u+iv must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in the region bounded by γγ, and moreover in the open neighborhood U of this region. Cauchy provided this proof, but it was later proven by Goursat without requiring techniques from vector calculus, or the continuity of partial derivatives. We can break the integrand f, as well as the differential dz into their real and imaginary components: f=u+iv=u+iv dz=dx+idy=dx+i dy In this case we have ∮γf(z)dz=∮γ(u+iv)(dx+idy)=∮γ(udx−vdy)+i∮γ(vdx+udy)∮_γf(z) dz=∮_γ(u+iv)(dx+i dy)=∮_γ(u dx-v dy)+i∮_γ(v dx+u dy) By Green's theorem, we may then replace the integrals around the closed contour γγ with an area integral throughout the domain D that is enclosed by γγ as follows: ∮γ(udx−vdy)=∬D(−∂v∂x−∂u∂y)dxdy∮_γ(u dx-v dy)=∬_D(-/-/) dx dy ∮γ(vdx+udy)=∬D(∂u∂x−∂v∂y)dxdy∮_γ(v dx+u dy)=∬_D(/-/) dx dy But as the real and imaginary parts of a function holomorphic in the domain D, u and v must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations there: ∂u∂x=∂v∂y/=/ ∂u∂y=−∂v∂x/=-/ We therefore find that both integrands (and hence their integrals) are zero ∬D(−∂v∂x−∂u∂y)dxdy=∬D(∂u∂y−∂u∂y)dxdy=0∬_D(-/-/) dx dy=∬_D(/-/) dx dy=0 ∬D(∂u∂x−∂v∂y)dxdy=∬D(∂u∂x−∂u∂x)dxdy=0∬_D(/-/) dx dy=∬_D(/-/) dx dy=0 This gives the desired result ∮γf(z)dz=0∮_γf(z) dz=0 See
