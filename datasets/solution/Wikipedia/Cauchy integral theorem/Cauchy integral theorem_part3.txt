integrals: If f(z) is a holomorphic function on an open region U, and γγ is a curve in U from z0_0 to z1_1 then, ∫γf′(z)dz=f(z1)−f(z0).∫_γf'(z) dz=f(z_1)-f(z_0). Also, when f(z) has a single-valued antiderivative in an open region U, then the path integral ∫γf′(z)dz∫_γf'(z) dz is path independent for all paths in U. Formulation on simply connected
