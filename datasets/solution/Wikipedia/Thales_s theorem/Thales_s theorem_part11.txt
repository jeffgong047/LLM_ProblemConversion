results: Thales's theorem is a special case of the following theorem: Given three points A, B and C on a circle with center O, the angle ∠ AOC is twice as large as the angle ∠ ABC. See inscribed angle, the proof of this theorem is quite similar to the proof of Thales's theorem given above. A related result to Thales's theorem is the following: If AC is a diameter of a circle, then: If B is inside the circle, then ∠ ABC > 90° If B is on the circle, then ∠ ABC = 90° If B is outside the circle, then ∠ ABC < 90°.
