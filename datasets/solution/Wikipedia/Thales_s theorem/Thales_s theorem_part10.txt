algebra: This proof utilizes two facts: two lines form a right angle if and only if the dot product of their directional vectors is zero, and the square of the length of a vector is given by the dot product of the vector with itself. Let there be a right angle ∠ ABC and circle M with AC as a diameter. Let M's center lie on the origin, for easier calculation. Then we know A = −C, because the circle centered at the origin has AC as diameter, and (A – B) · (B – C) = 0, because ∠ ABC is a right angle. It follows 0=(A−B)⋅(B−C)=(A−B)⋅(B+A)=|A|2−|B|2.∴|A|=|B|.0 =(A-B)·(B-C) =(A-B)·(B+A) =|A|^2-|B|^2. ∴A| =|B|. This means that A and B are equidistant from the origin, i.e. from the center of M. Since A lies on M, so does B, and the circle M is therefore the triangle's circumcircle. The above calculations in fact establish that both directions of Thales's theorem are valid in any inner product space. Generalizations and related
