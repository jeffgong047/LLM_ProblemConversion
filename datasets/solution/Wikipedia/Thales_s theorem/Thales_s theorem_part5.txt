proof: The theorem may also be proven using trigonometry: Let O = (0, 0), A = (-1, 0), and C = (1, 0). Then B is a point on the unit circle (cos θ, sin θ). We will show that △ABC forms a right angle by proving that AB and BC are perpendicular — that is, the product of their slopes is equal to −1. We calculate the slopes for AB and BC: mAB=yB−yAxB−xA=sin⁡θcos⁡θ+1mBC=yB−yCxB−xC=sin⁡θcos⁡θ−1m_AB =y_B-y_A/x_B-x_A=sinθ/cosθ+1 m_BC =y_B-y_C/x_B-x_C=sinθ/cosθ-1 Then we show that their product equals −1: mAB⋅mBC=sin⁡θcos⁡θ+1⋅sin⁡θcos⁡θ−1=sin2⁡θcos2⁡θ−1=sin2⁡θ−sin2⁡θ=−1 m_AB_BC = sinθ/cosθ+1·sinθ/cosθ-1 = sin^2θ/cos^2θ-1 = sin^2θ/-sin^2θ = -1 Note the use of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity sin2⁡θ+cos2⁡θ=1.sin^2θ+cos^2θ=1.
