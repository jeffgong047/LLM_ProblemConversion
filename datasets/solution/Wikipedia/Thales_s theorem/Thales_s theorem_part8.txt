geometry: Figure for the proof of the converse This proof consists of 'completing' the right triangle to form a rectangle and noticing that the center of that rectangle is equidistant from the vertices and so is the center of the circumscribing circle of the original triangle, it utilizes two facts: adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add to 180°) and, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and cross each other in their median point. Let there be a right angle ∠ ABC, r a line parallel to BC passing by A, and s a line parallel to AB passing by C. Let D be the point of intersection of lines r and s. (It has not been proven that D lies on the circle.) The quadrilateral ABCD forms a parallelogram by construction (as opposite sides are parallel). Since in a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary (add to 180°) and ∠ ABC is a right angle (90°) then angles ∠ BAD, ∠ BCD, ∠ ADC are also right (90°); consequently ABCD is a rectangle. Let O be the point of intersection of the diagonals AC and BD. Then the point O, by the second fact above, is equidistant from A, B, and C. And so O is center of the circumscribing circle, and the hypotenuse of the triangle (AC) is a diameter of the circle. Alternate proof of the converse using
