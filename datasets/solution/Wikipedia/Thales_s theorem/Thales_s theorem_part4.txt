proof: The following facts are used: the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180° and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. Provided AC is a diameter, angle at B is constant right (90°). Figure for the proof. Since OA = OB = OC, △OBA and △OBC are isosceles triangles, and by the equality of the base angles of an isosceles triangle, ∠ OBC = ∠ OCB and ∠ OBA = ∠ OAB. Let α = ∠ BAO and β = ∠ OBC. The three internal angles of the ∆ABC triangle are α, (α + β), and β. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to 180°, we have α+(α+β)+β=180∘2α+2β=180∘2(α+β)=180∘∴α+β=90∘.α+(α+β)+β =180^∘ 2α+2β =180^∘ 2(α+β) =180^∘ ∴α+β =90^∘. Q.E.D. Second
