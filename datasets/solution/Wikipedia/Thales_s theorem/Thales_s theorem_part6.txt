proof: Thales's theorem and reflections Let △ABC be a triangle in a circle where AB is a diameter in that circle. Then construct a new triangle △ABD by mirroring △ABC over the line AB and then mirroring it again over the line perpendicular to AB which goes through the center of the circle. Since lines AC and BD are parallel, likewise for AD and CB, the quadrilateral ACBD is a parallelogram. Since lines AB and CD, the diagonals of the parallelogram, are both diameters of the circle and therefore have equal length, the parallelogram must be a rectangle. All angles in a rectangle are right angles.
