geometry: Given a right triangle ABC with hypotenuse AC, construct a circle Ω whose diameter is AC. Let O be the center of Ω. Let D be the intersection of Ω and the ray OB. By Thales's theorem, ∠ ADC is right. But then D must equal B. (If D lies inside △ABC, ∠ ADC would be obtuse, and if D lies outside △ABC, ∠ ADC would be acute.) Proof of the converse using linear
