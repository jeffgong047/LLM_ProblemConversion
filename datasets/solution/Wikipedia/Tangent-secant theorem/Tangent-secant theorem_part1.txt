Geometry theorem relating line segments created by a secant and tangent line Beginning with the alternate segment theorem, ⟹∠PG2T=∠PTG1⟹△PTG2∼△PG1T⟹|PT||PG2|=|PG1||PT|⟹|PT|2=|PG1|⋅|PG2|[ _2T=_1; _2∼_1T; |PT|/|PG_2|=|PG_1|/|PT|; |PT|^2=|PG_1|·|PG_2| ] In Euclidean geometry, the tangent-secant theorem describes the relation of line segments created by a secant and a tangent line with the associated circle. This result is found as Proposition 36 in Book 3 of Euclid's Elements. Given a secant g intersecting the circle at points G1 and G2 and a tangent t intersecting the circle at point T and given that g and t intersect at point P, the following equation holds: |PT|2=|PG1|⋅|PG2||PT|^2=|PG_1|·|PG_2| The tangent-secant theorem can be proven using similar triangles (see graphic). Like the intersecting chords theorem and the intersecting secants theorem, the tangent-secant theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle, namely, the power of point theorem.
