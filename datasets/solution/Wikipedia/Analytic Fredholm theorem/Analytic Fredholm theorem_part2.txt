theorem: Let G ⊆ C be a domain (an open and connected set). Let (H, ⟨ , ⟩) be a real or complex Hilbert space and let Lin(H) denote the space of bounded linear operators from H into itself; let I denote the identity operator. Let B : G → Lin(H) be a mapping such that B is analytic on G in the sense that the limit limλ→λ0B(λ)−B(λ0)λ−λ0lim_λ→λ_0B(λ)-B(λ_0)/λ-λ_0 exists for all λ0 ∈ G; and the operator B(λ) is a compact operator for each λ ∈ G. Then either (I − B(λ))−1 does not exist for any λ ∈ G; or (I − B(λ))−1 exists for every λ ∈ G \ S, where S is a discrete subset of G (i.e., S has no limit points in G). In this case, the function taking λ to (I − B(λ))−1 is analytic on G \ S and, if λ ∈ S, then the equation B(λ)ψ=ψ(λ)ψ=ψ has a finite-dimensional family of solutions.
