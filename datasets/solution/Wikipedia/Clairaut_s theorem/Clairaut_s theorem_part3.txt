Formula: Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:[9][10] g(φ)=Ge[1+(52m−f)sin2⁡φ],(φ)=G_e[1+(5/2m-f)sin^2φ] , where Ge_e is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, m the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and f the flattening of a meridian section of the earth, defined as: f=a−ba,=a-b/a , (where a = semimajor axis, b = semiminor axis). Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.[11] This work was subsequently pursued by Laplace, who relaxed the initial assumption that surfaces of equal density were spheroids.[12] The English mathematician George Stokes showed in 1849[13] that the theorem applied to any law of density so long as the external surface is a spheroid of equilibrium.[14][15] A history of the subject, and more detailed equations for g can be found in Khan.[16] The above expression for g has been supplanted by the Somigliana equation (after Carlo Somigliana).
