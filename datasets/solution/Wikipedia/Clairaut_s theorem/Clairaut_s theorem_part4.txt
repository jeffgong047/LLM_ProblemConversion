Geodesy: See also: Theoretical gravity The spheroidal shape of the Earth is the result of the interplay between gravity and centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation about its axis.[17][18] In his Principia, Newton proposed the equilibrium shape of a homogeneous rotating Earth was a rotational ellipsoid with a flattening f given by 1/230.[19][20] As a result, gravity increases from the equator to the poles. By applying Clairaut's theorem, Laplace found from 15 gravity values that f = 1/330. A modern estimate is 1/298.25642.[21] See Figure of the Earth for more detail. For a detailed account of the construction of the reference Earth model of geodesy, see Chatfield.[22]
