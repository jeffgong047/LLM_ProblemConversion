Theorem: An interval polynomial is stable (i.e. all members of the family are stable) if and only if the four so-called Kharitonov polynomials k1(s)=l0+l1s1+u2s2+u3s3+l4s4+l5s5+⋯_1(s)=l_0+l_1s^1+u_2s^2+u_3s^3+l_4s^4+l_5s^5+⋯ k2(s)=u0+u1s1+l2s2+l3s3+u4s4+u5s5+⋯_2(s)=u_0+u_1s^1+l_2s^2+l_3s^3+u_4s^4+u_5s^5+⋯ k3(s)=l0+u1s1+u2s2+l3s3+l4s4+u5s5+⋯_3(s)=l_0+u_1s^1+u_2s^2+l_3s^3+l_4s^4+u_5s^5+⋯ k4(s)=u0+l1s1+l2s2+u3s3+u4s4+l5s5+⋯_4(s)=u_0+l_1s^1+l_2s^2+u_3s^3+u_4s^4+l_5s^5+⋯ are stable. What is somewhat surprising about Kharitonov's result is that although in principle we are testing an infinite number of polynomials for stability, in fact we need to test only four. This we can do using Routh–Hurwitz or any other method. So it only takes four times more work to be informed about the stability of an interval polynomial than it takes to test one ordinary polynomial for stability. Kharitonov's theorem is useful in the field of robust control, which seeks to design systems that will work well despite uncertainties in component behavior due to measurement errors, changes in operating conditions, equipment wear and so on.
