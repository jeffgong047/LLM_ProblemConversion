Necessary and sufficient condition for a formal language to be regular In the theory of formal languages, the Myhillâ€“Nerode theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be regular. The theorem is named for John Myhill and Anil Nerode, who proved it at the University of Chicago in 1957 (Nerode & Sauer 1957, p. ii).
