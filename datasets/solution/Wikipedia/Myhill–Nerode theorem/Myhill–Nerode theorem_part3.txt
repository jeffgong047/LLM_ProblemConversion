consequences: The Myhill–Nerode theorem may be used to show that a language L is regular by proving that the number of equivalence classes of ∼L∼_L is finite. This may be done by an exhaustive case analysis in which, beginning from the empty string, distinguishing extensions are used to find additional equivalence classes until no more can be found. For example, the language consisting of binary representations of numbers that can be divided by 3 is regular. Given the empty string, 0000 (or 1111), 0101, and 1010 are distinguishing extensions resulting in the three classes (corresponding to numbers that give remainders 0, 1 and 2 when divided by 3), but after this step there is no distinguishing extension anymore. The minimal automaton accepting our language would have three states corresponding to these three equivalence classes. Another immediate corollary of the theorem is that if for a language L the relation ∼L∼_L has infinitely many equivalence classes, it is not regular. It is this corollary that is frequently used to prove that a language is not regular.
