characteristic: One also has a weaker form of this theorem in positive characteristic. Namely, let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0>0. Then it remains true that Hi(G/B,Lλ)=0^i(G/B, L_λ)=0 for all i if λ is a weight such that w∗λ*λ is non-dominant for all w∈W as long as λ is "close to zero".[1] This is known as the Kempf vanishing theorem. However, the other statements of the theorem do not remain valid in this setting. More explicitly, let λ be a dominant integral weight; then it is still true that Hi(G/B,Lλ)=0^i(G/B, L_λ)=0 for all i>0>0, but it is no longer true that this G-module is simple in general, although it does contain the unique highest weight module of highest weight λ as a G-submodule. If λ is an arbitrary integral weight, it is in fact a large unsolved problem in representation theory to describe the cohomology modules Hi(G/B,Lλ)^i(G/B, L_λ) in general. Unlike over Cℂ, Mumford gave an example showing that it need not be the case for a fixed λ that these modules are all zero except in a single degree i. Borel–Weil
