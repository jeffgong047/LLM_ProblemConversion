extensions: For non-abelian extensions the jumps in the upper filtration need not be at integers. Serre gave an example of a totally ramified extension with Galois group the quaternion group Q8 of order 8 with G0 = Q8 G1 = Q8 G2 = Z/2Z G3 = Z/2Z G4 = 1 The upper numbering then satisfies Gn = Q8 for n≤1 Gn = Z/2Z for 1<n≤3/2 Gn = 1 for 3/2<n so has a jump at the non-integral value n=3/2.
