On jumps of upper numbering filtration of the Galois group of a finite Galois extension In mathematics, specifically in local class field theory, the Hasseâ€“Arf theorem is a result concerning jumps of the upper numbering filtration of the Galois group of a finite Galois extension. A special case of it when the residue fields are finite was originally proved by Helmut Hasse,[1][2] and the general result was proved by Cahit Arf.[3][4]
