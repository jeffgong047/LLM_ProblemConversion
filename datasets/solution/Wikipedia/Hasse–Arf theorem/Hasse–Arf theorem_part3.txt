groups: Main article: Ramification group The theorem deals with the upper numbered higher ramification groups of a finite abelian extension L/K. So assume L/K is a finite Galois extension, and that vK is a discrete normalised valuation of K, whose residue field has characteristic p > 0, and which admits a unique extension to L, say w. Denote by vL the associated normalised valuation ew of L and let O𝒪 be the valuation ring of L under vL. Let L/K have Galois group G and define the s-th ramification group of L/K for any real s ≥ −1 by Gs(L/K)=σ∈G:vL(σa−a)≥s+1foralla∈O._s(L/K)={σ : v_L(-a)+1foralla∈𝒪}. So, for example, G−1 is the Galois group G. To pass to the upper numbering one has to define the function ψL/K which in turn is the inverse of the function ηL/K defined by ηL/K(s)=∫0sdx|G0:Gx|.η_L/K(s)=∫_0^sdx/|G_0:G_x|. The upper numbering of the ramification groups is then defined by Gt(L/K) = Gs(L/K) where s = ψL/K(t). These higher ramification groups Gt(L/K) are defined for any real t ≥ −1, but since vL is a discrete valuation, the groups will change in discrete jumps and not continuously. Thus we say that t is a jump of the filtration {Gt(L/K) : t ≥ −1} if Gt(L/K) ≠ Gu(L/K) for any u > t. The Hasse–Arf theorem tells us the arithmetic nature of these jumps. Statement of the
