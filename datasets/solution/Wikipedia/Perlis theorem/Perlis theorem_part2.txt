graphs: Two graphs are called cospectral or isospectral if the adjacency matrices of the graphs are isospectral, that is, if the adjacency matrices have equal multisets of eigenvalues. Two cospectral enneahedra, the smallest possible cospectral polyhedral graphs Cospectral graphs need not be isomorphic, but isomorphic graphs are always cospectral. Graphs determined by their
