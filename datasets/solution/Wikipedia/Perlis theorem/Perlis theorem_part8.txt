inequality: When the graph G is d-regular, there is a relationship between h(G) and the spectral gap d − λ2 of G. An inequality due to Dodziuk[9] and independently Alon and Milman[10] states that[11] 12(d−λ2)≤h(G)≤2d(d−λ2).1/2(d-λ_2)(G)≤√(2d(d-λ_2)). This inequality is closely related to the Cheeger bound for Markov chains and can be seen as a discrete version of Cheeger's inequality in Riemannian geometry. For general connected graphs that are not necessarily regular, an alternative inequality is given by Chung[12]: 35 12λ≤h(G)≤2λ,1/2λ≤𝐡(G)≤√(2λ), where λλ is the least nontrivial eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian, and h(G)𝐡(G) is the (normalized) Cheeger constant h(G)=min∅≠S⊂V(G)|∂(S)|min(vol(S),vol(S¯))𝐡(G)=min_∅≠S(G)|∂(S)|/min(vol(S),vol(S̅)) where vol(Y)vol(Y) is the sum of degrees of vertices in Y.
