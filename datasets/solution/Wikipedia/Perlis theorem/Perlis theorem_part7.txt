constant: Main article: Cheeger constant (graph theory) The Cheeger constant (also Cheeger number or isoperimetric number) of a graph is a numerical measure of whether or not a graph has a "bottleneck". The Cheeger constant as a measure of "bottleneckedness" is of great interest in many areas: for example, constructing well-connected networks of computers, card shuffling, and low-dimensional topology (in particular, the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds). More formally, the Cheeger constant h(G) of a graph G on n vertices is defined as h(G)=min0<|S|≤n2|∂(S)||S|,(G)=min_0<|S|≤n/2|∂(S)|/|S|, where the minimum is over all nonempty sets S of at most n/2 vertices and ∂(S) is the edge boundary of S, i.e., the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in S.[8] Cheeger
