graphs: Almost all trees are cospectral, i.e., as the number of vertices grows, the fraction of trees for which there exists a cospectral tree goes to 1.[4] A pair of regular graphs are cospectral if and only if their complements are cospectral.[5] A pair of distance-regular graphs are cospectral if and only if they have the same intersection array. Cospectral graphs can also be constructed by means of the Sunada method.[6] Another important source of cospectral graphs are the point-collinearity graphs and the line-intersection graphs of point-line geometries. These graphs are always cospectral but are often non-isomorphic.[7] Cheeger
