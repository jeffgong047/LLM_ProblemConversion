inequality: There is an eigenvalue bound for independent sets in regular graphs, originally due to Alan J. Hoffman and Philippe Delsarte.[13] Suppose that G is a k-regular graph on n vertices with least eigenvalue λminλ_min. Then:α(G)≤n1−kλminα(G)≤n/1-k/λ_minwhere α(G)α(G) denotes its independence number. This bound has been applied to establish e.g. algebraic proofs of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem and its analogue for intersecting families of subspaces over finite fields.[14] For general graphs which are not necessarily regular, a similar upper bound for the independence number can be derived by using the maximum eigenvalue λmax′λ'_max of the normalized Laplacian[12] of G: α(G)≤n(1−1λmax′)maxdegmindegα(G)(1-1/λ'_max)maxdeg/mindeg where maxdegmaxdeg and mindegmindeg denote the maximum and minimum degree in G, respectively. This a consequence of a more general inequality (pp. 109 in [12]): vol(X)≤(1−1λmax′)vol(V(G))vol(X)≤(1-1/λ'_max)vol(V(G)) where X is an independent set of vertices and vol(Y)vol(Y) denotes the sum of degrees of vertices in Y .
