mates: A pair of graphs are said to be cospectral mates if they have the same spectrum, but are non-isomorphic. The smallest pair of cospectral mates is {K1,4, C4 âˆª K1}, comprising the 5-vertex star and the graph union of the 4-vertex cycle and the single-vertex graph, as reported by Collatz and Sinogowitz[1][2] in 1957. The smallest pair of polyhedral cospectral mates are enneahedra with eight vertices each.[3] Finding cospectral
