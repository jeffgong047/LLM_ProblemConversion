Derivation: Working in Cartesian coordinates, the moment of inertia of the planar body about the z axis is given by:[3] Iz=∫(x2+y2)dm=∫x2dm+∫y2dm=Iy+Ix_z=∫(x^2+y^2) dm=^2 dm+^2 dm=I_y+I_x On the plane, z=0=0, so these two terms are the moments of inertia about the x and y axes respectively, giving the perpendicular axis theorem. The converse of this theorem is also derived similarly. Note that ∫x2dm=Iy≠Ix^2 dm=I_y_x because in ∫r2dm^2 dm, r measures the distance from the axis of rotation, so for a y-axis rotation, deviation distance from the axis of rotation of a point is equal to its x coordinate.
