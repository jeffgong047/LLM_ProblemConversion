Proof: Fix a point ξ=σ+iτξ=σ+iτ inside ΩΩ. Choose λ>−y0λ>-y_0, an integer N>A>A and y1>τ_1>τ large enough such that By1A(y1+λ)N≤M(y0+λ)NBy_1^A/(y_1+λ)^N≤M/(y_0+λ)^N. Applying maximum modulus principle to the function g(z)=f(z)(z+iλ)N(z)=f(z)/(z+iλ)^N and the rectangular area z∈C∣x1≤Re(z)≤x2andy0≤Im(z)≤y1{z∈ℂ_1≤Re(z)_2{and_0≤Im(z)_1} we obtain |g(ξ)|≤M(y0+λ)N|g(ξ)|≤M/(y_0+λ)^N, that is, |f(ξ)|≤M(|ξ+λ|y0+λ)N|f(ξ)|(|ξ+λ|/y_0+λ)^N. Letting λ→+∞λ→+∞ yields |f(ξ)|≤M|f(ξ)| as required.
