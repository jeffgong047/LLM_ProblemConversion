theorem: Let ΩΩ be a half-strip in the complex plane: Ω=z∈C|x1≤Re(z)≤x2andIm(z)≥y0⊊C.Ω={z∈ℂ|x_1≤Re(z)_2{and mathrmIm(z)_0}⊊ℂ. Suppose that f is holomorphic (i.e. analytic) on ΩΩ and that there are constants M, A, and B such that |f(z)|≤Mforallz∈∂Ω|f(z)|{forall∈∂Ω and |f(x+iy)|≤ByAforallx+iy∈Ω.|f(x+iy)|^A{forall+iy∈Ω. Then f is bounded by M on all of ΩΩ: |f(z)|≤Mforallz∈Ω.|f(z)|{forall∈Ω.
