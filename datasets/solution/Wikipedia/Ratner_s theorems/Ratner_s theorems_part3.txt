SL2(R)_2(ℝ): The simplest case to which the statement above applies is G=SL2(R)=SL_2(ℝ). In this case it takes the following more explicit form; let ΓΓ be a lattice in SL2(R)_2(ℝ) and F⊂Γ∖G⊂Γ a closed subset which is invariant under all maps Γg↦Γ(gut)↦Γ(gu_t) where ut=(1t01)_t=[ 1 t; 0 1 ]. Then either there exists an x∈Γ∖G∈Γ such that F=xU=xU (where U=ut,t∈R={u_t,t∈ℝ}) or F=Γ∖G=Γ. In geometric terms ΓΓ is a cofinite Fuchsian group, so the quotient M=Γ∖H2=Γ\ℍ^2 of the hyperbolic plane by ΓΓ is a hyperbolic orbifold of finite volume. The theorem above implies that every horocycle of H2ℍ^2 has an image in M which is either a closed curve (a horocycle around a cusp of M) or dense in M. See
