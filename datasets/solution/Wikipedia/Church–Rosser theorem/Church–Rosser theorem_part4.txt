Proof: For β-reduction, one proof method originates from William W. Tait and Per Martin-Löf.[5] Say that a binary relation →→ satisfies the diamond property if: ∀M,N1,N2∈Λ:ifM→N1andM→N2then∃X∈Λ:N1→XandN2→X,N_1,N_2∈Λ:if_1{and_2{then existsX∈Λ:N_1{and_2 Then the Church–Rosser property is the statement that ↠β↠_β satisfies the diamond property. We introduce a new reduction →‖→_ whose reflexive transitive closure is ↠β↠_β and which satisfies the diamond property. By induction on the number of steps in the reduction, it thus follows that ↠β↠_β satisfies the diamond property. The relation →‖→_ has the formation rules: M→‖M→_M If M→‖M′→_M' and N→‖N′→_N' then λx.M→‖λx.M′.M→_.M' and MN→‖M′N′→_M'N' and (λx.M)N→‖M′[x:=N′](.M)N→_M'[x:=N'] The η-reduction rule can be proved to be Church–Rosser directly. Then, it can be proved that β-reduction and η-reduction commute in the sense that:[6] If M→βN1→_βN_1 and M→ηN2→_ηN_2 then there exists a term X such that N1→ηX_1→_ηX and N2→βX_2→_βX. Hence we can conclude that βη-reduction is Church–Rosser.[7]
