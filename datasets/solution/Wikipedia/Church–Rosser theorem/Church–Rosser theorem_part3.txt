calculus: One type of reduction in the pure untyped lambda calculus for which the Church–Rosser theorem applies is β-reduction, in which a subterm of the form (λx.t)s(.t)s is contracted by the substitution t[x:=s][x:=s]. If β-reduction is denoted by →β→_β and its reflexive, transitive closure by ↠β↠_β then the Church–Rosser theorem is that:[3] ∀M,N1,N2∈Λ:ifM↠βN1andM↠βN2then∃X∈Λ:N1↠βXandN2↠βX,N_1,N_2∈Λ:if↠_βN_1{and↠_βN_2{then existsX∈Λ:N_1↠_βX{and_2↠_βX A consequence of this property is that two terms equal in λβλβ must reduce to a common term:[4] ∀M,N∈Λ:ifλβ⊢M=Nthen∃X:M↠βXandN↠βX,N∈Λ:if lambdaβ=N{then existsX:M↠_βX{and↠_βX The theorem also applies to η-reduction, in which a subterm λx.Sx.Sx is replaced by S. It also applies to βη-reduction, the union of the two reduction rules.
