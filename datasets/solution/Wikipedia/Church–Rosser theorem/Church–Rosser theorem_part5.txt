Normalisation: A reduction rule that satisfies the Church–Rosser property has the property that every term M can have at most one distinct normal form, as follows: if X and Y are normal forms of M then by the Church–Rosser property, they both reduce to an equal term Z. Both terms are already normal forms so X=Z=Y=Z=Y.[4] If a reduction is strongly normalising (there are no infinite reduction paths) then a weak form of the Church–Rosser property implies the full property (see Newman's lemma). The weak property, for a relation →→, is:[8] ∀M,N1,N2∈Λ:,N_1,N_2∈Λ: if M→N1_1 and M→N2_2 then there exists a term X such that N1↠X_1 and N2↠X_2.
