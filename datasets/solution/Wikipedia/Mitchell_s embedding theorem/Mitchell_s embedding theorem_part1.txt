Abelian categories, while abstractly defined, are in fact concrete categories of modules Mitchell's embedding theorem, also known as the Freydâ€“Mitchell theorem or the full embedding theorem, is a result about abelian categories; it essentially states that these categories, while rather abstractly defined, are in fact concrete categories of modules. This allows one to use element-wise diagram chasing proofs in these categories. The theorem is named after Barry Mitchell and Peter Freyd.
