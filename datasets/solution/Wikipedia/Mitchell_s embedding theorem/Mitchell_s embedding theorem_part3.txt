proof: Let L⊂Fun⁡(A,Ab)ℒ⊂Fun(𝒜,Ab) be the category of left exact functors from the abelian category A𝒜 to the category of abelian groups Ab. First we construct a contravariant embedding H:A→L:𝒜→ℒ by H(A)=hA(A)=h^A for all A∈A∈𝒜, where hA^A is the covariant hom-functor, hA(X)=HomA⁡(A,X)^A(X)=Hom_𝒜(A,X). The Yoneda Lemma states that H is fully faithful and we also get the left exactness of H very easily because hA^A is already left exact. The proof of the right exactness of H is harder and can be read in Swan, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 76. After that we prove that Lℒ is an abelian category by using localization theory (also Swan). This is the hard part of the proof. It is easy to check that the abelian category Lℒ is an AB5 category with a generator ⨁A∈AhA⊕_A∈𝒜h^A. In other words it is a Grothendieck category and therefore has an injective cogenerator I. The endomorphism ring R:=HomL⁡(I,I):=Hom_ℒ(I,I) is the ring we need for the category of R-modules. By G(B)=HomL⁡(B,I)(B)=Hom_ℒ(B,I) we get another contravariant, exact and fully faithful embedding G:L→R-Mod.:ℒ-Mod. The composition GH:A→R-Mod:𝒜-Mod is the desired covariant exact and fully faithful embedding. Note that the proof of the Gabriel–Quillen embedding theorem for exact categories is almost identical.
