theorem: Let f be a univalent function on D with f(0) = 0. By Nevanlinna's criterion, f is starlike on |z| < r if and only if ℜzf′(z)f(z)≥0zf^'(z)(z)≥0 for |z| < r. Equivalently |arg⁡zf′(z)f(z)|≤π2.|zf^'(z)(z)|≤π2. On the other hand by the inequality of Grunsky above, |arg⁡zf′(z)f(z)|≤log⁡1+|z|1−|z|.|zf^'(z)(z)|≤log1+|z|1-|z|. Thus if log⁡1+|z|1−|z|≤π2,log1+|z|1-|z|≤π2, the inequality holds at z. This condition is equivalent to |z|≤tanh⁡π4|z|≤tanhπ4 and hence f is starlike on any disk |z| < r with r ≤ tanh π/4.
