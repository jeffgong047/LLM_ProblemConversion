Proof: Grunsky (1932) originally proved these inequalities based on extremal techniques of Ludwig Bieberbach. Subsequent proofs, outlined in Goluzin (1939), relied on the Loewner equation. More elementary proofs were subsequently given based on Goluzin's inequalities, an equivalent form of Grunsky's inequalities (1939) for the Grunsky matrix. For a univalent function g in z > 1 with an expansion g(z)=z+b1z−1+b2z−2+⋯.(z)=z+b_1z^-1+b_2z^-2+⋯. Goluzin's inequalities state that |∑i=1n∑j=1nλiλjlog⁡g(zi)−g(zj)zi−zj|≤∑i=1n∑j=1nλiλj¯log⁡zizj¯zizj¯−1,|∑_i=1^n∑_j=1^nλ_iλ_jlogg(z_i)-g(z_j)_i-z_j|≤∑_i=1^n∑_j=1^nλ_iλ_jlogz_iz_j_iz_j-1, where the zi are distinct points with |zi| > 1 and λi are arbitrary complex numbers. Taking n = 2. with λ1 = – λ2 = λ, the inequality implies |log⁡g′(ζ)g′(η)(ζ−η)2(g(ζ)−g(η))2|≤log⁡|1−ζη¯|2(|ζ|2−1)(|η|2−1).|logg^'(ζ)g^'(η)(ζ-η)^2(g(ζ)-g(η))^2|≤log|1-ζη|^2(|ζ|^2-1)(|η|^2-1). If g is an odd function and η = – ζ, this yields |log⁡ζg′(ζ)g(ζ)|≤|ζ|2+1|ζ|2−1.|log^'(ζ)(ζ)|≤|ζ|^2+1|ζ|^2-1. Finally if f is any normalized univalent function in D, the required inequality for f follows by taking g(ζ)=f(ζ−2)−12(ζ)=f(ζ^-2)^-12 with z=ζ−2.=ζ^-2. Proof of the
