Grunsky: If f(z) is univalent on D with f(0) = 0, then |log⁡zf′(z)f(z)|≤log⁡1+|z|1−|z|.|logzf^'(z)(z)|≤log1+|z|1-|z|. Taking the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm, this implies the two inequalities |zf′(z)f(z)|≤1+|z|1−|z||zf^'(z)(z)|≤1+|z|1-|z| and |arg⁡zf′(z)f(z)|≤log⁡1+|z|1−|z|.|zf^'(z)(z)|≤log1+|z|1-|z|. For fixed z, both these equalities are attained by suitable Koebe functions gw(ζ)=ζ(1−w¯ζ)2,_w(ζ)=ζ(1-wζ)^2, where |w| = 1.
