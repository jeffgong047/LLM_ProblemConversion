duality: If we take N=1 chiral super QCD with Nc colors and Nf flavors with Nf−2≥Nc>23Nf_f-2_c>2/3N_f, then by the Seiberg duality, this theory is dual to a nonabelian SU(Nf−Nc)(N_f-N_c) gauge theory which is trivial (i.e. free) in the infrared limit. As such, the dual theory doesn't suffer from any infraparticle problem or a continuous mass spectrum. Despite this, the dual theory is still a nonabelian Yang–Mills theory. Because of this, the dual magnetic current still suffers from all the same problems even though it is an "emergent current". Free theories aren't exempt from the Weinberg–Witten theorem.
