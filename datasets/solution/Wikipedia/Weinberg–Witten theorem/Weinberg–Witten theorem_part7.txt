theories: There are a number of ways to see why nonabelian Yang–Mills theories in the Coulomb phase don't violate this theorem. Yang–Mills theories don't have any conserved 4-current associated with the Yang–Mills charges that are both Poincaré covariant and gauge invariant. Noether's theorem gives a current which is conserved and Poincaré covariant, but not gauge invariant. As |p> is really an element of the BRST cohomology, i.e. a quotient space, it is really an equivalence class of states. As such, ⟨p′|J|p⟩'|J|p⟩ is only well defined if J is BRST-closed. But if J isn't gauge-invariant, then J isn't BRST-closed in general. The current defined as Jμ(x)≡δδAμ(x)Smatter^μ(x)≡δ/_μ(x)S_matter is not conserved because it satisfies DμJμ=0_μJ^μ=0 instead of ∂μJμ=0∂_μJ^μ=0 where D is the covariant derivative. The current defined after a gauge-fixing like the Coulomb gauge is conserved but isn't Lorentz covariant. Spontaneously broken gauge
