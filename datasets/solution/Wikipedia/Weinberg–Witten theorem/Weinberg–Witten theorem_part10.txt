relativity: In GR, we have diffeomorphisms and A|ψ> (over an element |ψ> of the BRST cohomology) only makes sense if A is BRST-closed. There are no local BRST-closed operators and this includes any stress–energy tensor that we can think of. As an alternate explanation, note that the stress tensor for pure GR vanishes (this statement is equivalent to the vacuum Einstein equation) and the stress tensor for GR coupled to matter is just the matter stress tensor. The latter is not conserved, ∂μTμνmatter≠0∂^μT_μν^matter≠0, but rather ∇μTμνmatter=0∇^μT_μν^matter=0 where ∇μ∇^μ is the covariant derivative. Induced
