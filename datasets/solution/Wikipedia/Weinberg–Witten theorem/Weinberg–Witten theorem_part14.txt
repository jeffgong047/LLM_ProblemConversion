Infraparticles: Two otherwise identical charged infraparticles moving with different velocities belong to different superselection sectors. Let's say they have momenta p′ and p respectively. Then as Jμ(0) is a local neutral operator, it does not map between different superselection sectors. So, <p′|Jμ(0)|p><p'|J^μ(0)|p> is zero. The only way |p′'> and |p> can belong in the same sector is if they have the same velocity, which means that they are proportional to each other, i.e. a null or zero momentum transfer, which isn't covered in the proof. So, infraparticles violate the continuity assumption ⟨p|J0(0)|p⟩=limp′→p⟨p′|J0(0)|p⟩|J^0(0)|p⟩=lim_p''|J^0(0)|p⟩ This doesn't mean of course that the momentum of a charge particle can't change by some spacelike momentum. It only means that if the incoming state is a one infraparticle state, then the outgoing state contains an infraparticle together with a number of soft quanta. This is nothing other than the inevitable bremsstrahlung. But this also means that the outgoing state isn't a one particle state. Theories with nonlocal
