Theorem: Weinberg and Witten proved two separate results. According to them, the first is due to Sidney Coleman, who did not publish it: A 3 + 1D QFT (quantum field theory) with a conserved 4-vector current Jμ^μ (see four-current) which is Poincaré covariant (and gauge invariant if there happens to be any gauge symmetry which hasn't been gauge-fixed) does not admit massless particles with helicity |h| > 1/2 that also have nonzero charges associated with the conserved current in question. A 3 + 1D QFT with a non-zero conserved stress–energy tensor Tμν^μν which is Poincaré covariant (and gauge invariant if there happens to be any gauge symmetry which hasn't been gauge-fixed) does not admit massless particles with helicity |h| > 1.
