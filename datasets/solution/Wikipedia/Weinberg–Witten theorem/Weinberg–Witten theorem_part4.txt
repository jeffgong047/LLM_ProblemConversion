proof: The conserved charge Q is given by ∫d3xJ0^3x J^0. We shall consider the matrix elements of the charge and of the current Jμ^μ for one-particle asymptotic states, of equal helicity, |p⟩|p⟩ and |p′⟩|p'⟩, labeled by their lightlike 4-momenta. We shall consider the case in which (p−p′)(p-p') isn't null, which means that the momentum transfer is spacelike. Let q be the eigenvalue of those states for the charge operator Q, so that: qδ3(p→′−p→)=⟨p′|Q|p⟩=∫d3x⟨p′|J0(x→,0)|p⟩=∫d3x⟨p′|e−iP→⋅x→J0(0,0)eiP→⋅x→|p⟩=∫d3xei(p→−p→′)⋅x→⟨p′|J0(0,0)|p⟩=(2π)3δ3(p→′−p→)⟨p′|J0(0,0)|p⟩qδ^3(p⃗'-p⃗)='|Q|p⟩ =^3x '|J^0(x⃗,0)|p⟩ =^3x '|e^-iP⃗·x⃗J^0(0,0)e^iP⃗·x⃗|p⟩ =^3x e^i(p⃗-p⃗')·x⃗'|J^0(0,0)|p⟩=(2π)^3δ^3(p⃗'-p⃗)'|J^0(0,0)|p⟩ where we have now made used of translational covariance, which is part of the Poincaré covariance. Thus: ⟨p′|J0(0)|p⟩=q(2π)3'|J^0(0)|p⟩=q/(2π)^3 with q≠0≠0. Let's transform to a reference frame where p moves along the positive z-axis and p′ moves along the negative z-axis. This is always possible for any spacelike momentum transfer. In this reference frame, ⟨p′|J0(0)|p⟩'|J^0(0)|p⟩ and ⟨p′|J3(0)|p⟩'|J^3(0)|p⟩ change by the phase factor ei(h−(−h))θ=e2ihθ^i(h-(-h))θ=e^2ihθ under rotations by θ counterclockwise about the z-axis whereas ⟨p′|J1(0)+iJ2(0)|p⟩'|J^1(0)+iJ^2(0)|p⟩ and ⟨p′|J1(0)−iJ2(0)|p⟩'|J^1(0)-iJ^2(0)|p⟩ change by the phase factors ei(2h+1)θ^i(2h+1)θ and ei(2h−1)θ^i(2h-1)θ respectively. If h is nonzero, we need to specify the phases of states. In general, this can't be done in a Lorentz-invariant way (see Thomas precession), but the one particle Hilbert space is Lorentz-covariant. So, if we make any arbitrary but fixed choice for the phases, then each of the matrix components in the previous paragraph has to be invariant under the rotations about the z-axis. So, unless |h| = 0 or 1/2, all of the components have to be zero. Weinberg and Witten did not assume the continuity ⟨p|J0(0)|p⟩=limp′→p⟨p′|J0(0)|p⟩|J^0(0)|p⟩=lim_p''|J^0(0)|p⟩. Rather, the authors argue that the physical (i.e., the measurable) quantum numbers of a massless particle are always defined by the matrix elements in the limit of zero momentum, defined for a sequence of spacelike momentum transfers. Also, δ3(p→′−p→)δ^3(p⃗'-p⃗) in the first equation can be replaced by "smeared out" Dirac delta function, which corresponds to performing the d3x^3x volume integral over a finite box. The proof of the second part of theorem is completely analogous, replacing the matrix elements of the current with the matrix elements of the stress–energy tensor Tμν^μν: pμ=∫d3xTμ0(x→,0)^μ=^3x T^μ0(x⃗,0) and ⟨p|T00(0)|p⟩=E(2π)3|T^00(0)|p⟩=E/(2π)^3 with E≠0≠0. For spacelike momentum transfers, we can go to the reference frame where p′ + p is along the t-axis and p′ − p is along the z-axis. In this reference frame, the components of ⟨p′|T(0)|p⟩'|𝐓(0)|p⟩ transforms as ei(2h−2)θ^i(2h-2)θ, ei(2h−1)θ^i(2h-1)θ,ei(2h)θ^i(2h)θ, ei(2h+1)θ^i(2h+1)θ or ei(2h+2)θ^i(2h+2)θ under a rotation by θ about the z-axis. Similarly, we can conclude that |h|=0,12,1|h|=0,1/2,1 Note that this theorem also applies to free field theories. If they contain massless particles with the "wrong" helicity/charge, they have to be gauge theories. Ruling out emergent
