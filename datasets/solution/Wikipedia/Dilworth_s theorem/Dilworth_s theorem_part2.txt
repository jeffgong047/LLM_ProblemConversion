proof: The following proof by induction on the size of the partially ordered set P is based on that of Galvin (1994). Let P be a finite partially ordered set. The theorem holds trivially if P is empty. So, assume that P has at least one element, and let a be a maximal element of P. By induction, we assume that for some integer k the partially ordered set P′:=P∖a':=P∖{a} can be covered by k disjoint chains C1,…,Ck_1,…,C_k and has at least one antichain A0_0 of size k. Clearly, A0∩Ci≠∅_0_i≠∅ for i=1,2,…,k=1,2,…,k. For i=1,2,…,k=1,2,…,k, let xi_i be the maximal element in Ci_i that belongs to an antichain of size k in P′', and set A:=x1,x2,…,xk:={x_1,x_2,…,x_k}. We claim that A is an antichain. Let Ai_i be an antichain of size k that contains xi_i. Fix arbitrary distinct indices i and j. Then Ai∩Cj≠∅_i_j≠∅. Let y∈Ai∩Cj_i_j. Then y≤xj_j, by the definition of xj_j. This implies that xi≱xj_i_j, since xi≱y_i. By interchanging the roles of i and j in this argument we also have xj≱xi_j_i. This verifies that A is an antichain. We now return to P. Suppose first that a≥xi_i for some i∈1,2,…,k∈{1,2,…,k}. Let K be the chain a∪z∈Ci:z≤xi{a}∪{z_i:z_i}. Then by the choice of xi_i, P∖K does not have an antichain of size k. Induction then implies that P∖K can be covered by k−1-1 disjoint chains since A∖xi∖{x_i} is an antichain of size k−1-1 in P∖K. Thus, P can be covered by k disjoint chains, as required. Next, if a≱xi_i for each i∈1,2,…,k∈{1,2,…,k}, then A∪a∪{a} is an antichain of size k+1+1 in P (since a is maximal in P). Now P can be covered by the k+1+1 chains a,C1,C2,…,Ck{a},C_1,C_2,…,C_k, completing the proof. Proof via Kőnig's
