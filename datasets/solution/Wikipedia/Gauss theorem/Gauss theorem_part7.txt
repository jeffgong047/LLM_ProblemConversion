boundary: We are going to prove the following: Theorem — Let Ω¯Ω be a C2^2 compact manifold with boundary with C1^1 metric tensor g. Let ΩΩ denote the manifold interior of Ω¯Ω and let ∂Ω∂Ω denote the manifold boundary of Ω¯Ω. Let (⋅,⋅)(·,·) denote L2(Ω¯)^2(Ω) inner products of functions and ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ denote inner products of vectors. Suppose u∈C1(Ω¯,R)^1(Ω,ℝ) and X is a C1^1 vector field on Ω¯Ω. Then (grad⁡u,X)=−(u,div⁡X)+∫∂Ωu⟨X,N⟩dS,(gradu,X)=-(u,divX)+∫_∂Ωu,N⟩ dS, where N is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to ∂Ω∂Ω. Proof of Theorem. [9] We use the Einstein summation convention. By using a partition of unity, we may assume that u and X have compact support in a coordinate patch O⊂Ω¯⊂Ω. First consider the case where the patch is disjoint from ∂Ω∂Ω. Then O is identified with an open subset of Rnℝ^n and integration by parts produces no boundary terms: (grad⁡u,X)=∫O⟨grad⁡u,X⟩gdx=∫O∂juXjgdx=−∫Ou∂j(gXj)dx=−∫Ou1g∂j(gXj)gdx=(u,−1g∂j(gXj))=(u,−div⁡X).(gradu,X) =∫_O⟨gradu,X⟩√(g) dx =∫_O∂_juX^j√(g) dx =-∫_Ou∂_j(√(g)X^j) dx =-∫_Ou1/√(g)∂_j(√(g)X^j)√(g) dx =(u,-1/√(g)∂_j(√(g)X^j)) =(u,-divX). In the last equality we used the Voss-Weyl coordinate formula for the divergence, although the preceding identity could be used to define −div-div as the formal adjoint of gradgrad. Now suppose O intersects ∂Ω∂Ω. Then O is identified with an open set in R+n=x∈Rn:xn≥0ℝ_+^n={x∈ℝ^n:x_n≥0}. We zero extend u and X to R+nℝ_+^n and perform integration by parts to obtain (grad⁡u,X)=∫O⟨grad⁡u,X⟩gdx=∫R+n∂juXjgdx=(u,−div⁡X)−∫Rn−1u(x′,0)Xn(x′,0)g(x′,0)dx′,(gradu,X) =∫_O⟨gradu,X⟩√(g) dx =∫_ℝ_+^n∂_juX^j√(g) dx =(u,-divX)-∫_ℝ^n-1u(x',0)X^n(x',0)√(g(x',0)) dx', where dx′=dx1…dxn−1'=dx_1_n-1. By a variant of the straightening theorem for vector fields, we may choose O so that ∂∂xn∂/_n is the inward unit normal −N-N at ∂Ω∂Ω. In this case g(x′,0)dx′=g∂Ω(x′)dx′=dS√(g(x',0)) dx'=√(g_∂Ω(x')) dx'=dS is the volume element on ∂Ω∂Ω and the above formula reads (grad⁡u,X)=(u,−div⁡X)+∫∂Ωu⟨X,N⟩dS.(gradu,X)=(u,-divX)+∫_∂Ωu,N⟩ dS. This completes the proof.
