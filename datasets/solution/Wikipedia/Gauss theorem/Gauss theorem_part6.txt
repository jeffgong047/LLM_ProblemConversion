space: We are going to prove the following: Theorem — Let Ω⊂RnΩ⊂ℝ^n be open and bounded with C1^1 boundary. If u is C1^1 on an open neighborhood O of Ω¯Ω, that is, u∈C1(O)^1(O), then for each i∈1,…,n∈{1,…,n}, ∫ΩuxidV=∫∂ΩuνidS,∫_Ωu_x_i dV=∫_∂Ωuν_i dS, where ν:∂Ω→Rnν:∂Ω→ℝ^n is the outward pointing unit normal vector to ∂Ω∂Ω. Equivalently, ∫Ω∇udV=∫∂ΩuνdS.∫_Ω dV=∫_∂Ωuν dS. Proof of Theorem. [8] (1) The first step is to reduce to the case where u∈Cc1(Rn)_c^1(ℝ^n). Pick ϕ∈Cc∞(O)ϕ_c^∞(O) such that ϕ=1ϕ=1 on Ω¯Ω. Note that ϕu∈Cc1(O)⊂Cc1(Rn)_c^1(O)_c^1(ℝ^n) and ϕu=u=u on Ω¯Ω. Hence it suffices to prove the theorem for ϕu. Hence we may assume that u∈Cc1(Rn)_c^1(ℝ^n). (2) Let x0∈∂Ω_0∈∂Ω be arbitrary. The assumption that Ω¯Ω has C1^1 boundary means that there is an open neighborhood U of x0_0 in Rnℝ^n such that ∂Ω∩U∂Ω is the graph of a C1^1 function with Ω∩UΩ lying on one side of this graph. More precisely, this means that after a translation and rotation of ΩΩ, there are r>0>0 and h>0>0 and a C1^1 function g:Rn−1→R:ℝ^n-1→ℝ, such that with the notation x′=(x1,…,xn−1),'=(x_1,…,x_n-1), it holds that U=x∈Rn:|x′|<rand|xn−g(x′)|<h={x∈ℝ^n:|x'|<rand|x_n-g(x')|<h} and for x∈U, xn=g(x′)⟹x∈∂Ω,−h<xn−g(x′)<0⟹x∈Ω,0<xn−g(x′)<h⟹x∉Ω.x_n=g(x') ∈∂Ω, -h<x_n-g(x')<0 ∈Ω, 0<x_n-g(x')<h ∉Ω. Since ∂Ω∂Ω is compact, we can cover ∂Ω∂Ω with finitely many neighborhoods U1,…,UN_1,…,U_N of the above form. Note that Ω,U1,…,UN{Ω,U_1,…,U_N} is an open cover of Ω¯=Ω∪∂ΩΩ=Ω∪∂Ω. By using a C∞^∞ partition of unity subordinate to this cover, it suffices to prove the theorem in the case where either u has compact support in ΩΩ or u has compact support in some Uj_j. If u has compact support in ΩΩ, then for all i∈1,…,n∈{1,…,n}, ∫ΩuxidV=∫RnuxidV=∫Rn−1∫−∞∞uxi(x)dxidx′=0∫_Ωu_x_i dV=∫_ℝ^nu_x_i dV=∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^∞u_x_i(x) dx_i dx'=0 by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and ∫∂ΩuνidS=0∫_∂Ωuν_i dS=0 since u vanishes on a neighborhood of ∂Ω∂Ω. Thus the theorem holds for u with compact support in ΩΩ. Thus we have reduced to the case where u has compact support in some Uj_j. (3) So assume u has compact support in some Uj_j. The last step now is to show that the theorem is true by direct computation. Change notation to U=Uj=U_j, and bring in the notation from (2) used to describe U. Note that this means that we have rotated and translated ΩΩ. This is a valid reduction since the theorem is invariant under rotations and translations of coordinates. Since u(x)=0(x)=0 for |x′|≥r|x'| and for |xn−g(x′)|≥h|x_n-g(x')|, we have for each i∈1,…,n∈{1,…,n} that ∫ΩuxidV=∫|x′|<r∫g(x′)−hg(x′)uxi(x′,xn)dxndx′=∫Rn−1∫−∞g(x′)uxi(x′,xn)dxndx′.∫_Ωu_x_i dV =∫_|x'|<r∫_g(x')-h^g(x')u_x_i(x',x_n) dx_n dx' =∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^g(x')u_x_i(x',x_n) dx_n dx'. For i=n=n we have by the fundamental theorem of calculus that ∫Rn−1∫−∞g(x′)uxn(x′,xn)dxndx′=∫Rn−1u(x′,g(x′))dx′.∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^g(x')u_x_n(x',x_n) dx_n dx'=∫_ℝ^n-1u(x',g(x')) dx'. Now fix i∈1,…,n−1∈{1,…,n-1}. Note that ∫Rn−1∫−∞g(x′)uxi(x′,xn)dxndx′=∫Rn−1∫−∞0uxi(x′,g(x′)+s)dsdx′∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^g(x')u_x_i(x',x_n) dx_n dx'=∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^0u_x_i(x',g(x')+s) ds dx' Define v:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ by v(x′,s)=u(x′,g(x′)+s)(x',s)=u(x',g(x')+s). By the chain rule, vxi(x′,s)=uxi(x′,g(x′)+s)+uxn(x′,g(x′)+s)gxi(x′)._x_i(x',s)=u_x_i(x',g(x')+s)+u_x_n(x',g(x')+s)g_x_i(x'). But since v has compact support, we can integrate out dxi_i first to deduce that ∫Rn−1∫−∞0vxi(x′,s)dsdx′=0.∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^0v_x_i(x',s) ds dx'=0. Thus ∫Rn−1∫−∞0uxi(x′,g(x′)+s)dsdx′=∫Rn−1∫−∞0−uxn(x′,g(x′)+s)gxi(x′)dsdx′=∫Rn−1−u(x′,g(x′))gxi(x′)dx′.∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^0u_x_i(x',g(x')+s) ds dx' =∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^0-u_x_n(x',g(x')+s)g_x_i(x') ds dx' =∫_ℝ^n-1-u(x',g(x'))g_x_i(x') dx'. In summary, with ∇u=(ux1,…,uxn)=(u_x_1,…,u_x_n) we have ∫Ω∇udV=∫Rn−1∫−∞g(x′)∇udV=∫Rn−1u(x′,g(x′))(−∇g(x′),1)dx′.∫_Ω dV=∫_ℝ^n-1∫_-∞^g(x') dV=∫_ℝ^n-1u(x',g(x'))(-(x'),1) dx'. Recall that the outward unit normal to the graph ΓΓ of g at a point (x′,g(x′))∈Γ(x',g(x'))∈Γ is ν(x′,g(x′))=11+|∇g(x′)|2(−∇g(x′),1)ν(x',g(x'))=1/√(1+|(x')|^2)(-(x'),1) and that the surface element dS is given by dS=1+|∇g(x′)|2dx′=√(1+|(x')|^2) dx'. Thus ∫Ω∇udV=∫∂ΩuνdS.∫_Ω dV=∫_∂Ωuν dS. This completes the proof. For compact Riemannian manifolds with
