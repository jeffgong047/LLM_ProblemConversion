fields: Main article: Tensor field Writing the theorem in Einstein notation: ∭V∂Fi∂xidV=∭_V∂𝐅_i_idV= S FinidS𝐅_in_i dS suggestively, replacing the vector field F with a rank-n tensor field T, this can be generalized to:[20] ∭V∂Ti1i2⋯iq⋯in∂xiqdV=∭_V_i_1i_2_q_n_i_qdV= S Ti1i2⋯iq⋯inniqdS._i_1i_2_q_nn_i_q dS. where on each side, tensor contraction occurs for at least one index. This form of the theorem is still in 3d, each index takes values 1, 2, and 3. It can be generalized further still to higher (or lower) dimensions (for example to 4d spacetime in general relativity[21]). See
