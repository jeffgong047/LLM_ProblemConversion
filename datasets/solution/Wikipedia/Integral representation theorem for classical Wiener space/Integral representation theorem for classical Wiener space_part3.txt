finance: The martingale representation theorem can be used to establish the existence of a hedging strategy. Suppose that (Mt)0≤t<∞(M_t)_0<∞ is a Q-martingale process, whose volatility σtσ_t is always non-zero. Then, if (Nt)0≤t<∞(N_t)_0<∞ is any other Q-martingale, there exists an Fℱ-previsible process φφ, unique up to sets of measure 0, such that ∫0Tφt2σt2dt<∞∫_0^Tφ_t^2σ_t^2 dt<∞ with probability one, and N can be written as: Nt=N0+∫0tφsdMs._t=N_0+∫_0^tφ_s dM_s. The replicating strategy is defined to be: hold φtφ_t units of the stock at the time t, and hold ψtBt=Ct−φtZtψ_tB_t=C_t-φ_tZ_t units of the bond. where Zt_t is the stock price discounted by the bond price to time t and Ct_t is the expected payoff of the option at time t. At the expiration day T, the value of the portfolio is: VT=φTST+ψTBT=CT=X_T=φ_TS_T+ψ_TB_T=C_T=X and it is easy to check that the strategy is self-financing: the change in the value of the portfolio only depends on the change of the asset prices (dVt=φtdSt+ψtdBt)(dV_t=φ_t dS_t+ψ_t dB_t).
