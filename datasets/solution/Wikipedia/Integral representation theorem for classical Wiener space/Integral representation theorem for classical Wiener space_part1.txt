(October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In probability theory, the martingale representation theorem states that a random variable that is measurable with respect to the filtration generated by a Brownian motion can be written in terms of an It√¥ integral with respect to this Brownian motion. The theorem only asserts the existence of the representation and does not help to find it explicitly; it is possible in many cases to determine the form of the representation using Malliavin calculus. Similar theorems also exist for martingales on filtrations induced by jump processes, for example, by Markov chains.
