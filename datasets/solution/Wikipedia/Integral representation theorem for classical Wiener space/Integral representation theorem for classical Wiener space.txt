In probability theory, the martingale representation theorem states that a random variable that is measurable with respect to the filtration generated by a Brownian motion can be written in terms of an Itô integral with respect to this Brownian motion.
The theorem only asserts the existence of the representation and does not help to find it explicitly; it is possible in many cases to determine the form of the representation using Malliavin calculus.
Similar theorems also exist for martingales on filtrations induced by jump processes, for example, by Markov chains. 


Statement[edit]
Let Bt_t be a Brownian motion on a standard filtered probability space (Ω,F,Ft,P)(Ω,ℱ,ℱ_t,P) and let Gt𝒢_t be the augmented filtration generated by B. If X is a square integrable random variable measurable with respect to G∞𝒢_∞, then there exists a predictable process C which is adapted with respect to Gt,𝒢_t, such that

X=E(X)+∫0∞CsdBs.=E(X)+∫_0^∞C_s dB_s.
Consequently,

E(X|Gt)=E(X)+∫0tCsdBs.(X|𝒢_t)=E(X)+∫_0^tC_s dB_s.
Application in finance[edit]
The martingale representation theorem can be used to establish the existence
of a hedging strategy.
Suppose that (Mt)0≤t<∞(M_t)_0<∞ is a Q-martingale process, whose volatility σtσ_t is always non-zero.
Then, if (Nt)0≤t<∞(N_t)_0<∞ is any other Q-martingale, there exists an Fℱ-previsible process φφ, unique up to sets of measure 0, such that ∫0Tφt2σt2dt<∞∫_0^Tφ_t^2σ_t^2 dt<∞ with probability one, and N can be written as:

Nt=N0+∫0tφsdMs._t=N_0+∫_0^tφ_s dM_s.
The replicating strategy is defined to be:

hold φtφ_t units of the stock at the time t, and
hold ψtBt=Ct−φtZtψ_tB_t=C_t-φ_tZ_t units of the bond.
where Zt_t is the stock price discounted by the bond price to time t and Ct_t is the expected payoff of the option at time t.
At the expiration day T, the value of the portfolio is:

VT=φTST+ψTBT=CT=X_T=φ_TS_T+ψ_TB_T=C_T=X
and it is easy to check that the strategy is self-financing: the change in the value of the portfolio only depends on the change of the asset prices (dVt=φtdSt+ψtdBt)(dV_t=φ_t dS_t+ψ_t dB_t).
