Statement: Let Bt_t be a Brownian motion on a standard filtered probability space (Ω,F,Ft,P)(Ω,ℱ,ℱ_t,P) and let Gt𝒢_t be the augmented filtration generated by B. If X is a square integrable random variable measurable with respect to G∞𝒢_∞, then there exists a predictable process C which is adapted with respect to Gt,𝒢_t, such that X=E(X)+∫0∞CsdBs.=E(X)+∫_0^∞C_s dB_s. Consequently, E(X|Gt)=E(X)+∫0tCsdBs.(X|𝒢_t)=E(X)+∫_0^tC_s dB_s. Application in
