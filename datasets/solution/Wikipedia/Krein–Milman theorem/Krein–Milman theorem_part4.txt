Statement: Krein–Milman theorem[6] — If K is a compact subset of a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space then the set of extreme points of K has the same closed convex hull as K.. In the case where the compact set K is also convex, the above theorem has as a corollary the first part of the next theorem,[6] which is also often called the Krein–Milman theorem. Krein–Milman theorem[2] — Suppose X is a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space (for example, a normed space) and K is a compact and convex subset of X.. Then K is equal to the closed convex hull of its extreme points: K=co¯(extreme⁡(K)). = co(extreme(K)). Moreover, if B⊆K then K is equal to the closed convex hull of B if and only if extreme⁡K⊆cl⁡B,extremeK⊆clB, where cl⁡BclB is closure of B.. The convex hull of the extreme points of K forms a convex subset of K so the main burden of the proof is to show that there are enough extreme points so that their convex hull covers all of K.. For this reason, the following corollary to the above theorem is also often called the Krein–Milman theorem. (KM) Krein–Milman theorem (Existence)[2] — Every non-empty compact convex subset of a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space has an extreme point; that is, the set of its extreme points is not empty. To visualized this theorem and its conclusion, consider the particular case where K is a convex polygon. In this case, the corners of the polygon (which are its extreme points) are all that is needed to recover the polygon shape. The statement of the theorem is false if the polygon is not convex, as then there are many ways of drawing a polygon having given points as corners. The requirement that the convex set K be compact can be weakened to give the following strengthened generalization version of the theorem.[7] (SKM) Strong Krein–Milman theorem (Existence)[8] — Suppose X is a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space and K is a non-empty convex subset of X with the property that whenever C𝒞 is a cover of K by convex closed subsets of X such that K∩C:C∈C{K:C∈𝒞} has the finite intersection property, then K∩⋂C∈CC∩⋂_C∈𝒞C is not empty. Then extreme⁡(K)extreme(K) is not empty. The property above is sometimes called quasicompactness or convex compactness. Compactness implies convex compactness because a topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property (FIP) has non-empty intersection (that is, its kernel is not empty). The definition of convex compactness is similar to this characterization of compact spaces in terms of the FIP, except that it only involves those closed subsets that are also convex (rather than all closed subsets).
