History: The original statement proved by Mark Krein and David Milman (1940) was somewhat less general than the form stated here.[14] Earlier, Hermann Minkowski (1911) proved that if X is 3-dimensional then K equals the convex hull of the set of its extreme points.[15] This assertion was expanded to the case of any finite dimension by Ernst Steinitz (1916).[16] The Kreinâ€“Milman theorem generalizes this to arbitrary locally convex X; however, to generalize from finite to infinite dimensional spaces, it is necessary to use the closure.
