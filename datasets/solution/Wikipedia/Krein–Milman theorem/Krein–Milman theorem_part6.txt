results: Under the previous assumptions on K,, if T is a subset of K and the closed convex hull of T is all of K,, then every extreme point of K belongs to the closure of T.. This result is known as Milman's (partial) converse to the Krein–Milman theorem.[12] The Choquet–Bishop–de Leeuw theorem states that every point in K is the barycenter of a probability measure supported on the set of extreme points of K..
