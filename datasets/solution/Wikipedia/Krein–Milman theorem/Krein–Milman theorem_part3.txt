definitions: A convex set in light blue, and its extreme points in red. Throughout, X will be a real or complex vector space. For any elements x and y in a vector space, the set [x,y]:=tx+(1−t)y:0≤t≤1[x,y]:={tx+(1-t)y:0≤1} is called the closed line segment or closed interval between x and y.. The open line segment or open interval between x and y is (x,x):=∅(x,x):=∅ when x=y=y while it is (x,y):=tx+(1−t)y:0<t<1(x,y):={tx+(1-t)y:0<t<1} when x≠y;;[2] it satisfies (x,y)=[x,y]∖x,y(x,y)=[x,y]∖{x,y} and [x,y]=(x,y)∪x,y.[x,y]=(x,y)∪{x,y}. The points x and y are called the endpoints of these interval. An interval is said to be non-degenerate or proper if its endpoints are distinct. The intervals [x,x]=x[x,x]={x} and [x,y][x,y] always contain their endpoints while (x,x)=∅(x,x)=∅ and (x,y)(x,y) never contain either of their endpoints. If x and y are points in the real line Rℝ then the above definition of [x,y][x,y] is the same as its usual definition as a closed interval. For any p,x,y∈X,,x,y, the point p is said to (strictly) lie between x and y if p belongs to the open line segment (x,y).(x,y).[2] If K is a subset of X and p∈K,, then p is called an extreme point of K if it does not lie between any two distinct points of K.. That is, if there does not exist x,y∈K,y and 0<t<10<t<1 such that x≠y and p=tx+(1−t)y.=tx+(1-t)y. In this article, the set of all extreme points of K will be denoted by extreme⁡(K).extreme(K).[2] For example, the vertices of any convex polygon in the plane R2ℝ^2 are the extreme points of that polygon. The extreme points of the closed unit disk in R2ℝ^2 is the unit circle. Every open interval and degenerate closed interval in Rℝ has no extreme points while the extreme points of a non-degenerate closed interval [x,y][x,y] are x and y.. A set S is called convex if for any two points x,y∈S,,y, S contains the line segment [x,y].[x,y]. The smallest convex set containing S is called the convex hull of S and it is denoted by co⁡S.coS. The closed convex hull of a set S,, denoted by co¯(S),co(S), is the smallest closed and convex set containing S.. It is also equal to the intersection of all closed convex subsets that contain S and to the closure of the convex hull of S; that is, co¯(S)=co⁡(S)¯,co(S)=co(S), where the right hand side denotes the closure of co⁡(S)co(S) while the left hand side is notation. For example, the convex hull of any set of three distinct points forms either a closed line segment (if they are collinear) or else a solid (that is, "filled") triangle, including its perimeter. And in the plane R2,ℝ^2, the unit circle is not convex but the closed unit disk is convex and furthermore, this disk is equal to the convex hull of the circle. The separable Hilbert space Lp space ℓ2(N)ℓ^2(ℕ) of square-summable sequences with the usual norm ‖⋅‖2·_2 has a compact subset S whose convex hull co⁡(S)co(S) is not closed and thus also not compact.[3] However, like in all complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces, the closed convex hull co¯ScoS of this compact subset will be compact.[4] But if a Hausdorff locally convex space is not complete then it is in general not guaranteed that co¯ScoS will be compact whenever S is; an example can even be found in a (non-complete) pre-Hilbert vector subspace of ℓ2(N).ℓ^2(ℕ). Every compact subset is totally bounded (also called "precompact") and the closed convex hull of a totally bounded subset of a Hausdorff locally convex space is guaranteed to be totally bounded.[5]
