choice: Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) axiomatic framework, the axiom of choice (AC) suffices to prove all versions of the Krein–Milman theorem given above, including statement KM and its generalization SKM. The axiom of choice also implies, but is not equivalent to, the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI), which is equivalent to the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. Conversely, the Krein–Milman theorem KM together with the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI) imply the axiom of choice.[13] In summary, AC holds if and only if both KM and BPI hold.[8] It follows that under ZF, the axiom of choice is equivalent to the following statement: The closed unit ball of the continuous dual space of any real normed space has an extreme point.[8] Furthermore, SKM together with the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces (HB) are also equivalent to the axiom of choice.[8] It is known that BPI implies HB, but that it is not equivalent to it (said differently, BPI is strictly stronger than HB).
