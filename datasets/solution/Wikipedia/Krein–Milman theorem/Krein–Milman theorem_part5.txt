settings: The assumption of local convexity for the ambient space is necessary, because James Roberts (1977) constructed a counter-example for the non-locally convex space Lp[0,1]^p[0,1] where 0<p<1.0<p<1.[9] Linearity is also needed, because the statement fails for weakly compact convex sets in CAT(0) spaces, as proved by Nicolas Monod (2016).[10] However, Theo Buehler (2006) proved that the Kreinâ€“Milman theorem does hold for metrically compact CAT(0) spaces.[11] Related
