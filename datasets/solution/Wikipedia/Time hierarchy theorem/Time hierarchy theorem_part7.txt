Extension: The reader may have realised that the proof gives the weaker result because we have chosen a simple Turing machine simulation for which we know that Hf∈TIME(f(m)3)._f∈𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(f(m)^3). It is known[7] that a more efficient simulation exists which establishes that Hf∈TIME(f(m)log⁡f(m))_f∈𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(f(m)(m)). Non-deterministic time hierarchy
