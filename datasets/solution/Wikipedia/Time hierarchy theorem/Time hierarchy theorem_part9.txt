Consequences: The time hierarchy theorems guarantee that the deterministic and non-deterministic versions of the exponential hierarchy are genuine hierarchies: in other words P ⊊ EXPTIME ⊊ 2-EXP ⊊ ... and NP ⊊ NEXPTIME ⊊ 2-NEXP ⊊ .... For example, P⊊EXPTIME𝖯⊊𝖤𝖷𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤 since P⊆DTIME(2n)⊊DTIME(22n)⊆EXPTIME𝖯⊆𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(2^n)⊊𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(2^2n)⊆𝖤𝖷𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤. Indeed, DTIME(2n)⊆DTIME(o(22n2n))⊊DTIME(22n)𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(2^n)⊆𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(o(2^2n/2n))⊊𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(2^2n) from the time hierarchy theorem. The theorem also guarantees that there are problems in P requiring arbitrarily large exponents to solve; in other words, P does not collapse to DTIME(nk) for any fixed k. For example, there are problems solvable in n5000 time but not n4999 time. This is one argument against Cobham's thesis, the convention that P is a practical class of algorithms. If such a collapse did occur, we could deduce that P ≠ PSPACE, since it is a well-known theorem that DTIME(f(n)) is strictly contained in DSPACE(f(n)). However, the time hierarchy theorems provide no means to relate deterministic and non-deterministic complexity, or time and space complexity, so they cast no light on the great unsolved questions of computational complexity theory: whether P and NP, NP and PSPACE, PSPACE and EXPTIME, or EXPTIME and NEXPTIME are equal or not.
