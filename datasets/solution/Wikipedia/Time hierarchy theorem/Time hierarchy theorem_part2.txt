Background: Both theorems use the notion of a time-constructible function. A function f:N→N:ℕ→ℕ is time-constructible if there exists a deterministic Turing machine such that for every n∈N∈ℕ, if the machine is started with an input of n ones, it will halt after precisely f(n) steps. All polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients are time-constructible, as are exponential functions such as 2n. Proof
