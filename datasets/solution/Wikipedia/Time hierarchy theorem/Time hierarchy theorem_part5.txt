Statement: Time Hierarchy Theorem. If f(n) is a time-constructible function, then there exists a decision problem which cannot be solved in worst-case deterministic time o(f(n)) but can be solved in worst-case deterministic time O(f(n)log f(n)). Thus DTIME(o(f(n)))⊊DTIME(f(n)log⁡f(n)).𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(o(f(n)))⊊𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤(f(n)(n)). Note 1. f(n) is at least n, since smaller functions are never time-constructible. Example. There are problems solvable in time nlog2n but not time n. This follows by setting f(n)=nlog⁡n(n)=n, since n is in o(nlog⁡n).(n).
