Notes: ^ However, if such an f satisfies f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) for all r>0>0 and x∈X,, then necessarily f(0)∈±∞,0(0)∈{±∞,0} and whenever f(0),f(x)∈R(0),f(x)∈ℝ are both real then f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) will hold for all r≥0.≥0. Proofs ^ Assume that f is strictly positively homogeneous and valued in a vector space or a field. Then f(0)=f(2⋅0)=2f(0)(0)=f(2·0)=2f(0) so subtracting f(0)(0) from both sides shows that f(0)=0.(0)=0. Writing r:=0,:=0, then for any x∈X,, f(rx)=f(0)=0=0f(x)=rf(x),(rx)=f(0)=0=0f(x)=rf(x), which shows that f is nonnegative homogeneous.
