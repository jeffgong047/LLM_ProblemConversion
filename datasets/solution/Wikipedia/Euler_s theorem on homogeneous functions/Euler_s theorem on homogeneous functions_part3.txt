homogeneity: Let V and W be two vector spaces over a field F. A linear cone in V is a subset C of V such that sx∈C for all x∈C and all nonzero s∈F.. A homogeneous function f from V to W is a partial function from V to W that has a linear cone C as its domain, and satisfies f(sx)=skf(x)(sx)=s^kf(x) for some integer k, every x∈C,, and every nonzero s∈F.. The integer k is called the degree of homogeneity, or simply the degree of f. A typical example of a homogeneous function of degree k is the function defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree k. The rational function defined by the quotient of two homogeneous polynomials is a homogeneous function; its degree is the difference of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator; its cone of definition is the linear cone of the points where the value of denominator is not zero. Homogeneous functions play a fundamental role in projective geometry since any homogeneous function f from V to W defines a well-defined function between the projectivizations of V and W. The homogeneous rational functions of degree zero (those defined by the quotient of two homogeneous polynomial of the same degree) play an essential role in the Proj construction of projective schemes.
