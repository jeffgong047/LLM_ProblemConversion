functions: Rational functions formed as the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials are homogeneous functions in their domain, that is, off of the linear cone formed by the zeros of the denominator. Thus, if f is homogeneous of degree m and g is homogeneous of degree n,, then f/g/g is homogeneous of degree mâˆ’n-n away from the zeros of g..
