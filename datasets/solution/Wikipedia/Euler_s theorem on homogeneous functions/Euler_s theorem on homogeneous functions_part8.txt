functions: Any linear map f:V→W:V between vector spaces over a field F is homogeneous of degree 1, by the definition of linearity: f(αv)=αf(v)(α𝐯)=(𝐯) for all α∈Fα∈F and v∈V.. Similarly, any multilinear function f:V1×V2×⋯Vn→W:V_1_2×_n is homogeneous of degree n,, by the definition of multilinearity: f(αv1,…,αvn)=αnf(v1,…,vn)(α𝐯_1,…,α𝐯_n)=α^nf(𝐯_1,…,𝐯_n) for all α∈Fα∈F and v1∈V1,v2∈V2,…,vn∈Vn._1_1,v_2_2,…,v_n_n.
