norms: The absolute value of a real number is a positively homogeneous function of degree 1, which is not homogeneous, since |sx|=s|x||sx|=s|x| if s>0,>0, and |sx|=âˆ’s|x||sx|=-s|x| if s<0.<0. The absolute value of a complex number is a positively homogeneous function of degree 11 over the real numbers (that is, when considering the complex numbers as a vector space over the real numbers). It is not homogeneous, over the real numbers as well as over the complex numbers. More generally, every norm and seminorm is a positively homogeneous function of degree 1 which is not a homogeneous function. As for the absolute value, if the norm or semi-norm is defined on a vector space over the complex numbers, this vector space has to be considered as vector space over the real number for applying the definition of a positively homogeneous function.
