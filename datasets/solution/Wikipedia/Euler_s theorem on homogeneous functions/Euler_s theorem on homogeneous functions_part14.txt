equations: Main article: Homogeneous differential equation The substitution v=y/x=y/x converts the ordinary differential equation I(x,y)dydx+J(x,y)=0,(x,y)dy/dx+J(x,y)=0, where I and J are homogeneous functions of the same degree, into the separable differential equation xdvdx=−J(1,v)I(1,v)−v.dv/dx=-J(1,v)/I(1,v)-v.
