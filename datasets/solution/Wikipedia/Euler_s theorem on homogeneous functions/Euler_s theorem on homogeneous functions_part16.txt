action: The definitions given above are all specialized cases of the following more general notion of homogeneity in which X can be any set (rather than a vector space) and the real numbers can be replaced by the more general notion of a monoid. Let M be a monoid with identity element 1∈M,1, let X and Y be sets, and suppose that on both X and Y there are defined monoid actions of M.. Let k be a non-negative integer and let f:X→Y:X be a map. Then f is said to be homogeneous of degree k over M if for every x∈X and m∈M,, f(mx)=mkf(x).(mx)=m^kf(x). If in addition there is a function M→M,, denoted by m↦|m|,↦|m|, called an absolute value then f is said to be absolutely homogeneous of degree k over M if for every x∈X and m∈M,, f(mx)=|m|kf(x).(mx)=|m|^kf(x). A function is homogeneous over M (resp. absolutely homogeneous over M) if it is homogeneous of degree 11 over M (resp. absolutely homogeneous of degree 11 over M). More generally, it is possible for the symbols mk^k to be defined for m∈M with k being something other than an integer (for example, if M is the real numbers and k is a non-zero real number then mk^k is defined even though k is not an integer). If this is the case then f will be called homogeneous of degree k over M if the same equality holds: f(mx)=mkf(x)foreveryx∈Xandm∈M.(mx)=m^kf(x) foreveryxandm. The notion of being absolutely homogeneous of degree k over M is generalized similarly. Distributions (generalized
