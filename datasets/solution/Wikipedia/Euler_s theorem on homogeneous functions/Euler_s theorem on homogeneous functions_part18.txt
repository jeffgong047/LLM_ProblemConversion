(December 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Let f:X→Y:X be a map between two vector spaces over a field F𝔽 (usually the real numbers Rℝ or complex numbers Cℂ). If S is a set of scalars, such as Z,ℤ, [0,∞),[0,∞), or Rℝ for example, then f is said to be homogeneous over S if f(sx)=sf(x)(sx)=sf(x) for every x∈X and scalar s∈S.. For instance, every additive map between vector spaces is homogeneous over the rational numbers S:=Q:=ℚ although it might not be homogeneous over the real numbers S:=R.:=ℝ. The following commonly encountered special cases and variations of this definition have their own terminology: (Strict) Positive homogeneity:[1] f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) for all x∈X and all positive real r>0.>0. When the function f is valued in a vector space or field, then this property is logically equivalent[proof 1] to nonnegative homogeneity, which by definition means:[2] f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) for all x∈X and all non-negative real r≥0.≥0. It is for this reason that positive homogeneity is often also called nonnegative homogeneity. However, for functions valued in the extended real numbers [−∞,∞]=R∪±∞,[-∞,∞]=ℝ∪{±∞}, which appear in fields like convex analysis, the multiplication 0⋅f(x)0(x) will be undefined whenever f(x)=±∞(x)=±∞ and so these statements are not necessarily always interchangeable.[note 1] This property is used in the definition of a sublinear function.[1][2] Minkowski functionals are exactly those non-negative extended real-valued functions with this property. Real homogeneity: f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) for all x∈X and all real r.. This property is used in the definition of a real linear functional. Homogeneity:[3] f(sx)=sf(x)(sx)=sf(x) for all x∈X and all scalars s∈F.∈𝔽. It is emphasized that this definition depends on the scalar field F𝔽 underlying the domain X.. This property is used in the definition of linear functionals and linear maps.[2] Conjugate homogeneity:[4] f(sx)=s¯f(x)(sx)=sf(x) for all x∈X and all scalars s∈F.∈𝔽. If F=C𝔽=ℂ then s¯s typically denotes the complex conjugate of s. But more generally, as with semilinear maps for example, s¯s could be the image of s under some distinguished automorphism of F.𝔽. Along with additivity, this property is assumed in the definition of an antilinear map. It is also assumed that one of the two coordinates of a sesquilinear form has this property (such as the inner product of a Hilbert space). All of the above definitions can be generalized by replacing the condition f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) with f(rx)=|r|f(x),(rx)=|r|f(x), in which case that definition is prefixed with the word "absolute" or "absolutely." For example, Absolute homogeneity:[2] f(sx)=|s|f(x)(sx)=|s|f(x) for all x∈X and all scalars s∈F.∈𝔽. This property is used in the definition of a seminorm and a norm. If k is a fixed real number then the above definitions can be further generalized by replacing the condition f(rx)=rf(x)(rx)=rf(x) with f(rx)=rkf(x)(rx)=r^kf(x) (and similarly, by replacing f(rx)=|r|f(x)(rx)=|r|f(x) with f(rx)=|r|kf(x)(rx)=|r|^kf(x) for conditions using the absolute value, etc.), in which case the homogeneity is said to be "of degree k" (where in particular, all of the above definitions are "of degree 11"). For instance, Real homogeneity of degree k: f(rx)=rkf(x)(rx)=r^kf(x) for all x∈X and all real r.. Homogeneity of degree k: f(sx)=skf(x)(sx)=s^kf(x) for all x∈X and all scalars s∈F.∈𝔽. Absolute real homogeneity of degree k: f(rx)=|r|kf(x)(rx)=|r|^kf(x) for all x∈X and all real r.. Absolute homogeneity of degree k: f(sx)=|s|kf(x)(sx)=|s|^kf(x) for all x∈X and all scalars s∈F.∈𝔽. A nonzero continuous function that is homogeneous of degree k on Rn∖0ℝ^n\{0} extends continuously to Rnℝ^n if and only if k>0.>0. See
