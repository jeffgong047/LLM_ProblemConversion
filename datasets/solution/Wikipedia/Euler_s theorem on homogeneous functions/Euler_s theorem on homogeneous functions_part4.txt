homogeneity: When working over the real numbers, or more generally over an ordered field, it is commonly convenient to consider positive homogeneity, the definition being exactly the same as that in the preceding section, with "nonzero s" replaced by "s > 0" in the definitions of a linear cone and a homogeneous function. This change allow considering (positively) homogeneous functions with any real number as their degrees, since exponentiation with a positive real base is well defined. Even in the case of integer degrees, there are many useful functions that are positively homogeneous without being homogeneous. This is, in particular, the case of the absolute value function and norms, which are all positively homogeneous of degree 1. They are not homogeneous since |−x|=|x|≠−|x||-x|=|x|≠-|x| if x≠0.≠0. This remains true in the complex case, since the field of the complex numbers Cℂ and every complex vector space can be considered as real vector spaces. Euler's homogeneous function theorem is a characterization of positively homogeneous differentiable functions, which may be considered as the fundamental theorem on homogeneous functions.
