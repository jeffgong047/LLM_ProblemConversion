polynomials: Main article: Homogeneous polynomial Monomials in n variables define homogeneous functions f:Fn‚ÜíF.:ùîΩ^n‚ÜíùîΩ. For example, f(x,y,z)=x5y2z3(x,y,z)=x^5y^2z^3 is homogeneous of degree 10 since f(Œ±x,Œ±y,Œ±z)=(Œ±x)5(Œ±y)2(Œ±z)3=Œ±10x5y2z3=Œ±10f(x,y,z).(,,)=()^5()^2()^3=Œ±^10x^5y^2z^3=Œ±^10f(x,y,z). The degree is the sum of the exponents on the variables; in this example, 10=5+2+3.10=5+2+3. A homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial made up of a sum of monomials of the same degree. For example, x5+2x3y2+9xy4^5+2x^3y^2+9xy^4 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Homogeneous polynomials also define homogeneous functions. Given a homogeneous polynomial of degree k with real coefficients that takes only positive values, one gets a positively homogeneous function of degree k/d/d by raising it to the power 1/d.1/d. So for example, the following function is positively homogeneous of degree 1 but not homogeneous: (x2+y2+z2)12.(x^2+y^2+z^2)^1/2.
