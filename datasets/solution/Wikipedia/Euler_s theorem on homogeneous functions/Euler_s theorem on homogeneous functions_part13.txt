theorem: Roughly speaking, Euler's homogeneous function theorem asserts that the positively homogeneous functions of a given degree are exactly the solution of a specific partial differential equation. More precisely: Euler's homogeneous function theorem — If f is a (partial) function of n real variables that is positively homogeneous of degree k, and continuously differentiable in some open subset of Rn,ℝ^n, then it satisfies in this open set the partial differential equation kf(x1,…,xn)=∑i=1nxi∂f∂xi(x1,…,xn). f(x_1,…,x_n)=∑_i=1^nx_i/_i(x_1,…,x_n). Conversely, every maximal continuously differentiable solution of this partial differentiable equation is a positively homogeneous function of degree k, defined on a positive cone (here, maximal means that the solution cannot be prolongated to a function with a larger domain). Proof For having simpler formulas, we set x=(x1,…,xn).𝐱=(x_1,…,x_n). The first part results by using the chain rule for differentiating both sides of the equation f(sx)=skf(x)(s𝐱)=s^kf(𝐱) with respect to s,, and taking the limit of the result when s tends to 1. The converse is proved by integrating a simple differential equation. Let x𝐱 be in the interior of the domain of f. For s sufficiently close of 1, the function g(s)=f(sx)(s)=f(s𝐱) is well defined. The partial differential equation implies that sg′(s)=kf(sx)=kg(s).'(s)=kf(s𝐱)=kg(s). The solutions of this linear differential equation have the form g(s)=g(1)sk.(s)=g(1)s^k. Therefore, f(sx)=g(s)=skg(1)=skf(x),(s𝐱)=g(s)=s^kg(1)=s^kf(𝐱), if s is sufficiently close to 1. If this solution of the partial differential equation would not be defined for all positive s, then the functional equation would allow to prolongate the solution, and the partial differential equation implies that this prolongation is unique. So, the domain of a maximal solution of the partial differential equation is a linear cone, and the solution is positively homogeneous of degree k. ◻□ As a consequence, if f:Rn→R:ℝ^n→ℝ is continuously differentiable and homogeneous of degree k,, its first-order partial derivatives ∂f/∂xi/_i are homogeneous of degree k−1.-1. This results from Euler's theorem by differentiating the partial differential equation with respect to one variable. In the case of a function of a single real variable (n=1=1), the theorem implies that a continuously differentiable and positively homogeneous function of degree k has the form f(x)=c+xk(x)=c_+x^k for x>0>0 and f(x)=c−xk(x)=c_-x^k for x<0.<0. The constants c+_+ and c−_- are not necessarily the same, as it is the case for the absolute value. Application to differential
