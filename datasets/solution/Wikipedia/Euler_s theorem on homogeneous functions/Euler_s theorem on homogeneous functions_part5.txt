Examples: A homogeneous function is not necessarily continuous, as shown by this example. This is the function f defined by f(x,y)=x(x,y)=x if xy>0>0 and f(x,y)=0(x,y)=0 if xy≤0.≤0. This function is homogeneous of degree 1, that is, f(sx,sy)=sf(x,y)(sx,sy)=sf(x,y) for any real numbers s,x,y.,x,y. It is discontinuous at y=0,x≠0.=0,x≠0. Simple
