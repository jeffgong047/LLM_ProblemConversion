sequences: In computer algebra, the polynomials that are considered have integer coefficients or may be transformed to have integer coefficients. The Sturm sequence of a polynomial with integer coefficients generally contains polynomials whose coefficients are not integers (see above example). To avoid computation with rational numbers, a common method is to replace Euclidean division by pseudo-division for computing polynomial greatest common divisors. This amounts to replacing the remainder sequence of the Euclidean algorithm by a pseudo-remainder sequence, a pseudo remainder sequence being a sequence p0,…,pk_0,…,p_k of polynomials such that there are constants ai_i and bi_i such that bipi+1_ip_i+1 is the remainder of the Euclidean division of aipi−1_ip_i-1 by pi._i. (The different kinds of pseudo-remainder sequences are defined by the choice of ai_i and bi;_i; typically, ai_i is chosen for not introducing denominators during Euclidean division, and bi_i is a common divisor of the coefficients of the resulting remainder; see Pseudo-remainder sequence for details.) For example, the remainder sequence of the Euclidean algorithm is a pseudo-remainder sequence with ai=bi=1_i=b_i=1 for every i, and the Sturm sequence of a polynomial is a pseudo-remainder sequence with ai=1_i=1 and bi=−1_i=-1 for every i. Various pseudo-remainder sequences have been designed for computing greatest common divisors of polynomials with integer coefficients without introducing denominators (see Pseudo-remainder sequence). They can all be made generalized Sturm sequences by choosing the sign of the bi_i to be the opposite of the sign of the ai._i. This allows the use of Sturm's theorem with pseudo-remainder sequences.
