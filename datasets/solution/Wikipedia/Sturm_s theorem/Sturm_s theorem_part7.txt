Application: Generalized Sturm sequences allow counting the roots of a polynomial where another polynomial is positive (or negative), without computing these root explicitly. If one knows an isolating interval for a root of the first polynomial, this allows also finding the sign of the second polynomial at this particular root of the first polynomial, without computing a better approximation of the root. Let P(x) and Q(x) be two polynomials with real coefficients such that P and Q have no common root and P has no multiple roots. In other words, P and P' Q are coprime polynomials. This restriction does not really affect the generality of what follows as GCD computations allows reducing the general case to this case, and the cost of the computation of a Sturm sequence is the same as that of a GCD. Let W(a) denote the number of sign variations at a of a generalized Sturm sequence starting from P and P' Q. If a < b are two real numbers, then W(a) â€“ W(b) is the number of roots of P in the interval (a,b](a,b] such that Q(a) > 0 minus the number of roots in the same interval such that Q(a) < 0. Combined with the total number of roots of P in the same interval given by Sturm's theorem, this gives the number of roots of P such that Q(a) > 0 and the number of roots of P such that Q(a) < 0.[1] See
