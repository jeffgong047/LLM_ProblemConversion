Example: Suppose we wish to find the number of roots in some range for the polynomial p(x)=x4+x3−x−1(x)=x^4+x^3-x-1. So p0(x)=p(x)=x4+x3−x−1p1(x)=p′(x)=4x3+3x2−1p_0(x) =p(x)=x^4+x^3-x-1 p_1(x) =p'(x)=4x^3+3x^2-1 The remainder of the Euclidean division of p0 by p1 is −316x2−34x−1516;-316x^2-34x-1516; multiplying it by −1 we obtain p2(x)=316x2+34x+1516_2(x)=316x^2+34x+1516. Next dividing p1 by p2 and multiplying the remainder by −1, we obtain p3(x)=−32x−64_3(x)=-32x-64. Now dividing p2 by p3 and multiplying the remainder by −1, we obtain p4(x)=−316_4(x)=-316. As this is a constant, this finishes the computation of the Sturm sequence. To find the number of real roots of p0_0 one has to evaluate the sequences of the signs of these polynomials at −∞ and ∞, which are respectively (+, −, +, +, −) and (+, +, +, −, −). Thus V(−∞)−V(+∞)=3−1=2,(-∞)-V(+∞)=3-1=2, where V denotes the number of sign changes in the sequence, which shows that p has two real roots. This can be verified by noting that p(x) can be factored as (x2 − 1)(x2 + x + 1), where the first factor has the roots −1 and 1, and second factor has no real roots. This last assertion results from the quadratic formula, and also from Sturm's theorem, which gives the sign sequences (+, –, –) at −∞ and (+, +, –) at +∞.
