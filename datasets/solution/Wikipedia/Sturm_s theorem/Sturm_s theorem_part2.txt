theorem: The Sturm chain or Sturm sequence of a univariate polynomial P(x) with real coefficients is the sequence of polynomials P0,P1,…,_0,P_1,…, such that P0=P,P1=P′,Pi+1=−rem⁡(Pi−1,Pi),P_0 =P, P_1 =P', P_i+1 =-rem(P_i-1,P_i), for i ≥ 1, where P' is the derivative of P, and rem⁡(Pi−1,Pi)rem(P_i-1,P_i) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of Pi−1_i-1 by Pi._i. The length of the Sturm sequence is at most the degree of P. The number of sign variations at ξ of the Sturm sequence of P is the number of sign changes–ignoring zeros—in the sequence of real numbers P0(ξ),P1(ξ),P2(ξ),…._0(ξ),P_1(ξ),P_2(ξ),…. This number of sign variations is denoted here V(ξ). Sturm's theorem states that, if P is a square-free polynomial, the number of distinct real roots of P in the half-open interval (a, b] is V(a) − V(b) (here, a and b are real numbers such that a < b).[1] The theorem extends to unbounded intervals by defining the sign at +∞ of a polynomial as the sign of its leading coefficient (that is, the coefficient of the term of highest degree). At –∞ the sign of a polynomial is the sign of its leading coefficient for a polynomial of even degree, and the opposite sign for a polynomial of odd degree. In the case of a non-square-free polynomial, if neither a nor b is a multiple root of p, then V(a) − V(b) is the number of distinct real roots of P. The proof of the theorem is as follows: when the value of x increases from a to b, it may pass through a zero of some Pi_i (i > 0); when this occurs, the number of sign variations of (Pi−1,Pi,Pi+1)(P_i-1,P_i,P_i+1) does not change. When x passes through a root of P0=P,_0=P, the number of sign variations of (P0,P1)(P_0,P_1) decreases from 1 to 0. These are the only values of x where some sign may change.
