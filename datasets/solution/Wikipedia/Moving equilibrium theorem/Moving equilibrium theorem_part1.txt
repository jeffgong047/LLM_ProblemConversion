Consider a dynamical system (1)..........x˙=f(x,y)ẋ=f(x,y) (2)..........y˙=g(x,y) ẏ=g(x,y) with the state variables x and y. Assume that x is fast and y is slow. Assume that the system (1) gives, for any fixed y, an asymptotically stable solution x¯(y)x̅(y). Substituting this for x in (2) yields (3)..........Y˙=g(x¯(Y),Y)=:G(Y). Ẏ=g(x̅(Y),Y)=:G(Y). Here y has been replaced by Y to indicate that the solution Y to (3) differs from the solution for y obtainable from the system (1), (2). The Moving Equilibrium Theorem suggested by Lotka states that the solutions Y obtainable from (3) approximate the solutions y obtainable from (1), (2) provided the partial system (1) is asymptotically stable in x for any given y and heavily damped (fast). The theorem has been proved for linear systems comprising real vectors x and y. It permits reducing high-dimensional dynamical problems to lower dimensions and underlies Alfred Marshall's temporary equilibrium method.
