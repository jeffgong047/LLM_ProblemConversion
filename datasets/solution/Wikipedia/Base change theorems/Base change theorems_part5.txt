change: If X is a Hausdorff topological space, S is a locally compact Hausdorff space and f is universally closed (i.e., X×ST→T×_ST is a closed map for any continuous map T→S), then the base change map g∗Rrf∗F→Rrf∗′g′∗F^*R^rf_*ℱ^rf'_*g'^*ℱ is an isomorphism.[2] Indeed, we have: for s∈S, (Rrf∗F)s=lim→⁡Hr(U,F)=Hr(Xs,F),Xs=f−1(s)(R^rf_*ℱ)_s=^r(U,ℱ)=H^r(X_s,ℱ),_s=f^-1(s) and so for s=g(t)=g(t) g∗(Rrf∗F)t=Hr(Xs,F)=Hr(Xt′,g′∗F)=Rrf∗′(g′∗F)t.^*(R^rf_*ℱ)_t=H^r(X_s,ℱ)=H^r(X'_t,g'^*ℱ)=R^rf'_*(g'^*ℱ)_t. To encode all individual higher derived functors of f∗_* into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map g∗Rf∗F→Rf∗′g′∗F^*Rf_*ℱ'_*g'^*ℱ is a quasi-isomorphism. The assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by Schnürer & Soergel (2016). Lurie (2009) has extended the above theorem to non-abelian sheaf cohomology, i.e., sheaves taking values in simplicial sets (as opposed to abelian groups).[3] Direct image with compact
