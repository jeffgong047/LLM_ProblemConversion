support: If the map f is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) : ∅→g′C∖0f′↓↓f0→gC[ ∅ g'→ ℂ∖{0}; f'↓ ; {0} g→ ℂ ] One the one hand f∗′g′∗F'_*g'^*ℱ is always zero, but if Fℱ is a local system on C∖0ℂ∖{0} corresponding to a representation of the fundamental group π1(X)π_1(X) (which is isomorphic to Z), then g∗f∗F^*f_*ℱ can be computed as the invariants of the monodromy action of π1(X,x)π_1(X,x) on the stalk Fxℱ_x (for any x≠0≠0), which need not vanish. To obtain a base-change result, the functor f∗_* (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the direct image with compact support Rf!_!. For example, if f:X→S:X is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example, Rf!F_!ℱ is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by (Rf!F)s=Fss∈X,0s∉X.(Rf_!ℱ)_s=ℱ_s s, 0 s. In general, there is a map Rf!F→Rf∗F_!ℱ_*ℱ, which is a quasi-isomorphism if f is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism[4] g∗Rf!F→Rf!′g′∗F.^*Rf_!ℱ'_!g'^*ℱ. Base change for quasi-coherent
