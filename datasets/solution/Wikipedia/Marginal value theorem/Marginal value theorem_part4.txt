Assumptions: The individual is assumed to control when it leaves the patch in order to maximize the ratio between resource intake and time. The consumer depletes the amount of resources in the patch where they are foraging; therefore, the rate of intake of food in that patch decreases as a function of time. If there is variation in the quality of patches, the MVT assumes that different patches are distributed randomly throughout the landscape.
