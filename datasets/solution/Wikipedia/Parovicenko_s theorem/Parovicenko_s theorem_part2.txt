Definition: A Parovicenko space is a topological space X satisfying the following conditions: X is compact Hausdorff X has no isolated points X has weight c, the cardinality of the continuum (this is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology). Every two disjoint open Fσ subsets of X have disjoint closures Every non-empty Gδ of X has non-empty interior.
