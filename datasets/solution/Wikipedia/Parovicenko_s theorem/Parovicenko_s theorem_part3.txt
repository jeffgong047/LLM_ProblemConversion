Properties: The space βN\N is a Parovicenko space, where βN is the Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers N. Parovicenko (1963) proved that the continuum hypothesis implies that every Parovicenko space is isomorphic[clarification needed] to βN\N. van Douwen & van Mill (1978) showed that if the continuum hypothesis is false then there are other examples of Parovicenko spaces.
