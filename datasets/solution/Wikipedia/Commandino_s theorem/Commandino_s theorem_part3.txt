Generalizations: Commandino's theorem has a direct analog for simplexes of any dimension:[6] Let ΔΔ be a d-simplex of some dimension d>1>1 in Rn(d,n∈N,n≥d)ℝ^n (d,n∈ℕ,n) and let V0,V1,…,Vp_0,V_1,…,V_p be its vertices. Furthermore, let ℓ0,ℓ1,…,ℓdℓ_0,ℓ_1,…,ℓ_d, be the medians of ΔΔ, the lines joining each vertex Vi_i with the centroid of the opposite (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional facet V0…Vi−1Vi+1…Vd_0_i-1V_i+1_d. Then, these lines intersect each other in a point S, in a ratio of d:1:1. Full
