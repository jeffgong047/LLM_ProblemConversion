generality: The former analog is easy to prove via the following, more general result, which is analogous to the way levers in physics work:[7] Let m and k be natural numbers, so that in an Rℝ-vector space V𝒱, m+k+k pairwise different points X1,…,Xm,Y1,…,Yk∈V_1,…,X_m,Y_1,…,Y_k∈𝒱 are given. Let SX_X be the centroid of the points Xi(i=1,…,m)_i (i=1,…,m), let SY_Y be the centroid of the points Yj(j=1,…,k)_j (j=1,…,k), and let S be the centroid of all of these m+k+k points. Then, one has S=SX+km+k(SY−SX)=mm+kSX+km+kSY.=S_X+k/m+k(S_Y-S_X)=m/m+kS_X+k/m+kS_Y. In particular, the centroid S lies on the line SXSY¯S_XS_Y and divides it in a ratio of k:m:m. Reusch's
