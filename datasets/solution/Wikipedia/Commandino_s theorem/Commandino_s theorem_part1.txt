The four medians of a tetrahedron are concurrent Medians of a tetrahedron intersecting in a point S (its centroid), such that|AS||SSBCD|=|BS||SSACD|=|CS||SSABD|=|DS||SSABC|=31|AS|/|SS_BCD|=|BS|/|SS_ACD|=|CS|/|SS_ABD|=|DS|/|SS_ABC|=3/1 Commandino's theorem, named after Federico Commandino (1509–1575), states that the four medians of a tetrahedron are concurrent at a point S, which divides them in a 3:1 ratio. In a tetrahedron a median is a line segment that connects a vertex with the centroid of the opposite face – that is, the centroid of the opposite triangle. The point S is also the centroid of the tetrahedron.[1][2][3]
