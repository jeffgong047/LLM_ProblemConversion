#5): The intersection between two circles becomes a trivial combination of two earlier constructions: Construct the radical axis between the two circles. Construct the intersection points between the radical axis (which is a line) and either one of the two circles arbitrarily chosen, using basic construction #4. These points are the desired points of intersection of the circles. The two circles and the radical axis all intersect at the same loci of points: two points, one point if tangential, or none if they do not intersect. If the radical axis does not intersect one circle then it intersects neither, and neither do the two circles intersect.
