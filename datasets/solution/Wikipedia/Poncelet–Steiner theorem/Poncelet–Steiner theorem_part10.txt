segment: Construction of a parallel line through an arbitrary point, of a given arbitrary line having a bisected segment embedded. This construction does not require the use of the given circle. Naturally any line that passes through the center of the given circle implicitly has a bisected segment: the diameter is bisected by the center. The animated gif file embedded at the introduction to this article demonstrates this construction, reiterated here without the circle and with enumerated steps. Given an arbitrary line n (in black) on which there exist two points A and B, having a midpoint M between them, and an arbitrary point P in the plane (assumed not to be on line n) through which a parallel of line n is to be made: Construct a line AP (in red). Construct a line BP (in orange). Define an arbitrary point R on line AP. Construct a line BR (in green). Construct a line MR (in light blue). Lines MR and BP intersect at point X. Construct a line AX (in purple). Lines BR and AX intersect at point Q. Construct a line PQ (in dark blue), the desired parallel. In some literature the bisected line segment is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional "circle" existing on the line. Alternatively, some literature views the bisected line segment as a two dimensional circle in three dimensional space with the line passing through a diameter, but not parallel to the plane, thus intersecting the plane of construction at two points on the circumference with the midpoint simply being the prescribed circle center.
