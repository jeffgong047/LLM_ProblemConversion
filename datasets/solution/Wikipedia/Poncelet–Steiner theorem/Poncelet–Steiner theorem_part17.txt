#4): The straightedge-only construction of the intersection points between a line and a circle. This construction does require the use of the provided circle, O(r). Given is the line m (in black) and the circle P(Q), which is not compass-constructed. The intersection points of the circle P(Q) and the line m, which are point A and B, may be constructed: Draw a line PQ (in red) through the points defining the circle. Construct a parallel (in orange) of line PQ through the center O of the provided circle. The parallel intersects the provided circle at two points, one of which is arbitrarily chosen: R. Draw a line PO (in light green), through the centers of the two circles (i.e. the one provided by compass construction and the one which is to be intersected). Draw a line QR (in light blue), connecting the two points on the circumferences of the two circles. Intersect the lines PO and QR at point X. If point X does not exist due to lines PO and QR being parallel - which results from circles P(Q) and O(r) having equal radii - then refer back to step 2 and choose the alternate point of intersection, R. Choosing a point M arbitrarily on line m, such that it is not on line PO, draw a line PM (in pink). For construction simplicity and only if line PQ is not parallel to line m, lines PM and PQ may be coincident. Draw a line MX (in brown). Construct a parallel (in dark purple) of line PM through the center O of the provided circle. The parallel intersects the line MX at a point N. Construct a parallel (in yellow) of line m through the point N. The parallel intersects the provided circle at points C and D. If the parallel does not intersect the provided circle then neither does the line m intersect circle P(Q). Draw lines CX and DX (both in dark blue). These lines both intersect line m at points A and B, respectively. Points A and B are the desired points of intersection between the line m and the circle P(Q). Intersecting two circles (Construction
