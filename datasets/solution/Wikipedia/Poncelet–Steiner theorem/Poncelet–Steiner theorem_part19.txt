Conclusion: The second basic construction - defining a circle with two points - never needed an arc to be constructed with the compass in order for the circle to be utilized in constructions - namely the intersections with circles and with lines which, together, are the essence of all constructions involving a circle. Thus defining a circle by its center and by any arbitrary point on its circumference is sufficient to fully describe the entire circle and construct with it. As such, the arc only serves an aesthetic purpose. Basic construction #2 is satisfied. Since all five basic constructions have been shown to be achievable with only a straightedge, provided that a single circle with its center is placed in the plane, this proves the Poncelet-Steiner theorem.
