line: If the line passes through the center of a circle, the segment defined by the diameter through the circle is bisected by the center of the circle. In the general case, however, any other line in the plane may have a bisected segment constructed onto it. This construction does require the use of the given circle. Construction of an arbitrary bisected line segment on a given line. Given a line, m (in black), and a circle centered at A, we wish to create points E, B, and H on the line such that B is the midpoint: Draw an arbitrary line (in red) passing through the given circles center, A, and the desired midpoint B (chosen arbitrarily) on the line m. Notice that the red line, AB, passes through the center of the circle and highlights a diameter, bisected by the circle center. Any parallel may be made from this line according to the previous construction. Choose an arbitrary point C on the given circle (which does not lie on the perpendicular of AB through the circle center). Construct a line (in orange), passing through C, that is parallel to the red line AB. This parallel intersects the given circle at D. This parallel also intersects the black line m at E, defining one end of the line segment. Create two lines (in green), AC and AD, that each pass through the given circles center. These green lines intersect the given circle at points G and F, respectively. Line FG (in blue) intersects the line m at H, defining the other endpoint of the line segment. Constructing a parallel of any
