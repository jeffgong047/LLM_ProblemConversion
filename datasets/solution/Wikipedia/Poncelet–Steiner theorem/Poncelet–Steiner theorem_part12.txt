line: This construction does require the use of the given circle. In order to generalize the parallel line construction to all possible lines, not just the ones with a collinear bisected line segment, it becomes necessary to have additional information. In keeping with the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, a circle (with center) is the object of choice for this construction. To construct a parallel line of any given line, through any point in the plane, we trivially combine two constructions: Any line from which a parallel is to be made must have a bisected segment constructed onto it, if one does not already exist. A parallel is then constructed according to the previous parallel construction involving the collinear bisected segment. In general, however, a parallel may be constructed from any pair of lines which are already parallel to one another; thus a third parallel may be produced from any two, without the use of a circle. Additionally, a parallel of any line may be constructed whenever there exists in the plane any parallelogram, also without the use of a given circle. Constructing a perpendicular
