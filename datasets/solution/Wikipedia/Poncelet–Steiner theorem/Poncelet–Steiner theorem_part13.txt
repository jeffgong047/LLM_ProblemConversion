line: Construction of a perpendicular line. This construction does require the use of the given circle and takes advantage of Thales's theorem. From a given line m, and a given point A in the plane, a perpendicular to the line is to be constructed through the point. Provided is the given circle O(r). If the desired line from which a perpendicular is to be made, m, does not pass through the given circle (or it also passes through the given circle's center), then a new parallel line (in red) may be constructed arbitrarily such that it does pass through the given circle but not its center, and the perpendicular is to be made from this line instead. This red line which passes through the given circle but not its center, will intersect the given circle in two points, B and C. Draw a line BO, through the circle center. This line intersects the given circle at point D. Draw a line DC. This line is perpendicular to the red (and black) lines, BC and m. Construct a parallel of line DC through point A using previous constructions. A perpendicular of the original black line, m, now exists in the plane, and a parallel of it may be constructed through any point in the plane. An alternative construction allows a perpendicular to be constructed without the given circle, provided there exists in the plane any square. Constructing the midpoint of any
