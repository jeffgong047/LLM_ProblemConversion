Approximations: It is worthwhile to point out that in all construction paradigms, the implicit rule is that all constructions must terminate in a finite number of applications of the compass and straightedge, and produce the exact intended results. Entire discussions could be made with either of these conditions alleviated. For any otherwise non-constructible figure: It is possible to approximate a construction to a predetermined level of precision using only compass and straightedge, using a reiterative approach. Exact construction may become possible at the infinite limit of this convergent process. For example, an angle trisection may be performed exactly using an infinite sequence of angle bisections. If the construction is terminated at some finite iteration, an accurate approximation of a trisection can be achieved to arbitrary precision. Although each point, line or circle is a valid construction, what it aims to approximate can never truly be achieved. There are, of course, exactly constructible figures that are reasonable approximations for non-constructible figures, such as relatively simple non-iterative constructions for an approximation of the heptagon.
