segment: Construction of the midpoint of an arbitrary line segment from a non-collinear parallel line. Given is a line segment AB, which is to be bisected. Optionally, a parallel line m exists in the plane. If the line m, which is parallel to line segment AB, does not exist in the plane then it must be constructed according to earlier constructions using the given circle in the plane (not depicted). A given circle in the plane is not required for this construction if the parallel already exists. The parallel may be placed in the plane arbitrarily, so long as it is not collinear with the line segment. Arbitrarily choose a point C in the plane which is not collinear with the line or the line segment. Draw a line AC (in red), intersecting line m at point D. Draw a line BC (in orange), intersecting line m at point E. Draw two lines, AE and BD (each in light green), intersecting each other at point X Draw a line CX (in blue), intersecting segment AB at point M. Point M is the desired midpoint of segment AB. Line CX also bisects segment DE For added perspective, in some sense this construction is a variant of a previous construction of a parallel from a bisected line segment. It is the same set of lines when taken on whole, but constructed in a different order, and from a different initial set of conditions, arriving at a different end goal.
