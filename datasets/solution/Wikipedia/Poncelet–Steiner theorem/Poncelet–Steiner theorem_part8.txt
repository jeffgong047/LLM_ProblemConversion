proof: In general constructions there are often several variations that will produce the same result. The choices made in such a variant can be made without loss of generality. However, when a construction is being used to prove that something can be done, it is not necessary to describe all these various choices and, for the sake of clarity of exposition, only one variant will be given below. The variants chosen below are done so for their ubiquity in application rather than their simplicity under any particular set of special conditions. In the constructions below, a circle defined by a center point P and a point on its circumference, Q, through which the arc of the circle passes, is denoted P(Q). As most circles are not compass-drawn, center and circumference points are named explicitly. Per the theorem, when a compass-drawn circle is provided it is simply referred to as the given circle or the provided circle. The provided circle should always be assumed to be placed arbitrarily in the plane with an arbitrary radius (i.e. in general position). The intersection points between any line and the given circle may be found directly. The Poncelet-Steiner Theorem does not prohibit the normal treatment of circles already drawn in the plane; normal construction rules apply. The theorem only prohibits the construction of new circular arcs with a compass. Steiner constructions and those constructions herein proving the Poncelet-Steiner theorem require the arbitrary placement of points in space. In some construction paradigms - such as in the geometric definition of the constructible number - this may be prohibited. Some preliminary
