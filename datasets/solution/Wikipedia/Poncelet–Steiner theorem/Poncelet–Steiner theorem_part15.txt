circles: Straightedge-only construction of the radical axis between circles. This construction does require the use of the given circle (which is not depicted) for the referenced sub-constructions. Suppose two circles A(B) and C(D) are implicitly given, defined only by the points A, B, C, and D in the plane, with their centers defined, but are not compass-constructed. The radical axis, line m, between the two circles may be constructed: Draw a line AC (in orange) through the circle centers. Draw a line segment BD (in red) between the points on the circumference of the circles. Find the midpoint, M, of segment BD. Draw lines AM and CM (both in light green), connecting the segment midpoint with each of the circle centers. Construct a line j (in purple) passing through point B, and perpendicular to AM. Construct a line k (in dark green) passing through point D, and perpendicular to CM. Lines j and k intersect at point X. If the lines j and k are parallel then the segment midpoint M is on the line AC, and the construction will fail. An alternative approach is required (see below). Construct a line m (in dark blue) perpendicular to line AC and passing through point X. Line m is the desired radical axis. Resolution of failed
