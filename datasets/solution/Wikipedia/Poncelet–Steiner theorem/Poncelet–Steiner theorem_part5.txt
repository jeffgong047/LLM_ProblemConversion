constructions: The term Steiner construction typically refers to any geometric construction that utilizes the straightedge tool only, and is sometimes simply called a straightedge-only construction. No stipulations are made about what geometric objects already exist in the plane, and no implications are made about what is or is not possible to construct. Thus, all constructions adhering to the Poncelet-Steiner theorem are Steiner constructions, though not all Steiner constructions abide by the standard of having only one circle with its center provided. The Poncelet-Steiner theorem does not require an actual compass - it is presumed that the circle preexists in the plane - therefore all constructions herein demonstrating the Poncelet-Steiner theorem are Steiner constructions.
