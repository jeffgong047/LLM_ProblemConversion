channels: A strong converse theorem, proven by Wolfowitz in 1957,[3] states that, Pe≥1−4An(R−C)2−e−n(R−C)2_e≥1-4A/n(R-C)^2-e^-n(R-C)/2 for some finite positive constant A. While the weak converse states that the error probability is bounded away from zero as n goes to infinity, the strong converse states that the error goes to 1. Thus, C is a sharp threshold between perfectly reliable and completely unreliable communication. Channel coding theorem for non-stationary memoryless
