channels: We assume that the channel is memoryless, but its transition probabilities change with time, in a fashion known at the transmitter as well as the receiver. Then the channel capacity is given by C=liminfmaxp(X1),p(X2),...1n∑i=1nI(Xi;Yi).=liminfmax_p^(X_1),p^(X_2),...1/n∑_i=1^nI(X_i;Y_i). The maximum is attained at the capacity achieving distributions for each respective channel. That is, C=liminf1n∑i=1nCi=liminf1/n∑_i=1^nC_i where Ci_i is the capacity of the ith channel.
