Proofs: Several proofs of the theorem have been given.[3][4] Two proofs are given in the following. The first one is very elementary, using only basic properties of triangle areas.[3] However, several cases have to be considered, depending on the position of the point O. The second proof uses barycentric coordinates and vectors, but is somehow more natural and not case dependent. Moreover, it works in any affine plane over any field. Using triangle
