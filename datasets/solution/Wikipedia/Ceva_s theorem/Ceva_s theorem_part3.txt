areas: First, the sign of the left-hand side is positive since either all three of the ratios are positive, the case where O is inside the triangle (upper diagram), or one is positive and the other two are negative, the case O is outside the triangle (lower diagram shows one case). To check the magnitude, note that the area of a triangle of a given height is proportional to its base. So |△BOD||△COD|=BD¯DC¯=|△BAD||△CAD|.||/||=BD/DC=||/||. Therefore, BD¯DC¯=|△BAD|−|△BOD||△CAD|−|△COD|=|△ABO||△CAO|.BD/DC=||-||/||-||=||/||. (Replace the minus with a plus if A and O are on opposite sides of BC.) Similarly, CE¯EA¯=|△BCO||△ABO|,CE/EA=||/||, and AF¯FB¯=|△CAO||△BCO|.AF/FB=||/||. Multiplying these three equations gives |AF¯FB¯⋅BD¯DC¯⋅CE¯EA¯|=1,|AF/FB·BD/DC·CE/EA|=1, as required. The theorem can also be proven easily using Menelaus' theorem.[5] From the transversal BOE of triangle △ACF, AB¯BF¯⋅FO¯OC¯⋅CE¯EA¯=−1AB/BF·FO/OC·CE/EA=-1 and from the transversal △AOD of triangle △BCF, BA¯AF¯⋅FO¯OC¯⋅CD¯DB¯=−1.BA/AF·FO/OC·CD/DB=-1. The theorem follows by dividing these two equations. The converse follows as a corollary.[3] Let D, E, F be given on the lines BC, AC, AB so that the equation holds. Let AD, BE meet at O and let F' be the point where CO crosses AB. Then by the theorem, the equation also holds for D, E, F'. Comparing the two, AF¯FB¯=AF′¯F′B¯AF/FB=AF'/F'B But at most one point can cut a segment in a given ratio so F = F’. Using barycentric
