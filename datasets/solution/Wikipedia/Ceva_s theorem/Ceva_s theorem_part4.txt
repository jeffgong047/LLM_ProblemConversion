coordinates: Given three points A, B, C that are not collinear, and a point O, that belongs to the same plane, the barycentric coordinates of O with respect of A, B, C are the unique three numbers λA,λB,λCλ_A,λ_B,λ_C such that λA+λB+λC=1,λ_A+λ_B+λ_C=1, and XO→=λAXA→+λBXB→+λCXC→,XO=λ_AXA+λ_BXB+λ_CXC, for every point X (for the definition of this arrow notation and further details, see Affine space). For Ceva's theorem, the point O is supposed to not belong to any line passing through two vertices of the triangle. This implies that λAλBλC≠0.λ_Aλ_Bλ_C≠0. If one takes for X the intersection F of the lines AB and OC (see figures), the last equation may be rearranged into FO→−λCFC→=λAFA→+λBFB→.FO-λ_CFC=λ_AFA+λ_BFB. The left-hand side of this equation is a vector that has the same direction as the line CF, and the right-hand side has the same direction as the line AB. These lines have different directions since A, B, C are not collinear. It follows that the two members of the equation equal the zero vector, and λAFA→+λBFB→=0.λ_AFA+λ_BFB=0. It follows that AF¯FB¯=λBλA,AF/FB=λ_B/λ_A, where the left-hand-side fraction is the signed ratio of the lengths of the collinear line segments AF and FB. The same reasoning shows BD¯DC¯=λCλBandCE¯EA¯=λAλC.BD/DC=λ_C/λ_B and CE/EA=λ_A/λ_C. Ceva's theorem results immediately by taking the product of the three last equations.
