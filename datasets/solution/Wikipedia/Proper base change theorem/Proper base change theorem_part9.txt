change: The base change map g∗(Rrf∗F)→Rrf∗′(g′∗F)^*(R^rf_*ℱ)^rf'_*(g'^*ℱ) is an isomorphism for a quasi-coherent sheaf Fℱ (on X), provided that the map g:S′→S:S' is flat (together with a number of technical conditions: f needs to be a separated morphism of finite type, the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).[7] Flat base change in the derived
