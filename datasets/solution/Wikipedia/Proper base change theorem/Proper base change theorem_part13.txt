sheaves: For étale torsion sheaves Fℱ, there are two base change results referred to as proper and smooth base change, respectively: base change holds if f:X→S:X is proper.[13] It also holds if g is smooth, provided that f is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of Fℱ is prime to the characteristic of the residue fields of X.[14] Closely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let X be a variety over a separably closed field and Fℱ a constructible sheaf on Xet_et. Then Hr(X,F)^r(X,ℱ) are finite in each of the following cases: X is complete, or Fℱ has no p-torsion, where p is the characteristic of k. Under additional assumptions, Deninger (1988) extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.
