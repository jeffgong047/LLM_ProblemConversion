change: Proper base change theorems for quasi-coherent sheaves apply in the following situation: f:X→S:X is a proper morphism between noetherian schemes, and Fℱ is a coherent sheaf which is flat over S (i.e., Fxℱ_x is flat over OS,f(x)𝒪_S,f(x)). In this situation, the following statements hold:[5] "Semicontinuity theorem": For each p≥0≥0, the function s↦dimk(s)⁡Hp(Xs,Fs):S→Z↦_k(s)H^p(X_s,ℱ_s):S→ℤ is upper semicontinuous. The function s↦χ(Fs)↦χ(ℱ_s) is locally constant, where χ(F)χ(ℱ) denotes the Euler characteristic. "Grauert's theorem": if S is reduced and connected, then for each p≥0≥0 the following are equivalent s↦dimk(s)⁡Hp(Xs,Fs)↦_k(s)H^p(X_s,ℱ_s) is constant. Rpf∗F^pf_*ℱ is locally free and the natural map Rpf∗F⊗OSk(s)→Hp(Xs,Fs)^pf_*ℱ⊗_𝒪_Sk(s)^p(X_s,ℱ_s) is an isomorphism for all s∈S. Furthermore, if these conditions hold, then the natural map Rp−1f∗F⊗OSk(s)→Hp−1(Xs,Fs)^p-1f_*ℱ⊗_𝒪_Sk(s)^p-1(X_s,ℱ_s) is an isomorphism for all s∈S. If, for some p, Hp(Xs,Fs)=0^p(X_s,ℱ_s)=0 for all s∈S, then the natural map Rp−1f∗F⊗OSk(s)→Hp−1(Xs,Fs)^p-1f_*ℱ⊗_𝒪_Sk(s)^p-1(X_s,ℱ_s) is an isomorphism for all s∈S. As the stalk of the sheaf Rpf∗F^pf_*ℱ is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under f, this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension".[6] These statements are proved using the following fact, where in addition to the above assumptions S=Spec⁡A=SpecA: there is a finite complex 0→K0→K1→⋯→Kn→00^0^1→⋯^n→0 of finitely generated projective A-modules and a natural isomorphism of functors Hp(X×SSpec−,F⊗A−)→Hp(K∙⊗A−),p≥0^p(X×_SSpec-,ℱ⊗_A-)^p(K^∙⊗_A-),p≥0 on the category of A-algebras.
