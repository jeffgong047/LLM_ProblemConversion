map: Image functors for sheaves direct image f∗ inverse image f∗ direct image with compact support f! exceptional inverse image Rf! f∗⇆f∗^*_* (R)f!⇆(R)f!(R)f_!⇆(R)f^! Base change theorems vte The base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following base change map g∗(Rrf∗F)→Rrf∗′(g′∗F)^*(R^rf_*ℱ)^rf'_*(g'^*ℱ) is an isomorphism, where X′→g′Xf′↓↓fS′→gS[ X' g'→ X; f'↓ ; S' g→ S; ] are continuous maps between topological spaces that form a Cartesian square and Fℱ is a sheaf on X.[1] Here Rif∗F^if_*ℱ denotes the higher direct image of Fℱ under f, i.e., the derived functor of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor f∗_*. This map exists without any assumptions on the maps f and g. It is constructed as follows: since g′∗'^* is left adjoint to g∗′'_*, there is a natural map (called unit map) id→g∗′∘g′∗id'_*'^* and so Rrf∗→Rrf∗∘g∗′∘g′∗.^rf_*^rf_*'_*'^*. The Grothendieck spectral sequence then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in: Rrf∗∘g∗′∘g′∗→Rr(f∘g′)∗∘g′∗=Rr(g∘f′)∗∘g′∗→g∗∘Rrf∗′∘g′∗.^rf_*'_*'^*^r(f')_*'^*=R^r(g')_*'^*_*^rf'_*'^*. Combining this with the above yields Rrf∗→g∗∘Rrf∗′∘g′∗.^rf_*_*^rf'_*'^*. Using the adjointness of g∗^* and g∗_* finally yields the desired map. The above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the affine schemes X=Spec⁡(B),S=Spec⁡(A),S′=Spec⁡(A′)=Spec(B),S=Spec(A),S'=Spec(A') and, consequently, X′=Spec⁡(B′)'=Spec(B'), and the quasi-coherent sheaf F:=M ℱ:=M̃ associated to the B-module M. It is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all Rrf∗^rf_* at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the derived category of sheaves on S': g∗Rf∗(F)→Rf∗′(g′∗F)^*Rf_*(ℱ)'_*(g'^*ℱ) where Rf∗_* denotes the (total) derived functor of f∗_*. General
