Applications: In close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an open immersion f, g∗f∗F→f∗′g′∗F^*f_*ℱ'_*g'^*ℱ is not usually an isomorphism.[15] Instead the extension by zero functor f!_! satisfies an isomorphism g∗f!F→f!′g∗F.^*f_!ℱ'_!g^*ℱ. This fact and the proper base change suggest to define the direct image functor with compact support for a map f by Rf!:=Rp∗j!_!:=Rp_*j_! where f=p∘j=p is a compactification of f, i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map. The proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification. Moreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for g∗_* vs. Rf!_! does hold for non-proper maps f. For the structural map f:X→S=Spec⁡k:X=Speck of a scheme over a field k, the individual cohomologies of Rf!(F)_!(ℱ), denoted by Hc∗(X,F)_c^*(X,ℱ) referred to as cohomology with compact support. It is an important variant of usual étale cohomology. Similar ideas are also used to construct an analogue of the functor Rf!_! in A1-homotopy theory.[16][17] See
