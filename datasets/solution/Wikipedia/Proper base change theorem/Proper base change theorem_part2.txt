Introduction: A simple base change phenomenon arises in commutative algebra when A is a commutative ring and B and A' are two A-algebras. Let B′=B⊗AA′'=B⊗_AA'. In this situation, given a B-module M, there is an isomorphism (of A' -modules): (M⊗BB′)A′≅(MA)⊗AA′.(M⊗_BB')_A'≅(M_A)⊗_AA'. Here the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e., MA_A is M, but regarded as an A-module. Indeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing M⊗BB′=M⊗BB⊗AA′≅M⊗AA′.⊗_BB'=M⊗_BB⊗_AA'⊗_AA'. Thus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism. The base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.
