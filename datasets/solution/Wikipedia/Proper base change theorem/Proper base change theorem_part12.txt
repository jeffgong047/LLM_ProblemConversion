applications: Proper base change also holds in the context of complex manifolds and complex analytic spaces.[10] The theorem on formal functions is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a completion operation. The see-saw principle and the theorem of the cube, which are foundational facts in the theory of abelian varieties, are a consequence of proper base change.[11] A base-change also holds for D-modules: if X, S, X', and S' are smooth varieties (but f and g need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism g†∫fF→∫f′g′†F,^†∫_fℱ→∫_f'g'^†ℱ, where −†-^† and ∫∫ denote the inverse and direct image functors for D-modules.[12] Base change for étale
