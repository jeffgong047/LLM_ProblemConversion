category: A far reaching extension of flat base change is possible when considering the base change map Lg∗Rf∗(F)→Rf∗′(Lg′∗F)^*Rf_*(ℱ)'_*(Lg'^*ℱ) in the derived category of sheaves on S', similarly as mentioned above. Here Lg∗^* is the (total) derived functor of the pullback of O𝒪-modules (because g∗G=OX⊗g−1OSg−1G^*𝒢=𝒪_X⊗_g^-1𝒪_Sg^-1𝒢 involves a tensor product, g∗^* is not exact when g is not flat and therefore is not equal to its derived functor Lg∗^*). This map is a quasi-isomorphism provided that the following conditions are satisfied:[8] S is quasi-compact and f is quasi-compact and quasi-separated, Fℱ is an object in Db(OX-mod)^b(𝒪_X-mod), the bounded derived category of OX𝒪_X-modules, and its cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent (for example, Fℱ could be a bounded complex of quasi-coherent sheaves) X and S′' are Tor-independent over S, meaning that if x∈X and s′∈S′'' satisfy f(x)=s=g(s′)(x)=s=g(s'), then for all integers p≥1≥1, TorpOS,s⁡(OX,x,OS′,s′)=0Tor_p^𝒪_S,s(𝒪_X,x,𝒪_S',s')=0. One of the following conditions is satisfied: Fℱ has finite flat amplitude relative to f, meaning that it is quasi-isomorphic in D−(f−1OS-mod)^-(f^-1𝒪_S-mod) to a complex F′ℱ' such that (F′)i(ℱ')^i is f−1OS^-1𝒪_S-flat for all i outside some bounded interval [m,n][m,n]; equivalently, there exists an interval [m,n][m,n] such that for any complex G𝒢 in D−(f−1OS-mod)^-(f^-1𝒪_S-mod), one has Tori⁡(F,G)=0Tor_i(ℱ,𝒢)=0 for all i outside [m,n][m,n]; or g has finite Tor-dimension, meaning that OS′𝒪_S' has finite flat amplitude relative to g. One advantage of this formulation is that the flatness hypothesis has been weakened. However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the Grothendieck spectral sequence. Base change in derived algebraic
