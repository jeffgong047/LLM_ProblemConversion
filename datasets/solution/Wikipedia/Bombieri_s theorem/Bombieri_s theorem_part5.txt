theorem: Bombieri & Lang (1970) and Bombieri (1970) generalized the result to functions of several variables. Bombieri showed that if K is an algebraic number field and f1, ..., fN are meromorphic functions of d complex variables of order at most ρ generating a field K(f1, ..., fN) of transcendence degree at least d + 1 that is closed under all partial derivatives, then the set of points where all the functions fn have values in K is contained in an algebraic hypersurface in Cd of degree at most d((d+1)ρ[K:Q]+1).((d+1)ρ[K:ℚ]+1). Waldschmidt (1979, theorem 5.1.1) gave a simpler proof of Bombieri's theorem, with a slightly stronger bound of d(ρ1 + ... + ρd+1)[K:Q] for the degree, where the ρj are the orders of d + 1 algebraically independent functions. The special case d = 1 gives the Schneider–Lang theorem, with a bound of (ρ1 + ρ2)[K:Q] for the number of points.
