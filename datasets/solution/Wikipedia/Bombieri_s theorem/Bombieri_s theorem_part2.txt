Statement: Fix a number field K and meromorphic f1, ..., fN, of which at least two are algebraically independent and have orders ρ1 and ρ2, and such that fj′ ∈ K[f1, ..., fN] for any j. Then there are at most (ρ1+ρ2)[K:Q](ρ_1+ρ_2)[K:ℚ] distinct complex numbers ω1, ..., ωm such that fi(ωj) ∈ K for all combinations of i and j.
