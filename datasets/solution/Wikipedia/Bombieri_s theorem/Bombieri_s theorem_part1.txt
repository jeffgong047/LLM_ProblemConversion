In mathematics, the Schneider–Lang theorem is a refinement by Lang (1966) of a theorem of Schneider (1949) about the transcendence of values of meromorphic functions. The theorem implies both the Hermite–Lindemann and Gelfond–Schneider theorems, and implies the transcendence of some values of elliptic functions and elliptic modular functions.
