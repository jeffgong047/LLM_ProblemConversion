Proof: To prove the result Lang took two algebraically independent functions from f1, ..., fN, say, f and g, and then created an auxiliary function F ∈ K[ f, g]. Using Siegel's lemma, he then showed that one could assume F vanished to a high order at the ω1, ..., ωm. Thus a high-order derivative of F takes a value of small size at one such ωis, "size" here referring to an algebraic property of a number. Using the maximum modulus principle, Lang also found a separate estimate for absolute values of derivatives of F. Standard results connect the size of a number and its absolute value, and the combined estimates imply the claimed bound on m. Bombieri's
