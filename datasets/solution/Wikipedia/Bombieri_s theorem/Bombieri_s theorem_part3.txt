Examples: If f1(z) = z and f2(z) = ez then the theorem implies the Hermite–Lindemann theorem that eα is transcendental for nonzero algebraic α: otherwise, α, 2α, 3α, ... would be an infinite number of values at which both f1 and f2 are algebraic. Similarly taking f1(z) = ez and f2(z) = eβz for β irrational algebraic implies the Gelfond–Schneider theorem that if α and αβ are algebraic, then α ∈ {0,1}: otherwise, log(α), 2log(α), 3log(α), ... would be an infinite number of values at which both f1 and f2 are algebraic. Recall that the Weierstrass P function satisfies the differential equation ℘′(z)2=4℘(z)3−g2℘(z)−g3.℘'(z)^2=4℘(z)^3-g_2℘(z)-g_3. Taking the three functions to be z, ℘(αz), ℘′(αz) shows that, for any algebraic α, if g2(α) and g3(α) are algebraic, then ℘(α) is transcendental. Taking the functions to be z and e f(z) for a polynomial f of degree ρ shows that the number of points where the functions are all algebraic can grow linearly with the order ρ = deg f.
