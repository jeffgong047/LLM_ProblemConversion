conjecture: As mentioned above, Gromoll and Meyer proved that if g has positive sectional curvature then the soul is a point. Cheeger and Gromoll conjectured that this would hold even if g had nonnegative sectional curvature, with positivity only required of all sectional curvatures at a single point.[7] This soul conjecture was proved by Grigori Perelman, who established the more powerful fact that Sharafutdinov's retraction is a Riemannian submersion, and even a submetry.[8]
