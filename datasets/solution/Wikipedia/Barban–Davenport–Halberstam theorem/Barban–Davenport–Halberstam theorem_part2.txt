Statement: Let a be coprime to q and ϑ(x;q,a)=∑p≤x;p≡amodqlog⁡pϑ(x;q,a)=∑_p ; pq} be a weighted count of primes in the arithmetic progression a mod q. We have ϑ(x;q,a)=xφ(q)+E(x;q,a)ϑ(x;q,a)=x/φ(q)+E(x;q,a)} where φ is Euler's totient function and the error term E is small compared to x. We take a sum of squares of error terms V(x,Q)=∑q≤Q∑amodq|E(x;q,a)|2.(x,Q)=∑_q∑_aq|E(x;q,a)|^2 Then we have V(x,Q)=O(Qxlog⁡x)+O(x2(log⁡x)−A)(x,Q)=O(Qx)+O(x^2()^-A)} for 1≤Q≤x1 and every positive A, where O is Landau's Big O notation. This form of the theorem is due to Gallagher. The result of Barban is valid only for Q≤x(log⁡x)−B()^-B for some B depending on A, and the result of Davenport–Halberstam has B = A + 5. See
