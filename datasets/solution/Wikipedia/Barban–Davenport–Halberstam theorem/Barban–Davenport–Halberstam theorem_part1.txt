In mathematics, the Barban–Davenport–Halberstam theorem is a statement about the distribution of prime numbers in an arithmetic progression. It is known that in the long run primes are distributed equally across possible progressions with the same difference. Theorems of the Barban–Davenport–Halberstam type give estimates for the error term, determining how close to uniform the distributions are.
