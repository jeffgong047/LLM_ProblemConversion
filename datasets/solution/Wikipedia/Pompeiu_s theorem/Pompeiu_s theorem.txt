On line segments from a point to the vertices of an equilateral triangle


Pompeiu's theorem is a result of plane geometry, discovered by the Romanian mathematician Dimitrie Pompeiu. The theorem is simple, but not classical. It states the following:

Given an equilateral triangle ABC in the plane, and a point P in the plane of the triangle ABC, the lengths PA, PB, and PC form the sides of a (maybe, degenerate) triangle.[1][2]
Proof of Pompeiu's theorem with Pompeiu triangle △PCP′'
The proof is quick.  Consider a rotation of 60° about the point B.  Assume A maps to C, and P maps to P '.  Then PB=P′B'B, and ∠PBP′=60∘'0^∘.  Hence triangle PBP ' is equilateral and PP′=PB'.  Then PA=P′C'C.  Thus, triangle PCP ' has sides equal to PA, PB, and PC and the proof by construction is complete (see drawing).[1]
Further investigations reveal that if P is not in the interior of the triangle, but rather on the circumcircle, then PA, PB, PC form a degenerate triangle, with the largest being equal to the sum of the others, this observation is also known as Van Schooten's theorem.[1]
Generally, by the point P and the lengths to the vertices of the equilateral triangle - PA, PB, and PC two equilateral triangles ( the larger and the smaller) with sides a1_1 and a2_2 are defined: 

a1,22=12(PA2+PB2+PC2±43△(PA,PB,PC))a_1,2^2   =1/2(PA^2+PB^2+PC^2±4√(3)_(PA,PB,PC)).
The symbol  △  denotes the area of the triangle whose sides have lengths PA, PB, PC.[3]
Pompeiu published the theorem in 1936, however August Ferdinand Möbius had published a more general theorem about four points in the Euclidean plane already in 1852. In this paper Möbius also derived the statement of Pompeiu's theorem explicitly as a special case of his more general theorem. For this reason the theorem is also known as the Möbius-Pompeiu theorem.[4]
