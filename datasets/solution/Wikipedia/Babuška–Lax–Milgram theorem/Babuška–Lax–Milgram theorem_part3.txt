theorem: In 1971, Babuška provided the following generalization of Lax and Milgram's earlier result, which begins by dispensing with the requirement that U and V be the same space. Let U and V be two real Hilbert spaces and let B : U × V → R be a continuous bilinear functional. Suppose also that B is weakly coercive: for some constant c > 0 and all u ∈ U, sup‖v‖=1|B(u,v)|≥c‖u‖sup_v=1|B(u,v)|u and, for all 0 ≠ v ∈ V, sup‖u‖=1|B(u,v)|>0sup_u=1|B(u,v)|>0 Then, for all f ∈ V∗, there exists a unique solution u = uf ∈ U to the weak problem B(uf,v)=⟨f,v⟩forallv∈V.(u_f,v)=,v⟩v. Moreover, the solution depends continuously on the given data: ‖uf‖≤1c‖f‖.u_f≤1/cf. See
