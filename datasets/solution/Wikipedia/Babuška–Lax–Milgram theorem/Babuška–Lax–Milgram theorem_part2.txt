Background: In the modern, functional-analytic approach to the study of partial differential equations, one does not attempt to solve a given partial differential equation directly, but by using the structure of the vector space of possible solutions, e.g. a Sobolev space W k,p. Abstractly, consider two real normed spaces U and V with their continuous dual spaces U∗ and V∗ respectively. In many applications, U is the space of possible solutions; given some partial differential operator Λ : U → V∗ and a specified element f ∈ V∗, the objective is to find a u ∈ U such that Λu=f.=f. However, in the weak formulation, this equation is only required to hold when "tested" against all other possible elements of V. This "testing" is accomplished by means of a bilinear function B : U × V → R which encodes the differential operator Λ; a weak solution to the problem is to find a u ∈ U such that B(u,v)=⟨f,v⟩forallv∈V.(u,v)=,v⟩v. The achievement of Lax and Milgram in their 1954 result was to specify sufficient conditions for this weak formulation to have a unique solution that depends continuously upon the specified datum f ∈ V∗: it suffices that U = V is a Hilbert space, that B is continuous, and that B is strongly coercive, i.e. |B(u,u)|≥c‖u‖2|B(u,u)|u^2 for some constant c > 0 and all u ∈ U. For example, in the solution of the Poisson equation on a bounded, open domain Ω ⊂ Rn, −Δu(x)=f(x),x∈Ω;u(x)=0,x∈∂Ω;-(x)=f(x), x∈Ω; u(x)=0, x∈∂Ω; the space U could be taken to be the Sobolev space H01(Ω) with dual H−1(Ω); the former is a subspace of the Lp space V = L2(Ω); the bilinear form B associated to −Δ is the L2(Ω) inner product of the derivatives: B(u,v)=∫Ω∇u(x)⋅∇v(x)dx.(u,v)=∫_Ω(x)·(x) dx. Hence, the weak formulation of the Poisson equation, given f ∈ L2(Ω), is to find uf such that ∫Ω∇uf(x)⋅∇v(x)dx=∫Ωf(x)v(x)dxforallv∈H01(Ω).∫_Ω_f(x)·(x) dx=∫_Ωf(x)v(x) dxv_0^1(Ω). Statement of the
