proof: Aldo Andreotti and Theodore Frankel[5] recognized that Lefschetz's theorem could be recast using Morse theory.[6] Here the parameter t plays the role of a Morse function. The basic tool in this approach is the Andreottiâ€“Frankel theorem, which states that a complex affine variety of complex dimension n (and thus real dimension 2n) has the homotopy type of a CW-complex of (real) dimension n. This implies that the relative homology groups of Y in X are trivial in degree less than n. The long exact sequence of relative homology then gives the theorem. Thom's and Bott's
