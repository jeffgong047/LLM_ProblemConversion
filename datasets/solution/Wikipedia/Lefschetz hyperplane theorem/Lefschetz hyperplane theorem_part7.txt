sheaves: Michael Artin and Alexander Grothendieck found a generalization of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to the case where the coefficients of the cohomology lie not in a field but instead in a constructible sheaf. They prove that for a constructible sheaf F on an affine variety U, the cohomology groups Hk(U,F)^k(U,F) vanish whenever k>n>n.[10] The Lefschetz theorem in other cohomology
