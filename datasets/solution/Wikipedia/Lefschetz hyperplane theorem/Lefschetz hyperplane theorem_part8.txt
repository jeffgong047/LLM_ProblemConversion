theories: The motivation behind Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible sheaves was to give a proof that could be adapted to the setting of étale and ℓℓ-adic cohomology. Up to some restrictions on the constructible sheaf, the Lefschetz theorem remains true for constructible sheaves in positive characteristic. The theorem can also be generalized to intersection homology. In this setting, the theorem holds for highly singular spaces. A Lefschetz-type theorem also holds for Picard groups.[11] Hard Lefschetz
