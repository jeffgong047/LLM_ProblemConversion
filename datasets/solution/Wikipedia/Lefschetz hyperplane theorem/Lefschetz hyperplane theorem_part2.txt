varieties: Let X be an n-dimensional complex projective algebraic variety in CPN, and let Y be a hyperplane section of X such that U = X ∖ Y is smooth. The Lefschetz theorem refers to any of the following statements:[1][2] The natural map Hk(Y, Z) → Hk(X, Z) in singular homology is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is surjective for k = n − 1. The natural map Hk(X, Z) → Hk(Y, Z) in singular cohomology is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is injective for k = n − 1. The natural map πk(Y, Z) → πk(X, Z) is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is surjective for k = n − 1. Using a long exact sequence, one can show that each of these statements is equivalent to a vanishing theorem for certain relative topological invariants. In order, these are: The relative singular homology groups Hk(X, Y, Z) are zero for k≤n−1-1. The relative singular cohomology groups Hk(X, Y, Z) are zero for k≤n−1-1. The relative homotopy groups πk(X, Y) are zero for k≤n−1-1. Lefschetz's
