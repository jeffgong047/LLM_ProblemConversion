groups: Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer found that under certain restrictions, it is possible to prove a Lefschetz-type theorem for the Hodge groups Hp,q. Specifically, assume that Y is smooth and that the line bundle OX(Y)𝒪_X(Y) is ample. Then the restriction map Hp,q(X) → Hp,q(Y) is an isomorphism if p + q < n − 1 and is injective if p + q = n − 1.[8][9] By Hodge theory, these cohomology groups are equal to the sheaf cohomology groups Hq(X,⋀pΩX)^q(X,⋀^pΩ_X) and Hq(Y,⋀pΩY)^q(Y,⋀^pΩ_Y). Therefore, the theorem follows from applying the Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem to Hq(X,⋀pΩX|Y)^q(X,⋀^pΩ_X|_Y) and using a long exact sequence. Combining this proof with the universal coefficient theorem nearly yields the usual Lefschetz theorem for cohomology with coefficients in any field of characteristic zero. It is, however, slightly weaker because of the additional assumptions on Y. Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible
