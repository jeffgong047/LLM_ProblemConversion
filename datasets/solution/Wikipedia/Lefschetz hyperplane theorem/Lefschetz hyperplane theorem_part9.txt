theorem: See also: Lefschetz manifold Let X be a n-dimensional non-singular complex projective variety in CPNℂℙ^N. Then in the cohomology ring of X, the k-fold product with the cohomology class of a hyperplane gives an isomorphism between Hn−k(X)^n-k(X) and Hn+k(X)^n+k(X). This is the hard Lefschetz theorem, christened in French by Grothendieck more colloquially as the Théorème de Lefschetz vache.[12][13] It immediately implies the injectivity part of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The hard Lefschetz theorem in fact holds for any compact Kähler manifold, with the isomorphism in de Rham cohomology given by multiplication by a power of the class of the Kähler form. It can fail for non-Kähler manifolds: for example, Hopf surfaces have vanishing second cohomology groups, so there is no analogue of the second cohomology class of a hyperplane section. The hard Lefschetz theorem was proven for ℓℓ-adic cohomology of smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic by Pierre Deligne (1980).
