theorem: The theorem is formulated using Jacobi fields to measure the variation in geodesics. As the tangential part of a Jacobi field is independent of the geometry of the manifold, the theorem focuses on normal Jacobi fields, i.e. Jacobi fields which are orthogonal to the speed vector γ˙(t)γ̇(t) of the geodesic for all time t. Up to reparametrization, every variation of geodesics induces a normal Jacobi field. Jacobi fields are requested to vanish at time t=0=0 because the theorem measures the infinitesimal divergence (or convergence) of a family of geodesics issued from the same point γ(0)γ(0), and such a family induces a Jacobi field vanishing at t=0=0.
