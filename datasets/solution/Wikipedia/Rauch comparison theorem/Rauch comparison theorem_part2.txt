(February 2015) Let M,M ,M be Riemannian manifolds, on which are drawn unit speed geodesic segments γ:[0,T]→Mγ:[0,T] and γ :[0,T]→M γ:[0,T]→M. Assume that γ (0)γ(0) has no conjugate points along γ γ, and let J,J ,J be two normal Jacobi fields along γγ and γ γ such that : J(0)=0(0)=0 and J (0)=0J(0)=0 |DtJ(0)|=|D tJ (0)||D_tJ(0)|=|D_tJ(0)|. If the sectional curvature of every 2-plane Π⊂Tγ(t)MΠ_γ(t)Mcontaining γ˙(t)γ̇(t) is less or equal than the sectional curvature of every 2-plane Π ⊂Tγ (t)M Π_γ̃(t)M containing γ ˙(t)γ̇(t), then |J(t)|≥|J (t)||J(t)|≥|J(t)| for all t∈[0,T]∈[0,T].
