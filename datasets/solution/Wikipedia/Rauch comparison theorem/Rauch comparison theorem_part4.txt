theorems: Under very similar conditions, it is also possible to compare the Hessian of the distance function to a given point.[1] It is also possible to compare the Laplacian of this function (which is the trace of the Hessian), with some additional condition on one of the two manifolds: it is then enough to have an inequality on the Ricci curvature (which is the trace of the curvature tensor).[1] See
