Consequences: The open mapping theorem has several important consequences: If A:X→Y:X is a bijective continuous linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y,, then the inverse operator A−1:Y→X^-1:Y is continuous as well (this is called the bounded inverse theorem).[3] If A:X→Y:X is a linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y,, and if for every sequence (xn)(x_n) in X with xn→0_n→0 and Axn→y_n it follows that y=0,=0, then A is continuous (the closed graph theorem).[4]
