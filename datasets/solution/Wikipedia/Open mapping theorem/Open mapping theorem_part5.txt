Generalizations: Local convexity of X or Y is not essential to the proof, but completeness is: the theorem remains true in the case when X and Y are F-spaces. Furthermore, the theorem can be combined with the Baire category theorem in the following manner: Open mapping theorem for continuous maps[5][6] — Let A:X→Y:X be a continuous linear operator from a complete pseudometrizable TVS X onto a Hausdorff TVS Y.. If Im⁡AImA is nonmeager in Y then A:X→Y:X is a (surjective) open map and Y is a complete pseudometrizable TVS. Moreover, if X is assumed to be hausdorff (i.e. a F-space), then Y is also an F-space. Furthermore, in this latter case if N is the kernel of A,, then there is a canonical factorization of A in the form X→X/N→αY/Nα→Y where X/N/N is the quotient space (also an F-space) of X by the closed subspace N.. The quotient mapping X→X/N/N is open, and the mapping αα is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces.[7] An important special case of this theorem can also be stated as Theorem[8] — Let X and Y be two F-spaces. Then every continuous linear map of X onto Y is a TVS homomorphism, where a linear map u:X→Y:X is a topological vector space (TVS) homomorphism if the induced map u^:X/ker⁡(u)→Yû:X/(u) is a TVS-isomorphism onto its image. On the other hand, a more general formulation which implies the first can be given: Open mapping theorem[6] — Let A:X→Y:X be a surjective linear map from a complete pseudometrizable TVS X onto a TVS Y and suppose that at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied: Y is a Baire space, or X is locally convex and Y is a barrelled space, If A is a closed linear operator then A is an open mapping. If A is a continuous linear operator and Y is Hausdorff then A is (a closed linear operator and thus also) an open mapping. Nearly/Almost open linear maps A linear map A:X→Y:X between two topological vector spaces (TVSs) is called a nearly open map (or sometimes, an almost open map) if for every neighborhood U of the origin in the domain, the closure of its image cl⁡A(U)clA(U) is a neighborhood of the origin in Y..[9] Many authors use a different definition of "nearly/almost open map" that requires that the closure of A(U)(U) be a neighborhood of the origin in A(X)(X) rather than in Y,,[9] but for surjective maps these definitions are equivalent. A bijective linear map is nearly open if and only if its inverse is continuous.[9] Every surjective linear map from locally convex TVS onto a barrelled TVS is nearly open.[10] The same is true of every surjective linear map from a TVS onto a Baire TVS.[10] Open mapping theorem[11] — If a closed surjective linear map from a complete pseudometrizable TVS onto a Hausdorff TVS is nearly open then it is open.
