form: Open mapping theorem for Banach spaces (Rudin 1973, Theorem 2.11) — If X and Y are Banach spaces and A:X→Y:X is a surjective continuous linear operator, then A is an open map (that is, if U is an open set in X,, then A(U)(U) is open in Y). This proof uses the Baire category theorem, and completeness of both X and Y is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a normed space, but is true if X and Y are taken to be Fréchet spaces. Proof Suppose A:X→Y:X is a surjective continuous linear operator. In order to prove that A is an open map, it is sufficient to show that A maps the open unit ball in X to a neighborhood of the origin of Y.. Let U=B1X(0),V=B1Y(0).=B_1^X(0),V=B_1^Y(0). Then X=⋃k∈NkU.=⋃_k∈ℕkU. Since A is surjective: Y=A(X)=A(⋃k∈NkU)=⋃k∈NA(kU).=A(X)=A(⋃_k∈ℕkU)=⋃_k∈ℕA(kU). But Y is Banach so by Baire's category theorem ∃k∈N:(A(kU)¯)∘≠∅.∈ℕ: (A(kU))^∘≠∅. That is, we have c∈Y and r>0>0 such that Br(c)⊆(A(kU)¯)∘⊆A(kU)¯._r(c)⊆(A(kU))^∘⊆A(kU). Let v∈V,, then c,c+rv∈Br(c)⊆A(kU)¯.,c+rv_r(c)⊆A(kU). By continuity of addition and linearity, the difference rv satisfies rv∈A(kU)¯+A(kU)¯⊆A(kU)+A(kU)¯⊆A(2kU)¯,∈A(kU)+A(kU)⊆A(kU)+A(kU)⊆A(2kU), and by linearity again, V⊆A(LU)¯⊆A(LU) where we have set L=2k/r.=2k/r. It follows that for all y∈Y and all ϵ>0,ϵ>0, there exists some x∈X such that ‖x‖X≤L‖y‖Yand‖y−Ax‖Y<ϵ.(1) x_Xy_Y and y-Ax_Y<ϵ. (1) Our next goal is to show that V⊆A(2LU).(2LU). Let y∈V.. By (1), there is some x1_1 with ‖x1‖<Lx_1<L and ‖y−Ax1‖<1/2.y-Ax_1<1/2. Define a sequence (xn)(x_n) inductively as follows. Assume: ‖xn‖<L2n−1and‖y−A(x1+x2+⋯+xn)‖<12n.(2)x_n<L/2^n-1 and y-A(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n)<1/2^n. (2) Then by (1) we can pick xn+1_n+1 so that: ‖xn+1‖<L2nand‖y−A(x1+x2+⋯+xn)−A(xn+1)‖<12n+1,x_n+1<L/2^n and y-A(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n)-A(x_n+1)<1/2^n+1, so (2) is satisfied for xn+1._n+1. Let sn=x1+x2+⋯+xn._n=x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n. From the first inequality in (2), (sn)(s_n)is a Cauchy sequence, and since X is complete, sn_n converges to some x∈X.. By (2), the sequence Asn_n tends to y and so Ax=y=y by continuity of A.. Also, ‖x‖=limn→∞‖sn‖≤∑n=1∞‖xn‖<2L.x=lim_n→∞s_n≤∑_n=1^∞x_n<2L. This shows that y belongs to A(2LU),(2LU), so V⊆A(2LU)(2LU) as claimed. Thus the image A(U)(U) of the unit ball in X contains the open ball V/2L/2L of Y.. Hence, A(U)(U) is a neighborhood of the origin in Y,, and this concludes the proof. Related
