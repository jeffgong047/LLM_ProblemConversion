results: Theorem[2] — Let X and Y be Banach spaces, let BX_X and BY_Y denote their open unit balls, and let T:X→Y:X be a bounded linear operator. If δ>0δ>0 then among the following four statements we have (1)⟹(2)⟹(3)⟹(4)(1)(2)(3)(4) (with the same δδ) ‖T∗y∗‖≥δ‖y∗‖T^*y^*≥δy^* for all y∗∈Y∗^*^*; T(BX)¯⊇δBYT(B_X)⊇_Y; T(BX)⊇δBYT(B_X)⊇_Y; Im⁡T=YImT=Y (that is, T is surjective). Furthermore, if T is surjective then (1) holds for some δ>0δ>0
