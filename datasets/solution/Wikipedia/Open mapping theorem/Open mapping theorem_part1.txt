Condition for a linear operator to be open In functional analysis, the open mapping theorem, also known as the Banachâ€“Schauder theorem or the Banach theorem[1] (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder), is a fundamental result which states that if a bounded or continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map.
