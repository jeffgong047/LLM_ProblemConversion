Theorem: If for all natural numbers j and k, aj,k is a non-negative real number and aj,k ≤ aj+1,k, then[2]: 168 limj→∞∑kaj,k=∑klimj→∞aj,k.lim_j→∞∑_ka_j,k=∑_klim_j→∞a_j,k. The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that the columns are weakly increasing and bounded, and for each row, the series whose terms are given by this row has a convergent sum, then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term k is given by the limit of column k (which is also its supremum). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent. As an example, consider the infinite series of rows (1+1n)n=∑k=0n(nk)1nk=∑k=0n1k!×nn×n−1n×⋯×n−k+1n,(1+1/n)^n=∑_k=0^nnk1/n^k=∑_k=0^n1/k!×n/n×n-1/n×⋯×n-k+1/n, where n approaches infinity (the limit of this series is e). Here the matrix entry in row n and column k is (nk)1nk=1k!×nn×n−1n×⋯×n−k+1n;nk1/n^k=1/k!×n/n×n-1/n×⋯×n-k+1/n; the columns (fixed k) are indeed weakly increasing with n and bounded (by 1/k!), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums (1+1/n)n(1+1/n)^n by taking the sum of the column limits, namely 1k!1/k!.
