lemma: The following result is due to Beppo Levi, who proved a slight generalization in 1906 of an earlier result by Henri Lebesgue.[3] In what follows, BR≥0ℬ_ℝ_≥0 denotes the σσ-algebra of Borel sets on [0,+∞][0,+∞]. By definition, BR≥0ℬ_ℝ_≥0 contains the set +∞{+∞} and all Borel subsets of R≥0.ℝ_≥0.
