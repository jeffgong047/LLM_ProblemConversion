theorem: Step 1. We begin by showing that f is (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)–measurable.[4]: section 21.3 Note. If we were using Fatou's lemma, the measurability would follow easily from Remark 3(a). To do this without using Fatou's lemma, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval [0,t][0,t] under f is an element of the sigma-algebra ΣΣ on X, because (closed) intervals generate the Borel sigma algebra on the reals. Since [0,t][0,t] is a closed interval, and, for every k, 0≤fk(x)≤f(x)0_k(x)(x), 0≤f(x)≤t⇔[∀k0≤fk(x)≤t].0(x) ⇔ [ 0_k(x)]. Thus, x∈X∣0≤f(x)≤t=⋂kx∈X∣0≤fk(x)≤t.{x|0(x)}=⋂_k{x|0_k(x)}. Being the inverse image of a Borel set under a (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable function fk_k, each set in the countable intersection is an element of ΣΣ. Since σσ-algebras are, by definition, closed under countable intersections, this shows that f is (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable, and the integral ∫Xfdμ∫_Xf dμ is well defined (and possibly infinite). Step 2. We will first show that ∫Xfdμ≥limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xf dμ≥lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. The definition of f and monotonicity of fk{f_k} imply that f(x)≥fk(x)(x)_k(x), for every k and every x∈X. By monotonicity (or, more precisely, its narrower version established in Remark 5; see also Remark 4) of Lebesgue integral, ∫Xfdμ≥∫Xfkdμ,∫_Xf dμ≥∫_Xf_k dμ, and ∫Xfdμ≥limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xf dμ≥lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. Note that the limit on the right exists (finite or infinite) because, due to monotonicity (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), the sequence is non-decreasing. End of Step 2. We now prove the reverse inequality. We seek to show that ∫Xfdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ∫_Xf dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. Proof using Fatou's lemma. Per Remark 3, the inequality we want to prove is equivalent to ∫Xliminfkfk(x)dμ≤liminfk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xlim inf_kf_k(x) dμ≤lim inf_k∫_Xf_k dμ. But the latter follows immediately from Fatou's lemma, and the proof is complete. Independent proof. To prove the inequality without using Fatou's lemma, we need some extra machinery. Denote SF⁡(f)SF(f) the set of simple (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable functions s:X→[0,∞):X→[0,∞) such that 0≤s≤f0 on X. Step 3. Given a simple function s∈SF⁡(f)∈SF(f) and a real number t∈(0,1)∈(0,1), define Bks,t=x∈X∣t⋅s(x)≤fk(x)⊆X._k^s,t={x⋯(x)_k(x)}. Then Bks,t∈Σ_k^s,t∈Σ, Bks,t⊆Bk+1s,t_k^s,t_k+1^s,t, and X=⋃kBks,t=⋃_kB_k^s,t. Step 3a. To prove the first claim, let s=∑i=1mci⋅1Ai=∑_i=1^mc_i·1_A_i, for some finite collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets Ai∈Σ_i∈Σ such that X=∪i=1mAi=∪_i=1^mA_i, some (finite) non-negative constants ci∈R≥0_i∈ℝ_≥0, and 1Ai1_A_i denoting the indicator function of the set Ai_i. For every x∈Ai,_i, t⋅s(x)≤fk(x)⋯(x)_k(x) holds if and only if fk(x)∈[t⋅ci,+∞]._k(x)∈[t_i,+∞]. Given that the sets Ai_i are pairwise disjoint, Bks,t=⋃i=1m(fk−1([t⋅ci,+∞])∩Ai)._k^s,t=⋃_i=1^m(f_k^-1([t_i,+∞])_i). Since the pre-image fk−1([t⋅ci,+∞])_k^-1([t_i,+∞]) of the Borel set [t⋅ci,+∞][t_i,+∞] under the measurable function fk_k is measurable, and σσ-algebras, by definition, are closed under finite intersection and unions, the first claim follows. Step 3b. To prove the second claim, note that, for each k and every x∈X, fk(x)≤fk+1(x)._k(x)_k+1(x). Step 3c. To prove the third claim, we show that X⊆⋃kBks,t⊆⋃_kB_k^s,t. Indeed, if, to the contrary, X⊈⋃kBks,t⊈⋃_kB_k^s,t, then an element x0∈X∖⋃kBks,t=⋂k(X∖Bks,t)_0∖⋃_kB_k^s,t=⋂_k(X_k^s,t) exists such that fk(x0)<t⋅s(x0)_k(x_0)<t⋯(x_0), for every k. Taking the limit as k→∞→∞, we get f(x0)≤t⋅s(x0)<s(x0).(x_0)⋯(x_0)<s(x_0). But by initial assumption, s≤f. This is a contradiction. Step 4. For every simple (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable non-negative function s2_2, limn∫Bns,ts2dμ=∫Xs2dμ.lim_n∫_B_n^s,ts_2 dμ=∫_Xs_2 dμ. To prove this, define ν(S)=∫Ss2dμν(S)=∫_Ss_2 dμ. By Lemma 1, ν(S)ν(S) is a measure on ΩΩ. By "continuity from below" (Lemma 2), limn∫Bns,ts2dμ=limnν(Bns,t)=ν(X)=∫Xs2dμ,lim_n∫_B_n^s,ts_2 dμ=lim_nν(B_n^s,t)=ν(X)=∫_Xs_2 dμ, as required. Step 5. We now prove that, for every s∈SF⁡(f)∈SF(f), ∫Xsdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xs dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. Indeed, using the definition of Bks,t_k^s,t, the non-negativity of fk_k, and the monotonicity of Lebesgue integral (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), we have ∫Bks,tt⋅sdμ≤∫Bks,tfkdμ≤∫Xfkdμ,∫_B_k^s,tt⋯ dμ≤∫_B_k^s,tf_k dμ≤∫_Xf_k dμ, for every k≥1≥1. In accordance with Step 4, as k→∞→∞, the inequality becomes t∫Xsdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xs dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. Taking the limit as t↑1↑1 yields ∫Xsdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ,∫_Xs dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ, as required. Step 6. We are now able to prove the reverse inequality, i.e. ∫Xfdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xf dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. Indeed, by non-negativity, f+=f_+=f and f−=0._-=0. For the calculation below, the non-negativity of f is essential. Applying the definition of Lebesgue integral and the inequality established in Step 5, we have ∫Xfdμ=sups∈SF⁡(f)∫Xsdμ≤limk∫Xfkdμ.∫_Xf dμ=sup_s∈SF(f)∫_Xs dμ≤lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ. The proof is complete. See
