Proof: Let (an)n∈N(a_n)_n∈ℕ be such a sequence, and let an{a_n} be the set of terms of (an)n∈N(a_n)_n∈ℕ. By assumption, an{a_n} is non-empty and bounded above. By the least-upper-bound property of real numbers, c=supnan=sup_n{a_n} exists and is finite. Now, for every ε>0ε>0, there exists N such that aN>c−ε_N>c-ε, since otherwise c−ε-ε is an upper bound of an{a_n}, which contradicts the definition of c. Then since (an)n∈N(a_n)_n∈ℕ is increasing, and c is its upper bound, for every n>N>N, we have |c−an|≤|c−aN|<ε|c-a_n|≤|c-a_N|<ε. Hence, by definition, the limit of (an)n∈N(a_n)_n∈ℕ is supnan.sup_n{a_n}. Lemma
