Theorem: Let (Ω,Σ,μ)(Ω,Σ,μ) be a measure space, and X∈Σ∈Σ. Consider a pointwise non-decreasing sequence fkk=1∞{f_k}_k=1^∞ of (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable non-negative functions fk:X→[0,+∞]_k:X→[0,+∞], i.e., for every k≥1k≥1 and every x∈Xx, 0≤fk(x)≤fk+1(x)≤∞.0_k(x)_k+1(x)≤∞. Set the pointwise limit of the sequence fn{f_n} to be f. That is, for every x∈X, f(x):=limk→∞fk(x).(x):=lim_k→∞f_k(x). Then f is (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable and limk→∞∫Xfkdμ=∫Xfdμ.lim_k→∞∫_Xf_k dμ=∫_Xf dμ. Remark 1. The integrals may be finite or infinite. Remark 2. The theorem remains true if its assumptions hold μμ-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a null set N such that the sequence fn(x){f_n(x)} non-decreases for every x∈X∖N.x. To see why this is true, we start with an observation that allowing the sequence fn{f_n} to pointwise non-decrease almost everywhere causes its pointwise limit f to be undefined on some null set N. On that null set, f may then be defined arbitrarily, e.g. as zero, or in any other way that preserves measurability. To see why this will not affect the outcome of the theorem, note that since μ(N)=0,μ(N)=0, we have, for every k,, ∫Xfkdμ=∫X∖Nfkdμ∫_Xf_k dμ=∫_Xf_k dμ and ∫Xfdμ=∫X∖Nfdμ,∫_Xf dμ=∫_Xf dμ, provided that f is (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable.[4]: section 21.38 (These equalities follow directly from the definition of Lebesgue integral for a non-negative function). Remark 3. Under assumptions of the theorem, f(x)=liminfkfk(x)=limsupkfk(x)=supkfk(x)(x)=lim inf_kf_k(x)=lim sup_kf_k(x)=sup_kf_k(x)liminfk∫Xfkdμ=limsupk∫Xfkdμ=limk∫Xfkdμ=supk∫Xfkdμlim inf_k∫_Xf_k dμ=lim sup_k∫_Xf_k dμ=lim_k∫_Xf_k dμ=sup_k∫_Xf_k dμ (Note that the second chain of equalities follows from Remark 5). Remark 4. The proof below does not use any properties of Lebesgue integral except those established here. The theorem, thus, can be used to prove other basic properties, such as linearity, pertaining to Lebesgue integration. Remark 5 (monotonicity of Lebesgue integral). In the proof below, we apply the monotonic property of Lebesgue integral to non-negative functions only. Specifically (see Remark 4), let the functions f,g:X→[0,+∞],g:X→[0,+∞] be (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable. If f≤g everywhere on X,, then ∫Xfdμ≤∫Xgdμ.∫_Xf dμ≤∫_Xg dμ. If X1,X2∈Σ_1,X_2∈Σ and X1⊆X2,_1_2, then ∫X1fdμ≤∫X2fdμ.∫_X_1f dμ≤∫_X_2f dμ. Proof. Denote SF⁡(h)SF(h) the set of simple (Σ,BR≥0)(Σ,ℬ_ℝ_≥0)-measurable functions s:X→[0,∞):X→[0,∞) such that 0≤s≤h0 everywhere on X.. 1. Since f≤g,, we have SF⁡(f)⊆SF⁡(g).SF(f)⊆SF(g). By definition of Lebesgue integral and the properties of supremum, ∫Xfdμ=sups∈SF(f)∫Xsdμ≤sups∈SF(g)∫Xsdμ=∫Xgdμ.∫_Xf dμ=sup_s∈SF(f)∫_Xs dμ≤sup_s∈SF(g)∫_Xs dμ=∫_Xg dμ. 2. Let 1X11_X_1 be the indicator function of the set X1._1. It can be deduced from the definition of Lebesgue integral that ∫X2f⋅1X1dμ=∫X1fdμ∫_X_2f·1_X_1 dμ=∫_X_1f dμ if we notice that, for every s∈SF(f⋅1X1),∈SF(f·1_X_1), s=0=0 outside of X1._1. Combined with the previous property, the inequality f⋅1X1≤f·1_X_1 implies ∫X1fdμ=∫X2f⋅1X1dμ≤∫X2fdμ.∫_X_1f dμ=∫_X_2f·1_X_1 dμ≤∫_X_2f dμ.
