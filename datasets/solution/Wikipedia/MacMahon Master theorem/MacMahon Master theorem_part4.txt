identity: Consider a matrix A=(01−1−1011−10).=[ 0 1 -1; -1 0 1; 1 -1 0 ]. Compute the coefficients G(2n, 2n, 2n) directly from the definition: G(2n,2n,2n)=[x12nx22nx32n](x2−x3)2n(x3−x1)2n(x1−x2)2n=∑k=02n(−1)k(2nk)3,G(2n,2n,2n) =[x_1^2nx_2^2nx_3^2n](x_2-x_3)^2n(x_3-x_1)^2n(x_1-x_2)^2n = ∑_k=0^2n(-1)^k2nk^3, where the last equality follows from the fact that on the right-hand side we have the product of the following coefficients: [x2kx32n−k](x2−x3)2n,[x3kx12n−k](x3−x1)2n,[x1kx22n−k](x1−x2)2n,[x_2^kx_3^2n-k](x_2-x_3)^2n, (x_3-x_1)^2n, (x_1-x_2)^2n, which are computed from the binomial theorem. On the other hand, we can compute the determinant explicitly: det(I−TA)=det(1−t1t1t21−t2−t3t31)=1+(t1t2+t1t3+t2t3).(I-TA) = [ 1 -t_1 t_1; t_2 1 -t_2; -t_3 t_3 1 ] = 1+(t_1t_2+t_1t_3+t_2t_3). Therefore, by the MMT, we have a new formula for the same coefficients: G(2n,2n,2n)=[t12nt22nt32n](−1)3n(t1t2+t1t3+t2t3)3n=(−1)n(3nn,n,n),G(2n,2n,2n) =[t_1^2nt_2^2nt_3^2n](-1)^3n(t_1t_2+t_1t_3+t_2t_3)^3n =(-1)^n3nn,n,n, where the last equality follows from the fact that we need to use an equal number of times all three terms in the power. Now equating the two formulas for coefficients G(2n, 2n, 2n) we obtain an equivalent version of Dixon's identity: ∑k=02n(−1)k(2nk)3=(−1)n(3nn,n,n).∑_k=0^2n(-1)^k2nk^3=(-1)^n3nn,n,n. See
