On Hamiltonian cycles in planar graphs A graph that can be proven non-Hamiltonian using Grinberg's theorem In graph theory, Grinberg's theorem is a necessary condition for a planar graph to contain a Hamiltonian cycle, based on the lengths of its face cycles. If a graph does not meet this condition, it is not Hamiltonian. The result has been widely used to prove that certain planar graphs constructed to have additional properties are not Hamiltonian; for instance it can prove non-Hamiltonicity of some counterexamples to Tait's conjecture that cubic polyhedral graphs are Hamiltonian. Grinberg's theorem is named after Latvian mathematician Emanuel Grinberg, who proved it in 1968.
