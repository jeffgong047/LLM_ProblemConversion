Formulation: A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn without crossings in the Euclidean plane. If the points belonging to vertices and edges are removed from the plane, the connected components of the remaining points form polygons, called faces, including an unbounded face extending to infinity. A face is a k-gon if its boundary is formed by a cycle of k vertices and k edges of the graph drawing. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that passes through each vertex exactly once. Let G be a finite planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle C, with a fixed planar drawing. By the Jordan curve theorem, C separates the plane into the subset inside of C and the subset outside of C; every face belongs to one of these two subsets. Denote by fk_k and gk_k the number of k-gonal faces of the drawing that are inside and outside of C, respectively. Then Grinberg's theorem states that ∑k≥3(k−2)(fk−gk)=0.∑_k≥3(k-2)(f_k-g_k)=0. The proof is an easy consequence of Euler's formula.[1][2] As a corollary of this theorem, if an embedded planar graph has only one face whose number of sides is not 2 mod 3, and the remaining faces all have numbers of sides that are 2 mod 3, then the graph is not Hamiltonian. To see this, consider a sum of the form given in the statement of the theorem, for an arbitrary partition of the faces into two subsets, counted by numbers fk_k and gk_k. Each face whose number of sides is 2 mod 3 contributes a multiple of three to the sum, because of the factor k−2-2 in the term to which it contributes, while the one remaining face does not. Therefore, the sum is not a multiple of three, and in particular is not zero. Since there is no way of partitioning the faces into two subsets that produce a sum obeying Grinberg's theorem, there can be no Hamiltonian cycle.[1] For instance, for the graph in the figure, all the bounded faces have 5 or 8 sides, but the unbounded face has 9 sides, so it satisfies this condition on numbers of sides and is not Hamiltonian.
