choice: The well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice as follows.[9]Let the set we are trying to well-order be A, and let f be a choice function for the family of non-empty subsets of A. For every ordinal αα, define an element aα_α that is in A by setting aα=f(A∖aξ∣ξ<α)_α(A∖{a_ξ|ξ<α}) if this complement A∖aξ∣ξ<α∖{a_ξ|ξ<α} is nonempty, or leave aα_α undefined if it is. That is, aα_α is chosen from the set of elements of A that have not yet been assigned a place in the ordering (or undefined if the entirety of A has been successfully enumerated). Then ⟨aα∣aαisdefined⟩_α_αisdefined⟩ is a well-order of A as desired. Proof of axiom of
