Proof: Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H) the bounded operators on H. Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra M of L(H) (this means that M contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on H). The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements: (i) clW(M) ⊆ M′′ (ii) clS(M) ⊆ clW(M) (iii) M′′ ⊆ clS(M) where the W and S subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.
