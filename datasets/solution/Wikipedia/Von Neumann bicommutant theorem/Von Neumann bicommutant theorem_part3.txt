(i): By definition of the weak operator topology, for any x and y in H, the map T → <Tx, y> is continuous in this topology. Therefore, for any operator O (and by substituting once y → O∗y and once x → Ox), so is the map T→⟨Tx,O∗y⟩−⟨TOx,y⟩=⟨OTx,y⟩−⟨TOx,y⟩.→,O^*y⟩-,y⟩=,y⟩-,y⟩. Let S be any subset of L(H), and S′ its commutant. For any operator T not in S′, <OTx, y> - <TOx, y> is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in H. By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood of T in the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S′. Thus S′ is closed in the weak operator, i.e. S′ is weakly closed. Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is M′′; since it contains M, it also contains its weak closure. Proof of
