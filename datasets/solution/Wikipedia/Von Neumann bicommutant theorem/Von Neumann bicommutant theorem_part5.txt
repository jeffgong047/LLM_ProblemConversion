(iii): Fix X ∈ M′′. We will show X ∈ clS(M). Fix an open neighborhood U of X in the strong operator topology. By definition of the strong operator topology, U contains a finite intersection U(h1,ε1) ∩...∩U(hn,εn) of subbasic open sets of the form U(h,ε) = {O ∈ L(H): ||Oh - Xh|| < ε}, where h is in H and ε > 0. Fix h in H. Consider the closure cl(Mh) of Mh = {Mh : M ∈ M} with respect to the norm of H and equipped with the inner product of H. It is a Hilbert space (being a closed subspace of a Hilbert space H), and so has a corresponding orthogonal projection which we denote P. P is bounded, so it is in L(H). Next we prove: Lemma. P ∈ M′. Proof. Fix x ∈ H. Then Px ∈ cl(Mh), so it is the limit of a sequence Onh with On in M for all n. Then for all T ∈ M, TOnh is also in Mh and thus its limit is in cl(Mh). By continuity of T (since it is in L(H) and thus Lipschitz continuous), this limit is TPx. Since TPx ∈ cl(Mh), PTPx = TPx. From this it follows that PTP = TP for all T in M. By using the closure of M under the adjoint we further have, for every T in M and all x, y ∈ H: ⟨x,TPy⟩=⟨x,PTPy⟩=⟨Px,TPy⟩=⟨T∗Px,Py⟩=⟨PT∗Px,y⟩=⟨T∗Px,y⟩=⟨Px,Ty⟩=⟨x,PTy⟩,TPy⟩=,PTPy⟩=,TPy⟩=^*Px,Py⟩=^*Px,y⟩=^*Px,y⟩=,Ty⟩=,PTy⟩ thus TP = PT and P lies in M′. By definition of the bicommutant XP = PX. Since M is unital, h ∈ Mh, hence Xh = XPh = PXh ∈ cl(Mh). Thus for every ε > 0, there exists T in M with ||Xh − Th|| < ε. Then T lies in U(h,ε).[clarification needed] Thus in every open neighborhood U of X in the strong operator topology there is a member of M, and so X is in the strong operator topology closure of M.
