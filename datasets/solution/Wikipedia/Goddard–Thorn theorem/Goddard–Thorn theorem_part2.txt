Statement: This statement is that of Borcherds (1992). Suppose that V is a unitary representation of the Virasoro algebra VirVir, so V is equipped with a non-degenerate bilinear form (⋅,⋅)(·,·) and there is an algebra homomorphism ρ:Vir→End(V)ρ:Vir→End(V) so that ρ(Li)†=ρ(L−i)ρ(L_i)^†=ρ(L_-i) where the adjoint is defined with respect to the bilinear form, and ρ(c)=24idV.ρ(c)=24id_V. Suppose also that V decomposes into a direct sum of eigenspaces of L0_0 with non-negative, integer eigenvalues i≥0≥0, denoted Vi^i, and that each Vi^i is finite dimensional (giving V a Z≥0ℤ_≥0-grading). Assume also that V admits an action from a group G that preserves this grading. For the two-dimensional even unimodular Lorentzian lattice II1,1, denote the corresponding lattice vertex algebra by VII1,1_II_1,1. This is a II1,1-graded algebra with a bilinear form and carries an action of the Virasoro algebra. Let P1^1 be the subspace of the vertex algebra V⊗VII1,1_II_1,1 consisting of vectors v such that L0⋅v=v,Ln⋅v=0_0=v,L_n=0 for n>0>0. Let Pr1_r^1 be the subspace of P1^1 of degree r∈II1,1_1,1. Each space inherits a G-action which acts as prescribed on V and trivially on VII1,1_II_1,1. The quotient of Pr1_r^1 by the nullspace of its bilinear form is naturally isomorphic as a G-module with an invariant bilinear form, to V1−(r,r)/2^1-(r,r)/2 if r≠0≠0 and V1⊕R2^1⊕ℝ^2 if r=0=0.
