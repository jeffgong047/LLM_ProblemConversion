intuition: Intuitively, the fundamental theorem states that integration and differentiation are essentially inverse operations which reverse each other. The second fundamental theorem says that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity over time (the integral of the derivative of the quantity) adds up to the net change in the quantity. To visualize this, imagine traveling in a car and wanting to know the distance traveled (the net change in position along the highway). You can see the velocity on the speedometer but cannot look out to see your location. Each second, you can find how far the car has traveled using distance = speed × time, multiplying the current speed (in kilometers or miles per hour) by the time interval (1 second = 1360013600 hour). Summing up all these small steps, you can calculate the total distance traveled, without ever looking outside the car:distancetraveled=∑(velocityateachtime)×(timeinterval)=∑v(t)×Δt.distancetraveled=∑([ velocityat; eachtime ])×([ time; interval ])=(t)×.As Δt becomes infinitesimally small, the summing up corresponds to integration. Thus, the integral of the velocity function (the derivative of position) computes how far the car has traveled (the net change in position). The first fundamental theorem says that any quantity is the rate of change (the derivative) of the integral of the quantity from a fixed time up to a variable time. Continuing the above example, if you imagine a velocity function, you can integrate it from the starting time up to any given time to obtain a distance function whose derivative is the given velocity. (To obtain the highway-marker position, you need to add your starting position to this integral.) Formal
