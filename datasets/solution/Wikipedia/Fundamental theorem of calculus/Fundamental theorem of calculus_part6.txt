part: This part is sometimes referred to as the first fundamental theorem of calculus.[7] Let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Let F be the function defined, for all x in [a, b], by F(x)=∫axf(t)dt.(x)=∫_a^xf(t) dt. Then F is uniformly continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and F′(x)=f(x)'(x)=f(x) for all x in (a, b) so F is an antiderivative of f.
