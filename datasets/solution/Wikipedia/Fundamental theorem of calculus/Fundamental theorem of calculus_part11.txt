part: This is a limit proof by Riemann sums. To begin, we recall the mean value theorem. Stated briefly, if F is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that F′(c)(b−a)=F(b)−F(a).'(c)(b-a)=F(b)-F(a). Let f be (Riemann) integrable on the interval [a, b], and let f admit an antiderivative F on (a, b) such that F is continuous on [a, b]. Begin with the quantity F(b) − F(a). Let there be numbers x0, ..., xn such that a=x0<x1<x2<⋯<xn−1<xn=b.=x_0<x_1<x_2<⋯<x_n-1<x_n=b. It follows that F(b)−F(a)=F(xn)−F(x0).(b)-F(a)=F(x_n)-F(x_0). Now, we add each F(xi) along with its additive inverse, so that the resulting quantity is equal: F(b)−F(a)=F(xn)+[−F(xn−1)+F(xn−1)]+⋯+[−F(x1)+F(x1)]−F(x0)=[F(xn)−F(xn−1)]+[F(xn−1)−F(xn−2)]+⋯+[F(x2)−F(x1)]+[F(x1)−F(x0)].F(b)-F(a) =F(x_n)+[-F(x_n-1)+F(x_n-1)]+⋯+[-F(x_1)+F(x_1)]-F(x_0) =[F(x_n)-F(x_n-1)]+[F(x_n-1)-F(x_n-2)]+⋯+[F(x_2)-F(x_1)]+[F(x_1)-F(x_0)]. The above quantity can be written as the following sum: F(b)−F(a)=∑i=1n[F(xi)−F(xi−1)].(b)-F(a)=∑_i=1^n[F(x_i)-F(x_i-1)]. (1') The function F is differentiable on the interval (a, b) and continuous on the closed interval [a, b]; therefore, it is also differentiable on each interval (xi−1, xi) and continuous on each interval [xi−1, xi]. According to the mean value theorem (above), for each i there exists a ci_i in (xi−1, xi) such that F(xi)−F(xi−1)=F′(ci)(xi−xi−1).(x_i)-F(x_i-1)=F'(c_i)(x_i-x_i-1). Substituting the above into (1'), we get F(b)−F(a)=∑i=1n[F′(ci)(xi−xi−1)].(b)-F(a)=∑_i=1^n[F'(c_i)(x_i-x_i-1)]. The assumption implies F′(ci)=f(ci).'(c_i)=f(c_i). Also, xi−xi−1_i-x_i-1 can be expressed as Δx of partition i. F(b)−F(a)=∑i=1n[f(ci)(Δxi)].(b)-F(a)=∑_i=1^n[f(c_i)(_i)]. (2') A converging sequence of Riemann sums. The number in the upper left is the total area of the blue rectangles. They converge to the definite integral of the function. We are describing the area of a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together. Each rectangle, by virtue of the mean value theorem, describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also Δxi_i need not be the same for all values of i, or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ. What we have to do is approximate the curve with n rectangles. Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and n increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve. By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity. So, we take the limit on both sides of (2'). This gives us lim‖Δxi‖→0F(b)−F(a)=lim‖Δxi‖→0∑i=1n[f(ci)(Δxi)].lim__i→0F(b)-F(a)=lim__i→0∑_i=1^n[f(c_i)(_i)]. Neither F(b) nor F(a) is dependent on ‖Δxi‖_i, so the limit on the left side remains F(b) − F(a). F(b)−F(a)=lim‖Δxi‖→0∑i=1n[f(ci)(Δxi)].(b)-F(a)=lim__i→0∑_i=1^n[f(c_i)(_i)]. The expression on the right side of the equation defines the integral over f from a to b. Therefore, we obtain F(b)−F(a)=∫abf(x)dx,(b)-F(a)=∫_a^bf(x) dx, which completes the proof.
