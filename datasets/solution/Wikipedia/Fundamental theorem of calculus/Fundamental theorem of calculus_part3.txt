meaning: The area shaded in red stripes is close to h times f(x). Alternatively, if the function A(x) were known, this area would be exactly A(x + h) − A(x). These two values are approximately equal, particularly for small h. The first fundamental theorem may be interpreted as follows. Given a continuous function y = f(x) whose graph is plotted as a curve, one defines a corresponding "area function" x↦A(x)(x) such that A(x) is the area beneath the curve between 0 and x. The area A(x) may not be easily computable, but it is assumed to be well defined. The area under the curve between x and x + h could be computed by finding the area between 0 and x + h, then subtracting the area between 0 and x. In other words, the area of this "strip" would be A(x + h) − A(x). There is another way to estimate the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, h is multiplied by f(x) to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So: A(x+h)−A(x)≈f(x)⋅h(x+h)-A(x)(x) In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red "Excess" area in the diagram. So: A(x+h)−A(x)=f(x)⋅h+(Excess)(x+h)-A(x)=f(x)+(Excess) Rearranging terms: f(x)=A(x+h)−A(x)h−Excessh.(x)=A(x+h)-A(x)/h-Excess/h. As h approaches 0 in the limit, the last fraction must go to zero.[6] To see this, note that the excess region is inside the tiny black-bordered rectangle, giving an upper bound for the excess area:|Excess|≤h(f(x+h1)−f(x+h2)),|Excess| (f(x+h_1)-f(x+h_2)),where x+h1+h_1 and x+h2+h_2 are points where f reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in the interval [x, x + h]. Thus: |f(x)−A(x+h)−A(x)h|=|Excess|h≤h(f(x+h1)−f(x+h2))h=f(x+h1)−f(x+h2),|f(x)-A(x+h)-A(x)/h|=|Excess|/h≤h(f(x+h_1)-f(x+h_2))/h=f(x+h_1)-f(x+h_2),By the continuity of f, the right-hand expression tends to zero as h does. Therefore, the left-hand side also tends to zero, and: f(x)=limh→0A(x+h)−A(x)h=defA′(x).(x)=lim_h→0A(x+h)-A(x)/h{def='(x). That is, the derivative of the area function A(x) exists and is equal to the original function f(x), so the area function is an antiderivative of the original function. Thus, the derivative of the integral of a function (the area) is the original function, so that derivative and integral are inverse operations which reverse each other. This is the essence of the Fundamental Theorem. Physical
