Corollary: Fundamental theorem of calculus (animation) The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function f for which an antiderivative F is known. Specifically, if f is a real-valued continuous function on [a,b][a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f in [a,b][a,b] then ∫abf(t)dt=F(b)−F(a).∫_a^bf(t) dt=F(b)-F(a). The corollary assumes continuity on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem. Second
