Generalizations: The function f does not have to be continuous over the whole interval. Part I of the theorem then says: if f is any Lebesgue integrable function on [a, b] and x0 is a number in [a, b] such that f is continuous at x0, then F(x)=∫axf(t)dt(x)=∫_a^xf(t) dt is differentiable for x = x0 with F′(x0) = f(x0). We can relax the conditions on f still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable. In that case, we can conclude that the function F is differentiable almost everywhere and F′(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. On the real line this statement is equivalent to Lebesgue's differentiation theorem. These results remain true for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions.[10] In higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every x, the average value of a function f over a ball of radius r centered at x tends to f(x) as r tends to 0. Part II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function f, which has an antiderivative F (not all integrable functions do, though). In other words, if a real function F on [a, b] admits a derivative f(x) at every point x of [a, b] and if this derivative f is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b], then[11] F(b)−F(a)=∫abf(t)dt.(b)-F(a)=∫_a^bf(t) dt. This result may fail for continuous functions F that admit a derivative f(x) at almost every point x, as the example of the Cantor function shows. However, if F is absolutely continuous, it admits a derivative F′(x) at almost every point x, and moreover F′ is integrable, with F(b) − F(a) equal to the integral of F′ on [a, b]. Conversely, if f is any integrable function, then F as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with F′ = f almost everywhere. The conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as Henstock–Kurzweil integrals. Specifically, if a continuous function F(x) admits a derivative f(x) at all but countably many points, then f(x) is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and F(b) − F(a) is equal to the integral of f on [a, b]. The difference here is that the integrability of f does not need to be assumed.[12] The version of Taylor's theorem, which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem. There is a version of the theorem for complex functions: suppose U is an open set in C and f : U → C is a function that has a holomorphic antiderivative F on U. Then for every curve γ : [a, b] → U, the curve integral can be computed as ∫γf(z)dz=F(γ(b))−F(γ(a)).∫_γf(z) dz=F(γ(b))-F(γ(a)). The fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on manifolds. One such generalization offered by the calculus of moving surfaces is the time evolution of integrals. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the divergence theorem and the gradient theorem. One of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is Stokes' theorem (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus):[13] Let M be an oriented piecewise smooth manifold of dimension n and let ωω be a smooth compactly supported (n − 1)-form on M. If ∂M denotes the boundary of M given its induced orientation, then ∫Mdω=∫∂Mω.∫_Mdω=∫_ω. Here d is the exterior derivative, which is defined using the manifold structure only. The theorem is often used in situations where M is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold (e.g. Rk) on which the form ωω is defined. The fundamental theorem of calculus allows us to pose a definite integral as a first-order ordinary differential equation. ∫abf(x)dx∫_a^bf(x) dx can be posed as dydx=f(x),y(a)=0dy/dx=f(x), y(a)=0 with y(b)(b) as the value of the integral.
