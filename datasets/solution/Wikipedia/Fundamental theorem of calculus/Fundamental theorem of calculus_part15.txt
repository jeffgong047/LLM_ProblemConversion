part: Suppose ddx∫0xt3dtd/dx∫_0^xt^3 dt is to be calculated. Using the first part of the theorem with f(t)=t3(t)=t^3 gives ddx∫0xt3dt=f(x)=x3.d/dx∫_0^xt^3 dt=f(x)=x^3. This can also be checked using the second part of the theorem. Specifically, F(t)=14t4(t)=1/4t^4 is an antiderivative of f(t)(t), so ddx∫0xt3dt=ddxF(x)−ddxF(0)=ddxx44=x3.d/dx∫_0^xt^3 dt=d/dxF(x)-d/dxF(0)=d/dxx^4/4=x^3. An integral where the corollary is
