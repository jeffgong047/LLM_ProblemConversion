part: This part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus[8] or the Newton–Leibniz theorem. Let f be a real-valued function on a closed interval [a,b][a,b] and F a continuous function on [a,b][a,b] which is an antiderivative of f in (a,b)(a,b): F′(x)=f(x).'(x)=f(x). If f is Riemann integrable on [a,b][a,b] then ∫abf(x)dx=F(b)−F(a).∫_a^bf(x) dx=F(b)-F(a). The second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that f is continuous. When an antiderivative F of f exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for f, obtained by adding an arbitrary constant to F. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of f always exist when f is continuous. Proof of the first
