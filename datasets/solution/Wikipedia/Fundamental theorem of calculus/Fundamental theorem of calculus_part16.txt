insufficient: Suppose f(x)=sin⁡(1x)−1xcos⁡(1x)x≠00x=0(x)=sin(1/x)-1/xcos(1/x) x≠0 0 x=0 Then f(x)(x) is not continuous at zero. Moreover, this is not just a matter of how f is defined at zero, since the limit as x→0→0 of f(x)(x) does not exist. Therefore, the corollary cannot be used to compute ∫01f(x)dx.∫_0^1f(x) dx. But consider the function F(x)=xsin⁡(1x)x≠00x=0.(x)=xsin(1/x) x≠0 0 x=0. Notice that F(x)(x) is continuous on [0,1][0,1] (including at zero by the squeeze theorem), and F(x)(x) is differentiable on (0,1)(0,1) with F′(x)=f(x).'(x)=f(x). Therefore, part two of the theorem applies, and ∫01f(x)dx=F(1)−F(0)=sin⁡(1).∫_0^1f(x) dx=F(1)-F(0)=sin(1). Theoretical
