corollary: Suppose F is an antiderivative of f, with f continuous on [a, b]. Let G(x)=∫axf(t)dt.(x)=∫_a^xf(t) dt. By the first part of the theorem, we know G is also an antiderivative of f. Since F′ − G′ = 0 the mean value theorem implies that F − G is a constant function, that is, there is a number c such that G(x) = F(x) + c for all x in [a, b]. Letting x = a, we have F(a)+c=G(a)=∫aaf(t)dt=0,(a)+c=G(a)=∫_a^af(t) dt=0, which means c = −F(a). In other words, G(x) = F(x) − F(a), and so ∫abf(x)dx=G(b)=F(b)−F(a).∫_a^bf(x) dx=G(b)=F(b)-F(a).
