theorems: A consequence of the Remmert–Stein theorem (also treated in their paper), is Chow's theorem stating that any projective complex analytic space is necessarily a projective algebraic variety. The Remmert–Stein theorem is implied by a proper mapping theorem due to Bishop (1964), see Aguilar & Verjovsky (2021).
