inequalities: Let μ be a Borel non-negative measure on RN, finite on compact subsets and let f be a μμ-integrable function. Define the maximal function f∗^* by setting for every x (using the convention ∞×0=0∞×0=0) f∗(x)=supr>0(μ(B(x,r))−1∫B(x,r)|f(y)|dμ(y)).^*(x)=sup_r>0(μ(B(x,r))^-1∫_B(x,r)|f(y)| dμ(y)). This maximal function is lower semicontinuous, hence measurable. The following maximal inequality is satisfied for every λ > 0 : λμ(x:f∗(x)>λ)≤bN∫|f|dμ.λ μ({x:f^*(x)>λ})_N ∫|f| dμ. Proof. The set Eλ of the points x such that f∗(x)>λ^*(x)>λ clearly admits a Besicovitch cover Fλ by balls B such that ∫1B|f|dμ=∫B|f(y)|dμ(y)>λμ(B).∫1_B |f|μ̣=∫_B|f(y)| dμ(y)>λ μ(B). For every bounded Borel subset E´ of Eλ, one can find a subcollection G extracted from Fλ that covers E´ and such that SG ≤ bN, hence λμ(E′)≤λ∑B∈Gμ(B)≤∑B∈G∫1B|f|dμ=∫SG|f|dμ≤bN∫|f|dμ,λ μ(E') ≤λ ∑_B∈𝐆μ(B) ≤∑_B∈𝐆∫1_B |f| dμ=_𝐆 |f| dμ_N ∫|f| dμ, which implies the inequality above. When dealing with the Lebesgue measure on RN, it is more customary to use the easier (and older) Vitali covering lemma in order to derive the previous maximal inequality (with a different constant).
