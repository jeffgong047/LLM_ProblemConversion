Examples: A fundamental domain in logarithmic space of the group of units of the cyclic cubic field K obtained by adjoining to Qℚ a root of f(x) = x3 + x2 − 2x − 1. If α denotes a root of f(x), then a set of fundamental units is {ε1, ε2}, where ε1 = α2 + α − 1 and ε2 = 2 − α2. The area of the fundamental domain is approximately 0.910114, so the regulator of K is approximately 0.525455. The regulator of an imaginary quadratic field, or of the rational integers, is 1 (as the determinant of a 0 × 0 matrix is 1). The regulator of a real quadratic field is the logarithm of its fundamental unit: for example, that of Q(5)ℚ(√(5)) is log⁡5+12log√(5)+1/2. This can be seen as follows. A fundamental unit is (5+1)/2(√(5)+1)/2, and its images under the two embeddings into Rℝ are (5+1)/2(√(5)+1)/2 and (−5+1)/2(-√(5)+1)/2. So the r × (r + 1) matrix is [1×log⁡|5+12|,1×log⁡|−5+12|].[1×log|√(5)+1/2|, 1×log|-√(5)+1/2| right]. The regulator of the cyclic cubic field Q(α)ℚ(α), where α is a root of x3 + x2 − 2x − 1, is approximately 0.5255. A basis of the group of units modulo roots of unity is {ε1, ε2} where ε1 = α2 + α − 1 and ε2 = 2 − α2.[4] Higher
