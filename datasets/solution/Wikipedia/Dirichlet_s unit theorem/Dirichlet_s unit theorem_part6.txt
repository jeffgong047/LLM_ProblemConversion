regulator: Let K be a number field and for each prime P of K above some fixed rational prime p, let UP denote the local units at P and let U1,P denote the subgroup of principal units in UP. Set U1=∏P|pU1,P._1=∏_P|pU_1,P. Then let E1 denote the set of global units ε that map to U1 via the diagonal embedding of the global units in E. Since E1 is a finite-index subgroup of the global units, it is an abelian group of rank r1 + r2 − 1. The p-adic regulator is the determinant of the matrix formed by the p-adic logarithms of the generators of this group. Leopoldt's conjecture states that this determinant is non-zero.[8][9] See
