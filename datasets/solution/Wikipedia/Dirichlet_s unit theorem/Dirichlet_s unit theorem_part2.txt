regulator: Suppose that K is a number field and u1,…,ur_1,…,u_r are a set of generators for the unit group of K modulo roots of unity. There will be r + 1 Archimedean places of K, either real or complex. For u∈K, write u(1),…,u(r+1)^(1),…,u^(r+1) for the different embeddings into Rℝ or Cℂ and set Nj to 1 or 2 if the corresponding embedding is real or complex respectively. Then the r × (r + 1) matrix(Njlog⁡|ui(j)|)i=1,…,r,j=1,…,r+1(N_jlog|u_i^(j)|)_i=1,…,r, j=1,…,r+1has the property that the sum of any row is zero (because all units have norm 1, and the log of the norm is the sum of the entries in a row). This implies that the absolute value R of the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting one column is independent of the column. The number R is called the regulator of the algebraic number field (it does not depend on the choice of generators ui). It measures the "density" of the units: if the regulator is small, this means that there are "lots" of units. The regulator has the following geometric interpretation. The map taking a unit u to the vector with entries Njlog⁡|u(j)|_jlog|u^(j)| has an image in the r-dimensional subspace of Rr+1ℝ^r+1 consisting of all vectors whose entries have sum 0, and by Dirichlet's unit theorem the image is a lattice in this subspace. The volume of a fundamental domain of this lattice is Rr+1√(r+1). The regulator of an algebraic number field of degree greater than 2 is usually quite cumbersome to calculate, though there are now computer algebra packages that can do it in many cases. It is usually much easier to calculate the product hR of the class number h and the regulator using the class number formula, and the main difficulty in calculating the class number of an algebraic number field is usually the calculation of the regulator.
