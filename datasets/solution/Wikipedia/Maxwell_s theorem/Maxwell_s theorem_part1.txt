Concept in probability theorySee Maxwell's theorem (geometry) for the result on triangles. In probability theory, Maxwell's theorem (known also as Herschel-Maxwell's theorem and Herschel-Maxwell's derivation) states that if the probability distribution of a random vector in Rn‚Ñù^n is unchanged by rotations, and if the components are independent, then the components are identically distributed and normally distributed.
