Proof: We only need to prove the theorem for the 2-dimensional case, since we can then generalize it to n-dimensions by applying the theorem sequentially to each pair of coordinates. Since rotating by 90 degrees preserves the joint distribution, both X1,X2_1,X_2 has the same probability measure. Let it be μμ. If μμ is a Dirac delta distribution at zero, then it's a gaussian distribution, just degenerate. Now assume that it is not. By Lebesgue's decomposition theorem, we decompose it to a sum of regular measure and an atomic measure: μ=μr+μsμ=μ_r+μ_s. We need to show that μs=0μ_s=0, with a proof by contradiction. Suppose μsμ_s contains an atomic part, then there exists some x∈R∈ℝ such that μs(x)>0μ_s({x})>0. By independence of X1,X2_1,X_2, the conditional variable X2|X1=x_2|{X_1=x} is distributed the same way as X2_2. Suppose x=0=0, then since we assumed μμ is not concentrated at zero, Pr(X2≠0)>0(X_2≠0)>0, and so the double ray (x1,x2):x1=0,x2≠0{(x_1,x_2):x_1=0,x_2≠0} has nonzero probability. Now by rotational symmetry of μ×μμ×μ, any rotation of the double ray also has the same nonzero probability, and since any two rotations are disjoint, their union has infinite probability, contradiction. (As far as we can find, there is no literature about the case where μsμ_s is singularly continuous, so we will let that case go.) So now let μμ have probability density function ρρ, and the problem reduces to solving the functional equation ρ(x)ρ(y)=ρ(xcos⁡θ+ysin⁡θ)ρ(xsin⁡θ−ycos⁡θ)ρ(x)ρ(y)=ρ(xcosθ+ysinθ)ρ(xsinθ-ycosθ)
