Statement: Suppose that T is a complex torus given by V/Λ/Λ where ΛΛ is a lattice in a complex vector space V. If H is a Hermitian form on V whose imaginary part E=Im(H)=Im(H) is integral on Λ×ΛΛ×Λ, and αα is a map from ΛΛ to the unit circle U(1)=z∈C:|z|=1(1)={z∈ℂ:|z|=1}, called a semi-character, such that α(u+v)=eiπE(u,v)α(u)α(v)α(u+v)=e^i(u,v)α(u)α(v)} then α(u)eπH(z,u)+H(u,u)π/2α(u)e^(z,u)+H(u,u)π/2} is a 1-cocycle of ΛΛ defining a line bundle on T. For the trivial Hermitian form, this just reduces to a character. Note that the space of character morphisms is isomorphic with a real torusHomAb(Λ,U(1))≅R2n/Z2nHom_Ab(Λ,U(1))≅ℝ^2n/ℤ^2nif Λ≅Z2nΛ≅ℤ^2n since any such character factors through Rℝ composed with the exponential map. That is, a character is a map of the formexp(2πi⟨l∗,−⟩)exp(2^*,-⟩)for some covector l∗∈V∗^*^*. The periodicity of exp(2πif(x))exp(2(x)) for a linear f(x)(x) gives the isomorphism of the character group with the real torus given above. In fact, this torus can be equipped with a complex structure, giving the dual complex torus. Explicitly, a line bundle on T=V/Λ=V/Λ may be constructed by descent from a line bundle on V (which is necessarily trivial) and a descent data, namely a compatible collection of isomorphisms u∗OV→OV^*𝒪_V→𝒪_V, one for each u∈U. Such isomorphisms may be presented as nonvanishing holomorphic functions on V, and for each u the expression above is a corresponding holomorphic function. The Appell–Humbert theorem (Mumford 2008) says that every line bundle on T can be constructed like this for a unique choice of H and αα satisfying the conditions above. Ample line
