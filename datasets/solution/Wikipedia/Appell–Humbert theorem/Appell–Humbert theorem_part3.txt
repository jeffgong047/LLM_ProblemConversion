bundles: Lefschetz proved that the line bundle L, associated to the Hermitian form H is ample if and only if H is positive definite, and in this case L⊗3^⊗3 is very ample. A consequence is that the complex torus is algebraic if and only if there is a positive definite Hermitian form whose imaginary part is integral on Λ×ΛΛ×Λ See
