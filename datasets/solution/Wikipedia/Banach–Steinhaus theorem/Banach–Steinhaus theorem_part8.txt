subsets: Although the notion of a nonmeager set is used in the following version of the uniform bounded principle, the domain X is not assumed to be a Baire space. Theorem[2] — Let H⊆L(X,Y)(X,Y) be a set of continuous linear operators between two topological vector spaces X and Y (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex). For every x∈X,, denote the orbit of x by H(x):=h(x):h∈H(x):={h(x):h} and let B denote the set of all x∈X whose orbit H(x)(x) is a bounded subset of Y.. If B is of the second category (that is, nonmeager) in X then B=X=X and H is equicontinuous. Every proper vector subspace of a TVS X has an empty interior in X..[3] So in particular, every proper vector subspace that is closed is nowhere dense in X and thus of the first category (meager) in X (and the same is thus also true of all its subsets). Consequently, any vector subspace of a TVS X that is of the second category (nonmeager) in X must be a dense subset of X (since otherwise its closure in X would a closed proper vector subspace of X and thus of the first category).[3] Proof[2] Proof that H is equicontinuous: Let W,V⊆Y,V be balanced neighborhoods of the origin in Y satisfying V¯+V¯⊆W.V+V. It must be shown that there exists a neighborhood N⊆X of the origin in X such that h(N)⊆W(N) for every h∈H.. Let C:=⋂h∈Hh−1(V¯), := ⋂_hh^-1(V), which is a closed subset of X (because it is an intersection of closed subsets) that for every h∈H,, also satisfies h(C)⊆V¯(C)⊆V and h(C−C)=h(C)−h(C)⊆V¯−V¯=V¯+V¯⊆W(C-C) = h(C)-h(C) ⊆ V-V = V+V ⊆ W (as will be shown, the set C−C-C is in fact a neighborhood of the origin in X because the topological interior of C in X is not empty). If b∈B then H(b)(b) being bounded in Y implies that there exists some integer n∈N∈ℕ such that H(b)⊆nV(b) so if h∈H,, then b∈h−1(nV)=nh−1(V). ∈ h^-1(nV) = nh^-1(V). Since h∈H was arbitrary, b∈⋂h∈Hnh−1(V)=n⋂h∈Hh−1(V)⊆nC. ∈ ⋂_hnh^-1(V) = n⋂_hh^-1(V) ⊆ nC. This proves that B⊆⋃n∈NnC. ⊆ ⋃_n∈ℕnC. Because B is of the second category in X,, the same must be true of at least one of the sets nC for some n∈N.∈ℕ. The map X→X defined by x↦1nx↦1/nx is a (surjective) homeomorphism, so the set 1n(nC)=C1/n(nC)=C is necessarily of the second category in X.. Because C is closed and of the second category in X,, its topological interior in X is not empty. Pick c∈IntX⁡C.∈Int_XC. Because the map X→X defined by x↦c−x-x is a homeomorphism, the set N:=c−IntX⁡C=IntX⁡(c−C) := c-Int_XC = Int_X(c-C) is a neighborhood of 0=c−c0=c-c in X,, which implies that the same is true of its superset C−C.-C. And so for every h∈H,, h(N)⊆h(c−C)=h(c)−h(C)⊆V¯−V¯⊆W.(N) ⊆ h(c-C) = h(c)-h(C) ⊆ V-V ⊆ W. This proves that H is equicontinuous. Q.E.D. Proof that B=X=X: Because H is equicontinuous, if S⊆X is bounded in X then H(S)(S) is uniformly bounded in Y.. In particular, for any x∈X,, because S:=x:={x} is a bounded subset of X,, H(x)=H(x)({x})=H(x) is a uniformly bounded subset of Y.. Thus B=X.=X. Q.E.D. Sequences of continuous linear
