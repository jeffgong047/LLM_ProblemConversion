spaces: Main article: Barrelled space Attempts to find classes of locally convex topological vector spaces on which the uniform boundedness principle holds eventually led to barrelled spaces. That is, the least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a barrelled space, where the following generalized version of the theorem holds (Bourbaki 1987, Theorem III.2.1): Theorem â€” Given a barrelled space X and a locally convex space Y,, then any family of pointwise bounded continuous linear mappings from X to Y is equicontinuous (and even uniformly equicontinuous). Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever X is a Baire space and Y is a locally convex space.[1] Uniform boundedness in topological vector
