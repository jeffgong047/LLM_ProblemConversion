domain: Dieudonné (1970) proves a weaker form of this theorem with Fréchet spaces rather than the usual Banach spaces. Theorem[2] — Let H⊆L(X,Y)(X,Y) be a set of continuous linear operators from a complete metrizable topological vector space X (such as a Fréchet space or an F-space) into a Hausdorff topological vector space Y.. If for every x∈X,, the orbit H(x):=h(x):h∈H(x):={h(x):h} is a bounded subset of Y then H is equicontinuous. So in particular, if Y is also a normed space and if suph∈H‖h(x)‖<∞foreveryx∈X,sup_hh(x)<∞ foreveryx, then H is equicontinuous. See
