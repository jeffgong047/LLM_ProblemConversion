Corollaries: Corollary — If a sequence of bounded operators (Tn)(T_n) converges pointwise, that is, the limit of (Tn(x))(T_n(x)) exists for all x∈X,, then these pointwise limits define a bounded linear operator T.. The above corollary does not claim that Tn_n converges to T in operator norm, that is, uniformly on bounded sets. However, since Tn{T_n} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator T is continuous, a standard "3ε3ε" estimate shows that Tn_n converges to T uniformly on compact sets. Proof Essentially the same as that of the proof that a pointwise convergent sequence of uniformly continuous functions on a compact set converges to a continuous function. By uniform boundedness principle, let M=maxsupn‖Tn‖,T=max{sup_nT_n,T} be a uniform upper bound on the operator norms. Fix any compact K⊂X. Then for any ϵ>0ϵ>0, finitely cover (use compactness) K by a finite set of open balls B(xi,r)i=1,...,N{B(x_i,r)}_i=1,...,N of radius r=ϵM=ϵ/M Since Tn→T_n pointwise on each of x1,...,xN_1,...,x_N, for all large n, ‖Tn(xi)−T(xi)‖≤ϵT_n(x_i)-T(x_i)≤ϵ for all i=1,...,N=1,...,N. Then by triangle inequality, we find for all large n, ∀x∈K,‖Tn(x)−T(x)‖≤3ϵ,T_n(x)-T(x)≤3ϵ. Corollary — Any weakly bounded subset S⊆Y in a normed space Y is bounded. Indeed, the elements of S define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space X:=Y′,:=Y', which is the continuous dual space of Y.. By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of S,, as functionals on X,, that is, norms in the second dual Y″,”, are bounded. But for every s∈S,, the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in Y,, by a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Let L(X,Y)(X,Y) denote the continuous operators from X to Y,, endowed with the operator norm. If the collection F is unbounded in L(X,Y),(X,Y), then the uniform boundedness principle implies: R=x∈X:supT∈F‖Tx‖Y=∞≠∅.={x sup_TTx_Y=∞}≠∅. In fact, R is dense in X.. The complement of R in X is the countable union of closed sets ⋃Xn._n. By the argument used in proving the theorem, each Xn_n is nowhere dense, i.e. the subset ⋃Xn_n is of first category. Therefore R is the complement of a subset of first category in a Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called comeagre or residual sets) are dense. Such reasoning leads to the principle of condensation of singularities, which can be formulated as follows: Theorem — Let X be a Banach space, (Yn)(Y_n) a sequence of normed vector spaces, and for every n,, let Fn_n an unbounded family in L(X,Yn).(X,Y_n). Then the set R:=x∈X:foralln∈N,supT∈Fn‖Tx‖Yn=∞:={x {foralln∈ℕ,sup_T_nTx_Y_n=∞} is a residual set, and thus dense in X.. Proof The complement of R is the countable union ⋃n,mx∈X:supT∈Fn‖Tx‖Yn≤m⋃_n,m{x sup_T_nTx_Y_n} of sets of first category. Therefore, its residual set R is dense.
