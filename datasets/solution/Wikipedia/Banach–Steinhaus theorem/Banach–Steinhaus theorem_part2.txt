Theorem: Uniform Boundedness Principle — Let X be a Banach space, Y a normed vector space and B(X,Y)(X,Y) the space of all continuous linear operators from X into Y. Suppose that F is a collection of continuous linear operators from X to Y.. If supT∈F‖T(x)‖Y<∞forallx∈X,sup_TT(x)_Y<∞ forallx, then sup‖x‖≤1T∈F,‖T(x)‖Y=supT∈F‖T‖B(X,Y)<∞.sup_T,x≤1T(x)_Y=sup_TT_B(X,Y)<∞. In the case that X is not the trivial vector space, then the semi-inequality used in the supremum of the first term in this last chain of equalities (which has x range over the closed unit ball) may be replaced by a proper equality (which has x range over the closed unit sphere). The completeness of X enables the following short proof, using the Baire category theorem. Proof Let X be a Banach space. Suppose that for every x∈X,, supT∈F‖T(x)‖Y<∞.sup_TT(x)_Y<∞. For every integer n∈N,∈ℕ, let Xn=x∈X:supT∈F‖T(x)‖Y≤n._n={x sup_TT(x)_Y}. Each set Xn_n is a closed set and by the assumption, ⋃n∈NXn=X≠∅.⋃_n∈ℕX_n=X≠∅. By the Baire category theorem for the non-empty complete metric space X,, there exists some m∈N∈ℕ such that Xm_m has non-empty interior; that is, there exist x0∈Xm_0_m and ε>0ε>0 such that Bε(x0)¯:=x∈X:‖x−x0‖≤ε⊆Xm.B_ε(x_0) := {x : x-x_0≤ε} ⊆ X_m. Let u∈X with ‖u‖≤1u≤1 and T∈F.. Then: ‖T(u)‖Y=ε−1‖T(x0+εu)−T(x0)‖Y[bylinearityofT]≤ε−1(‖T(x0+εu)‖Y+‖T(x0)‖Y)≤ε−1(m+m).[sincex0+εu,x0∈Xm]T(u)_Y =ε^-1T(x_0+)-T(x_0)_Y [bylinearityofT] ≤ε^-1(T(x_0+)_Y+T(x_0)_Y) ≤ε^-1(m+m). [since_0+,_0_m] Taking the supremum over u in the unit ball of X and over T∈F it follows that supT∈F‖T‖B(X,Y)≤2ε−1m<∞.sup_TT_B(X,Y) ≤ 2ε^-1m < ∞. There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem (Sokal 2011).
