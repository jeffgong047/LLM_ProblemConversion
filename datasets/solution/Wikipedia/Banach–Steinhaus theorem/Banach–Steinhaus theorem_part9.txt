maps: The following theorem establishes conditions for the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous linear maps to be itself continuous. Theorem[4] — Suppose that h1,h2,…_1,h_2,… is a sequence of continuous linear maps between two topological vector spaces X and Y.. If the set C of all x∈X for which h1(x),h2(x),…_1(x),h_2(x),… is a Cauchy sequence in Y is of the second category in X,, then C=X.=X. If the set L of all x∈X at which the limit h(x):=limn→∞hn(x)(x):=lim_n→∞h_n(x) exists in Y is of the second category in X and if Y is a complete metrizable topological vector space (such as a Fréchet space or an F-space), then L=X=X and h:X→Y:X is a continuous linear map. Theorem[3] — If h1,h2,…_1,h_2,… is a sequence of continuous linear maps from an F-space X into a Hausdorff topological vector space Y such that for every x∈X,, the limit h(x):=limn→∞hn(x)(x) := lim_n→∞h_n(x) exists in Y,, then h:X→Y:X is a continuous linear map and the maps h,h1,h2,…,h_1,h_2,… are equicontinuous. If in addition the domain is a Banach space and the codomain is a normed space then ‖h‖≤liminfn→∞‖hn‖<∞.h≤lim inf_n→∞h_n<∞. Complete metrizable
