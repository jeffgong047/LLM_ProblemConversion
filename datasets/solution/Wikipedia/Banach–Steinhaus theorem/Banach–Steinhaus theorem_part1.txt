A theorem stating that pointwise boundedness implies uniform boundedness For the definition of uniformly bounded functions, see Uniform boundedness. For the conjectures in number theory and algebraic geometry, see Uniform boundedness conjecture (disambiguation). In mathematics, the uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm. The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.
