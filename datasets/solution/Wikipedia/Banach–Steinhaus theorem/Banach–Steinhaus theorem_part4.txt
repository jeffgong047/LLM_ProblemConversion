series: Let T𝕋 be the circle, and let C(T)(𝕋) be the Banach space of continuous functions on T,𝕋, with the uniform norm. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in C(T)(𝕋) for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise. For f∈C(T),(𝕋), its Fourier series is defined by ∑k∈Zf^(k)eikx=∑k∈Z12π(∫02πf(t)e−iktdt)eikx,∑_k∈ℤf̂(k)e^ikx=∑_k∈ℤ1/2π(∫_0^2πf(t)e^-iktdt)e^ikx, and the N-th symmetric partial sum is SN(f)(x)=∑k=−NNf^(k)eikx=12π∫02πf(t)DN(x−t)dt,_N(f)(x)=∑_k=-N^Nf̂(k)e^ikx=1/2π∫_0^2πf(t)D_N(x-t) dt, where DN_N is the N-th Dirichlet kernel. Fix x∈T∈𝕋 and consider the convergence of SN(f)(x).{S_N(f)(x)}. The functional φN,x:C(T)→Cφ_N,x:C(𝕋)→ℂ defined by φN,x(f)=SN(f)(x),f∈C(T),φ_N,x(f)=S_N(f)(x),(𝕋), is bounded. The norm of φN,x,φ_N,x, in the dual of C(T),(𝕋), is the norm of the signed measure (2(2π)−1DN(x−t)dt,(2(2π)^-1D_N(x-t)dt, namely ‖φN,x‖=12π∫02π|DN(x−t)|dt=12π∫02π|DN(s)|ds=‖DN‖L1(T).φ_N,x=1/2π∫_0^2π|D_N(x-t)| dt=1/2π∫_0^2π|D_N(s)| ds=D_N_L^1(𝕋). It can be verified that 12π∫02π|DN(t)|dt≥12π∫02π|sin⁡((N+12)t)|t/2dt→∞.1/2π∫_0^2π|D_N(t)| dt≥1/2π∫_0^2π|sin((N+12)t)|/t/2 dt→∞. So the collection (φN,x)(φ_N,x) is unbounded in C(T)∗,(𝕋)^∗, the dual of C(T).(𝕋). Therefore, by the uniform boundedness principle, for any x∈T,∈𝕋, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at x is dense in C(T).(𝕋). More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let (xm)(x_m) be a dense sequence in T.𝕋. Define φN,xmφ_N,x_m in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each xm_m is dense in C(T)(𝕋) (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function f converges to f(x)(x) for almost every x∈T,∈𝕋, by Carleson's theorem).
