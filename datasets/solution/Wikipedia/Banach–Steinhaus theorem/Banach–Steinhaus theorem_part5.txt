Generalizations: In a topological vector space (TVS) X,, "bounded subset" refers specifically to the notion of a von Neumann bounded subset. If X happens to also be a normed or seminormed space, say with (semi)norm ‖⋅‖,·, then a subset B is (von Neumann) bounded if and only if it is norm bounded, which by definition means supb∈B‖b‖<∞.sup_bb<∞.
