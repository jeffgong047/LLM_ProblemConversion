spaces: Main article: Uniformly bounded sets (topological vector space) A family Bℬ of subsets of a topological vector space Y is said to be uniformly bounded in Y,, if there exists some bounded subset D of Y such that B⊆DforeveryB∈B, foreveryB∈ℬ, which happens if and only if ⋃B∈BB⋃_B∈ℬB is a bounded subset of Y; if Y is a normed space then this happens if and only if there exists some real M≥0≥0 such that supB∈Bb∈B‖b‖≤M.sup_bB∈ℬb. In particular, if H is a family of maps from X to Y and if C⊆X then the family h(C):h∈H{h(C):h} is uniformly bounded in Y if and only if there exists some bounded subset D of Y such that h(C)⊆Dforallh∈H,(C)forallh, which happens if and only if H(C):=⋃h∈Hh(C)(C):=⋃_hh(C) is a bounded subset of Y.. Proposition[2] — Let H⊆L(X,Y)(X,Y) be a set of continuous linear operators between two topological vector spaces X and Y and let C⊆X be any bounded subset of X.. Then the family of sets h(C):h∈H{h(C):h} is uniformly bounded in Y if any of the following conditions are satisfied: H is equicontinuous. C is a convex compact Hausdorff subspace of X and for every c∈C,, the orbit H(c):=h(c):h∈H(c):={h(c):h} is a bounded subset of Y.. Generalizations involving nonmeager
