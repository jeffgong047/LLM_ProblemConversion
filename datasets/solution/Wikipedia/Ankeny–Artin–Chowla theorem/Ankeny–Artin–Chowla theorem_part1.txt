Concerns the class number of a real quadratic field of discriminant > 0 In number theory, the Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence is a result published in 1953 by N. C. Ankeny, Emil Artin and S. Chowla. It concerns the class number h of a real quadratic field of discriminant d > 0. If the fundamental unit of the field is ε=t+ud2ε=t+u√(d)/2 with integers t and u, it expresses in another form htu(modp)ht/up for any prime number p > 2 that divides d. In case p > 3 it states that −2mhtu≡∑0<k<dχ(k)k⌊k/p⌋(modp)-2mht≡∑_0<k<dχ(k)⌊k/p⌋p where m=dp=d/p and χχ is the Dirichlet character for the quadratic field. For p = 3 there is a factor (1 + m) multiplying the LHS. Here ⌊x⌋⌋ represents the floor function of x. A related result is that if d=p is congruent to one mod four, then uth≡B(p−1)/2(modp)uh_(p-1)/2p where Bn is the nth Bernoulli number. There are some generalisations of these basic results, in the papers of the authors.
