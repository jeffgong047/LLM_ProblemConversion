2: The real line Rℝ and the plane R2ℝ^2 are isomorphic as measurable spaces. It is immediate to embed Rℝ into R2.ℝ^2. The converse, embedding of R2.ℝ^2. into Rℝ (as measurable spaces, of course, not as topological spaces) can be made by a well-known trick with interspersed digits; for example, g(π,100e) = g(3.14159 265…, 271.82818 28…) = 20731.184218 51982 2685…. The map g:R2→R:ℝ^2→ℝ is clearly injective. It is easy to check that it is bimeasurable. (However, it is not bijective; for example, the number 1/11=0.090909…1/11=0.090909… is not of the form g(x,y)(x,y)).
