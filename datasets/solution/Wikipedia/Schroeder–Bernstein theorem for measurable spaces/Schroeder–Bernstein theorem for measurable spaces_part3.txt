Comments: The phrase "f is bimeasurable" means that, first, f is measurable (that is, the preimage f−1(B)^-1(B) is measurable for every measurable B⊂Y), and second, the image f(A)(A) is measurable for every measurable A⊂X. (Thus, f(X)(X) must be a measurable subset of Y,, not necessarily the whole Y..) An isomorphism (between two measurable spaces) is, by definition, a bimeasurable bijection. If it exists, these measurable spaces are called isomorphic.
