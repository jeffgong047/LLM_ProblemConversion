(April 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The following simple proof can be found in a collection of problems by late professor H.M. Martirosian from the Yerevan State University, Armenia (Russian). Let's keep in mind that for any ε>0ε>0, there exists an open set U U, so that A⊂U⊂U and μ(U)<μ(A)+εμ(U)<μ(A)+ε. As a consequence, for a given α∈(1/2,1)α∈(1/2,1), we can find an appropriate interval Δ=(a,b)Δ=(a,b) so that taking just an appropriate part of positive measure of the set A we can assume that A⊂Δ⊂Δ, and that μ(A)>α(b−a)μ(A)>α(b-a). Now assume that |x|<δ|x|<δ, where δ=(2α−1)(b−a)δ=(2α-1)(b-a). We'll show that there are common points in the sets x+A+A and A. Otherwise 2μ(A)=μ(x+A)∪A≤μ(x+Δ)∪Δ2μ(A)=μ{(x+A)}≤μ{(x+Δ)∪Δ}. But since δ<b−aδ<b-a, and μ(x+Δ)∪Δ=b−a+|x|<b−a+δμ{(x+Δ)∪Δ}=b-a+|x|<b-a+δ, we would get 2μ(A)<b−a+δ=2α(b−a)2μ(A)<b-a+δ=2α(b-a), which contradicts the initial property of the set. Hence, since (x+A)∩A≠∅(x+A)≠∅, when |x|<δ|x|<δ, it follows immediately that x;|x|<δ⊂A−A{x;|x|<δ}-A, what we needed to establish.
