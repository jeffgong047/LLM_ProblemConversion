Statement: Let A be a Lebesgue-measurable set on the real line such that the Lebesgue measure of A is not zero. Then the difference set A−A=a−b∣a,b∈A-A={a-b,b} contains an open neighbourhood of the origin. The general version of the theorem, first proved by André Weil,[2] states that if G is a locally compact group, and A ⊂ G a subset of positive (left) Haar measure, then AA−1=ab−1∣a,b∈A^-1={ab^-1,b} contains an open neighbourhood of unity. The theorem can also be extended to nonmeagre sets with the Baire property. The proof of these extensions, sometimes also called Steinhaus theorem, is almost identical to the one below.
