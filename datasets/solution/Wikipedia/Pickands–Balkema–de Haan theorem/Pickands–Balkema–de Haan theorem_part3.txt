Statement: Let Fu_u be the conditional excess distribution function. Pickands,[1] Balkema and De Haan[2] posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions F, and large u, Fu_u is well approximated by the generalized Pareto distribution, in the following sense. Suppose that there exist functions a(u),b(u)(u),b(u), with a(u)>0(u)>0 such that Fu(a(u)y+b(u))_u(a(u)y+b(u)) as u→∞→∞ converge to a non-degenerate distribution, then such limit is equal to the generalized Pareto distribution: Fu(a(u)y+b(u))→Gk,σ(y),asu→∞_u(a(u)y+b(u))_k,σ(y),asu→∞, where Gk,σ(y)=1−(1+ky/σ)−1/k_k,σ(y)=1-(1+ky/σ)^-1/k, if k≠0≠0 Gk,σ(y)=1−e−y/σ_k,σ(y)=1-e^-y/σ, if k=0.=0. Here σ > 0, and y ≥ 0 when k ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ y ≤ −σ/k when k < 0. These special cases are also known as Exponential distribution with mean σσ, if k = 0, Uniform distribution on [0,σ][0,σ], if k = -1, Pareto distribution, if k > 0. The class of underlying distribution functions F are related to the class of the distribution functions F satisfying the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem.[3] Since a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution is a power-law, the Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem is sometimes used to justify the use of a power-law for modeling extreme events. The theorem has been extended to include a wider range of distributions.[4][5] While the extended versions cover, for example the normal and log-normal distributions, still continuous distributions exist that are not covered.[6] See
