function: For an unknown distribution function F of a random variable X, the Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem describes the conditional distribution function Fu_u of the variable X above a certain threshold u. This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as Fu(y)=P(X−u≤y|X>u)=F(u+y)−F(u)1−F(u)_u(y)=P(X-u|X>u)=F(u+y)-F(u)/1-F(u) for 0≤y≤xF−u0_F-u, where xF_F is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution F. The function Fu_u describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold u, given that the threshold is exceeded.
