The Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem gives the asymptotic tail distribution of a random variable, when its true distribution is unknown. It is often called the second theorem in extreme value theory. Unlike the first theorem (the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem), which concerns the maximum of a sample, the Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem describes the values above a threshold.
The theorem owes its name to mathematicians James Pickands, Guus Balkema, and Laurens de Haan.


Conditional excess distribution function[edit]
For an unknown distribution function F of a random variable X, the Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem describes the conditional distribution function Fu_u of the variable X above a certain threshold u. This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as

Fu(y)=P(X−u≤y|X>u)=F(u+y)−F(u)1−F(u)_u(y)=P(X-u|X>u)=F(u+y)-F(u)/1-F(u)
for 0≤y≤xF−u0_F-u, where xF_F is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution F. The function Fu_u describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold u, given that the threshold is exceeded.

Statement[edit]
Let Fu_u be the conditional excess distribution function. Pickands,[1] Balkema and De Haan[2] posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions F, and large u, Fu_u is well approximated by the generalized Pareto distribution, in the following sense. Suppose that there exist functions a(u),b(u)(u),b(u), with a(u)>0(u)>0 such that Fu(a(u)y+b(u))_u(a(u)y+b(u)) as u→∞→∞ converge to a non-degenerate distribution, then such limit is equal to the generalized Pareto distribution:

Fu(a(u)y+b(u))→Gk,σ(y),asu→∞_u(a(u)y+b(u))_k,σ(y),asu→∞,
where

Gk,σ(y)=1−(1+ky/σ)−1/k_k,σ(y)=1-(1+ky/σ)^-1/k,  if k≠0≠0
Gk,σ(y)=1−e−y/σ_k,σ(y)=1-e^-y/σ,  if k=0.=0.
Here σ > 0, and y ≥ 0 when k ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ y ≤ −σ/k when k < 0. These special cases are also known as  

Exponential distribution with mean σσ,  if k = 0,
Uniform distribution on [0,σ][0,σ],  if k = -1,
Pareto distribution, if k > 0.
The class of underlying distribution functions F are related to the class of the distribution functions F satisfying the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem.[3]
Since a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution is a power-law, the Pickands–Balkema–De Haan theorem is sometimes used to justify the use of a power-law for modeling extreme events.
The theorem has been extended to include a wider range of distributions.[4][5] While the extended versions cover, for example the normal and log-normal distributions, still continuous distributions exist that are not covered.[6]
