theorem: Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. Let f1(X1,…,Xr,Y1,…,Ys),…,fn(X1,…,Xr,Y1,…,Ys)_1(X_1,…,X_r,Y_1,…,Y_s),…,f_n(X_1,…,X_r,Y_1,…,Y_s) be irreducible polynomials in the ring Q(X1,…,Xr)[Y1,…,Ys].ℚ(X_1,…,X_r)[Y_1,…,Y_s]. Then there exists an r-tuple of rational numbers (a1, ..., ar) such that f1(a1,…,ar,Y1,…,Ys),…,fn(a1,…,ar,Y1,…,Ys)_1(a_1,…,a_r,Y_1,…,Y_s),…,f_n(a_1,…,a_r,Y_1,…,Y_s) are irreducible in the ring Q[Y1,…,Ys].ℚ[Y_1,…,Y_s]. Remarks. It follows from the theorem that there are infinitely many r-tuples. In fact the set of all irreducible specializations, called Hilbert set, is large in many senses. For example, this set is Zariski dense in Qr.ℚ^r. There are always (infinitely many) integer specializations, i.e., the assertion of the theorem holds even if we demand (a1, ..., ar) to be integers. There are many Hilbertian fields, i.e., fields satisfying Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. For example, number fields are Hilbertian.[1] The irreducible specialization property stated in the theorem is the most general. There are many reductions, e.g., it suffices to take n=r=s=1=r=s=1 in the definition. A result of Bary-Soroker shows that for a field K to be Hilbertian it suffices to consider the case of n=r=s=1=r=s=1 and f=f1=f_1 absolutely irreducible, that is, irreducible in the ring Kalg[X,Y], where Kalg is the algebraic closure of K.
