Applications: Hilbert's irreducibility theorem has numerous applications in number theory and algebra. For example: The inverse Galois problem, Hilbert's original motivation. The theorem almost immediately implies that if a finite group G can be realized as the Galois group of a Galois extension N of E=Q(X1,…,Xr),=ℚ(X_1,…,X_r), then it can be specialized to a Galois extension N0 of the rational numbers with G as its Galois group.[2] (To see this, choose a monic irreducible polynomial f(X1, ..., Xn, Y) whose root generates N over E. If f(a1, ..., an, Y) is irreducible for some ai, then a root of it will generate the asserted N0.) Construction of elliptic curves with large rank.[2] Hilbert's irreducibility theorem is used as a step in the Andrew Wiles proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. If a polynomial g(x)∈Z[x](x)∈ℤ[x] is a perfect square for all large integer values of x, then g(x) is the square of a polynomial in Z[x].ℤ[x]. This follows from Hilbert's irreducibility theorem with n=r=s=1=r=s=1 and f1(X,Y)=Y2−g(X)._1(X,Y)=Y^2-g(X). (More elementary proofs exist.) The same result is true when "square" is replaced by "cube", "fourth power", etc.
