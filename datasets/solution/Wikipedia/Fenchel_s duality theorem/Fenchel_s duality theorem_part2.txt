theorem: Let X and Y be Banach spaces, f:X→R∪+∞:X→ℝ∪{+∞} and g:Y→R∪+∞:Y→ℝ∪{+∞} be convex functions and A:X→Y:X be a bounded linear map. Then the Fenchel problems: p∗=infx∈Xf(x)+g(Ax)^*=inf_x{f(x)+g(Ax)} d∗=supy∗∈Y∗−f∗(A∗y∗)−g∗(−y∗)^*=sup_y^*^*{-f^*(A^*y^*)-g^*(-y^*)} satisfy weak duality, i.e. p∗≥d∗^*^*. Note that f∗,g∗^*,g^* are the convex conjugates of f,g respectively, and A∗^* is the adjoint operator. The perturbation function for this dual problem is given by F(x,y)=f(x)+g(Ax−y)(x,y)=f(x)+g(Ax-y). Suppose that f,g, and A satisfy either f and g are lower semi-continuous and 0∈core⁡(dom⁡g−Adom⁡f)0∈core(domg-Adomf) where corecore is the algebraic interior and dom⁡hdomh, where h is some function, is the set z:h(z)<+∞{z:h(z)<+∞}, or Adom⁡f∩cont⁡g≠∅domf∩contg≠∅ where contcont are the points where the function is continuous. Then strong duality holds, i.e. p∗=d∗^*=d^*. If d∗∈R^*∈ℝ then supremum is attained.[1] One-dimensional
