In mathematics, Fenchel's duality theorem is a result in the theory of convex functions named after Werner Fenchel. Let ƒ be a proper convex function on Rn and let g be a proper concave function on Rn. Then, if regularity conditions are satisfied, infx(f(x)−g(x))=supp(g∗(p)−f∗(p)).inf_x(f(x)-g(x))=sup_p(g_*(p)-f^*(p)). where ƒ * is the convex conjugate of ƒ (also referred to as the Fenchel–Legendre transform) and g * is the concave conjugate of g. That is, f∗(x∗):=sup⟨x∗,x⟩−f(x)|x∈Rn^*(x^*):=sup{.^*,x⟩-f(x)|x∈ℝ^n} g∗(x∗):=inf⟨x∗,x⟩−g(x)|x∈Rn_*(x^*):=inf{.^*,x⟩-g(x)|x∈ℝ^n} Mathematical
