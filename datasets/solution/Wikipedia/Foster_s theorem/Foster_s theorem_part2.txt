Theorem: Consider an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain on a countable state space S having a transition probability matrix P with elements pij_ij for pairs i, j in S. Foster's theorem states that the Markov chain is positive recurrent if and only if there exists a Lyapunov function V:S→R:S→ℝ, such that V(i)≥0∀i∈S(i)≥0∀i and ∑j∈SpijV(j)<∞∑_jp_ijV(j)<∞ for i∈F ∑j∈SpijV(j)≤V(i)−ε∑_jp_ijV(j)(i)-ε for all i∉F for some finite set F and strictly positive εε.[2] Related
