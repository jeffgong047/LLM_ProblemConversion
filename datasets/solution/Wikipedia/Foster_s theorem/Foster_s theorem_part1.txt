This article needs attention from an expert in Mathematics. The specific problem is: Needs a proof adding. WikiProject Mathematics may be able to help recruit an expert. (February 2009) This article is about the theorem in Markov probability theory. For the theorem in electrical engineering, see Foster's reactance theorem. In probability theory, Foster's theorem, named after Gordon Foster,[1] is used to draw conclusions about the positive recurrence of Markov chains with countable state spaces. It uses the fact that positive recurrent Markov chains exhibit a notion of "Lyapunov stability" in terms of returning to any state while starting from it within a finite time interval.
