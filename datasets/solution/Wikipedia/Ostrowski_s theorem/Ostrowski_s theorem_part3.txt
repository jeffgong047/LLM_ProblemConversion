Proof: The following proof follows the one of Theorem 10.1 in Schikhof (2007). Let |⋅|∗|·|_* be an absolute value on the rationals. We start the proof by showing that it is entirely determined by the values it takes on prime numbers. From the fact that 1×1=11×1=1 and the multiplicativity property of the absolute value, we infer that |1|∗2=|1|∗|1|_*^2=|1|_*. In particular, |1|∗|1|_* has to be 0 or 1 and since 1≠01≠0, one must have |1|∗=1|1|_*=1. A similar argument shows that |−1|∗=1|-1|_*=1. For all positive integer n, the multiplicativity property entails |−n|∗=|−1|∗×|n|∗=|n|∗|-n|_*=|-1|_*×|n|_*=|n|_*. In other words, the absolute value of a negative integer coincides with that of its opposite. Let n be a positive integer. From the fact that n−1×n=1^-1=1 and the multiplicativity property, we conclude that |n−1|∗=|n|∗−1|n^-1|_*=|n|_*^-1. Let now r be a positive rational. There exist two coprime positive integers p and q such that r=pq−1=pq^-1. The properties above show that |r|∗=|p|∗|q−1|∗=|p|∗|q|∗−1|r|_*=|p|_*|q^-1|_*=|p|_*|q|_*^-1. Altogether, the absolute value of a positive rational is entirely determined from that of its numerator and denominator. Finally, let Pℙ be the set of prime numbers. For all positive integer n, we can write n=∏p∈Ppvp(n),=∏_p∈ℙp^v_p(n), where vp(n)_p(n) is the p-adic valuation of n. The multiplicativity property enables one to compute the absolute value of n from that of the prime numbers using the following relationship |n|∗=|∏p∈Ppvp(n)|=∏p∈P|p|∗vp(n).|n|_*=|∏_p∈ℙp^v_p(n)|=∏_p∈ℙ|p|_*^v_p(n). We continue the proof by separating two cases: There exists a positive integer n such that |n|∗>1|n|_*>1; or For all integer n, one has |n|∗≤1|n|_*≤1. First
