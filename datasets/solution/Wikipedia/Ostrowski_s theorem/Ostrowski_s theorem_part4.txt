case: Suppose that there exists a positive integer n such that |n|∗>1.|n|_*>1. Let k be a non-negative integer and b be a positive integer greater than 11. We express nk^k in base b: there exist a positive integer m and integers (ci)0≤i<m(c_i)_0<m such that for all i, 0≤ci<b0_i<b and nk=∑i<mcibi^k=∑_i<mc_ib^i. In particular, nk≥bm−1^k^m-1 so m≤1+klogb⁡n≤1+klog_bn. Each term |cibi|∗|c_ib^i|_* is smaller than (b−1)|b|∗i(b-1)|b|_*^i (by the multiplicativity property and the triangle inequality). Besides, |b|∗i|b|_*^i is smaller than max1,|b|∗m−1max{1,|b|_*^m-1}. By the triangle inequality and the above bound on m, it follows: |n|∗k≤mmaxi<m|cibi|∗≤m(b−1)max1,|b|∗m−1≤(1+klogb⁡n)(b−1)max1,|b|∗klogb⁡n.|n|_*^k max_i<m{|c_ib^i|_*} (b-1)max{1,|b|_*^m-1} ≤(1+klog_bn)(b-1)max{1,|b|_*^klog_bn}. Therefore, raising both sides to the power 1/k1/k, we obtain |n|∗≤((1+klogb⁡n)(b−1))1/kmax1,|b|∗logb⁡n.|n|_*≤((1+klog_bn)(b-1))^1/kmax{1,|b|_*^log_bn}. Finally, taking the limit as k tends to infinity shows that |n|∗≤max1,|b|∗logb⁡n.|n|_*≤max{1,|b|_*^log_bn}. Together with the condition |n|∗>1,|n|_*>1, the above argument leads to |b|∗>1|b|_*>1 regardless of the choice of b (otherwise |b|∗logb⁡n≤1|b|_*^log_bn≤1 implies |n|∗≤1|n|_*≤1). As a result, all integers greater than one have an absolute value strictly greater than one. Thus generalizing the above, for any choice of integers n and b greater than or equal to 2, we get |n|∗≤|b|∗logb⁡n,|n|_*≤|b|_*^log_bn, i.e. logn⁡|n|∗≤logb⁡|b|∗.log_n|n|_*≤log_b|b|_*. By symmetry, this inequality is an equality. In particular, for all n≥2≥2, logn⁡|n|∗=log2⁡|2|∗=λlog_n|n|_*=log_2|2|_*=λ, i.e. |n|∗=nλ=|n|∞λ|n|_*=n^λ=|n|_∞^λ. Because the triangle inequality implies that for all positive integers n we have |n|∗≤n|n|_*, in this case we obtain more precisely that 0<λ≤10<λ≤1. As per the above result on the determination of an absolute value by its values on the prime numbers, we easily see that |r|∗=|r|∞λ|r|_*=|r|_∞^λ for all rational r, thus demonstrating equivalence to the real absolute value.
