Definitions: Two absolute values |⋅||·| and |⋅|∗|·|_* on the rationals are defined to be equivalent if they induce the same topology; this can be shown to be equivalent to the existence of a positive real number λ∈(0,∞)λ∈(0,∞) such that ∀x∈K:|x|∗=|x|λ.: |x|_*=|x|^λ. (Note: In general, if |x||x| is an absolute value, |x|λ|x|^λ is not necessarily an absolute value anymore; however if two absolute values are equivalent, then each is a positive power of the other.[2]) The trivial absolute value on any field K is defined to be |x|0:=0x=0,1x≠0.|x|_0:=0 x=0, 1 x≠0. The real absolute value on the rationals Qℚ is the standard absolute value on the reals, defined to be |x|∞:=xx≥0,−xx<0.|x|_∞:=x x≥0, -x x<0. This is sometimes written with a subscript 1 instead of infinity. For a prime number p, the p-adic absolute value on Qℚ is defined as follows: any non-zero rational x can be written uniquely as x=pnab=p^nab, where a and b are coprime integers not divisible by p, and n is an integer; so we define |x|p:=0x=0,p−nx≠0.|x|_p:=0 x=0, p^-n x≠0.
