case: Suppose that for all integer n, one has |n|∗≤1|n|_*≤1. As our absolute value is non-trivial, there must exist a positive integer n for which |n|∗<1.|n|_*<1. Decomposing |n|∗|n|_* on the prime numbers shows that there exists p∈P∈ℙ such that |p|∗<1|p|_*<1. We claim that in fact this is so for one prime number only. Suppose per contra that p and q are two distinct primes with absolute value strictly less than 1. Let k be a positive integer such that |p|∗k|p|_*^k and |q|∗k|q|_*^k are smaller than 1/21/2. By Bezout's identity, since pk^k and qk^k are coprime, there exist two integers a and b such that apk+bqk=1.^k+bq^k=1. This yields a contradiction, as 1=|1|∗≤|a|∗|p|∗k+|b|∗|q|∗k<|a|∗+|b|∗2≤1.1=|1|_*≤|a|_*|p|_*^k+|b|_*|q|_*^k<|a|_*+|b|_*/2≤1. This means that there exists a unique prime p such that |p|∗<1|p|_*<1 and that for all other prime q, one has |q|∗=1|q|_*=1 (from the hypothesis of this second case). Let λ=−logp⁡|p|∗λ=-log_p|p|_*. From |p|∗<1|p|_*<1, we infer that 0<λ<∞0<λ<∞. (And indeed in this case, all positive λλ give absolute values equivalent to the p-adic one.) We finally verify that |p|pλ=p−λ=|p|∗|p|_p^λ=p^-λ=|p|_* and that for all other prime q, |q|pλ=1=|q|∗|q|_p^λ=1=|q|_*. As per the above result on the determination of an absolute value by its values on the prime numbers, we conclude that |r|∗=|r|pλ|r|_*=|r|_p^λ for all rational r, implying that this absolute value is equivalent to the p-adic one. ◼▪ Another Ostrowski's
