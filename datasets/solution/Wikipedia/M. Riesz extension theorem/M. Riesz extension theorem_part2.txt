Formulation: Let E be a real vector space, F⊂E be a vector subspace, and K⊂E be a convex cone. A linear functional ϕ:F→Rϕ:F→ℝ is called K-positive, if it takes only non-negative values on the cone K: ϕ(x)≥0forx∈F∩K.ϕ(x)≥0 for. A linear functional ψ:E→Rψ:E→ℝ is called a K-positive extension of ϕϕ, if it is identical to ϕϕ in the domain of ϕϕ, and also returns a value of at least 0 for all points in the cone K: ψ|F=ϕandψ(x)≥0forx∈K.ψ|_F=ϕ and ψ(x)≥0 for. In general, a K-positive linear functional on F cannot be extended to a K-positive linear functional on E. Already in two dimensions one obtains a counterexample. Let E=R2,K=(x,y):y>0∪(x,0):x>0,=ℝ^2,={(x,y):y>0}∪{(x,0):x>0}, and F be the x-axis. The positive functional ϕ(x,0)=xϕ(x,0)=x can not be extended to a positive functional on E. However, the extension exists under the additional assumption that E⊂K+F,+F, namely for every y∈E,, there exists an x∈F such that y−x∈K.-x.
