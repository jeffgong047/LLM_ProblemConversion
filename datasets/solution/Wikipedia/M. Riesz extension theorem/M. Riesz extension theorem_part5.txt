theorem: Main article: Hahn–Banach theorem The Hahn–Banach theorem can be deduced from the M. Riesz extension theorem. Let V be a linear space, and let N be a sublinear function on V. Let φ be a functional on a subspace U ⊂ V that is dominated by N: ϕ(x)≤N(x),x∈U.ϕ(x)(x),. The Hahn–Banach theorem asserts that φ can be extended to a linear functional on V that is dominated by N. To derive this from the M. Riesz extension theorem, define a convex cone K ⊂ R×V by K=(a,x)∣N(x)≤a.={(a,x) | N(x)}. Define a functional φ1 on R×U by ϕ1(a,x)=a−ϕ(x).ϕ_1(a,x)=a-ϕ(x). One can see that φ1 is K-positive, and that K + (R × U) = R × V. Therefore φ1 can be extended to a K-positive functional ψ1 on R×V. Then ψ(x)=−ψ1(0,x)ψ(x)=-ψ_1(0,x) is the desired extension of φ. Indeed, if ψ(x) > N(x), we have: (N(x), x) ∈ K, whereas ψ1(N(x),x)=N(x)−ψ(x)<0,ψ_1(N(x),x)=N(x)-ψ(x)<0, leading to a contradiction.
