Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem (see also below). By transfinite induction or Zorn's lemma it is sufficient to consider the case dim E/F=1/F=1. Choose any y∈E∖F. Set a=supϕ(x)∣x∈F,y−x∈K,b=infϕ(x)∣x∈F,x−y∈K.=sup{ ϕ(x),-x },=̱inf{ ϕ(x),x-y }. We will prove below that −∞<a≤b-∞<a. For now, choose any c satisfying a≤c≤b, and set ψ(y)=cψ(y)=c, ψ|F=ϕψ|_F=ϕ, and then extend ψψ to all of E by linearity. We need to show that ψψ is K-positive. Suppose z∈K. Then either z=0=0, or z=p(x+y)=p(x+y) or z=p(x−y)=p(x-y) for some p>0>0 and x∈F. If z=0=0, then ψ(z)>0ψ(z)>0. In the first remaining case x+y=y−(−x)∈K+y=y-(-x), and so ψ(y)=c≥a≥ϕ(−x)=ψ(−x)ψ(y)=c≥ϕ(-x)=ψ(-x) by definition. Thus ψ(z)=pψ(x+y)=p(ψ(x)+ψ(y))≥0.ψ(z)=pψ(x+y)=p(ψ(x)+ψ(y))≥0. In the second case, x−y∈K-y, and so similarly ψ(y)=c≤b≤ϕ(x)=ψ(x)ψ(y)=c≤ϕ(x)=ψ(x) by definition and so ψ(z)=pψ(x−y)=p(ψ(x)−ψ(y))≥0.ψ(z)=pψ(x-y)=p(ψ(x)-ψ(y))≥0. In all cases, ψ(z)>0ψ(z)>0, and so ψψ is K-positive. We now prove that −∞<a≤b-∞<a. Notice by assumption there exists at least one x∈F for which y−x∈K-x, and so −∞<a-∞<a. However, it may be the case that there are no x∈F for which x−y∈K-y, in which case b=∞=∞ and the inequality is trivial (in this case notice that the third case above cannot happen). Therefore, we may assume that b<∞<∞ and there is at least one x∈F for which x−y∈K-y. To prove the inequality, it suffices to show that whenever x∈F and y−x∈K-x, and x′∈F' and x′−y∈K'-y, then ϕ(x)≤ϕ(x′)ϕ(x)≤ϕ(x'). Indeed, x′−x=(x′−y)+(y−x)∈K'-x=(x'-y)+(y-x) since K is a convex cone, and so 0≤ϕ(x′−x)=ϕ(x′)−ϕ(x)0≤ϕ(x'-x)=ϕ(x')-ϕ(x) since ϕϕ is K-positive. Corollary: Krein's extension
