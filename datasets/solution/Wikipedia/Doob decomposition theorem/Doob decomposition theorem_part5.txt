Existence: Using conditional expectations, define the processes A and M, for every n ∈ I, explicitly by An=∑k=1n(E[Xk|Fk−1]−Xk−1)_n=∑_k=1^n(𝔼[X_k | ℱ_k-1]-X_k-1) (1) and Mn=X0+∑k=1n(Xk−E[Xk|Fk−1]),_n=X_0+∑_k=1^n(X_k-𝔼[X_k | ℱ_k-1]), (2) where the sums for n = 0 are empty and defined as zero. Here A adds up the expected increments of X, and M adds up the surprises, i.e., the part of every Xk that is not known one time step before. Due to these definitions, An+1 (if n + 1 ∈ I) and Mn are Fn-measurable because the process X is adapted, E[|An|] < ∞ and E[|Mn|] < ∞ because the process X is integrable, and the decomposition Xn = Mn + An is valid for every n ∈ I. The martingale property E[Mn−Mn−1|Fn−1]=0𝔼[M_n-M_n-1 | ℱ_n-1]=0 a.s. also follows from the above definition (2), for every n ∈ I \ {0}.
