Uniqueness: To prove uniqueness, let X = M' + A' be an additional decomposition. Then the process Y := M − M' = A' − A is a martingale, implying that E[Yn|Fn−1]=Yn−1𝔼[Y_n | ℱ_n-1]=Y_n-1 a.s., and also predictable, implying that E[Yn|Fn−1]=Yn𝔼[Y_n | ℱ_n-1]=Y_n a.s. for any n ∈ I \ {0}. Since Y0 = A'0 − A0 = 0 by the convention about the starting point of the predictable processes, this implies iteratively that Yn = 0 almost surely for all n ∈ I, hence the decomposition is almost surely unique.
