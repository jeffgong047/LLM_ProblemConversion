Statement: Let (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,ℙ) be a probability space, I = {0, 1, 2, ..., N} with N∈N∈ℕ or I=N0=ℕ_0 a finite or an infinite index set, (Fn)n∈I(ℱ_n)_n a filtration of Fℱ, and X = (Xn)n∈I an adapted stochastic process with E[|Xn|] < ∞ for all n ∈ I. Then there exist a martingale M = (Mn)n∈I and an integrable predictable process A = (An)n∈I starting with A0 = 0 such that Xn = Mn + An for every n ∈ I. Here predictable means that An is Fn−1ℱ_n-1-measurable for every n ∈ I \ {0}. This decomposition is almost surely unique.[2][3][4]
