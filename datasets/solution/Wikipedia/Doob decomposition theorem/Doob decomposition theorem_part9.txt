Example: Let X = (Xn)n∈N0ℕ_0 be a sequence in independent, integrable, real-valued random variables. They are adapted to the filtration generated by the sequence, i.e. Fn = σ(X0, . . . , Xn) for all n ∈ N0ℕ_0. By (1) and (2), the Doob decomposition is given by An=∑k=1n(E[Xk]−Xk−1),n∈N0,_n=∑_k=1^n(𝔼[X_k]-X_k-1),∈ℕ_0, and Mn=X0+∑k=1n(Xk−E[Xk]),n∈N0._n=X_0+∑_k=1^n(X_k-𝔼[X_k]),∈ℕ_0. If the random variables of the original sequence X have mean zero, this simplifies to An=−∑k=0n−1Xk_n=-∑_k=0^n-1X_k and Mn=∑k=0nXk,n∈N0,_n=∑_k=0^nX_k,∈ℕ_0, hence both processes are (possibly time-inhomogeneous) random walks. If the sequence X = (Xn)n∈N0ℕ_0 consists of symmetric random variables taking the values +1 and −1, then X is bounded, but the martingale M and the predictable process A are unbounded simple random walks (and not uniformly integrable), and Doob's optional stopping theorem might not be applicable to the martingale M unless the stopping time has a finite expectation.
