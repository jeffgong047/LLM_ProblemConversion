equation: The general or generic polynomial equation of degree n is the equation xn+a1xn−1+⋯+an−1x+an=0,^n+a_1x^n-1+⋯+a_n-1x+a_n=0, where a1,…,an_1,…,a_n are distinct indeterminates. This is an equation defined over the field F=Q(a1,…,an)=ℚ(a_1,…,a_n) of the rational fractions in a1,…,an_1,…,a_n with rational number coefficients. The original Abel–Ruffini theorem asserts that, for n > 4, this equation is not solvable in radicals. In view of the preceding sections, this results from the fact that the Galois group over F of the equation is the symmetric group Sn𝒮_n (this Galois group is the group of the field automorphisms of the splitting field of the equation that fix the elements of F, where the splitting field is the smallest field containing all the roots of the equation). For proving that the Galois group is Sn,𝒮_n, it is simpler to start from the roots. Let x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n be new indeterminates, aimed to be the roots, and consider the polynomial P(x)=xn+b1xn−1+⋯+bn−1x+bn=(x−x1)⋯(x−xn).(x)=x^n+b_1x^n-1+⋯+b_n-1x+b_n=(x-x_1)⋯(x-x_n). Let H=Q(x1,…,xn)=ℚ(x_1,…,x_n) be the field of the rational fractions in x1,…,xn,_1,…,x_n, and K=Q(b1,…,bn)=ℚ(b_1,…,b_n) be its subfield generated by the coefficients of P(x).(x). The permutations of the xi_i induce automorphisms of H. Vieta's formulas imply that every element of K is a symmetric function of the xi,_i, and is thus fixed by all these automorphisms. It follows that the Galois group Gal⁡(H/K)Gal(H/K) is the symmetric group Sn.𝒮_n. The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials implies that the bi_i are algebraic independent, and thus that the map that sends each ai_i to the corresponding bi_i is a field isomorphism from F to K. This means that one may consider P(x)=0(x)=0 as a generic equation. This finishes the proof that the Galois group of a general equation is the symmetric group, and thus proves the original Abel–Ruffini theorem, which asserts that the general polynomial equation of degree n cannot be solved in radicals for n > 4.
