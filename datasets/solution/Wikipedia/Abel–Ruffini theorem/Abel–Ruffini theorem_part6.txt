groups: For n > 4, the symmetric group Sn𝒮_n of degree n has only the alternating group An𝒜_n as a nontrivial normal subgroup (see Symmetric group § Normal subgroups). For n > 4, the alternating group An𝒜_n is not abelian and simple (that is, it does not have any nontrivial normal subgroup). This implies that both An𝒜_n and Sn𝒮_n are not solvable for n > 4. Thus, the Abel–Ruffini theorem results from the existence of polynomials with a symmetric Galois group; this will be shown in the next section. On the other hand, for n ≤ 4, the symmetric group and all its subgroups are solvable. This explains the existence of the quadratic, cubic, and quartic formulas, since a major result of Galois theory is that a polynomial equation has a solution in radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable (the term "solvable group" takes its origin from this theorem).
