example: See also: Galois theory § A non-solvable quintic example The equation x5−x−1=0^5-x-1=0 is not solvable in radicals, as will be explained below. Let q be x5−x−1^5-x-1. Let G be its Galois group, which acts faithfully on the set of complex roots of q. Numbering the roots lets one identify G with a subgroup of the symmetric group S5𝒮_5. Since qmod22 factors as (x2+x+1)(x3+x2+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^3+x^2+1) in F2[x]𝔽_2[x], the group G contains a permutation g that is a product of disjoint cycles of lengths 2 and 3 (in general, when a monic integer polynomial reduces modulo a prime to a product of distinct monic irreducible polynomials, the degrees of the factors give the lengths of the disjoint cycles in some permutation belonging to the Galois group); then G also contains g3^3, which is a transposition. Since qmod33 is irreducible in F3[x]𝔽_3[x], the same principle shows that G contains a 5-cycle. Because 5 is prime, any transposition and 5-cycle in S5𝒮_5 generate the whole group; see Symmetric group § Generators and relations. Thus G=S5=𝒮_5. Since the group S5𝒮_5 is not solvable, the equation x5−x−1=0^5-x-1=0 is not solvable in radicals. Cayley's
