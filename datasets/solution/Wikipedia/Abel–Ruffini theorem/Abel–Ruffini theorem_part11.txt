History: Around 1770, Joseph Louis Lagrange began the groundwork that unified the many different methods that had been used up to that point to solve equations, relating them to the theory of groups of permutations, in the form of Lagrange resolvents.[9] This innovative work by Lagrange was a precursor to Galois theory, and its failure to develop solutions for equations of fifth and higher degrees hinted that such solutions might be impossible, but it did not provide conclusive proof. The first person who conjectured that the problem of solving quintics by radicals might be impossible to solve was Carl Friedrich Gauss, who wrote in 1798 in section 359 of his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (which would be published only in 1801) that "there is little doubt that this problem does not so much defy modern methods of analysis as that it proposes the impossible". The next year, in his thesis, he wrote "After the labors of many geometers left little hope of ever arriving at the resolution of the general equation algebraically, it appears more and more likely that this resolution is impossible and contradictory." And he added "Perhaps it will not be so difficult to prove, with all rigor, the impossibility for the fifth degree. I shall set forth my investigations of this at greater length in another place." Actually, Gauss published nothing else on this subject.[1] Paolo Ruffini, Teoria generale delle equazioni, 1799 The theorem was first nearly proved by Paolo Ruffini in 1799.[10] He sent his proof to several mathematicians to get it acknowledged, amongst them Lagrange (who did not reply) and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who sent him a letter saying: "Your memoir on the general solution of equations is a work which I have always believed should be kept in mind by mathematicians and which, in my opinion, proves conclusively the algebraic unsolvability of general equations of higher than fourth degree."[11] However, in general, Ruffini's proof was not considered convincing. Abel wrote: "The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument. It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying."[11][12] The proof also, as it was discovered later, was incomplete. Ruffini assumed that all radicals that he was dealing with could be expressed from the roots of the polynomial using field operations alone; in modern terms, he assumed that the radicals belonged to the splitting field of the polynomial. To see why this is really an extra assumption, consider, for instance, the polynomial P(x)=x3‚àí15x‚àí20(x)=x^3-15x-20. According to Cardano's formula, one of its roots (all of them, actually) can be expressed as the sum of a cube root of 10+5i10+5i with a cube root of 10‚àí5i10-5i. On the other hand, since P(‚àí3)<0(-3)<0, P(‚àí2)>0(-2)>0, P(‚àí1)<0(-1)<0, and P(5)>0(5)>0, the roots r1_1, r2_2, and r3_3 of P(x)(x) are all real and therefore the field Q(r1,r2,r3)ùêê(r_1,r_2,r_3) is a subfield of Rùêë. But then the numbers 10¬±5i10¬±5i cannot belong to Q(r1,r2,r3)ùêê(r_1,r_2,r_3). While Cauchy either did not notice Ruffini's assumption or felt that it was a minor one, most historians believe that the proof was not complete until Abel proved the theorem on natural irrationalities, which asserts that the assumption holds in the case of general polynomials.[7][13] The Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem is thus generally credited to Abel, who published a proof compressed into just six pages in 1824.[3] (Abel adopted a very terse style to save paper and money: the proof was printed at his own expense.[8]) A more elaborated version of the proof would be published in 1826.[4] Proving that the general quintic (and higher) equations were unsolvable by radicals did not completely settle the matter, because the Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem does not provide necessary and sufficient conditions for saying precisely which quintic (and higher) equations are unsolvable by radicals. Abel was working on a complete characterization when he died in 1829.[14] According to Nathan Jacobson, "The proofs of Ruffini and of Abel [...] were soon superseded by the crowning achievement of this line of research: Galois' discoveries in the theory of equations."[15] In 1830, Galois (at the age of 18) submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences a memoir on his theory of solvability by radicals, which was ultimately rejected in 1831 as being too sketchy and for giving a condition in terms of the roots of the equation instead of its coefficients. Galois was aware of the contributions of Ruffini and Abel, since he wrote "It is a common truth, today, that the general equation of degree greater than 4 cannot be solved by radicals... this truth has become common (by hearsay) despite the fact that geometers have ignored the proofs of Abel and Ruffini..."[1] Galois then died in 1832 and his paper M√©moire sur les conditions de resolubilit√© des √©quations par radicaux[16] remained unpublished until 1846, when it was published by Joseph Liouville accompanied by some of his own explanations.[14] Prior to this publication, Liouville announced Galois' result to the academy in a speech he gave on 4 July 1843.[5] A simplification of Abel's proof was published by Pierre Wantzel in 1845.[17] When Wantzel published it, he was already aware of the contributions by Galois and he mentions that, whereas Abel's proof is valid only for general polynomials, Galois' approach can be used to provide a concrete polynomial of degree 5 whose roots cannot be expressed in radicals from its coefficients. In 1963, Vladimir Arnold discovered a topological proof of the Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem,[18][19][20] which served as a starting point for topological Galois theory.[21]
