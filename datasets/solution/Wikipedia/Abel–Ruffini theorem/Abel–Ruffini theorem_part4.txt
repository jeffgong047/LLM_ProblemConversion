theory: An algebraic solution of a polynomial equation is an expression involving the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and root extractions. Such an expression may be viewed as the description of a computation that starts from the coefficients of the equation to be solved and proceeds by computing some numbers, one after the other. At each step of the computation, one may consider the smallest field that contains all numbers that have been computed so far. This field is changed only for the steps involving the computation of an nth root. So, an algebraic solution produces a sequence F0⊆F1⊆⋯⊆Fk_0_1⊆⋯_k of fields, and elements xi∈Fi_i_i such that Fi=Fi−1(xi)_i=F_i-1(x_i) for i=1,…,k,=1,…,k, with xini∈Fi−1_i^n_i_i-1 for some integer ni>1._i>1. An algebraic solution of the initial polynomial equation exists if and only if there exists such a sequence of fields such that Fk_k contains a solution. For having normal extensions, which are fundamental for the theory, one must refine the sequence of fields as follows. If Fi−1_i-1 does not contain all ni_i-th roots of unity, one introduces the field Ki_i that extends Fi−1_i-1 by a primitive root of unity, and one redefines Fi_i as Ki(xi)._i(x_i). So, if one starts from a solution in terms of radicals, one gets an increasing sequence of fields such that the last one contains the solution, and each is a normal extension of the preceding one with a Galois group that is cyclic. Conversely, if one has such a sequence of fields, the equation is solvable in terms of radicals. For proving this, it suffices to prove that a normal extension with a cyclic Galois group can be built from a succession of radical extensions. Galois
