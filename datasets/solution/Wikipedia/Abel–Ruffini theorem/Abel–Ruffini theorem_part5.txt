correspondence: The Galois correspondence establishes a one to one correspondence between the subextensions of a normal field extension F/E/E and the subgroups of the Galois group of the extension. This correspondence maps a field K such E⊆K⊆F to the Galois group Gal⁡(F/K)Gal(F/K) of the automorphisms of F that leave K fixed, and, conversely, maps a subgroup H of Gal⁡(F/E)Gal(F/E) to the field of the elements of F that are fixed by H. The preceding section shows that an equation is solvable in terms of radicals if and only if the Galois group of its splitting field (the smallest field that contains all the roots) is solvable, that is, it contains a sequence of subgroups such that each is normal in the preceding one, with a quotient group that is cyclic. (Solvable groups are commonly defined with abelian instead of cyclic quotient groups, but the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups shows that the two definitions are equivalent). So, for proving Abel–Ruffini theorem, it remains to prove that the symmetric group S5_5 is not solvable, and that there are polynomials with symmetric Galois group. Solvable symmetric
