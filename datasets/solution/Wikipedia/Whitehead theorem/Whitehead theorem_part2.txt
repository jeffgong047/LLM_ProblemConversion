Statement: In more detail, let X and Y be topological spaces. Given a continuous mapping f:X→Y and a point x in X, consider for any n ≥ 1 the induced homomorphism f∗:πn(X,x)→πn(Y,f(x)),_*π_n(X,x)→π_n(Y,f(x)), where πn(X,x) denotes the n-th homotopy group of X with base point x. (For n = 0, π0(X) just means the set of path components of X.) A map f is a weak homotopy equivalence if the function f∗:π0(X)→π0(Y)_*π_0(X)→π_0(Y) is bijective, and the homomorphisms f* are bijective for all x in X and all n ≥ 1. (For X and Y path-connected, the first condition is automatic, and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point x in X.) The Whitehead theorem states that a weak homotopy equivalence from one CW complex to another is a homotopy equivalence. (That is, the map f: X → Y has a homotopy inverse g: Y → X, which is not at all clear from the assumptions.) This implies the same conclusion for spaces X and Y that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes. Combining this with the Hurewicz theorem yields a useful corollary: a continuous map f:X→Y between simply connected CW complexes that induces an isomorphism on all integral homology groups is a homotopy equivalence. Spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may not be homotopy
