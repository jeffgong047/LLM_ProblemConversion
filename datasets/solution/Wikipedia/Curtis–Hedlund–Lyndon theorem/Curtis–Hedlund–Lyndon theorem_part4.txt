alphabets: Consider the space of bi-infinite sequences of integers, and define a function f from this space to itself according to the rule that, if f(x) = y, then for every position i, yi = xi + xi. This rule is the same for each position, so it is shift-equivariant. And it can be shown to be continuous according to the Cantor topology: for each finite pattern p in y, there is a pattern in x with at most twice as many positions that forces f to generate p, consisting of the cells in p together with the cells whose values are copied into p. However, despite being continuous and equivariant, f is not a cellular automaton rule, because the value of any cell can potentially depend on the value of any other cell rather than only depending on the cells in any prior-fixed finite neighborhood.[4] Application to reversible cellular
