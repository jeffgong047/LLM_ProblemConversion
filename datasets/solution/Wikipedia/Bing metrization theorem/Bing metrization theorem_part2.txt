statement: The theorem states that a topological space X is metrizable if and only if it is regular and T0 and has a σ-discrete basis. A family of sets is called σ-discrete when it is a union of countably many discrete collections, where a family Fℱ of subsets of a space X is called discrete, when every point of X has a neighborhood that intersects at most one member of F.ℱ.
