theorem: Herbrand's theorem has been extended to higher-order logic by using expansion-tree proofs.[3] The deep representation of expansion-tree proofs corresponds to a Herbrand disjunction, when restricted to first-order logic. Herbrand disjunctions and expansion-tree proofs have been extended with a notion of cut. Due to the complexity of cut-elimination, Herbrand disjunctions with cuts can be non-elementarily smaller than a standard Herbrand disjunction. Herbrand disjunctions have been generalized to Herbrand sequents, allowing Herbrand's theorem to be stated for sequents: "a Skolemized sequent is derivable if and only if it has a Herbrand sequent".
