Statement: Let (∃y1,…,yn)F(y1,…,yn)(_1,…,y_n)F(y_1,…,y_n) be a formula of first-order logic with F(y1,…,yn)(y_1,…,y_n) quantifier-free, though it may contain additional free variables. This version of Herbrand's theorem states that the above formula is valid if and only if there exists a finite sequence of terms tij_ij, possibly in an expansion of the language, with 1≤i≤r1 and 1≤j≤n1, such that F(t11,…,t1n)∨…∨F(tr1,…,trn)(t_11,…,t_1n)∨…(t_r1,…,t_rn) is valid. If it is valid, it is called a Herbrand disjunction for (∃y1,…,yn)F(y1,…,yn).(_1,…,y_n)F(y_1,…,y_n). Informally: a formula A in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers is provable (valid) in first-order logic if and only if a disjunction composed of substitution instances of the quantifier-free subformula of A is a tautology (propositionally derivable). The restriction to formulas in prenex form containing only existential quantifiers does not limit the generality of the theorem, because formulas can be converted to prenex form and their universal quantifiers can be removed by Herbrandization. Conversion to prenex form can be avoided, if structural Herbrandization is performed. Herbrandization can be avoided by imposing additional restrictions on the variable dependencies allowed in the Herbrand disjunction. Proof
