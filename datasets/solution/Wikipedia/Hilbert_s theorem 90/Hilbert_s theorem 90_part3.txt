Cohomology: The theorem can be stated in terms of group cohomology: if L× is the multiplicative group of any (not necessarily finite) Galois extension L of a field K with corresponding Galois group G, then H1(G,L×)=1.^1(G,L^×)={1}. Specifically, group cohomology is the cohomology of the complex whose i-cochains are arbitrary functions from i-tuples of group elements to the multiplicative coefficient group, Ci(G,L×)=ϕ:Gi→L×^i(G,L^×)={ϕ:G^i^×}, with differentials di:Ci→Ci+1^i:C^i^i+1 defined in dimensions i=0,1=0,1 by: (d0(b))(σ)=b/bσ,and(d1(ϕ))(σ,τ)=ϕ(σ)ϕ(τ)σ/ϕ(στ),(d^0(b))(σ)=b/b^σ, and (d^1(ϕ))(σ,τ) = ϕ(σ)ϕ(τ)^σ/ϕ(στ), where xg^g denotes the image of the G-module element x under the action of the group element g∈G. Note that in the first of these we have identified a 0-cochain γ=γb:G0=idG→L×γ=γ_b:G^0=id_G^×, with its unique image value b∈L×^×. The triviality of the first cohomology group is then equivalent to the 1-cocycles Z1^1 being equal to the 1-coboundaries B1^1, viz.: Z1=ker⁡d1=ϕ∈C1satisfying∀σ,τ∈G:ϕ(στ)=ϕ(σ)ϕ(τ)σisequaltoB1=imd0=ϕ∈C1:∃b∈L×suchthatϕ(σ)=b/bσ∀σ∈G.[ Z^1 = ^1 = {ϕ^1satisfying ∀σ,τ ϕ(στ)=ϕ(σ) ϕ(τ)^σ}; isequalto; B^1 = imd^0 = {ϕ^1; , ∃ b^×suchthatϕ(σ)=b/b^σ; ∀σ}. ] For cyclic G=1,σ,…,σn−1={1,σ,…,σ^n-1}, a 1-cocycle is determined by ϕ(σ)=a∈L×ϕ(σ)=a^×, with ϕ(σi)=aσ(a)⋯σi−1(a)ϕ(σ^i)=a σ(a)⋯σ^i-1(a) and:1=ϕ(1)=ϕ(σn)=aσ(a)⋯σn−1(a)=N(a).1=ϕ(1)=ϕ(σ^n)=a σ(a)⋯σ^n-1(a)=N(a).On the other hand, a 1-coboundary is determined by ϕ(σ)=b/bσϕ(σ)=b/b^σ. Equating these gives the original version of the Theorem. A further generalization is to cohomology with non-abelian coefficients: that if H is either the general or special linear group over L, including GL1⁡(L)=L×GL_1(L)=L^×, then H1(G,H)=1.^1(G,H)={1}. Another generalization is to a scheme X: Het1(X,Gm)=H1(X,OX×)=Pic⁡(X),_et^1(X,𝔾_m)=H^1(X,𝒪_X^×)=Pic(X), where Pic⁡(X)Pic(X) is the group of isomorphism classes of locally free sheaves of OX×𝒪_X^×-modules of rank 1 for the Zariski topology, and Gm𝔾_m is the sheaf defined by the affine line without the origin considered as a group under multiplication. [1] There is yet another generalization to Milnor K-theory which plays a role in Voevodsky's proof of the Milnor conjecture.
