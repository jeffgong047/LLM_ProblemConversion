Examples: Let L/K/K be the quadratic extension Q(i)/Qℚ(i)/ℚ. The Galois group is cyclic of order 2, its generator σσ acting via conjugation: σ:c+di↦c−di.σ:c+di-di. An element a=x+yi=x+yi in Q(i)ℚ(i) has norm aσ(a)=x2+y2σ(a)=x^2+y^2. An element of norm one thus corresponds to a rational solution of the equation x2+y2=1^2+y^2=1 or in other words, a point with rational coordinates on the unit circle. Hilbert's Theorem 90 then states that every such element a of norm one can be written as a=c−dic+di=c2−d2c2+d2−2cdc2+d2i,=c-di/c+di=c^2-d^2/c^2+d^2-2cd/c^2+d^2i, where b=c+di=c+di is as in the conclusion of the theorem, and c and d are both integers. This may be viewed as a rational parametrization of the rational points on the unit circle. Rational points (x,y)=(p/r,q/r)(x,y)=(p/r,q/r) on the unit circle x2+y2=1^2+y^2=1 correspond to Pythagorean triples, i.e. triples (p,q,r)(p,q,r) of integers satisfying p2+q2=r2^2+q^2=r^2.
