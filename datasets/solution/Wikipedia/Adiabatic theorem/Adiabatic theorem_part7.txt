crossing: Main article: Avoided crossing Figure 2. An avoided energy-level crossing in a two-level system subjected to an external magnetic field. Note the energies of the diabatic states, |1⟩|1⟩ and |2⟩|2⟩ and the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, giving the energies of the eigenstates |ϕ1⟩|ϕ_1⟩ and |ϕ2⟩|ϕ_2⟩ (the adiabatic states). (Actually, |ϕ1⟩|ϕ_1⟩ and |ϕ2⟩|ϕ_2⟩ should be switched in this picture.) For a more widely applicable example, consider a 2-level atom subjected to an external magnetic field.[7] The states, labelled |1⟩|1⟩ and |2⟩|2⟩ using bra–ket notation, can be thought of as atomic angular-momentum states, each with a particular geometry. For reasons that will become clear these states will henceforth be referred to as the diabatic states. The system wavefunction can be represented as a linear combination of the diabatic states: |Ψ⟩=c1(t)|1⟩+c2(t)|2⟩.|Ψ⟩=c_1(t)|1⟩+c_2(t)|2⟩. With the field absent, the energetic separation of the diabatic states is equal to ℏω0ħω_0; the energy of state |1⟩|1⟩ increases with increasing magnetic field (a low-field-seeking state), while the energy of state |2⟩|2⟩ decreases with increasing magnetic field (a high-field-seeking state). Assuming the magnetic-field dependence is linear, the Hamiltonian matrix for the system with the field applied can be written H=(μB(t)−ℏω0/2aa∗ℏω0/2−μB(t))𝐇=[ (t)-ħω_0/2 a; a^* ħω_0/2-(t) ] where μμ is the magnetic moment of the atom, assumed to be the same for the two diabatic states, and a is some time-independent coupling between the two states. The diagonal elements are the energies of the diabatic states (E1(t)_1(t) and E2(t)_2(t)), however, as H𝐇 is not a diagonal matrix, it is clear that these states are not eigenstates of H𝐇 due to the off diagonal coupling constant. The eigenvectors of the matrix H𝐇 are the eigenstates of the system, which we will label |ϕ1(t)⟩|ϕ_1(t)⟩ and |ϕ2(t)⟩|ϕ_2(t)⟩, with corresponding eigenvalues ε1(t)=−124a2+(ℏω0−2μB(t))2ε2(t)=+124a2+(ℏω0−2μB(t))2.ε_1(t) =-1/2√(4a^2+(ħω_0-2(t))^2) ε_2(t) =+1/2√(4a^2+(ħω_0-2(t))^2). It is important to realise that the eigenvalues ε1(t)ε_1(t) and ε2(t)ε_2(t) are the only allowed outputs for any individual measurement of the system energy, whereas the diabatic energies E1(t)_1(t) and E2(t)_2(t) correspond to the expectation values for the energy of the system in the diabatic states |1⟩|1⟩ and |2⟩|2⟩. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the diabatic and adiabatic energies on the value of the magnetic field; note that for non-zero coupling the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian cannot be degenerate, and thus we have an avoided crossing. If an atom is initially in state |ϕ2(t0)⟩|ϕ_2(t_0)⟩ in zero magnetic field (on the red curve, at the extreme left), an adiabatic increase in magnetic field (dBdt→0)(dB/dt→0) will ensure the system remains in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian |ϕ2(t)⟩|ϕ_2(t)⟩ throughout the process (follows the red curve). A diabatic increase in magnetic field (dBdt→∞)(dB/dt→∞) will ensure the system follows the diabatic path (the dotted blue line), such that the system undergoes a transition to state |ϕ1(t1)⟩|ϕ_1(t_1)⟩. For finite magnetic field slew rates (0<dBdt<∞)(0<dB/dt<∞) there will be a finite probability of finding the system in either of the two eigenstates. See below for approaches to calculating these probabilities. These results are extremely important in atomic and molecular physics for control of the energy-state distribution in a population of atoms or molecules. Mathematical
