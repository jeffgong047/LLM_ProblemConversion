oscillator: Figure 1. Change in the probability density, |ψ(t)|2|ψ(t)|^2, of a ground state quantum harmonic oscillator, due to an adiabatic increase in spring constant. The classical nature of a pendulum precludes a full description of the effects of the adiabatic theorem. As a further example consider a quantum harmonic oscillator as the spring constant k is increased. Classically this is equivalent to increasing the stiffness of a spring; quantum-mechanically the effect is a narrowing of the potential energy curve in the system Hamiltonian. If k is increased adiabatically (dkdt→0)(dk/dt→0) then the system at time t will be in an instantaneous eigenstate ψ(t)ψ(t) of the current Hamiltonian H^(t)Ĥ(t), corresponding to the initial eigenstate of H^(0)Ĥ(0). For the special case of a system like the quantum harmonic oscillator described by a single quantum number, this means the quantum number will remain unchanged. Figure 1 shows how a harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, n=0=0, remains in the ground state as the potential energy curve is compressed; the functional form of the state adapting to the slowly varying conditions. For a rapidly increased spring constant, the system undergoes a diabatic process (dkdt→∞)(dk/dt→∞) in which the system has no time to adapt its functional form to the changing conditions. While the final state must look identical to the initial state (|ψ(t)|2=|ψ(0)|2)(|ψ(t)|^2=|ψ(0)|^2) for a process occurring over a vanishing time period, there is no eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, H^(t)Ĥ(t), that resembles the initial state. The final state is composed of a linear superposition of many different eigenstates of H^(t)Ĥ(t) which sum to reproduce the form of the initial state. Avoided curve
