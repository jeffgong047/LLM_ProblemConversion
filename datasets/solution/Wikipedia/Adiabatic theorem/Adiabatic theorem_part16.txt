approach: Main article: Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations For a transition involving a nonlinear change in perturbation variable or time-dependent coupling between the diabatic states, the equations of motion for the system dynamics cannot be solved analytically. The diabatic transition probability can still be obtained using one of the wide variety of numerical solution algorithms for ordinary differential equations. The equations to be solved can be obtained from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation: iℏc_˙A(t)=HA(t)c_A(t),ħċ^A(t)=𝐇_A(t)c^A(t), where c_A(t)c^A(t) is a vector containing the adiabatic state amplitudes, HA(t)𝐇_A(t) is the time-dependent adiabatic Hamiltonian,[7] and the overdot represents a time derivative. Comparison of the initial conditions used with the values of the state amplitudes following the transition can yield the diabatic transition probability. In particular, for a two-state system: PD=|c2A(t1)|2_D=|c_2^A(t_1)|^2 for a system that began with |c1A(t0)|2=1|c_1^A(t_0)|^2=1. See
