(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) We will now pursue a more rigorous analysis.[17] Making use of bra–ket notation, the state vector of the system at time t can be written |ψ(t)⟩=∑ncnA(t)e−iEnt/ℏ|ϕn⟩,|ψ(t)⟩=∑_nc_n^A(t)e^-iE_nt/ħ|ϕ_n⟩, where the spatial wavefunction alluded to earlier is the projection of the state vector onto the eigenstates of the position operator ψ(x,t)=⟨x|ψ(t)⟩.ψ(x,t)=|ψ(t)⟩. It is instructive to examine the limiting cases, in which ττ is very large (adiabatic, or gradual change) and very small (diabatic, or sudden change). Consider a system Hamiltonian undergoing continuous change from an initial value H^0Ĥ_0, at time t0_0, to a final value H^1Ĥ_1, at time t1_1, where τ=t1−t0τ=t_1-t_0. The evolution of the system can be described in the Schrödinger picture by the time-evolution operator, defined by the integral equation U^(t,t0)=1−iℏ∫t0tH^(t′)U^(t′,t0)dt′,Û(t,t_0)=1-i/ħ∫_t_0^tĤ(t')Û(t',t_0)dt', which is equivalent to the Schrödinger equation. iℏ∂∂tU^(t,t0)=H^(t)U^(t,t0),ħ∂/Û(t,t_0)=Ĥ(t)Û(t,t_0), along with the initial condition U^(t0,t0)=1Û(t_0,t_0)=1. Given knowledge of the system wave function at t0_0, the evolution of the system up to a later time t can be obtained using |ψ(t)⟩=U^(t,t0)|ψ(t0)⟩.|ψ(t)⟩=Û(t,t_0)|ψ(t_0)⟩. The problem of determining the adiabaticity of a given process is equivalent to establishing the dependence of U^(t1,t0)Û(t_1,t_0) on ττ. To determine the validity of the adiabatic approximation for a given process, one can calculate the probability of finding the system in a state other than that in which it started. Using bra–ket notation and using the definition |0⟩≡|ψ(t0)⟩|0⟩≡|ψ(t_0)⟩, we have: ζ=⟨0|U^†(t1,t0)U^(t1,t0)|0⟩−⟨0|U^†(t1,t0)|0⟩⟨0|U^(t1,t0)|0⟩.ζ=⟨0|Û^†(t_1,t_0)Û(t_1,t_0)|0⟩-⟨0|Û^†(t_1,t_0)|0⟩⟨0|Û(t_1,t_0)|0⟩. We can expand U^(t1,t0)Û(t_1,t_0) U^(t1,t0)=1+1iℏ∫t0t1H^(t)dt+1(iℏ)2∫t0t1dt′∫t0t′dt″H^(t′)H^(t″)+⋯.Û(t_1,t_0)=1+1ħ∫_t_0^t_1Ĥ(t)dt+1(iħ)^2∫_t_0^t_1dt'∫_t_0^t'dt”Ĥ(t')Ĥ(t”)+⋯. In the perturbative limit we can take just the first two terms and substitute them into our equation for ζζ, recognizing that 1τ∫t0t1H^(t)dt≡H¯1τ∫_t_0^t_1Ĥ(t)dt≡H̅ is the system Hamiltonian, averaged over the interval t0→t1_0_1, we have: ζ=⟨0|(1+iℏτH¯)(1−iℏτH¯)|0⟩−⟨0|(1+iℏτH¯)|0⟩⟨0|(1−iℏτH¯)|0⟩.ζ=⟨0|(1+iħτH̅)(1-iħτH̅)|0⟩-⟨0|(1+iħτH̅)|0⟩⟨0|(1-iħτH̅)|0⟩. After expanding the products and making the appropriate cancellations, we are left with: ζ=τ2ℏ2(⟨0|H¯2|0⟩−⟨0|H¯|0⟩⟨0|H¯|0⟩),ζ=τ^2/ħ^2(⟨0|H̅^2|0⟩-⟨0|H̅|0⟩⟨0|H̅|0⟩), giving ζ=τ2ΔH¯2ℏ2,ζ=τ^2ΔH̅^2/ħ^2, where ΔH¯ΔH̅ is the root mean square deviation of the system Hamiltonian averaged over the interval of interest. The sudden approximation is valid when ζ≪1ζ≪1 (the probability of finding the system in a state other than that in which is started approaches zero), thus the validity condition is given by τ≪ℏΔH¯,τ≪ħΔH̅, which is a statement of the time-energy form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
