passage: In the limit τ→∞τ→∞ we have infinitely slow, or adiabatic passage. The system evolves, adapting its form to the changing conditions, |⟨x|ψ(t1)⟩|2≠|⟨x|ψ(t0)⟩|2.||ψ(t_1)⟩|^2≠||ψ(t_0)⟩|^2. If the system is initially in an eigenstate of H^(t0)Ĥ(t_0), after a period ττ it will have passed into the corresponding eigenstate of H^(t1)Ĥ(t_1). This is referred to as the adiabatic approximation. The validity of the approximation for a given process can be determined from the probability that the final state of the system is different from the initial state: PA=ζ._A=ζ.
