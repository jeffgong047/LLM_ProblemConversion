formula: Main article: Landau–Zener formula In 1932 an analytic solution to the problem of calculating adiabatic transition probabilities was published separately by Lev Landau and Clarence Zener,[18] for the special case of a linearly changing perturbation in which the time-varying component does not couple the relevant states (hence the coupling in the diabatic Hamiltonian matrix is independent of time). The key figure of merit in this approach is the Landau–Zener velocity: vLZ=∂∂t|E2−E1|∂∂q|E2−E1|≈dqdt,_LZ=∂/|E_2-E_1|∂/|E_2-E_1|≈dq/dt, where q is the perturbation variable (electric or magnetic field, molecular bond-length, or any other perturbation to the system), and E1_1 and E2_2 are the energies of the two diabatic (crossing) states. A large vLZ_LZ results in a large diabatic transition probability and vice versa. Using the Landau–Zener formula the probability, PD_D, of a diabatic transition is given by PD=e−2πΓΓ=a2/ℏ|∂∂t(E2−E1)|=a2/ℏ|dqdt∂∂q(E2−E1)|=a2ℏ|α|P_D =e^-2πΓ Γ =a^2/ħ|∂/(E_2-E_1)|=a^2/ħ|dq/dt∂/(E_2-E_1)| =a^2ħ|α| The numerical
