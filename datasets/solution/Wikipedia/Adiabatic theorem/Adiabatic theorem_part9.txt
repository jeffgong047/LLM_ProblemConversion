Proofs: Sakurai in Modern Quantum Mechanics[8] This proof is partly inspired by one given by Sakurai in Modern Quantum Mechanics.[9] The instantaneous eigenstates |n(t)⟩|n(t)⟩ and energies En(t)_n(t), by assumption, satisfy the time-independent Schrödinger equation H(t)|n(t)⟩=En(t)|n(t)⟩(t)|n(t)⟩=E_n(t)|n(t)⟩ at all times t. Thus, they constitute a basis that can be used to expand the state |ψ(t)⟩=∑ncn(t)|n(t)⟩|ψ(t)⟩=∑_nc_n(t)|n(t)⟩ at any time t. The evolution of the system is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation iℏ|ψ˙(t)⟩=H(t)|ψ(t)⟩,ħ|ψ̇(t)⟩=H(t)|ψ(t)⟩, where ˙=d/dt=d/dt (see Notation for differentiation § Newton's notation). Insert the expansion of |ψ(t)⟩|ψ(t)⟩, use H(t)|n(t)⟩=En(t)|n(t)⟩(t)|n(t)⟩=E_n(t)|n(t)⟩, differentiate with the product rule, take the inner product with |m(t)⟩|m(t)⟩ and use orthonormality of the eigenstates to obtain iℏc˙m(t)+iℏ∑ncn(t)⟨m(t)|n˙(t)⟩=cm(t)Em(t).ħċ_m(t)+iħ∑_nc_n(t)(t)|ṅ(t)⟩=c_m(t)E_m(t). This coupled first-order differential equation is exact and expresses the time-evolution of the coefficients in terms of inner products ⟨m(t)|n˙(t)⟩(t)|ṅ(t)⟩ between the eigenstates and the time-differentiated eigenstates. But it is possible to re-express the inner products for m≠n in terms of matrix elements of the time-differentiated Hamiltonian H˙(t)Ḣ(t). To do so, differentiate both sides of the time-independent Schrödinger equation with respect to time using the product rule to get H˙(t)|n(t)⟩+H(t)|n˙(t)⟩=E˙n(t)|n(t)⟩+En(t)|n˙(t)⟩.Ḣ(t)|n(t)⟩+H(t)|ṅ(t)⟩=Ė_n(t)|n(t)⟩+E_n(t)|ṅ(t)⟩. Again take the inner product with |m(t)⟩|m(t)⟩ and use ⟨m(t)|H(t)=Em(t)⟨m(t)|(t)|H(t)=E_m(t)(t)| and orthonormality to find ⟨m(t)|n˙(t)⟩=−⟨m(t)|H˙(t)|n(t)⟩Em(t)−En(t)(m≠n).(t)|ṅ(t)⟩=-(t)|Ḣ(t)|n(t)⟩/E_m(t)-E_n(t) (m). Insert this into the differential equation for the coefficients to obtain c˙m(t)+(iℏEm(t)+⟨m(t)|m˙(t)⟩)cm(t)=∑n≠m⟨m(t)|H˙|n(t)⟩Em(t)−En(t)cn(t).ċ_m(t)+(i/ħE_m(t)+(t)|ṁ(t)⟩)c_m(t)=∑_n(t)|Ḣ|n(t)⟩/E_m(t)-E_n(t)c_n(t). This differential equation describes the time-evolution of the coefficients, but now in terms of matrix elements of H˙(t)Ḣ(t). To arrive at the adiabatic theorem, neglect the right hand side. This is valid if the rate of change of the Hamiltonian H˙(t)Ḣ(t) is small and there is a finite gap Em(t)−En(t)≠0_m(t)-E_n(t)≠0 between the energies. This is known as the adiabatic approximation. Under the adiabatic approximation, c˙m(t)=i(−Em(t)ℏ+i⟨m(t)|m˙(t)⟩)cm(t)ċ_m(t)=i(-E_m(t)/ħ+i(t)|ṁ(t)⟩)c_m(t) which integrates precisely to the adiabatic theorem cm(t)=cm(0)eiθm(t)eiγm(t)_m(t)=c_m(0)e^iθ_m(t)e^iγ_m(t) with the phases defined in the statement of the theorem. The dynamical phase θm(t)θ_m(t) is real because it involves an integral over a real energy. To see that the geometric phase γm(t)γ_m(t) is purely real, differentiate the normalization ⟨m(t)|m(t)⟩=1(t)|m(t)⟩=1 of the eigenstates and use the product rule to find that 0=ddt(⟨m(t)|m(t)⟩)=⟨m˙(t)|m(t)⟩+⟨m(t))|m˙(t)⟩=⟨m(t))|m˙(t)⟩∗+⟨m(t))|m˙(t)⟩=2Re⁡(⟨m(t))|m˙(t)⟩).0=d/dt((t)|m(t)⟩)=⟨ṁ(t)|m(t)⟩+(t))|ṁ(t)⟩=(t))|ṁ(t)⟩^*+(t))|ṁ(t)⟩=2 Re((t))|ṁ(t)⟩). Thus, ⟨m(t))|m˙(t)⟩(t))|ṁ(t)⟩ is purely imaginary, so the geometric phase γm(t)γ_m(t) is purely real. Adiabatic approximation[10][11] Proof with the details of the adiabatic approximation[12][13] We are going to formulate the statement of the theorem as follows: For a slowly varying Hamiltonian H^Ĥ in the time range T the solution of the schroedinger equation Ψ(t)Ψ(t) with initial conditions Ψ(0)=ψn(0)Ψ(0)=ψ_n(0) where ψn(t)ψ_n(t) is the eigenvector of the instantaneous Schroedinger equation H^(t)ψn(t)=En(t)ψn(t)Ĥ(t)ψ_n(t)=E_n(t)ψ_n(t) can be approximated as: ‖Ψ(t)−ψadiabatic(t)‖≈O(1T)Ψ(t)-ψ_adiabatic(t)(1/T) where the adiabatic approximation is: |ψadiabatic(t)⟩=eiθn(t)eiγn(t)|ψn(t)⟩|ψ_adiabatic(t)⟩=e^iθ_n(t)e^iγ_n(t)|ψ_n(t)⟩ and θn(t)=−1ℏ∫0tEn(t′)dt′θ_n(t)=-1/ħ∫_0^tE_n(t')dt' γn(t)=∫0tνn(t′)dt′γ_n(t)=∫_0^tν_n(t')dt' also called Berry phase νn(t)=i⟨ψn(t)|ψ˙n(t)⟩ν_n(t)=i⟨ψ_n(t)|ψ̇_n(t)⟩ And now we are going to prove the theorem. Consider the time-dependent Schrödinger equation iℏ∂∂t|ψ(t)⟩=H^(tT)|ψ(t)⟩ħ∂|ψ(t)⟩=Ĥ(tT)|ψ(t)⟩ with Hamiltonian H^(t).Ĥ(t). We would like to know the relation between an initial state |ψ(0)⟩|ψ(0)⟩ and its final state |ψ(T)⟩|ψ(T)⟩ at t=T=T in the adiabatic limit T→∞.→∞. First redefine time as λ=tT∈[0,1]λ=tT∈[0,1]: iℏ∂∂λ|ψ(λ)⟩=TH^(λ)|ψ(λ)⟩.ħ∂∂λ|ψ(λ)⟩=TĤ(λ)|ψ(λ)⟩. At every point in time H^(λ)Ĥ(λ) can be diagonalized H^(λ)|ψn(λ)⟩=En(λ)|ψn(λ)⟩Ĥ(λ)|ψ_n(λ)⟩=E_n(λ)|ψ_n(λ)⟩ with eigenvalues En_n and eigenvectors |ψn(λ)⟩|ψ_n(λ)⟩. Since the eigenvectors form a complete basis at any time we can expand |ψ(λ)⟩|ψ(λ)⟩ as: |ψ(λ)⟩=∑ncn(λ)|ψn(λ)⟩eiTθn(λ),|ψ(λ)⟩=∑_nc_n(λ)|ψ_n(λ)^iTθ_n(λ), where θn(λ)=−1ℏ∫0λEn(λ′)dλ′.θ_n(λ)=-1/ħ∫_0^λE_n(λ')dλ'. The phase θn(t)θ_n(t) is called the dynamic phase factor. By substitution into the Schrödinger equation, another equation for the variation of the coefficients can be obtained: iℏ∑n(c˙n|ψn⟩+cn|ψ˙n⟩+icn|ψn⟩Tθ˙n)eiTθn=∑ncnTEn|ψn⟩eiTθn.ħ∑_n(ċ_n|ψ_n⟩+c_n|ψ̇_n⟩+ic_n|ψ_nθ̇_n)e^iTθ_n=∑_nc_nTE_n|ψ_n^iTθ_n. The term θ˙nθ̇_n gives −En/ℏ-E_n/ħ, and so the third term of left side cancels out with the right side, leaving ∑nc˙n|ψn⟩eiTθn=−∑ncn|ψ˙n⟩eiTθn.∑_nċ_n|ψ_n^iTθ_n=-∑_nc_n|ψ̇_n^iTθ_n. Now taking the inner product with an arbitrary eigenfunction ⟨ψm|⟨ψ_m|, the ⟨ψm|ψn⟩⟨ψ_m|ψ_n⟩ on the left gives δnmδ_nm, which is 1 only for m = n and otherwise vanishes. The remaining part gives c˙m=−∑ncn⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm).ċ_m=-∑_nc_n⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m). For T→∞→∞ the eiT(θn−θm)^iT(θ_n-θ_m) will oscillate faster and faster and intuitively will eventually suppress nearly all terms on the right side. The only exceptions are when θn−θmθ_n-θ_m has a critical point, i.e. En(λ)=Em(λ)_n(λ)=E_m(λ). This is trivially true for m=n=n. Since the adiabatic theorem assumes a gap between the eigenenergies at any time this cannot hold for m≠n. Therefore, only the m=n=n term will remain in the limit T→∞→∞. In order to show this more rigorously we first need to remove the m=n=n term. This can be done by defining dm(λ)=cm(λ)e∫0λ⟨ψm|ψ˙m⟩dλ=cm(λ)e−iγm(λ)._m(λ)=c_m(λ)e^∫_0^λ⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_mλ=c_m(λ)e^-iγ_m(λ). We obtain: d˙m=−∑n≠mdn⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm)−i(γm−γn).ḋ_m=-∑_nd_n⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m)-i(γ_m-γ_n). This equation can be integrated: dm(1)−dm(0)=−∫01∑n≠mdn⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm)−i(γm−γn)dλ=−∫01∑n≠m(dn−dn(0))⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm)−i(γm−γn)dλ−∫01∑n≠mdn(0)⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm)−i(γm−γn)dλd_m(1)-d_m(0) =-∫_0^1∑_nd_n⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m)-i(γ_m-γ_n)dλ =-∫_0^1∑_n(d_n-d_n(0))⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m)-i(γ_m-γ_n)dλ-∫_0^1∑_nd_n(0)⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m)-i(γ_m-γ_n)dλ or written in vector notation d→(1)−d→(0)=−∫01A^(T,λ)(d→(λ)−d→(0))dλ−α→(T).d⃗(1)-d⃗(0)=-∫_0^1Â(T,λ)(d⃗(λ)-d⃗(0))dλ-α⃗(T). Here A^(T,λ)Â(T,λ) is a matrix and αm(T)=∫01∑n≠mdn(0)⟨ψm|ψ˙n⟩eiT(θn−θm)−i(γm−γn)dλα_m(T)=∫_0^1∑_nd_n(0)⟨ψ_m|ψ̇_n^iT(θ_n-θ_m)-i(γ_m-γ_n)dλ is basically a Fourier transform. It follows from the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma that α→(T)→0α⃗(T)→0 as T→∞→∞. As last step take the norm on both sides of the above equation: ‖d→(1)−d→(0)‖≤‖α→(T)‖+∫01‖A^(T,λ)‖‖d→(λ)−d→(0)‖dλ‖d⃗(1)-d⃗(0)‖≤‖α⃗(T)‖+∫_0^1‖Â(T,λ)‖‖d⃗(λ)-d⃗(0)λ and apply Grönwall's inequality to obtain ‖d→(1)−d→(0)‖≤‖α→(T)‖e∫01‖A^(T,λ)‖dλ.‖d⃗(1)-d⃗(0)‖≤‖α⃗(T)^∫_0^1‖Â(T,λ)λ. Since α→(T)→0α⃗(T)→0 it follows ‖d→(1)−d→(0)‖→0‖d⃗(1)-d⃗(0)‖→0 for T→∞→∞. This concludes the proof of the adiabatic theorem. In the adiabatic limit the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian evolve independently of each other. If the system is prepared in an eigenstate |ψ(0)⟩=|ψn(0)⟩|ψ(0)⟩=|ψ_n(0)⟩ its time evolution is given by: |ψ(λ)⟩=|ψn(λ)⟩eiTθn(λ)eiγn(λ).|ψ(λ)⟩=|ψ_n(λ)^iTθ_n(λ)e^iγ_n(λ). So, for an adiabatic process, a system starting from nth eigenstate also remains in that nth eigenstate like it does for the time-independent processes, only picking up a couple of phase factors. The new phase factor γn(t)γ_n(t) can be canceled out by an appropriate choice of gauge for the eigenfunctions. However, if the adiabatic evolution is cyclic, then γn(t)γ_n(t) becomes a gauge-invariant physical quantity, known as the Berry phase. Generic proof in parameter space Let's start from a parametric Hamiltonian H(R→(t))(R⃗(t)), where the parameters are slowly varying in time, the definition of slow here is defined essentially by the distance in energy by the eigenstates (through the uncertainty principle, we can define a timescale that shall be always much lower than the time scale considered). This way we clearly also identify that while slowly varying the eigenstates remains clearly separated in energy (e.g. also when we generalize this to the case of bands as in the TKNN formula the bands shall remain clearly separated). Given they do not intersect the states are ordered and in this sense this is also one of the meanings of the name topological order. We do have the instantaneous Schrödinger equation: H(R→(t))|ψm(t)⟩=Em(t)|ψm(t)⟩(R⃗(t))|ψ_m(t)⟩=E_m(t)|ψ_m(t)⟩ And instantaneous eigenstates: ⟨ψm(t)|ψn(t)⟩=δmn⟨ψ_m(t)|ψ_n(t)⟩=δ_mn The generic solution: Ψ(t)=∑an(t)|ψn(t)⟩Ψ(t)=_n(t)|ψ_n(t)⟩ plugging in the full Schrödinger equation and multiplying by a generic eigenvector: ⟨ψm(t)|iℏ∂t|Ψ(t)⟩=⟨ψm(t)|H(R→(t))|Ψ(t)⟩⟨ψ_m(t)|iħ∂_t|Ψ(t)⟩=⟨ψ_m(t)|H(R⃗(t))|Ψ(t)⟩ a˙m+∑n⟨ψm(t)|∂R→|ψn(t)⟩R→˙an=−iℏEm(t)amȧ_m+∑_n⟨ψ_m(t)|∂_R⃗|ψ_n(t)⟩Ṙ⃗̇a_n=-i/ħE_m(t)a_m And if we introduce the adiabatic approximation: |⟨ψm(t)|∂R→|ψn(t)⟩R→˙an|≪|am||⟨ψ_m(t)|∂_R⃗|ψ_n(t)⟩Ṙ⃗̇a_n|≪|a_m| for each m≠n We have a˙m=−⟨ψm(t)|∂R→|ψm(t)⟩R→˙am−iℏEm(t)amȧ_m=-⟨ψ_m(t)|∂_R⃗|ψ_m(t)⟩Ṙ⃗̇a_m-i/ħE_m(t)a_m and am(t)=e−iℏ∫t0tEm(t′)dt′eiγm(t)am(t0)_m(t)=e^-i/ħ∫_t_0^tE_m(t')dt'e^iγ_m(t)a_m(t_0) where γm(t)=i∫t0t⟨ψm(t)|∂R→|ψm(t)⟩R→˙dt′=i∫C⟨ψm(R→)|∂R→|ψm(R→)⟩dR→γ_m(t)=i∫_t_0^t⟨ψ_m(t)|∂_R⃗|ψ_m(t)⟩Ṙ⃗̇dt'=i∫_C⟨ψ_m(R⃗)|∂_R⃗|ψ_m(R⃗)R⃗ And C is the path in the parameter space, This is the same as the statement of the theorem but in terms of the coefficients of the total wave function and its initial state.[14] Now this is slightly more general than the other proofs given we consider a generic set of parameters, and we see that the Berry phase acts as a local geometric quantity in the parameter space. Finally integrals of local geometric quantities can give topological invariants as in the case of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.[15] In fact if the path C is closed then the Berry phase persists to Gauge transformation and becomes a physical quantity.
