statement: Under a slowly changing Hamiltonian H(t)(t) with instantaneous eigenstates |n(t)⟩|n(t)⟩ and corresponding energies En(t)_n(t), a quantum system evolves from the initial state |ψ(0)⟩=∑ncn(0)|n(0)⟩|ψ(0)⟩=∑_nc_n(0)|n(0)⟩ to the final state |ψ(t)⟩=∑ncn(t)|n(t)⟩,|ψ(t)⟩=∑_nc_n(t)|n(t)⟩, where the coefficients undergo the change of phase cn(t)=cn(0)eiθn(t)eiγn(t)_n(t)=c_n(0)e^iθ_n(t)e^iγ_n(t) with the dynamical phase θm(t)=−1ℏ∫0tEm(t′)dt′θ_m(t)=-1/ħ∫_0^tE_m(t')dt' and geometric phase γm(t)=i∫0t⟨m(t′)|m˙(t′)⟩dt′.γ_m(t)=i∫_0^t(t')|ṁ(t')'. In particular, |cn(t)|2=|cn(0)|2|c_n(t)|^2=|c_n(0)|^2, so if the system begins in an eigenstate of H(0)(0), it remains in an eigenstate of H(t)(t) during the evolution with a change of phase only.
