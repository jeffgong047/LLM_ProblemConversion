passage: In the limit τ→0τ→0 we have infinitely rapid, or diabatic passage: limτ→0U^(t1,t0)=1.lim_τ→0Û(t_1,t_0)=1. The functional form of the system remains unchanged: |⟨x|ψ(t1)⟩|2=|⟨x|ψ(t0)⟩|2.||ψ(t_1)⟩|^2=||ψ(t_0)⟩|^2. This is sometimes referred to as the sudden approximation. The validity of the approximation for a given process can be characterized by the probability that the state of the system remains unchanged: PD=1−ζ._D=1-ζ. Adiabatic
