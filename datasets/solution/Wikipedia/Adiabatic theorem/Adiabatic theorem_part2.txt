processes: Comparison Diabatic Adiabatic Rapidly changing conditions prevent the system from adapting its configuration during the process, hence the spatial probability density remains unchanged. Typically there is no eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian with the same functional form as the initial state. The system ends in a linear combination of states that sum to reproduce the initial probability density. Gradually changing conditions allow the system to adapt its configuration, hence the probability density is modified by the process. If the system starts in an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian, it will end in the corresponding eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian.[2] At some initial time t0_0 a quantum-mechanical system has an energy given by the Hamiltonian H^(t0)Ĥ(t_0); the system is in an eigenstate of H^(t0)Ĥ(t_0) labelled ψ(x,t0)ψ(x,t_0). Changing conditions modify the Hamiltonian in a continuous manner, resulting in a final Hamiltonian H^(t1)Ĥ(t_1) at some later time t1_1. The system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, to reach a final state ψ(x,t1)ψ(x,t_1). The adiabatic theorem states that the modification to the system depends critically on the time τ=t1−t0τ=t_1-t_0 during which the modification takes place. For a truly adiabatic process we require τ→∞τ→∞; in this case the final state ψ(x,t1)ψ(x,t_1) will be an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian H^(t1)Ĥ(t_1), with a modified configuration: |ψ(x,t1)|2≠|ψ(x,t0)|2.|ψ(x,t_1)|^2≠|ψ(x,t_0)|^2. The degree to which a given change approximates an adiabatic process depends on both the energy separation between ψ(x,t0)ψ(x,t_0) and adjacent states, and the ratio of the interval ττ to the characteristic time-scale of the evolution of ψ(x,t0)ψ(x,t_0) for a time-independent Hamiltonian, τint=2πℏ/E0τ_int=2πħ/E_0, where E0_0 is the energy of ψ(x,t0)ψ(x,t_0). Conversely, in the limit τ→0τ→0 we have infinitely rapid, or diabatic passage; the configuration of the state remains unchanged: |ψ(x,t1)|2=|ψ(x,t0)|2.|ψ(x,t_1)|^2=|ψ(x,t_0)|^2. The so-called "gap condition" included in Born and Fock's original definition given above refers to a requirement that the spectrum of H^Ĥ is discrete and nondegenerate, such that there is no ambiguity in the ordering of the states (one can easily establish which eigenstate of H^(t1)Ĥ(t_1) corresponds to ψ(t0)ψ(t_0)). In 1999 J. E. Avron and A. Elgart reformulated the adiabatic theorem to adapt it to situations without a gap.[3] Comparison with the adiabatic concept in
