applications: Often a solid crystal is modeled as a set of independent valence electrons moving in a mean perfectly periodic potential generated by a rigid lattice of ions. With the Adiabatic theorem we can also include instead the motion of the valence electrons across the crystal and the thermal motion of the ions as in the Bornâ€“Oppenheimer approximation.[16] This does explain many phenomena in the scope of: thermodynamics: Temperature dependence of specific heat, thermal expansion, melting transport phenomena: the temperature dependence of electric resistivity of conductors, the temperature dependence of electric conductivity in insulators, Some properties of low temperature superconductivity optics: optic absorption in the infrared for ionic crystals, Brillouin scattering, Raman scattering Deriving conditions for diabatic vs adiabatic
