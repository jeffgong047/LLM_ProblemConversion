1: The area bounded by the two functions: y=f(x),y≥0=f(x), ≥0 y=g(x),f(x)≥g(x)=g(x), (x)(x) and bounded by the two lines: x=a≥0=a≥0 and x=b≥a=b is given by: A=∫abdA=∫ab[f(x)−g(x)]dx=∫_a^bdA=∫_a^b[f(x)-g(x)] dx The x component of the centroid of this area is given by: x¯=1A∫abx[f(x)−g(x)]dxx̅=1/A ∫_a^bx [f(x)-g(x)] dx If this area is rotated about the y-axis, the volume generated can be calculated using the shell method. It is given by: V=2π∫abx[f(x)−g(x)]dx=2π∫_a^bx [f(x)-g(x)] dx Using the last two equations to eliminate the integral we have: V=2πx¯A=2πx̅A Proof
