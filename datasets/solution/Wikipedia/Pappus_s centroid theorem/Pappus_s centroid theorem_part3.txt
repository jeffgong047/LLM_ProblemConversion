Proof: A curve given by the positive function f(x)(x) is bounded by two points given by: a≥0≥0 and b≥a If dL is an infinitesimal line element tangent to the curve, the length of the curve is given by: L=∫abdL=∫abdx2+dy2=∫ab1+(dydx)2dx=∫_a^bdL=∫_a^b√(dx^2+dy^2)=∫_a^b√(1+(dy/dx)^2) dx The y component of the centroid of this curve is: y¯=1L∫abydL=1L∫aby1+(dydx)2dxy̅=1/L∫_a^by dL=1/L∫_a^by√(1+(dy/dx)^2) dx The area of the surface generated by rotating the curve around the x-axis is given by: A=2π∫abydL=2π∫aby1+(dydx)2dx=2π∫_a^by dL=2π∫_a^by√(1+(dy/dx)^2) dx Using the last two equations to eliminate the integral we have: A=2πy¯L=2πy̅L The second
