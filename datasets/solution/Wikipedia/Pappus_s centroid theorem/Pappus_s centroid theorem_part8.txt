n-dimensions: In general, one can generate an n dimensional solid by rotating an n−p-p dimensional solid F around a p dimensional sphere. This is called an n-solid of revolution of species p. Let the p-th centroid of F be defined by R=∬FxpdAA,=∬_Fx^p dA/A, Then Pappus' theorems generalize to:[7] Volume of n-solid of revolution of species p = (Volume of generating (n−p)(n-p)-solid) ×× (Surface area of p-sphere traced by the p-th centroid of the generating solid) and Surface area of n-solid of revolution of species p = (Surface area of generating (n−p)(n-p)-solid) ×× (Surface area of p-sphere traced by the p-th centroid of the generating solid) The original theorems are the case with n=3,p=1=3, p=1.
