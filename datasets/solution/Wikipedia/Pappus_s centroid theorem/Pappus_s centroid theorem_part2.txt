theorem: The first theorem states that the surface area A of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a plane curve C about an axis external to C and on the same plane is equal to the product of the arc length s of C and the distance d traveled by the geometric centroid of C: A=sd.=sd. For example, the surface area of the torus with minor radius r and major radius R is A=(2πr)(2πR)=4π2Rr.=(2)(2)=4π^2Rr.
