theorem: The second theorem states that the volume V of a solid of revolution generated by rotating a plane figure F about an external axis is equal to the product of the area A of F and the distance d traveled by the geometric centroid of F. (The centroid of F is usually different from the centroid of its boundary curve C.) That is: V=Ad.=Ad. For example, the volume of the torus with minor radius r and major radius R is V=(πr2)(2πR)=2π2Rr2.=(^2)(2)=2π^2Rr^2. This special case was derived by Johannes Kepler using infinitesimals.[c] Proof
