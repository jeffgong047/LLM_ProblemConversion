version: Diagram of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms where f is a homomorphism, N is a normal subgroup of G and e is the identity element of G. Given two groups G and H and a group homomorphism f : G → H, let N be a normal subgroup in G and φ the natural surjective homomorphism G → G/N (where G/N is the quotient group of G by N). If N is a subset of ker(f) then there exists a unique homomorphism h: G/N → H such that f = h∘φ. In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on G that map N to the identity element. The situation is described by the following commutative diagram: h is injective if and only if N = ker(f). Therefore, by setting N = ker(f) we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem. We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as "every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group".
