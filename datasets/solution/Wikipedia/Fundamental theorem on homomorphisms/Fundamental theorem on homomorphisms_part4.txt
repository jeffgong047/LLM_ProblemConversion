1: The operation that is preserved by ϕϕ is the group operation. If a,b∈im(ϕ),b∈im(ϕ), then there exist elements a′,b′∈G',b' such that ϕ(a′)=aϕ(a')=a and ϕ(b′)=bϕ(b')=b. For these a and b, we have ab=ϕ(a′)ϕ(b′)=ϕ(a′b′)∈im(ϕ)=ϕ(a')ϕ(b')=ϕ(a'b')∈im(ϕ) (since ϕϕ preserves the group operation), and thus, the closure property is satisfied in im(ϕ)im(ϕ). The identity element e∈H is also in im(ϕ)im(ϕ) because ϕϕ maps the identity element of G to it. Since every element a′' in G has an inverse (a′)−1(a')^-1such that ϕ((a′)−1)=(ϕ(a′))−1ϕ((a')^-1)=(ϕ(a'))^-1 (because ϕϕ preserves the inverse property as well), we have an inverse for each element ϕ(a′)=aϕ(a')=a in im(ϕ)im(ϕ), therefore, im(ϕ)im(ϕ) is a subgroup of H.
