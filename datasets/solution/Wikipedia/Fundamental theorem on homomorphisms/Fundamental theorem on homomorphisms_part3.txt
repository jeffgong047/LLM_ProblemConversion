Proof: The proof follows from two basic facts about homomorphisms, namely their preservation of the group operation, and their mapping of the identity element to the identity element. We need to show that if ϕ:G→Hϕ:G is a homomorphism of groups, then: im(ϕ)im(ϕ) is a subgroup of H.G/ker⁡(ϕ)/(ϕ) is isomorphic to im(ϕ)im(ϕ). Proof of
