lemma: Sobolev's original proof of the Sobolev embedding theorem relied on the following, sometimes known as the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev fractional integration theorem. An equivalent statement is known as the Sobolev lemma in (Aubin 1982, Chapter 2). A proof is in (Stein 1970, Chapter V, §1.3). Let 0 < α < n and 1 < p < q < ∞. Let Iα = (−Δ)−α/2 be the Riesz potential on Rn. Then, for q defined by 1q=1p−αn1/q=1/p-α/n there exists a constant C depending only on p such that ‖Iαf‖q≤C‖f‖p.I_αf_qf_p. If p = 1, then one has two possible replacement estimates. The first is the more classical weak-type estimate: mx:|Iαf(x)|>λ≤C(‖f‖1λ)q,{x:|I_αf(x)|>λ}(f_1/λ)^q, where 1/q = 1 − α/n. Alternatively one has the estimate‖Iαf‖q≤C‖Rf‖1,I_αf_qRf_1,where Rf is the vector-valued Riesz transform, c.f. (Schikorra, Spector & Van Schaftingen 2017). The boundedness of the Riesz transforms implies that the latter inequality gives a unified way to write the family of inequalities for the Riesz potential. The Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev lemma implies the Sobolev embedding essentially by the relationship between the Riesz transforms and the Riesz potentials. Morrey's
