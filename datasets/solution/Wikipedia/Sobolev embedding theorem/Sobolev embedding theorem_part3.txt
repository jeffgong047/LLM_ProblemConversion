Generalizations: Further information: Souček space The Sobolev embedding theorem holds for Sobolev spaces W k,p(M) on other suitable domains M. In particular (Aubin 1982, Chapter 2; Aubin 1976), both parts of the Sobolev embedding hold when M is a bounded open set in Rn with Lipschitz boundary (or whose boundary satisfies the cone condition; Adams 1975, Theorem 5.4) M is a compact Riemannian manifold M is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and the boundary is Lipschitz (meaning that the boundary can be locally represented as a graph of a Lipschitz continuous function). M is a complete Riemannian manifold with injectivity radius δ > 0 and bounded sectional curvature. If M is a bounded open set in Rn with continuous boundary, then W 1,2(M) is compactly embedded in L2(M) (Nečas 2012, Section 1.1.5, Theorem 1.4). Kondrachov embedding
