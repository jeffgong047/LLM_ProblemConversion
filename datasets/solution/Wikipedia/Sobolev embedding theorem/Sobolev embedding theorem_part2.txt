theorem: Graphical representation of the embedding conditions. The space W 3,p, represented by a blue dot at the point (1/p, 3), embeds into the spaces indicated by red dots, all lying on a line with slope n. The white circle at (0,0) indicates the impossibility of optimal embeddings into L ∞. Let W k,p(Rn) denote the Sobolev space consisting of all real-valued functions on Rn whose first k weak derivatives are functions in Lp. Here k is a non-negative integer and 1 ≤ p < ∞. The first part of the Sobolev embedding theorem states that if k > ℓ, p < n and 1 ≤ p < q < ∞ are two real numbers such that 1p−kn=1q−ℓn,1/p-k/n=1/q-ℓ/n, then Wk,p(Rn)⊆Wℓ,q(Rn)^k,p(𝐑^n)^ℓ,q(𝐑^n) and the embedding is continuous. In the special case of k = 1 and ℓ = 0, Sobolev embedding gives W1,p(Rn)⊆Lp∗(Rn)^1,p(𝐑^n)^p^*(𝐑^n) where p∗ is the Sobolev conjugate of p, given by 1p∗=1p−1n.1/p^*=1/p-1/n. This special case of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of the Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality. The result should be interpreted as saying that if a function f in Lp(Rn)^p(ℝ^n) has one derivative in Lp^p, then f itself has improved local behavior, meaning that it belongs to the space Lp∗^p^* where p∗>p^*>p. (Note that 1/p∗<1/p1/p^*<1/p, so that p∗>p^*>p.) Thus, any local singularities in f must be more mild than for a typical function in Lp^p. If the line from the picture above intersects the y-axis at s = r + α, the embedding into a Hölder space C r, α (red) holds. White circles indicate intersection points at which optimal embeddings are not valid. The second part of the Sobolev embedding theorem applies to embeddings in Hölder spaces C r,α(Rn). If n < pk and 1p−kn=−r+αn,or,equivalently,r+α=k−np1/p-k/n=-r+α/n,r+α=k-n/p with α ∈ (0, 1) then one has the embedding Wk,p(Rn)⊂Cr,α(Rn).^k,p(𝐑^n)^r,α(𝐑^n). This part of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of Morrey's inequality. Intuitively, this inclusion expresses the fact that the existence of sufficiently many weak derivatives implies some continuity of the classical derivatives. If α=1α=1 then Wk,p(Rn)⊂Cr,γ(Rn)^k,p(𝐑^n)^r,γ(𝐑^n) for every γ∈(0,1)γ∈(0,1). In particular, as long as pk>n>n, the embedding criterion will hold with r=0=0 and some positive value of αα. That is, for a function f on Rnℝ^n, if f has k derivatives in Lp^p and pk>n>n, then f will be continuous (and actually Hölder continuous with some positive exponent αα).
