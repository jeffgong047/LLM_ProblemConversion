inequality: The Nash inequality, introduced by John Nash (1958), states that there exists a constant C > 0, such that for all u ∈ L1(Rn) ∩ W 1,2(Rn), ‖u‖L2(Rn)1+2/n≤C‖u‖L1(Rn)2/n‖Du‖L2(Rn).u_L^2(𝐑^n)^1+2/nu_L^1(𝐑^n)^2/nDu_L^2(𝐑^n). The inequality follows from basic properties of the Fourier transform. Indeed, integrating over the complement of the ball of radius ρ, ∫|x|≥ρ|u^(x)|2dx≤∫|x|≥ρ|x|2ρ2|u^(x)|2dx≤ρ−2∫Rn|Du|2dx∫_|x|≥ρ|û(x)|^2 dx≤∫_|x|≥ρ|x|^2/ρ^2|û(x)|^2 dx≤ρ^-2∫_𝐑^n|Du|^2 dx (1) because 1≤|x|2/ρ21≤|x|^2/ρ^2. On the other hand, one has |u^|≤‖u‖L1|û|≤u_L^1 which, when integrated over the ball of radius ρ gives ∫|x|≤ρ|u^(x)|2dx≤ρnωn‖u‖L12∫_|x|≤ρ|û(x)|^2 dx≤ρ^nω_nu_L^1^2 (2) where ωn is the volume of the n-ball. Choosing ρ to minimize the sum of (1) and (2) and applying Parseval's theorem: ‖u^‖L2=‖u‖L2û_L^2=u_L^2 gives the inequality. In the special case of n = 1, the Nash inequality can be extended to the Lp case, in which case it is a generalization of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality (Brezis 2011, Comments on Chapter 8). In fact, if I is a bounded interval, then for all 1 ≤ r < ∞ and all 1 ≤ q ≤ p < ∞ the following inequality holds ‖u‖Lp(I)≤C‖u‖Lq(I)1−a‖u‖W1,r(I)a,u_L^p(I)u_L^q(I)^1-au_W^1,r(I)^a, where: a(1q−1r+1)=1q−1p.(1/q-1/r+1)=1/q-1/p.
