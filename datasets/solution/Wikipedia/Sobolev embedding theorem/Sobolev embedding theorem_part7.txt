inequality: Assume n < p ≤ ∞. Then there exists a constant C, depending only on p and n, such that ‖u‖C0,γ(Rn)≤C‖u‖W1,p(Rn)u_C^0,γ(𝐑^n)u_W^1,p(𝐑^n) for all u ∈ C1(Rn) ∩ Lp(Rn), where γ=1−np.γ=1-n/p. Thus if u ∈ W 1,p(Rn), then u is in fact Hölder continuous of exponent γ, after possibly being redefined on a set of measure 0. A similar result holds in a bounded domain U with Lipschitz boundary. In this case, ‖u‖C0,γ(U)≤C‖u‖W1,p(U)u_C^0,γ(U)u_W^1,p(U) where the constant C depends now on n, p and U. This version of the inequality follows from the previous one by applying the norm-preserving extension of W 1,p(U) to W 1,p(Rn). The inequality is named after Charles B. Morrey Jr. General Sobolev
