inequality: Assume that u is a continuously differentiable real-valued function on Rn with compact support. Then for 1 ≤ p < n there is a constant C depending only on n and p such that ‖u‖Lp∗(Rn)≤C‖Du‖Lp(Rn).u_L^p^*(𝐑^n)Du_L^p(𝐑^n). with 1/p* = 1/p - 1/n. The case 1<p<n1<p<n is due to Sobolev, p=1=1 to Gagliardo and Nirenberg independently. The Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality implies directly the Sobolev embedding W1,p(Rn)⊂Lp∗(Rn).^1,p(𝐑^n)^p^*(𝐑^n). The embeddings in other orders on Rn are then obtained by suitable iteration.
