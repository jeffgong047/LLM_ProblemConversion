n/p: Here, we conclude that u belongs to a Hölder space, more precisely: u∈Ck−[np]−1,γ(U),^k-[n/p]-1,γ(U), where γ=[np]+1−npnp∉Zanyelementin(0,1)np∈Zγ=[n/p]+1-n/p n/p∉𝐙 anyelementin(0,1) n/p∈𝐙 We have in addition the estimate ‖u‖Ck−[np]−1,γ(U)≤C‖u‖Wk,p(U),u_C^k-[n/p]-1,γ(U)u_W^k,p(U), the constant C depending only on k, p, n, γ, and U. In particular, the condition k>n/p>n/p guarantees that u is continuous (and actually Hölder continuous with some positive exponent). Case p=n,
