inequality: Main article: Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities The simplest of the Sobolev embedding theorems, described above, states that if a function f in Lp(Rn)^p(ℝ^n) has one derivative in Lp^p, then f itself is in Lp∗^p^*, where 1/p∗=1/p−1/n.1/p^*=1/p-1/n. We can see that as n tends to infinity, p∗^* approaches p. Thus, if the dimension n of the space on which f is defined is large, the improvement in the local behavior of f from having a derivative in Lp^p is small (p∗^* is only slightly larger than p). In particular, for functions on an infinite-dimensional space, we cannot expect any direct analog of the classical Sobolev embedding theorems. There is, however, a type of Sobolev inequality, established by Leonard Gross (Gross 1975) and known as a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, that has dimension-independent constants and therefore continues to hold in the infinite-dimensional setting. The logarithmic Sobolev inequality says, roughly, that if a function is in Lp^p with respect to a Gaussian measure and has one derivative that is also in Lp^p, then f is in "Lp^p-log", meaning that the integral of |f|plog⁡|f||f|^plog|f| is finite. The inequality expressing this fact has constants that do not involve the dimension of the space and, thus, the inequality holds in the setting of a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional space. It is now known that logarithmic Sobolev inequalities hold for many different types of measures, not just Gaussian measures. Although it might seem as if the Lp^p-log condition is a very small improvement over being in Lp^p, this improvement is sufficient to derive an important result, namely hypercontractivity for the associated Dirichlet form operator. This result means that if a function is in the range of the exponential of the Dirichlet form operator—which means that the function has, in some sense, infinitely many derivatives in Lp^p—then the function does belong to Lp∗^p^* for some p∗>p^*>p (Gross 1975 Theorem 6).
