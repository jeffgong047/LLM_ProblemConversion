theorem: Main article: Rellich–Kondrachov theorem On a compact manifold M with C1 boundary, the Kondrachov embedding theorem states that if k > ℓ and1p−kn<1q−ℓn1/p-k/n<1/q-ℓ/nthen the Sobolev embedding Wk,p(M)⊂Wℓ,q(M)^k,p(M)^ℓ,q(M) is completely continuous (compact).[1] Note that the condition is just as in the first part of the Sobolev embedding theorem, with the equality replaced by an inequality, thus requiring a more regular space W k,p(M).
