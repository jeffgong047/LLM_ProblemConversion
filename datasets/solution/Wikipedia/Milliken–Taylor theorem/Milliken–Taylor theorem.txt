In mathematics, the Milliken–Taylor theorem in combinatorics is a generalization of both Ramsey's theorem and Hindman's theorem. It is named after Keith Milliken and Alan D. Taylor.
Let Pf(N)𝒫_f(ℕ) denote the set of finite subsets of Nℕ, and define a partial order on Pf(N)𝒫_f(ℕ) by α<β if and only if max α<min β. Given a sequence of integers ⟨an⟩n=0∞⊂N_n⟩_n=0^∞⊂ℕ and k > 0, let 

[FS(⟨an⟩n=0∞)]<k=∑t∈α1at,…,∑t∈αkat:α1,⋯,αk∈Pf(N)andα1<⋯<αk.[FS(_n⟩_n=0^∞)]_<^k={{∑_t∈α_1a_t,…,∑_t∈α_ka_t}:α_1,⋯,α_k∈𝒫_f(ℕ)andα_1<⋯<α_k}.
Let [S]k[S]^k denote the k-element subsets of a set S. The Milliken–Taylor theorem says that for any finite partition [N]k=C1∪C2∪⋯∪Cr[ℕ]^k=C_1_2∪⋯_r, there exist some i ≤ r and a sequence ⟨an⟩n=0∞⊂N_n⟩_n=0^∞⊂ℕ such that [FS(⟨an⟩n=0∞)]<k⊂Ci[FS(_n⟩_n=0^∞)]_<^k_i.
For each ⟨an⟩n=0∞⊂N_n⟩_n=0^∞⊂ℕ, call [FS(⟨an⟩n=0∞)]<k[FS(_n⟩_n=0^∞)]_<^k an MTk set. Then, alternatively, the Milliken–Taylor theorem asserts that the collection of MTk sets is partition regular for each k.
