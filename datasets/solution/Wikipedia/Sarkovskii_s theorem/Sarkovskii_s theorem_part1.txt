Mathematical rule In mathematics, Sharkovskii's theorem (also spelled Sharkovsky's theorem, Sharkovskiy's theorem, Å arkovskii's theorem or Sarkovskii's theorem), named after Oleksandr Mykolayovych Sharkovsky, who published it in 1964, is a result about discrete dynamical systems.[1] One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.
