Statement: For a compact Hausdorff space X, let C(X) denote the Banach space of continuous real- or complex-valued functions on X, equipped with the supremum norm ‖·‖∞. Given compact Hausdorff spaces X and Y, suppose T : C(X) → C(Y) is a surjective linear isometry. Then there exists a homeomorphism φ : Y → X and a function g ∈ C(Y) with |g(y)|=1forally∈Y|g(y)|=1y such that (Tf)(y)=g(y)f(φ(y))forally∈Y,f∈C(X).(Tf)(y)=g(y)f(φ(y))y,f(X). The case where X and Y are compact metric spaces is due to Banach,[1] while the extension to compact Hausdorff spaces is due to Stone.[2] In fact, they both prove a slight generalization—they do not assume that T is linear, only that it is an isometry in the sense of metric spaces, and use the Mazur–Ulam theorem to show that T is affine, and so T−T(0)-T(0) is a linear isometry.
