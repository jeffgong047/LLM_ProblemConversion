Applications: Let λ∈R∖0λ∈ℝ∖{0}. The identity can be used to show the somewhat more general statement that det(AB−λIm)=(−λ)m−ndet(BA−λIn).(AB-_m)=(-λ)^m-n(BA-_n). It follows that the non-zero eigenvalues of AB and BA are the same. This identity is useful in developing a Bayes estimator for multivariate Gaussian distributions. The identity also finds applications in random matrix theory by relating determinants of large matrices to determinants of smaller ones.[2]
