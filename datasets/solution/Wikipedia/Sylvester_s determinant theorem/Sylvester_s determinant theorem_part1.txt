"Sylvester's determinant theorem" redirects here. Not to be confused with Sylvester's determinant identity.For two suitable matrices, A and B, I+AB and I+BA have the same determinate In mathematics, the Weinstein–Aronszajn identity states that if A and B are matrices of size m × n and n × m respectively (either or both of which may be infinite) then, provided AB (and hence, also BA) is of trace class, det(Im+AB)=det(In+BA),(I_m+AB)=(I_n+BA), where Ik_k is the k × k identity matrix. It is closely related to the matrix determinant lemma and its generalization. It is the determinant analogue of the Woodbury matrix identity for matrix inverses.
