"Sylvester's determinant theorem" redirects here. Not to be confused with Sylvester's determinant identity.For two suitable matrices, A and B, I+AB and I+BA have the same determinate
In mathematics, the Weinstein–Aronszajn identity  states that if A and B are matrices of size m × n and n × m respectively (either or both of which may be infinite) then,
provided AB (and hence, also BA) is of trace class,

det(Im+AB)=det(In+BA),(I_m+AB)=(I_n+BA),
where Ik_k is the k × k identity matrix.
It is closely related to the matrix determinant lemma and its generalization. It is the determinant analogue of the Woodbury matrix identity for matrix inverses.

Proof[edit]
The identity may be proved as follows.[1] 
Let M be a matrix consisting of the four blocks Im_m, A, B and In_n:

M=(ImABIn).=[ I_m   A;   B I_n ].
Because Im is invertible, the formula for the determinant of a block matrix gives

det(ImABIn)=det(Im)det(In−BIm−1A)=det(In−BA).[ I_m   A;   B I_n ]=(I_m)(I_n-BI_m^-1A)=(I_n-BA).
Because In is invertible, the formula for the determinant of a block matrix gives

det(ImABIn)=det(In)det(Im−AIn−1B)=det(Im−AB).[ I_m   A;   B I_n ]=(I_n)(I_m-AI_n^-1B)=(I_m-AB).
Thus

det(In−BA)=det(Im−AB).(I_n-BA)=(I_m-AB).
Substituting −A-A for A then gives the Weinstein–Aronszajn identity.

Applications[edit]
Let λ∈R∖0λ∈ℝ∖{0}. The identity can be used to show the somewhat more general statement that

det(AB−λIm)=(−λ)m−ndet(BA−λIn).(AB-_m)=(-λ)^m-n(BA-_n).
It follows that the non-zero eigenvalues of AB and BA are the same.
This identity is useful in developing a Bayes estimator for multivariate Gaussian distributions.
The identity also finds applications in random matrix theory by relating determinants of large matrices to determinants of smaller ones.[2]
