Prerequisites: The 1895 proof by Cantor relied, in effect, on the axiom of choice by inferring the result as a corollary of the well-ordering theorem.[8][9] However, K√∂nig's proof given above shows that the result can also be proved without using the axiom of choice. On the other hand, K√∂nig's proof uses the principle of excluded middle to draw a conclusion through case analysis. As such, the above proof is not a constructive one. In fact, in a constructive set theory such as intuitionistic set theory IZFùñ®ùñπùñ•, which adopts the full axiom of separation but dispenses with the principle of excluded middle, assuming the Schr√∂der‚ÄìBernstein theorem implies the latter.[19] In turn, there is no proof of K√∂nig's conclusion in this or weaker constructive theories. Therefore, intuitionists do not accept the statement of the Schr√∂der‚ÄìBernstein theorem.[20] There is also a proof which uses Tarski's fixed point theorem.[21] See
