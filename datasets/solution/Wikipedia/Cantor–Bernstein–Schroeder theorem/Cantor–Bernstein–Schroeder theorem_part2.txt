Proof: König's definition of a bijection h:A → B from given example injections f:A → B and g:B → A. An element in A and B is denoted by a number and a letter, respectively. The sequence 3 → e → 6 → ... is an A-stopper, leading to the definitions h(3) = f(3) = e, h(6) = f(6), .... The sequence d → 5 → f → ... is a B-stopper, leading to h(5) = g−1(5) = d, .... The sequence ... → a → 1 → c → 4 → ... is doubly infinite, leading to h(1) = g−1(1) = a, h(4) = g−1(4) = c, .... The sequence b → 2 → b is cyclic, leading to h(2) = g−1(2) = b. The following proof is attributed to Julius König.[1] Assume without loss of generality that A and B are disjoint. For any a in A or b in B we can form a unique two-sided sequence of elements that are alternately in A and B, by repeatedly applying f and g−1^-1 to go from A to B and g and f−1^-1 to go from B to A (where defined; the inverses f−1^-1 and g−1^-1 are understood as partial functions.) ⋯→f−1(g−1(a))→g−1(a)→a→f(a)→g(f(a))→⋯⋯^-1(g^-1(a))^-1(a)(a)(f(a))→⋯ For any particular a, this sequence may terminate to the left or not, at a point where f−1^-1 or g−1^-1 is not defined. By the fact that f and g are injective functions, each a in A and b in B is in exactly one such sequence to within identity: if an element occurs in two sequences, all elements to the left and to the right must be the same in both, by the definition of the sequences. Therefore, the sequences form a partition of the (disjoint) union of A and B. Hence it suffices to produce a bijection between the elements of A and B in each of the sequences separately, as follows: Call a sequence an A-stopper if it stops at an element of A, or a B-stopper if it stops at an element of B. Otherwise, call it doubly infinite if all the elements are distinct or cyclic if it repeats. See the picture for examples. For an A-stopper, the function f is a bijection between its elements in A and its elements in B. For a B-stopper, the function g is a bijection between its elements in B and its elements in A. For a doubly infinite sequence or a cyclic sequence, either f or g will do (g is used in the picture).
