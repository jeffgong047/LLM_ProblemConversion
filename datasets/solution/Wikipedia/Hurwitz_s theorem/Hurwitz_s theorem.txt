Theorem in number theory that gives a bound on a Diophantine approximation
This article is about a theorem in number theory. For other uses, see Hurwitz's theorem.
In number theory, Hurwitz's theorem, named after Adolf Hurwitz, gives a bound on a Diophantine approximation. The theorem states that for every irrational number ξ there are infinitely many relatively prime integers m, n such that
|ξ−mn|<15n2.|ξ-m/n|<1/√(5) n^2.
The condition that ξ is irrational cannot be omitted. Moreover the constant 5√(5) is the best possible; if we replace 5√(5) by any number A>5>√(5) and we let ξ=(1+5)/2ξ=(1+√(5))/2 (the golden ratio) then there exist only finitely many relatively prime integers m, n such that the formula above holds.
The theorem is equivalent to the claim that the Markov constant of every number is larger than 5√(5).
