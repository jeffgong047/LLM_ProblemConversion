Examples: The hyperreal numbers are the ultraproduct of one copy of the real numbers for every natural number, with regard to an ultrafilter over the natural numbers containing all cofinite sets. Their order is the extension of the order of the real numbers. For example, the sequence ωω given by ωi=iω_i=i defines an equivalence class representing a hyperreal number that is greater than any real number. Analogously, one can define nonstandard integers, nonstandard complex numbers, etc., by taking the ultraproduct of copies of the corresponding structures. As an example of the carrying over of relations into the ultraproduct, consider the sequence ψψ defined by ψi=2i.ψ_i=2i. Because ψi>ωi=iψ_i>ω_i=i for all i,, it follows that the equivalence class of ψi=2iψ_i=2i is greater than the equivalence class of ωi=i,ω_i=i, so that it can be interpreted as an infinite number which is greater than the one originally constructed. However, let χi=iχ_i=i for i not equal to 7,7, but χ7=8.χ_7=8. The set of indices on which ωω and χχ agree is a member of any ultrafilter (because ωω and χχ agree almost everywhere), so ωω and χχ belong to the same equivalence class. In the theory of large cardinals, a standard construction is to take the ultraproduct of the whole set-theoretic universe with respect to some carefully chosen ultrafilter U.𝒰. Properties of this ultrafilter U𝒰 have a strong influence on (higher order) properties of the ultraproduct; for example, if U𝒰 is σσ-complete, then the ultraproduct will again be well-founded. (See measurable cardinal for the prototypical example.) Łoś's
