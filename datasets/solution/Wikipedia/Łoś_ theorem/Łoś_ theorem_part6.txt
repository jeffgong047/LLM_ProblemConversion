Examples: Let R be a unary relation in the structure M,, and form the ultrapower of M.. Then the set S=x∈M:Rx={x:Rx} has an analog ∗S^*S in the ultrapower, and first-order formulas involving S are also valid for ∗S.^*S. For example, let M be the reals, and let Rx hold if x is a rational number. Then in M we can say that for any pair of rationals x and y,, there exists another number z such that z is not rational, and x<z<y.<z<y. Since this can be translated into a first-order logical formula in the relevant formal language, Łoś's theorem implies that ∗S^*S has the same property. That is, we can define a notion of the hyperrational numbers, which are a subset of the hyperreals, and they have the same first-order properties as the rationals. Consider, however, the Archimedean property of the reals, which states that there is no real number x such that x>1,x>1+1,x>1+1+1,…>1, x>1+1, x>1+1+1,… for every inequality in the infinite list. Łoś's theorem does not apply to the Archimedean property, because the Archimedean property cannot be stated in first-order logic. In fact, the Archimedean property is false for the hyperreals, as shown by the construction of the hyperreal number ωω above. Direct limits of ultrapowers
