theorem: Łoś's theorem, also called the fundamental theorem of ultraproducts, is due to Jerzy Łoś (the surname is pronounced [ˈwɔɕ], approximately "wash"). It states that any first-order formula is true in the ultraproduct if and only if the set of indices i such that the formula is true in Mi_i is a member of U.𝒰. More precisely: Let σσ be a signature, U𝒰 an ultrafilter over a set I,, and for each i∈I let Mi_i be a σσ-structure. Let ∏UM∙∏_𝒰 M_∙ or ∏i∈IMi/U∏_iM_i/𝒰 be the ultraproduct of the Mi_i with respect to U.𝒰. Then, for each a1,…,an∈∏i∈IMi,^1,…,a^n∈∏_iM_i, where ak=(aik)i∈I,^k=(a_i^k)_i, and for every σσ-formula ϕ,ϕ, ∏UM∙⊨ϕ[aU1,…,aUn]⟺i∈I:Mi⊨ϕ[ai1,…,ain]∈U.∏_𝒰 M_∙ϕ[a_𝒰^1,…,a_𝒰^n] {i:M_iϕ[a_i^1,…,a_i^n]}∈𝒰. The theorem is proved by induction on the complexity of the formula ϕ.ϕ. The fact that U𝒰 is an ultrafilter (and not just a filter) is used in the negation clause, and the axiom of choice is needed at the existential quantifier step. As an application, one obtains the transfer theorem for hyperreal fields.
