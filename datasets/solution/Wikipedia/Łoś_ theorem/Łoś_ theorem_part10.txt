Proofs ^ Although U𝒰 is assumed to be an ultrafilter over I,, this proof only requires that U𝒰 be a filter on I.. Throughout, let a∙=(ai)i∈I,b∙=(bi)i∈I,_∙=(a_i)_i,b_∙=(b_i)_i, and c∙=(ci)i∈I_∙=(c_i)_i be elements of ∏i∈IMi.∏_iM_i. The relation a∙∼a∙_∙ ∼ a_∙ always holds since i∈I:ai=ai=I{i:a_i=a_i}=I is an element of filter U.𝒰. Thus the reflexivity of ∼ ∼ follows from that of equality =. =. Similarly, ∼ ∼ is symmetric since equality is symmetric. For transitivity, assume that R=i:ai:=bi={i:a_i:=b_i} and S:=i:bi=ci:={i:b_i=c_i} are elements of U;𝒰; it remains to show that T:=i:ai=ci:={i:a_i=c_i} also belongs to U.𝒰. The transitivity of equality guarantees R∩S⊆T (since if i∈R∩S then ai=bi_i=b_i and bi=ci_i=c_i). Because U𝒰 is closed under binary intersections, R∩S∈U.∈𝒰. Since U𝒰 is upward closed in I,, it contains every superset of R∩S (that consists of indices); in particular, U𝒰 contains T.. ◼▪
