Ultrapower: An ultrapower is an ultraproduct for which all the factors Mi_i are equal. Explicitly, the ultrapower of a set M modulo U𝒰 is the ultraproduct ∏i∈IMi/U=∏UM∙∏_iM_i / 𝒰=∏_𝒰 M_∙ of the indexed family M∙:=(Mi)i∈I_∙:=(M_i)_i defined by Mi:=M_i:=M for every index i∈I.. The ultrapower may be denoted by ∏UM∏_𝒰 M or (since ∏i∈IM∏_iM is often denoted by MI^I) by MI/U:=∏i∈IM/U^I/𝒰 := ∏_iM / 𝒰 For every m∈M,, let (m)i∈I(m)_i denote the constant map I→M that is identically equal to m.. This constant map/tuple is an element of the Cartesian product MI=∏i∈IM^I=∏_iM and so the assignment m↦(m)i∈I↦(m)_i defines a map M→∏i∈IM.→∏_iM. The natural embedding of M into ∏UM∏_𝒰 M is the map M→∏UM→∏_𝒰 M that sends an element m∈M to the U𝒰-equivalence class of the constant tuple (m)i∈I.(m)_i.
