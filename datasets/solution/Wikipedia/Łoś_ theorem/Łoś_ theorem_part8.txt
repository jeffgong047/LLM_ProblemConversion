monad: The ultrafilter monad is the codensity monad of the inclusion of the category of finite sets into the category of all sets.[1] Similarly, the ultraproduct monad is the codensity monad of the inclusion of the category FinFam𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐅𝐚𝐦 of finitely-indexed families of sets into the category Fam𝐅𝐚𝐦 of all indexed families of sets. So in this sense, ultraproducts are categorically inevitable.[1] Explicitly, an object of Fam𝐅𝐚𝐦 consists of a non-empty index set I and an indexed family (Mi)i∈I(M_i)_i of sets. A morphism (Ni)j∈J→(Mi)i∈I(N_i)_j→(M_i)_i between two objects consists of a function ϕ:I→Jϕ:I between the index sets and a J-indexed family (ϕj)j∈J(ϕ_j)_j of function ϕj:Mϕ(j)→Nj.ϕ_j:M_ϕ(j)_j. The category FinFam𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐅𝐚𝐦 is a full subcategory of this category of Fam𝐅𝐚𝐦 consisting of all objects (Mi)i∈I(M_i)_i whose index set I is finite. The codensity monad of the inclusion map FinFam↪Fam𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐅𝐚𝐦↪𝐅𝐚𝐦 is then, in essence, given by (Mi)i∈I↦(∏i∈IMi/U)U∈U(I).(M_i)_i ↦ (∏_iM_i / 𝒰)_𝒰(I) . See
