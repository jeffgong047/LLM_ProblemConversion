(ultralimits): For the ultraproduct of a sequence of metric spaces, see Ultralimit. In model theory and set theory, the direct limit of a sequence of ultrapowers is often considered. In model theory, this construction can be referred to as an ultralimit or limiting ultrapower. Beginning with a structure, A0_0 and an ultrafilter, D0,𝒟_0, form an ultrapower, A1._1. Then repeat the process to form A2,_2, and so forth. For each n there is a canonical diagonal embedding An→An+1._n_n+1. At limit stages, such as Aω,_ω, form the direct limit of earlier stages. One may continue into the transfinite. Ultraproduct
