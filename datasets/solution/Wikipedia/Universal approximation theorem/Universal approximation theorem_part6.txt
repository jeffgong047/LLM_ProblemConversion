input: Achieving useful universal function approximation on graphs (or rather on graph isomorphism classes) has been a longstanding problem. The popular graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs or GNNs) can be made as discriminative as the Weisfeiler–Leman graph isomorphism test.[42] In 2020,[43] a universal approximation theorem result was established by Brüel-Gabrielsson, showing that graph representation with certain injective properties is sufficient for universal function approximation on bounded graphs and restricted universal function approximation on unbounded graphs, with an accompanying O((#edges××#nodes))-runtime method that performed at state of the art on a collection of benchmarks.
