In abstract algebra, the focal subgroup theorem describes the fusion of elements in a Sylow subgroup of a finite group. The focal subgroup theorem was introduced in (Higman 1953) and is the "first major application of the transfer" according to (Gorenstein, Lyons & Solomon 1996, p. 90). The focal subgroup theorem relates the ideas of transfer and fusion such as described in (Gr√ºn 1936). Various applications of these ideas include local criteria for p-nilpotence and various non-simplicity criteria focussing on showing that a finite group has a normal subgroup of index p.
