Subgroups: The following three normal subgroups of index a power of p are naturally defined, and arise as the smallest normal subgroups such that the quotient is (a certain kind of) p-group. Formally, they are kernels of the reflection onto the reflective subcategory of p-groups (respectively, elementary abelian p-groups, abelian p-groups). Ep(G) is the intersection of all index p normal subgroups; G/Ep(G) is an elementary abelian group, and is the largest elementary abelian p-group onto which G surjects. Ap(G) (notation from (Isaacs 2008, 5D, p. 164)) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K such that G/K is an abelian p-group (i.e., K is an index pk^k normal subgroup that contains the derived group [G,G][G,G]): G/Ap(G) is the largest abelian p-group (not necessarily elementary) onto which G surjects. Op(G) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K of G such that G/K is a (possibly non-abelian) p-group (i.e., K is an index pk^k normal subgroup): G/Op(G) is the largest p-group (not necessarily abelian) onto which G surjects. Op(G) is also known as the p-residual subgroup. Firstly, as these are weaker conditions on the groups K, one obtains the containments Ep(G)⊇Ap(G)⊇Op(G).𝐄^p(G)⊇𝐀^p(G)⊇𝐎^p(G). These are further related as: Ap(G) = Op(G)[G,G]. Op(G) has the following alternative characterization as the subgroup generated by all Sylow q-subgroups of G as q≠p ranges over the prime divisors of the order of G distinct from p. Op(G) is used to define the lower p-series of G, similarly to the upper p-series described in p-core. Transfer
