characterizations: Various mathematicians have presented methods to calculate the focal subgroup from smaller groups. For instance, the influential work (Alperin 1967) develops the idea of a local control of fusion, and as an example application shows that: P ∩ Ap(G) is generated by the commutator subgroups [Q, NG(Q)] where Q varies over a family C of subgroups of P The choice of the family C can be made in many ways (C is what is called a "weak conjugation family" in (Alperin 1967)), and several examples are given: one can take C to be all non-identity subgroups of P, or the smaller choice of just the intersections Q = P ∩ Pg for g in G in which NP(Q) and NPg(Q) are both Sylow p-subgroups of NG(Q). The latter choice is made in (Gorenstein 1980, Theorem 7.4.1, p. 251). The work of (Grün 1936) studied aspects of the transfer and fusion as well, resulting in Grün's first theorem: P ∩ Ap(G) is generated by P ∩ [N, N] and P ∩ [Q, Q] where N = NG(P) and Q ranges over the set of Sylow p-subgroups Q = Pg of G (Gorenstein 1980, Theorem 7.4.2, p. 252).
