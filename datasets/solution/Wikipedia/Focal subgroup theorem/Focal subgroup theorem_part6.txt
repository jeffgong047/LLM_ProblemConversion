subgroup: One can define, as in (Isaacs 2008, p. 165) the focal subgroup of H with respect to G as: FocG(H) = ⟨ x−1 y | x,y in H and x is G-conjugate to y ⟩. This focal subgroup measures the extent to which elements of H fuse in G, while the previous definition measured certain abelian p-group homomorphic images of the group G. The content of the focal subgroup theorem is that these two definitions of focal subgroup are compatible. (Gorenstein 1980, p. 246) shows that the focal subgroup of P in G is the intersection P∩[G,G] of the Sylow p-subgroup P of the finite group G with the derived subgroup [G,G] of G. The focal subgroup is important as it is a Sylow p-subgroup of the derived subgroup. One also gets the following result: There exists a normal subgroup K of G with G/K an abelian p-group isomorphic to P/P∩[G,G] (here K denotes Ap(G)), and if K is a normal subgroup of G with G/K an abelian p-group, then P∩[G,G] ≤ K, and G/K is a homomorphic image of P/P∩[G,G], (Gorenstein 1980, Theorem 7.3.1, p. 90).
