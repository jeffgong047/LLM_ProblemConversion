generalizations: This connection between transfer and fusion is credited to (Higman 1953),[1] where, in different language, the focal subgroup theorem was proved along with various generalizations. The requirement that G/K be abelian was dropped, so that Higman also studied Op(G) and the nilpotent residual γ∞(G), as so called hyperfocal subgroups. Higman also did not restrict to a single prime p, but rather allowed π-groups for sets of primes π and used Philip Hall's theorem of Hall subgroups in order to prove similar results about the transfer into Hall π-subgroups; taking π = {p} a Hall π-subgroup is a Sylow p-subgroup, and the results of Higman are as presented above. Interest in the hyperfocal subgroups was renewed by work of (Puig 2000) in understanding the modular representation theory of certain well behaved blocks. The hyperfocal subgroup of P in G can defined as P∩γ∞(G) that is, as a Sylow p-subgroup of the nilpotent residual of G. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of the finite group G, then one gets the standard focal subgroup theorem: P∩γ∞(G) = P∩Op(G) = ⟨ x−1 y : x,y in P and y = xg for some g in G of order coprime to p ⟩ and the local characterization: P∩Op(G) = ⟨ x−1 y : x,y in Q ≤ P and y = xg for some g in NG(Q) of order coprime to p ⟩. This compares to the local characterization of the focal subgroup as: P∩Ap(G) = ⟨ x−1 y : x,y in Q ≤ P and y = xg for some g in NG(Q) ⟩. Puig is interested in the generalization of this situation to fusion systems, a categorical model of the fusion pattern of a Sylow p-subgroup with respect to a finite group that also models the fusion pattern of a defect group of a p-block in modular representation theory. In fact fusion systems have found a number of surprising applications and inspirations in the area of algebraic topology known as equivariant homotopy theory. Some of the major algebraic theorems in this area only have topological proofs at the moment. Other
