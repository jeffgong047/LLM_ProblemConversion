Notes: ^ The focal subgroup theorem and/or the focal subgroup is due to (Higman 1953) according to (Gorenstein, Lyons & Solomon 1996, p. 90), (Rose 1978, p. 255), (Suzuki 1986, p. 141); however, the focal subgroup theorem as stated there and here is quite a bit older and already appears in textbook form in (Hall 1959, p. 215). There and in (Puig 2000) the ideas are credited to (Grün 1936); compare to (Grün 1936, Satz 5) in the special case of p-normal groups, and the general result in Satz 9 which is in some sense a refinement of the focal subgroup theorem.
