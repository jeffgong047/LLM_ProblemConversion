homomorphism: Main article: Transfer (group theory) The transfer homomorphism is a homomorphism that can be defined from any group G to the abelian group H/[H,H] defined by a subgroup H ≤ G of finite index, that is [G:H] < ∞. The transfer map from a finite group G into its Sylow p-subgroup has a kernel that is easy to describe: The kernel of the transfer homomorphism from a finite group G into its Sylow p-subgroup P has Ap(G) as its kernel, (Isaacs 2008, Theorem 5.20, p. 165). In other words, the "obvious" homomorphism onto an abelian p-group is in fact the most general such homomorphism.
