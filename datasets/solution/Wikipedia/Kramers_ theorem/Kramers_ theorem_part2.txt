proof: In quantum mechanics, the time reversal operation is represented by an antiunitary operator T:H→H:ℋ→ℋ acting on a Hilbert space Hℋ. If it happens that T2=−1^2=-1, then we have the following simple theorem: If T:H→H:ℋ→ℋ is an antiunitary operator acting on a Hilbert space Hℋ satisfying T2=−1^2=-1 and v a vector in Hℋ, then Tv is orthogonal to v.
