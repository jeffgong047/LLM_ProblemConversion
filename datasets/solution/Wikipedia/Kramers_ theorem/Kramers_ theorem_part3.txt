Proof: By the definition of an antiunitary operator, ⟨Tu,Tw⟩=⟨w,u⟩,Tw⟩=,u⟩, where u and w are vectors in Hℋ. Replacing u=Tv=Tv and w=v=v and using that T2=−1^2=-1, we get −⟨v,Tv⟩=⟨T2v,Tv⟩=⟨v,Tv⟩,-,Tv⟩=^2v,Tv⟩=,Tv⟩,which implies that ⟨v,Tv⟩=0,Tv⟩=0. Consequently, if a Hamiltonian H is time-reversal symmetric, i.e. it commutes with T, then all its energy eigenspaces have even degeneracy, since applying T to an arbitrary energy eigenstate |n⟩|n⟩ gives another energy eigenstate T|n⟩|n⟩ that is orthogonal to the first one. The orthogonality property is crucial, as it means that the two eigenstates |n⟩|n⟩ and T|n⟩|n⟩ represent different physical states. If, on the contrary, they were the same physical state, then T|n⟩=eiα|n⟩|n⟩=e^iα|n⟩ for an angle α∈Rα∈ℝ, which would imply T2|n⟩=T(eiα|n⟩)=e−iαeiα|n⟩=+|n⟩^2|n⟩=T(e^iα|n⟩)=e^-iαe^iα|n⟩=+ |n⟩ To complete Kramers degeneracy theorem, we just need to prove that the time-reversal operator T acting on a half-odd-integer spin Hilbert space satisfies T2=−1^2=-1. This follows from the fact that the spin operator S𝐒 represents a type of angular momentum, and, as such, should reverse direction under T: S→T−1ST=−S.𝐒^-1𝐒T=-𝐒. Concretely, an operator T that has this property is usually written as T=e−iπSyK=e^-i_yK where Sy_y is the spin operator in the y direction and K is the complex conjugation map in the Sz_z spin basis.[2] Since iSy_y has real matrix components in the Sz_z basis, then T2=e−iπSyKe−iπSyK=e−i2πSyK2=(−1)2S.^2=e^-i_yKe^-i_yK=e^-i2_yK^2=(-1)^2S. Hence, for half-odd-integer spins S=12,32,…=1/2,3/2,…, we have T2=−1^2=-1. This is the same minus sign that appears when one does a full 2π2π rotation on systems with half-odd-integer spins, such as fermions.
