analysis: Main article: Closed graph theorem (functional analysis) If T:X→Y:X is a linear operator between topological vector spaces (TVSs) then we say that T is a closed operator if the graph of T is closed in X×Y when X×Y is endowed with the product topology. The closed graph theorem is an important result in functional analysis that guarantees that a closed linear operator is continuous under certain conditions. The original result has been generalized many times. A well known version of the closed graph theorems is the following. Theorem[6][7] — A linear map between two F-spaces (e.g. Banach spaces) is continuous if and only if its graph is closed. See
