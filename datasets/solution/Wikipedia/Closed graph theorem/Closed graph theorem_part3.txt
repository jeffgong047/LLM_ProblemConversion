graph: If X is any space then the identity map Id:X→XId:X is continuous but its graph, which is the diagonal Gr⁡Id:=(x,x):x∈X,GrId:={(x,x):x},, is closed in X×X if and only if X is Hausdorff.[2] In particular, if X is not Hausdorff then Id:X→XId:X is continuous but does not have a closed graph. Let X denote the real numbers Rℝ with the usual Euclidean topology and let Y denote Rℝ with the indiscrete topology (where note that Y is not Hausdorff and that every function valued in Y is continuous). Let f:X→Y:X be defined by f(0)=1(0)=1 and f(x)=0(x)=0 for all x≠0≠0. Then f:X→Y:X is continuous but its graph is not closed in X×Y.[3] Closed graph theorem in point-set
