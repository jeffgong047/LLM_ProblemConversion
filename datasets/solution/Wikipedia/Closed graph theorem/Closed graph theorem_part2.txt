graphs: Main article: Closed graph If f:X→Y:X is a map between topological spaces then the graph of f is the set Gr⁡f:=(x,f(x)):x∈XGrf:={(x,f(x)):x} or equivalently, Gr⁡f:=(x,y)∈X×Y:y=f(x)Grf:={(x,y):y=f(x)} It is said that the graph of f is closed if Gr⁡fGrf is a closed subset of X×Y (with the product topology). Any continuous function into a Hausdorff space has a closed graph. Any linear map, L:X→Y,:X, between two topological vector spaces whose topologies are (Cauchy) complete with respect to translation invariant metrics, and if in addition (1a) L is sequentially continuous in the sense of the product topology, then the map L is continuous and its graph, Gr L, is necessarily closed. Conversely, if L is such a linear map with, in place of (1a), the graph of L is (1b) known to be closed in the Cartesian product space X×Y, then L is continuous and therefore necessarily sequentially continuous.[1] Examples of continuous maps that do not have a closed
