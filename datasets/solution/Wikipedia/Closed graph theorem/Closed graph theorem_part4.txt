topology: In point-set topology, the closed graph theorem states the following: Closed graph theorem[4] — If f:X→Y:X is a map from a topological space X into a Hausdorff space Y,, then the graph of f is closed if f:X→Y:X is continuous. The converse is true when Y is compact. (Note that compactness and Hausdorffness do not imply each other.) Proof First part is essentially by definition. Second part: For any open V⊂Y , we check f−1(V)^-1(V) is open. So take any x∈f−1(V)inf^-1(V) , we construct some open neighborhood U of x , such that f(U)⊂V(U) . Since the graph of f is closed, for every point (x,y′)(x,y') on the "vertical line at x", with y′≠f(x)'(x) , draw an open rectangle Uy′×Vy′_y'_y' disjoint from the graph of f . These open rectangles, when projected to the y-axis, cover the y-axis except at f(x)(x) , so add one more set V. Naively attempting to take U:=⋂y′≠f(x)Uy′:=⋂_y'(x)U_y' would construct a set containing x, but it is not guaranteed to be open, so we use compactness here. Since Y is compact, we can take a finite open covering of Y as V,Vy1′,...,Vyn′{V,V_y'_1,...,V_y'_n}. Now take U:=⋂i=1nUyi′:=⋂_i=1^nU_y'_i. It is an open neighborhood of x, since it is merely a finite intersection. We claim this is the open neighborhood of U that we want. Suppose not, then there is some unruly x′∈U' such that f(x′)∉V(x') , then that would imply f(x′)∈Vyi′(x')_y'_i for some i by open covering, but then (x′,f(x′))∈U×Vyi′⊂Uyi′×Vyi′(x',f(x'))_y'_i_y'_i_y'_i , a contradiction since it is supposed to be disjoint from the graph of f . Non-Hausdorff spaces are rarely seen, but non-compact spaces are common. An example of non-compact Y is the real line, which allows the discontinuous function with closed graph f(x)=1xifx≠0,0else(x)=1/xifx≠0, 0else. For set-valued
