Proof: Due to having the same base length and height the parallelograms ABDE and ABUH have the same area, the same argument applying to the parallelograms ACFG and ACVH, ABUH and BLQR, ACVH and RCMQ. This already yields the desired result, as we have: AABDE+AACFG=AABUH+AACVH=ABLQR+ARCMQ=ABCMLA_ABDE+A_ACFG =A_ABUH+A_ACVH =A_BLQR+A_RCMQ =A_BCML
