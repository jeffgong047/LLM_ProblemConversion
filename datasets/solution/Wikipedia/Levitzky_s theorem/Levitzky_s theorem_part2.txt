Proof: This is Utumi's argument as it appears in (Lam 2001, p. 164-165) Lemma[3] Assume that R satisfies the ascending chain condition on annihilators of the form r∈R∣ar=0{r=0} where a is in R. Then Any nil one-sided ideal is contained in the lower nil radical Nil*(R); Every nonzero nil right ideal contains a nonzero nilpotent right ideal. Every nonzero nil left ideal contains a nonzero nilpotent left ideal. Levitzki's Theorem [4] Let R be a right Noetherian ring. Then every nil one-sided ideal of R is nilpotent. In this case, the upper and lower nilradicals are equal, and moreover this ideal is the largest nilpotent ideal among nilpotent right ideals and among nilpotent left ideals. Proof: In view of the previous lemma, it is sufficient to show that the lower nilradical of R is nilpotent. Because R is right Noetherian, a maximal nilpotent ideal N exists. By maximality of N, the quotient ring R/N has no nonzero nilpotent ideals, so R/N is a semiprime ring. As a result, N contains the lower nilradical of R. Since the lower nilradical contains all nilpotent ideals, it also contains N, and so N is equal to the lower nilradical. Q.E.D. See
