statement: Let M be a differentiable manifold, of dimension n, and v a vector field on M. Suppose that x is an isolated zero of v, and fix some local coordinates near x. Pick a closed ball D centered at x, so that x is the only zero of v in D. Then the index of v at x, indexx⁡(v)index_x(v), can be defined as the degree of the map u:∂D→Sn−1:→𝕊^n-1 from the boundary of D to the (n−1)(n-1)-sphere given by u(z)=v(z)/‖v(z)‖(z)=v(z)/v(z). Theorem. Let M be a compact differentiable manifold. Let v be a vector field on M with isolated zeroes. If M has boundary, then we insist that v be pointing in the outward normal direction along the boundary. Then we have the formula ∑iindexxi⁡(v)=χ(M)∑_iindex_x_i(v)=χ(M) where the sum of the indices is over all the isolated zeroes of v and χ(M)χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M. A particularly useful corollary is when there is a non-vanishing vector field implying Euler characteristic 0. The theorem was proven for two dimensions by Henri Poincaré[1] and later generalized to higher dimensions by Heinz Hopf.[2]
