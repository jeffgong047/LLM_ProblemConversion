On prime divisors of differences two nth powers In number theory, Zsigmondy's theorem, named after Karl Zsigmondy, states that if a>b>0>b>0 are coprime integers, then for any integer n≥1≥1, there is a prime number p (called a primitive prime divisor) that divides an−bn^n-b^n and does not divide ak−bk^k-b^k for any positive integer k<n<n, with the following exceptions: n=1=1, a−b=1-b=1; then an−bn=1^n-b^n=1 which has no prime divisors n=2=2, a+b+b a power of two; then any odd prime factors of a2−b2=(a+b)(a1−b1)^2-b^2=(a+b)(a^1-b^1) must be contained in a1−b1^1-b^1, which is also even n=6=6, a=2=2, b=1=1; then a6−b6=63=32×7=(a2−b2)2(a3−b3)^6-b^6=63=3^2×7=(a^2-b^2)^2(a^3-b^3) This generalizes Bang's theorem,[1] which states that if n>1>1 and n is not equal to 6, then 2n−12^n-1 has a prime divisor not dividing any 2k−12^k-1 with k<n<n. Similarly, an+bn^n+b^n has at least one primitive prime divisor with the exception 23+13=92^3+1^3=9. Zsigmondy's theorem is often useful, especially in group theory, where it is used to prove that various groups have distinct orders except when they are known to be the same.[2][3]
