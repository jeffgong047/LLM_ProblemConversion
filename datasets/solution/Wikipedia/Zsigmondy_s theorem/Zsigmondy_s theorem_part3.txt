Generalizations: Let (an)n‚â•1(a_n)_n‚â•1 be a sequence of nonzero integers. The Zsigmondy set associated to the sequence is the set Z(an)=n‚â•1:anhasnoprimitiveprimedivisors.ùíµ(a_n)={n‚â•1:a_nhasnoprimitiveprimedivisors}. i.e., the set of indices n such that every prime dividing an_n also divides some am_m for some m<n<n. Thus Zsigmondy's theorem implies that Z(an‚àíbn)‚äÇ1,2,6ùíµ(a^n-b^n)‚äÇ{1,2,6}, and Carmichael's theorem says that the Zsigmondy set of the Fibonacci sequence is 1,2,6,12{1,2,6,12}, and that of the Pell sequence is 1{1}. In 2001 Bilu, Hanrot, and Voutier[4] proved that in general, if (an)n‚â•1(a_n)_n‚â•1 is a Lucas sequence or a Lehmer sequence, then Z(an)‚äÜ1‚â§n‚â§30ùíµ(a_n)‚äÜ{1‚â§30} (see OEIS: A285314, there are only 13 such ns, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 30). Lucas and Lehmer sequences are examples of divisibility sequences. It is also known that if (Wn)n‚â•1(W_n)_n‚â•1 is an elliptic divisibility sequence, then its Zsigmondy set Z(Wn)ùíµ(W_n) is finite.[5] However, the result is ineffective in the sense that the proof does not give an explicit upper bound for the largest element in Z(Wn)ùíµ(W_n), although it is possible to give an effective upper bound for the number of elements in Z(Wn)ùíµ(W_n).[6] See
