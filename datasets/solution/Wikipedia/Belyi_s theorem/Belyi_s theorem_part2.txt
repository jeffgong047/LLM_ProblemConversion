half-plane: It follows that the Riemann surface in question can be taken to be the quotient H/Γ (where H is the upper half-plane and Γ is a subgroup of finite index in the modular group) compactified by cusps. Since the modular group has non-congruence subgroups, it is not the conclusion that any such curve is a modular curve. Belyi
