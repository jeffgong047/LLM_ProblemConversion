theorem: Let 0 < p1 < p2 < ... be a sequence of integers such that, for some λ > 1 and all j ∈ N, pj+1pj>λ.p_j+1/p_j>λ. Let (αj)j∈N be a sequence of complex numbers such that the power series f(z)=∑j∈Nαjzpj(z)=∑_j∈𝐍α_jz^p_j has radius of convergence 1. Then no point z with |z| = 1 is a regular point for f; i.e. f cannot be analytically extended from the open unit disc D to any larger open set—not even to a single point on the boundary of D. See
