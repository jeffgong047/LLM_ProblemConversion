Notes: ^ a b See the original paper of Hartogs (1906) and its description in various historical surveys by Osgood (1966, pp. 56–59), Severi (1958, pp. 111–115) and Struppa (1988, pp. 132–134). In particular, in this last reference on p. 132, the Author explicitly writes :-"As it is pointed out in the title of (Hartogs 1906), and as the reader shall soon see, the key tool in the proof is the Cauchy integral formula". ^ See for example Vladimirov (1966, p. 153), which refers the reader to the book of Fuks (1963, p. 284) for a proof (however, in the former reference it is incorrectly stated that the proof is on page 324). ^ See Brown (1936) and Osgood (1929). ^ See Fichera (1983) and Bratti (1986a) (Bratti 1986b). ^ Fichera's proof as well as his epoch making paper (Fichera 1957) seem to have been overlooked by many specialists of the theory of functions of several complex variables: see Range (2002) for the correct attribution of many important theorems in this field. ^ See Bratti (1986a) (Bratti 1986b). ^ See his paper (Kaneko 1973) and the references therein. ^ Hörmander 1990, Theorem 2.3.2. ^ Hörmander 1990, p. 30. ^ Any connected component of Cn \ L must intersect G \ L in a nonempty open set. To see the nonemptiness, connect an arbitrary point p of Cn \ L to some point of L via a line. The intersection of the line with Cn \ L may have many connected components, but the component containing p gives a continuous path from p into G \ L.
