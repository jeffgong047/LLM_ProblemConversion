phenomenon: For example, in two variables, consider the interior domain Hε=z=(z1,z2)∈Δ2:|z1|<εor1−ε<|z2|_ε={z=(z_1,z_2)∈Δ^2:|z_1|<ε or 1-ε<|z_2|} in the two-dimensional polydisk Δ2=z∈C2;|z1|<1,|z2|<1Δ^2={z∈ℂ^2;|z_1|<1,|z_2|<1} where 0<ε<10<ε<1 . Theorem Hartogs (1906): any holomorphic functions f on Hε_ε are analytically continued to Δ2Δ^2 . Namely, there is a holomorphic function F on Δ2Δ^2 such that F=f=f on Hε_ε . Such a phenomenon is called Hartogs's phenomenon, which lead to the notion of this Hartogs's extension theorem and the domain of holomorphy. Formal statement and
