one: The theorem does not hold when n = 1. To see this, it suffices to consider the function f(z) = zâˆ’1, which is clearly holomorphic in C \ {0}, but cannot be continued as a holomorphic function on the whole C. Therefore, the Hartogs's phenomenon is an elementary phenomenon that highlights the difference between the theory of functions of one and several complex variables.
