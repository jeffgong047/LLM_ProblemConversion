Group-theoretic: Maschke's theorem is commonly formulated as a corollary to the following result: Theorem — V is a representation of a finite group G over a field F𝔽 with characteristic not dividing the order of G. If V has a subrepresentation W, then it has another subrepresentation U such that V=W⊕U=W.[4][5] Then the corollary is Corollary (Maschke's theorem) — Every representation of a finite group G over a field F𝔽 with characteristic not dividing the order of G is a direct sum of irreducible representations.[6][7] The vector space of complex-valued class functions of a group G has a natural G-invariant inner product structure, described in the article Schur orthogonality relations. Maschke's theorem was originally proved for the case of representations over Cℂ by constructing U as the orthogonal complement of W under this inner product.
