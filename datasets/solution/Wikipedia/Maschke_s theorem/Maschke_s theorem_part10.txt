Non-examples: The theorem can not apply to the case where G is infinite, or when the field K has characteristics dividing #G. For example, Consider the infinite group Zℤ and the representation ρ:Z→GL2(C)ρ:ℤ→GL_2(ℂ) defined by ρ(n)=[1101]n=[1n01]ρ(n)=[ 1 1; 0 1 ]^n=[ 1 n; 0 1 ]. Let W=C⋅[10]=ℂ·[ 1; 0 ], a 1-dimensional subspace of C2ℂ^2 spanned by [10][ 1; 0 ]. Then the restriction of ρρ on W is a trivial subrepresentation of Zℤ. However, there's no U such that both W, U are subrepresentations of Zℤ and C2=W⊕Uℂ^2=W: any such U needs to be 1-dimensional, but any 1-dimensional subspace preserved by ρρ has to be spanned by an eigenvector for [1101][ 1 1; 0 1 ], and the only eigenvector for that is [10][ 1; 0 ]. Consider a prime p, and the group Z/pZℤ/pℤ, field K=Fp=𝔽_p, and the representation ρ:Z/pZ→GL2(Fp)ρ:ℤ/pℤ→GL_2(𝔽_p) defined by ρ(n)=[1n01]ρ(n)=[ 1 n; 0 1 ]. Simple calculations show that there is only one eigenvector for [1101][ 1 1; 0 1 ] here, so by the same argument, the 1-dimensional subrepresentation of Z/pZℤ/pℤ is unique, and Z/pZℤ/pℤ cannot be decomposed into the direct sum of two 1-dimensional subrepresentations.
