statement: The above proof depends on the fact that #G is invertible in K. This might lead one to ask if the converse of Maschke's theorem also holds: if the characteristic of K divides the order of G, does it follow that K[G] is not semisimple? The answer is yes.[12] Proof. For x=∑λgg∈K[G]=∑λ_gg[G] define ϵ(x)=∑λgϵ(x)=∑λ_g. Let I=ker⁡ϵ=ϵ. Then I is a K[G]-submodule. We will prove that for every nontrivial submodule V of K[G], I∩V≠0≠0. Let V be given, and let v=∑μgg=∑μ_gg be any nonzero element of V. If ϵ(v)=0ϵ(v)=0, the claim is immediate. Otherwise, let s=∑1g=∑1g. Then ϵ(s)=#G⋅1=0ϵ(s)=#G·1=0 so s∈I and sv=(∑1g)(∑μgg)=∑ϵ(v)g=ϵ(v)s=(∑1g)(∑μ_gg)=∑ϵ(v)g=ϵ(v)s so that sv is a nonzero element of both I and V. This proves V is not a direct complement of I for all V, so K[G] is not semisimple.
