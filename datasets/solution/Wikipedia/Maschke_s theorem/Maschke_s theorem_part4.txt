Module-theoretic: One of the approaches to representations of finite groups is through module theory. Representations of a group G are replaced by modules over its group algebra K[G][G] (to be precise, there is an isomorphism of categories between K[G]-Mod[G]-Mod and RepGRep_G, the category of representations of G). Irreducible representations correspond to simple modules. In the module-theoretic language, Maschke's theorem asks: is an arbitrary module semisimple? In this context, the theorem can be reformulated as follows: Maschke's Theorem — Let G be a finite group and K a field whose characteristic does not divide the order of G. Then K[G][G], the group algebra of G, is semisimple.[8][9] The importance of this result stems from the well developed theory of semisimple rings, in particular, their classification as given by the Wedderburn–Artin theorem. When K is the field of complex numbers, this shows that the algebra K[G][G] is a product of several copies of complex matrix algebras, one for each irreducible representation.[10] If the field K has characteristic zero, but is not algebraically closed, for example if K is the field of real or rational numbers, then a somewhat more complicated statement holds: the group algebra K[G][G] is a product of matrix algebras over division rings over K. The summands correspond to irreducible representations of G over K.[11]
