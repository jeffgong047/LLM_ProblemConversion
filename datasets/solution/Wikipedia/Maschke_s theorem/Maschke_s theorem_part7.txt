Group-theoretic: Let U be a subspace of V complement of W. Let p0:V→W_0:V be the projection function, i.e., p0(w+u)=w_0(w+u)=w for any u∈U,w∈W,w. Define p(x)=1#G∑g∈Gg⋅p0⋅g−1(x)(x)=1/#G∑_gg_0^-1(x), where g⋅p0⋅g−1_0^-1 is an abbreviation of ρWg⋅p0⋅ρVg−1ρ_Wg_0·ρ_Vg^-1, with ρWg,ρVg−1ρ_Wg,ρ_Vg^-1 being the representation of G on W and V. Then, ker⁡p is preserved by G under representation ρVρ_V: for any w′∈ker⁡p,h∈G'∈,h, p(hw′)=h⋅h−11#G∑g∈Gg⋅p0⋅g−1(hw′)=h⋅1#G∑g∈G(h−1⋅g)⋅p0⋅(g−1h)w′=h⋅1#G∑g∈Gg⋅p0⋅g−1w′=h⋅p(w′)=0p(hw') =h^-11/#G∑_gg_0^-1(hw') =h·1/#G∑_g(h^-1)_0·(g^-1h)w' =h·1/#G∑_gg_0^-1w' =h(w') =0 so w′∈ker⁡p'∈ implies that hw′∈ker⁡p'∈. So the restriction of ρVρ_V on ker⁡p is also a representation. By the definition of p, for any w∈W, p(w)=w(w)=w, so W∩ker⁡p=0∩={0}, and for any v∈V, p(p(v))=p(v)(p(v))=p(v). Thus, p(v−p(v))=0(v-p(v))=0, and v−p(v)∈ker⁡p-p(v)∈. Therefore, V=W⊕ker⁡p=W⊕.
