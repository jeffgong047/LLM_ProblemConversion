Statement: Let f be a weight 2 newform on Γ0(qN) – i.e. of level qN where q does not divide N – with absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρf,p unramified at q if q ≠ p and finite flat at q = p. Then there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that ρf,p≃ρg,p.ρ_f,p≃ρ_g,p. In particular, if E is an elliptic curve over Qℚ with conductor qN, then the modularity theorem guarantees that there exists a weight 2 newform f of level qN such that the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρf, p of f is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρE, p of E. To apply Ribet's Theorem to ρE, p, it suffices to check the irreducibility and ramification of ρE, p. Using the theory of the Tate curve, one can prove that ρE, p is unramified at q ≠ p and finite flat at q = p if p divides the power to which q appears in the minimal discriminant ΔE. Then Ribet's theorem implies that there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that ρg, p ≈ ρE, p. Level
