Implications: Suppose that the Fermat equation with exponent p ≥ 5[8] had a solution in non-zero integers a, b, c. The corresponding Frey curve Eap,bp,cp is an elliptic curve whose minimal discriminant Δ is equal to 2−8 (abc)2p and whose conductor N is the radical of abc, i.e. the product of all distinct primes dividing abc. An elementary consideration of the equation ap + bp = cp, makes it clear that one of a, b, c is even and hence so is N. By the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, E is a modular elliptic curve. Since all odd primes dividing a, b, c in N appear to a pth power in the minimal discriminant Δ, by Ribet's theorem repetitive level descent modulo p strips all odd primes from the conductor. However, no newforms of level 2 remain because the genus of the modular curve X0(2) is zero (and newforms of level N are differentials on X0(N)). See
