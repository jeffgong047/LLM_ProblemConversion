History: In his thesis, Yves Hellegouarch [fr] originated the idea of associating solutions (a,b,c) of Fermat's equation with a different mathematical object: an elliptic curve.[3] If p is an odd prime and a, b, and c are positive integers such that ap+bp=cp,^p+b^p=c^p, then a corresponding Frey curve is an algebraic curve given by the equation y2=x(x−ap)(x+bp).^2=x(x-a^p)(x+b^p). This is a nonsingular algebraic curve of genus one defined over Qℚ, and its projective completion is an elliptic curve over Qℚ. In 1982 Gerhard Frey called attention to the unusual properties of the same curve, now called a Frey curve.[4] This provided a bridge between Fermat and Taniyama by showing that a counterexample to FLT would create a curve that would not be modular. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when Frey suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies FLT. However, his argument was not complete.[5] In 1985 Jean-Pierre Serre proposed that a Frey curve could not be modular and provided a partial proof.[6][7] This showed that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture would imply FLT. Serre did not provide a complete proof and the missing bit became known as the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture. In the summer of 1986, Kenneth Alan Ribet proved the epsilon conjecture, thereby proving that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implied FLT.[8]
