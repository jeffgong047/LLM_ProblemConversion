lowering: Ribet's theorem states that beginning with an elliptic curve E of conductor qN does not guarantee the existence of an elliptic curve E′ of level N such that ρE, p ≈ ρE′, p. The newform g of level N may not have rational Fourier coefficients, and hence may be associated to a higher-dimensional abelian variety, not an elliptic curve. For example, elliptic curve 4171a1 in the Cremona database given by the equation E:y2+xy+y=x3−663204x+206441595:y^2+xy+y=x^3-663204x+206441595 with conductor 43 × 97 and discriminant 437 × 973 does not level-lower mod 7 to an elliptic curve of conductor 97. Rather, the mod p Galois representation is isomorphic to the mod p Galois representation of an irrational newform g of level 97. However, for p large enough compared to the level N of the level-lowered newform, a rational newform (e.g. an elliptic curve) must level-lower to another rational newform (e.g. elliptic curve). In particular for p ≫ NN1+ε, the mod p Galois representation of a rational newform cannot be isomorphic to an irrational newform of level N.[2] Similarly, the Frey-Mazur conjecture predicts that for large enough p (independent of the conductor N), elliptic curves with isomorphic mod p Galois representations are in fact isogenous, and hence have the same conductor. Thus non-trivial level-lowering between rational newforms is not predicted to occur for large p (p > 17).
