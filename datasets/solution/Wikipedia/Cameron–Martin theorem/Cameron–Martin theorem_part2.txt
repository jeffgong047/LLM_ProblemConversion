Motivation: The standard Gaussian measure γnγ^n on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn𝐑^n is not translation-invariant. (In fact, there is a unique translation invariant Radon measure up to scale by Haar's theorem: the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure, denoted here dx.) Instead, a measurable subset A has Gaussian measure γn(A)=1(2π)n/2∫Aexp⁡(−12⟨x,x⟩Rn)dx.γ_n(A)=1/(2π)^n/2∫_Aexp(-12,x⟩_𝐑^n) dx. Here ⟨x,x⟩Rn,x⟩_𝐑^n refers to the standard Euclidean dot product in Rn𝐑^n. The Gaussian measure of the translation of A by a vector h∈Rn∈𝐑^n is γn(A−h)=1(2π)n/2∫Aexp⁡(−12⟨x−h,x−h⟩Rn)dx=1(2π)n/2∫Aexp⁡(2⟨x,h⟩Rn−⟨h,h⟩Rn2)exp⁡(−12⟨x,x⟩Rn)dx.γ_n(A-h) =1/(2π)^n/2∫_Aexp(-12-h,x-h⟩_𝐑^n) dx =1/(2π)^n/2∫_Aexp(2,h⟩_𝐑^n-,h⟩_𝐑^n/2)exp(-12,x⟩_𝐑^n) dx. So under translation through h, the Gaussian measure scales by the distribution function appearing in the last display: exp⁡(2⟨x,h⟩Rn−⟨h,h⟩Rn2)=exp⁡(⟨x,h⟩Rn−12‖h‖Rn2).exp(2,h⟩_𝐑^n-,h⟩_𝐑^n/2)=exp(,h⟩_𝐑^n-12h_𝐑^n^2). The measure that associates to the set A the number γn(A−h)γ_n(A-h) is the pushforward measure, denoted (Th)∗(γn)(T_h)_*(γ^n). Here Th:Rn→Rn_h:𝐑^n→𝐑^n refers to the translation map: Th(x)=x+h_h(x)=x+h. The above calculation shows that the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the pushforward measure with respect to the original Gaussian measure is given by d(Th)∗(γn)dγn(x)=exp⁡(⟨h,x⟩Rn−12‖h‖Rn2).d(T_h)_*(γ^n)/dγ^n(x)=exp(,x⟩_𝐑^n-12h_𝐑^n^2). The abstract Wiener measure γγ on a separable Banach space E, where i:H→E:H is an abstract Wiener space, is also a "Gaussian measure" in a suitable sense. How does it change under translation? It turns out that a similar formula to the one above holds if we consider only translations by elements of the dense subspace i(H)⊆E(H). Statement of the
