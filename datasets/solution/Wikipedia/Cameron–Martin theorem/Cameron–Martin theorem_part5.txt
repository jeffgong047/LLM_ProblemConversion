application: Using Cameron–Martin theorem one may establish (See Liptser and Shiryayev 1977, p. 280) that for a q×q symmetric non-negative definite matrix H(t)(t) whose elements Hj,k(t)_j,k(t) are continuous and satisfy the condition ∫0T∑j,k=1q|Hj,k(t)|dt<∞,∫_0^T∑_j,k=1^q|H_j,k(t)| dt<∞, it holds for a q−dimensional Wiener process w(t)(t) that E[exp⁡(−∫0Tw(t)∗H(t)w(t)dt)]=exp⁡[12∫0Ttr⁡(G(t))dt],[exp(-∫_0^Tw(t)^*H(t)w(t) dt)]=exp[12∫_0^Ttr(G(t)) dt], where G(t)(t) is a q×q nonpositive definite matrix which is a unique solution of the matrix-valued Riccati differential equation dG(t)dt=2H(t)−G2(t)dG(t)/dt=2H(t)-G^2(t) with the boundary condition G(T)=0(T)=0. In the special case of a one-dimensional Brownian motion where H(t)=1/2(t)=1/2, the unique solution is G(t)=tanh⁡(t−T)(t)=tanh(t-T), and we have the original formula as established by Cameron and Martin: E[exp⁡(−12∫0Tw(t)2dt)]=1cosh⁡T.[exp(-12∫_0^Tw(t)^2 dt)]=1/√().
