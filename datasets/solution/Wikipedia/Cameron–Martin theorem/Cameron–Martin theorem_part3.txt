theorem: Let i:H→E:H be an abstract Wiener space with abstract Wiener measure γ:Borel⁡(E)→[0,1]γ:Borel(E)→[0,1]. For h∈H, define Th:E→E_h:E by Th(x)=x+i(h)_h(x)=x+i(h). Then (Th)∗(γ)(T_h)_*(γ) is equivalent to γγ with Radon–Nikodym derivative d(Th)∗(γ)dγ(x)=exp⁡(⟨h,x⟩∼−12‖h‖H2),d(T_h)_*(γ)/dγ(x)=exp(,x⟩^∼-12h_H^2), where ⟨h,x⟩∼=i(h)(x),x⟩^∼=i(h)(x) denotes the Paley–Wiener integral. The Cameron–Martin formula is valid only for translations by elements of the dense subspace i(H)⊆E(H), called Cameron–Martin space, and not by arbitrary elements of E. If the Cameron–Martin formula did hold for arbitrary translations, it would contradict the following result: If E is a separable Banach space and μμ is a locally finite Borel measure on E that is equivalent to its own push forward under any translation, then either E has finite dimension or μμ is the trivial (zero) measure. (See quasi-invariant measure.) In fact, γγ is quasi-invariant under translation by an element v if and only if v∈i(H)(H). Vectors in i(H)(H) are sometimes known as Cameron–Martin directions.
