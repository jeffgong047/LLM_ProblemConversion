parts: The Cameron–Martin formula gives rise to an integration by parts formula on E: if F:E→R:E→𝐑 has bounded Fréchet derivative DF:E→Lin⁡(E;R)=E∗DF:E→Lin(E;𝐑)=E^*, integrating the Cameron–Martin formula with respect to Wiener measure on both sides gives ∫EF(x+ti(h))dγ(x)=∫EF(x)exp⁡(t⟨h,x⟩∼−12t2‖h‖H2)dγ(x)∫_EF(x+ti(h)) dγ(x)=∫_EF(x)exp(t,x⟩^∼-12t^2h_H^2) dγ(x) for any t∈R∈𝐑. Formally differentiating with respect to t and evaluating at t=0=0 gives the integration by parts formula ∫EDF(x)(i(h))dγ(x)=∫EF(x)⟨h,x⟩∼dγ(x).∫_EDF(x)(i(h)) dγ(x)=∫_EF(x),x⟩^∼ dγ(x). Comparison with the divergence theorem of vector calculus suggests div⁡[Vh](x)=−⟨h,x⟩∼,div[V_h](x)=-,x⟩^∼, where Vh:E→E_h:E is the constant "vector field" Vh(x)=i(h)_h(x)=i(h) for all x∈E. The wish to consider more general vector fields and to think of stochastic integrals as "divergences" leads to the study of stochastic processes and the Malliavin calculus, and, in particular, the Clark–Ocone theorem and its associated integration by parts formula.
