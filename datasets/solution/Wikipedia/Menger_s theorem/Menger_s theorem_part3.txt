connectivity: The vertex-connectivity statement of Menger's theorem is as follows: Let G be a finite undirected graph and x and y two nonadjacent vertices. Then the size of the minimum vertex cut for x and y (the minimum number of vertices, distinct from x and y, whose removal disconnects x and y) is equal to the maximum number of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths from x to y. Extended to all pairs: a graph is k-vertex-connected (it has more than k vertices and it remains connected after removing fewer than k vertices) if and only if every pair of vertices has at least k internally vertex-disjoint paths in between. All these statements (in both edge and vertex versions) remain true in directed graphs (when considering directed paths). Short
