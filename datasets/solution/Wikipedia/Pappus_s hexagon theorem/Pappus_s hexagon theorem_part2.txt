form: Pappus theorem: proof If the affine form of the statement can be proven, then the projective form of Pappus's theorem is proven, as the extension of a pappian plane to a projective plane is unique. Because of the parallelity in an affine plane one has to distinct two cases: g∦h and g∥h. The key for a simple proof is the possibility for introducing a "suitable" coordinate system: Case 1: The lines g,h,h intersect at point S=g∩h=g. In this case coordinates are introduced, such that S=(0,0),A=(0,1),c=(1,0) S=(0,0), A=(0,1), c=(1,0) (see diagram). B,C,C have the coordinates B=(0,γ),C=(0,δ),γ,δ∉0,1 B=(0,γ), C=(0,δ), γ,δ∉{0,1}. From the parallelity of the lines Bc,Cb, Cb one gets b=(δγ,0)=(δγ,0) and the parallelity of the lines Ab,Ba,Ba yields a=(δ,0)=(δ,0). Hence line Ca has slope −1-1 and is parallel line Ac. Case 2: g∥h} (little theorem). In this case the coordinates are chosen such that c=(0,0),b=(1,0),A=(0,1),B=(γ,1),γ≠0 c=(0,0), b=(1,0), A=(0,1), B=(γ,1), γ≠0. From the parallelity of Ab∥Ba and cB∥bC one gets C=(γ+1,1) C=(γ+1,1) and a=(γ+1,0) a=(γ+1,0) , respectively, and at least the parallelity Ac∥Ca Ac . Proof with homogeneous
