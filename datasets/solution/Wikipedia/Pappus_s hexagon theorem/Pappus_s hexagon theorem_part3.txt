coordinates: Choose homogeneous coordinates with C=(1,0,0),c=(0,1,0),X=(0,0,1),A=(1,1,1)=(1,0,0), c=(0,1,0), X=(0,0,1), A=(1,1,1). On the lines AC,Ac,AX,Ac,AX, given by x2=x3,x1=x3,x2=x1_2=x_3, x_1=x_3, x_2=x_1, take the points B,Y,b,Y,b to be B=(p,1,1),Y=(1,q,1),b=(1,1,r)=(p,1,1), Y=(1,q,1), b=(1,1,r) for some p,q,r,q,r. The three lines XB,CY,cb,CY,cb are x1=x2p,x2=x3q,x3=x1r_1=x_2p, x_2=x_3q, x_3=x_1r, so they pass through the same point a if and only if rqp=1=1. The condition for the three lines Cb,cB,cB and XY with equations x2=x1q,x1=x3p,x3=x2r_2=x_1q, x_1=x_3p, x_3=x_2r to pass through the same point Z is rpq=1=1. So this last set of three lines is concurrent if all the other eight sets are because multiplication is commutative, so pq=qp=qp. Equivalently, X,Y,Z,Y,Z are collinear. The proof above also shows that for Pappus's theorem to hold for a projective space over a division ring it is both sufficient and necessary that the division ring is a (commutative) field. German mathematician Gerhard Hessenberg proved that Pappus's theorem implies Desargues's theorem.[4][5] In general, Pappus's theorem holds for some projective plane if and only if it is a projective plane over a commutative field. The projective planes in which Pappus's theorem does not hold are Desarguesian projective planes over noncommutative division rings, and non-Desarguesian planes. The proof is invalid if C,c,X,c,X happen to be collinear. In that case an alternative proof can be provided, for example, using a different projective reference. Dual
