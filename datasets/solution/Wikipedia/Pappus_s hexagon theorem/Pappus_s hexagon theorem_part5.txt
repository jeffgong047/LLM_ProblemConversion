theorem: Triangles XcC and BbY are perspective from A and a, and so, also from Z. In addition to the above characterizations of Pappus's theorem and its dual, the following are equivalent statements: If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, then the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear.[7] Arranged in a matrix of nine points (as in the figure and description above) and thought of as evaluating a permanent, if the first two rows and the six "diagonal" triads are collinear, then the third row is collinear. |ABCabcXYZ||A B C a b c X Y Z| That is, if ABC,abc,AbZ,BcX,CaY,XbC,YcA,ZaB,abc,AbZ,BcX,CaY,XbC,YcA,ZaB} are lines, then Pappus's theorem states that XYZ must be a line. Also, note that the same matrix formulation applies to the dual form of the theorem when (A,B,C)(A,B,C) etc. are triples of concurrent lines.[8] Given three distinct points on each of two distinct lines, pair each point on one of the lines with one from the other line, then the joins of points not paired will meet in (opposite) pairs at points along a line.[9] If two triangles are perspective in at least two different ways, then they are perspective in three ways.[4] If AB,CD, AB,CD, and EF are concurrent and DE,FA,,FA, and BC are concurrent, then AD,BE,,BE, and CF are concurrent.[8]
