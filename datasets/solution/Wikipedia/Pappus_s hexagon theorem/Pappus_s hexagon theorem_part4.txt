theorem: Because of the principle of duality for projective planes the dual theorem of Pappus is true: If 6 lines A,b,C,a,B,c,b,C,a,B,c are chosen alternately from two pencils with centers G,H,H, the lines X:=(A∩b)(a∩B),:=(A)(a), Y:=(c∩A)(C∩a),:=(c)(C), Z:=(b∩C)(B∩c):=(b)(B) are concurrent, that means: they have a point U in common. The left diagram shows the projective version, the right one an affine version, where the points G,H,H are points at infinity. If point U is on the line GH than one gets the "dual little theorem" of Pappus' theorem. dual theorem: projective form dual theorem: affine form If in the affine version of the dual "little theorem" point U is a point at infinity too, one gets Thomsen's theorem, a statement on 6 points on the sides of a triangle (see diagram). The Thomsen figure plays an essential role coordinatising an axiomatic defined projective plane.[6] The proof of the closure of Thomsen's figure is covered by the proof for the "little theorem", given above. But there exists a simple direct proof, too: Because the statement of Thomsen's theorem (the closure of the figure) uses only the terms connect, intersect and parallel, the statement is affinely invariant, and one can introduce coordinates such that P=(0,0),Q=(1,0),R=(0,1)=(0,0), Q=(1,0), R=(0,1) (see right diagram). The starting point of the sequence of chords is (0,λ).(0,λ). One easily verifies the coordinates of the points given in the diagram, which shows: the last point coincides with the first point.
