functions: The normalizations a0=0anda1=1_0=0{and_1=1 mean that f(0)=0andf′(0)=1.(0)=0{and'(0)=1. This can always be obtained by an affine transformation: starting with an arbitrary injective holomorphic function g defined on the open unit disk and setting f(z)=g(z)−g(0)g′(0).(z)=g(z)-g(0)/g'(0). Such functions g are of interest because they appear in the Riemann mapping theorem. A schlicht function is defined as an analytic function f that is one-to-one and satisfies f(0)=0(0)=0 and f′(0)=1'(0)=1. A family of schlicht functions are the rotated Koebe functions fα(z)=z(1−αz)2=∑n=1∞nαn−1zn_α(z)=z/(1-)^2=∑_n=1^∞nα^n-1z^n with αα a complex number of absolute value 11. If f is a schlicht function and |an|=n|a_n|=n for some n≥2≥2, then f is a rotated Koebe function. The condition of de Branges' theorem is not sufficient to show the function is schlicht, as the function f(z)=z+z2=(z+1/2)2−1/4(z)=z+z^2=(z+1/2)^2-1/4 shows: it is holomorphic on the unit disc and satisfies |an|≤n|a_n| for all n, but it is not injective since f(−1/2+z)=f(−1/2−z)(-1/2+z)=f(-1/2-z).
