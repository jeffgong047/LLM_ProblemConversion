proof: The proof uses a type of Hilbert space of entire functions. The study of these spaces grew into a sub-field of complex analysis and the spaces have come to be called de Branges spaces. De Branges proved the stronger Milin conjecture (Milin 1977) on logarithmic coefficients. This was already known to imply the Robertson conjecture (Robertson 1936) about odd univalent functions, which in turn was known to imply the Bieberbach conjecture about schlicht functions (Bieberbach 1916). His proof uses the Loewner equation, the Askey–Gasper inequality about Jacobi polynomials, and the Lebedev–Milin inequality on exponentiated power series. De Branges reduced the conjecture to some inequalities for Jacobi polynomials, and verified the first few by hand. Walter Gautschi verified more of these inequalities by computer for de Branges (proving the Bieberbach conjecture for the first 30 or so coefficients) and then asked Richard Askey whether he knew of any similar inequalities. Askey pointed out that Askey & Gasper (1976) had proved the necessary inequalities eight years before, which allowed de Branges to complete his proof. The first version was very long and had some minor mistakes which caused some skepticism about it, but these were corrected with the help of members of the Leningrad seminar on Geometric Function Theory (Leningrad Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute) when de Branges visited in 1984. De Branges proved the following result, which for ν=0ν=0 implies the Milin conjecture (and therefore the Bieberbach conjecture). Suppose that ν>−3/2ν>-3/2 and σnσ_n are real numbers for positive integers n with limit 00 and such that ρn=Γ(2ν+n+1)Γ(n+1)(σn−σn+1)ρ_n=Γ(2ν+n+1)/Γ(n+1)(σ_n-σ_n+1) is non-negative, non-increasing, and has limit 00. Then for all Riemann mapping functions F(z)=z+⋯(z)=z+⋯ univalent in the unit disk with F(z)ν−zνν=∑n=1∞anzν+nF(z)^ν-z^ν/ν=∑_n=1^∞a_nz^ν+n the maximum value of ∑n=1∞(ν+n)σn|an|2∑_n=1^∞(ν+n)σ_n|a_n|^2 is achieved by the Koebe function z/(1−z)2/(1-z)^2. A simplified version of the proof was published in 1985 by Carl FitzGerald and Christian Pommerenke (FitzGerald & Pommerenke (1985)), and an even shorter description by Jacob Korevaar (Korevaar (1986)).
