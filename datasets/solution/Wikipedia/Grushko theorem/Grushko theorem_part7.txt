Lemma: Let F be a finitely generated free group, with n generators. Let G1 and G2 be two finitely presented groups. Suppose there exists a surjective homomorphism ϕ:F→G1∗G2ϕ:F_1_2. Then there exists two subgroups F1 and F2 of F with ϕ(F1)=G1ϕ(F_1)=G_1 and ϕ(F2)=G2ϕ(F_2)=G_2, such that F=F1∗F2.=F_1_2. Proof: We give the proof assuming that F has no generator which is mapped to the identity of G1∗G2_1_2, for if there are such generators, they may be added to any of F1_1 or F2_2. The following general results are used in the proof. 1. There is a one or two dimensional CW complex, Z with fundamental group F. By Van Kampen theorem, the wedge of n circles is one such space. 2. There exists a two complex X=X1∪X2=X_1_2 where p=X1∩X2{p}=X_1_2 is a point on a one cell of X such that X1 and X2 are two complexes with fundamental groups G1 and G2 respectively. Note that by the Van Kampen theorem, this implies that the fundamental group of X is G1∗G2_1_2. 3. There exists a map f:Z→X:Z such that the induced map f∗_∗ on the fundamental groups is same as ϕϕ For the sake of convenience, let us denote f−1(X1)=:Z1^-1(X_1)=:Z_1 and f−1(X2)=:Z2^-1(X_2)=:Z_2. Since no generator of F maps to identity, the set Z1∩Z2_1_2 has no loops, for if it does, these will correspond to circles of Z which map to p∈X, which in turn correspond to generators of F which go to the identity. So, the components of Z1∩Z2_1_2 are contractible. In the case where Z1∩Z2_1_2 has only one component, by Van Kampen's theorem, we are done, as in that case, :F=Π1(Z1)∗Π1(Z2)=Π_1(Z_1)∗Π_1(Z_2). The general proof follows by reducing Z to a space homotopically equivalent to it, but with fewer components in Z1∩Z2_1_2, and thus by induction on the components of Z1∩Z2_1_2. Such a reduction of Z is done by attaching discs along binding ties. We call a map γ:[0,1]→Zγ:[0,1] a binding tie if it satisfies the following properties 1. It is monochromatic i.e. γ([0,1])⊆Z1γ([0,1])_1 or γ([0,1])⊆Z2γ([0,1])_2 2. It is a tie i.e. γ(0)γ(0) and γ(1)γ(1) lie in different components of Z1∩Z2_1_2. 3. It is null i.e. f∘γ([0,1])∘γ([0,1]) is null homotopic in X. Let us assume that such a binding tie exists. Let γγ be the binding tie. Consider the map g:[0,1]→D2:[0,1]^2 given by g(t)=eit(t)=e^it. This map is a homeomorphism onto its image. Define the space Z′' as Z′=Z∐D2/∼'=Z∐D^2/∼ where :x∼yiffx=y,orx=γ(t)andy=g(t)forsomet∈[0,1]orx=g(t)andy=γ(t)forsomet∈[0,1]iffx=y, x=γ(t)andy=g(t)forsomet∈[0,1] x=g(t)andy=γ(t)forsomet∈[0,1] Note that the space Z' deformation retracts to Z We first extend f to a function f″:Z∐∂D2/∼”:Z∐^2/∼ as f″(x)=f(x),x∈Zpotherwise.”(x)=f(x), potherwise. Since the f(γ)(γ) is null homotopic, f″” further extends to the interior of the disc, and therefore, to Z′' . Let Zi′=f′−1(Xi)_i'=f'^-1(X_i) i = 1,2. As γ(0)γ(0) and γ(1)γ(1) lay in different components of Z1∩Z2_1_2, Z1′∩Z2′_1'_2' has one less component than Z1∩Z2_1_2. Construction of binding
