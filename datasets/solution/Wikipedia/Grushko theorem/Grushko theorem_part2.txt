theorem: Let A and B be finitely generated groups and let A∗B be the free product of A and B. Then rank(A∗B) = rank(A) + rank(B). It is obvious that rank(A∗B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B) since if X is a finite generating set of A and Y is a finite generating set of B then X∪Y is a generating set for A∗B and that |X ∪ Y| ≤ |X| + |Y|. The opposite inequality, rank(A∗B) ≥ rank(A) + rank(B), requires proof. Grushko, but not Neumann, proved a more precise version of Grushko's theorem in terms of Nielsen equivalence. It states that if M = (g1, g2, ..., gn) is an n-tuple of elements of G = A∗B such that M generates G, <g1, g2, ..., gn> = G, then M is Nielsen equivalent in G to an n-tuple of the form M' = (a1, ..., ak, b1, ..., bn−k) where {a1, ..., ak}⊆A is a generating set for A and where {b1, ..., bn−k}⊆B is a generating set for B. In particular, rank(A) ≤ k, rank(B) ≤ n − k and rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ k + (n − k) = n. If one takes M to be the minimal generating tuple for G, that is, with n = rank(G), this implies that rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ rank(G). Since the opposite inequality, rank(G) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B), is obvious, it follows that rank(G)=rank(A) + rank(B), as required. History and
