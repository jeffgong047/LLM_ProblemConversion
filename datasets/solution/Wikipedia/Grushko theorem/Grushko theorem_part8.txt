tie: The binding tie is constructed in two steps. Step 1: Constructing a null tie: Consider a map γ′:[0,1]→Zγ':[0,1] with γ′(0)γ'(0) and γ′(1)γ'(1) in different components of Z1∩Z2_1_2. Since f∗_∗ is surjective, there exits a loop λλ based at γ'(1) such that f(γ′)f(γ') and f(λ)f(λ) are homotopically equivalent in X. If we define a curve γ:[0,1]→Zγ:[0,1] as γ(t)=γ′∗λ(t)γ(t)=γ'∗λ(t) for all t∈[0,1]∈[0,1], then γγ is a null tie. Step 2: Making the null tie monochromatic: The tie γγ may be written as γ1∗γ2∗⋯∗γmγ_1∗γ_2∗⋯∗γ_m where each γiγ_i is a curve in Z1_1 or Z2_2 such that if γiγ_i is in Z1_1, then γi+1γ_i+1 is in Z2_2 and vice versa. This also implies that f(γi)(γ_i) is a loop based at p in X. So, [e]=[f(γ)]=[f(γ1)]∗⋯∗[f(γm)][e]=[f(γ)]=[f(γ_1)]∗⋯∗[f(γ_m)] Hence, [f(γj)]=[e][f(γ_j)]=[e] for some j. If this γjγ_j is a tie, then we have a monochromatic, null tie. If γjγ_j is not a tie, then the end points of γjγ_j are in the same component of Z1∩Z2_1_2. In this case, we replace γjγ_j by a path in Z1∩Z2_1_2, say γj′γ_j'. This path may be appended to γj−1γ_j-1 and we get a new null tie γ″=γ1∗⋯∗γj−1′∗γj+1⋯γmγ”=γ_1∗⋯∗γ_j-1'∗γ_j+1⋯γ_m, where γj−1′=γj−1∗γj′γ_j-1'=γ_j-1∗γ_j'. Thus, by induction on m, we prove the existence of a binding tie. Proof of Grushko
