Applications: The three-line theorem can be used to prove the Hadamard three-circle theorem for a bounded continuous function g(z)(z) on an annulus z:r≤|z|≤R,{z:r≤|z|}, holomorphic in the interior. Indeed applying the theorem to f(z)=g(ez),(z)=g(e^z), shows that, if m(s)=sup|z|=es|g(z)|,(s)=sup_|z|=e^s|g(z)|, then logm(s)log m(s) is a convex function of s.. The three-line theorem also holds for functions with values in a Banach space and plays an important role in complex interpolation theory. It can be used to prove Hölder's inequality for measurable functions ∫|gh|≤(∫|g|p)1p⋅(∫|h|q)1q,∫|gh|≤(∫|g|^p)^1·(∫|h|^q)^1, where 1p+1q=1,1+1=1, by considering the function f(z)=∫|g|pz|h|q(1−z).(z)=∫|g|^pz|h|^q(1-z).
