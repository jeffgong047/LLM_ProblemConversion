Statement: Hadamard three-lines theorem — Let f(z)(z) be a bounded function of z=x+iy=x+iy defined on the strip x+iy:a≤x≤b,{x+iy:a}, holomorphic in the interior of the strip and continuous on the whole strip. If M(x)=supy|f(x+iy)|(x)=sup_y|f(x+iy)| then log⁡M(x)(x) is a convex function on [a,b].[a,b]. In other words, if x=ta+(1−t)b=ta+(1-t)b with 0≤t≤1,0≤1, then M(x)≤M(a)tM(b)1−t.(x)(a)^tM(b)^1-t. Proof Define F(z)(z) by F(z)=f(z)M(a)z−bb−aM(b)z−aa−b(z)=f(z)M(a)^z-b-aM(b)^z-a-b where |F(z)|≤1|F(z)|≤1 on the edges of the strip. The result follows once it is shown that the inequality also holds in the interior of the strip. After an affine transformation in the coordinate z,, it can be assumed that a=0=0 and b=1.=1. The function Fn(z)=F(z)ez2/ne−1/n_n(z)=F(z)e^z^2/ne^-1/n tends to 00 as |z||z| tends to infinity and satisfies |Fn|≤1|F_n|≤1 on the boundary of the strip. The maximum modulus principle can therefore be applied to Fn_n in the strip. So |Fn(z)|≤1.|F_n(z)|≤1. Because Fn(z)_n(z) tends to F(z)(z) as n tends to infinity, it follows that |F(z)|≤1.|F(z)|≤1. ∎
