In solid mechanics, it is common to analyze the properties of beams with constant cross section. Saint-Venant's theorem states that the simply connected cross section with maximal torsional rigidity is a circle.[1] It is named after the French mathematician Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant. Given a simply connected domain D in the plane with area A, ρρ the radius and σσ the area of its greatest inscribed circle, the torsional rigidity P of D is defined by P=4supf(∬Dfdxdy)2∬Dfx2+fy2dxdy.=4sup_f(∬_Df dx dy)^2/∬_Df_x^2+f_y^2 dx dy. Here the supremum is taken over all the continuously differentiable functions vanishing on the boundary of D. The existence of this supremum is a consequence of Poincaré inequality. Saint-Venant[2] conjectured in 1856 that of all domains D of equal area A the circular one has the greatest torsional rigidity, that is P≤Pcircle≤A22π._circle≤A^2/2π. A rigorous proof of this inequality was not given until 1948 by Pólya.[3] Another proof was given by Davenport and reported in.[4] A more general proof and an estimate P<4ρ2A<4ρ^2A is given by Makai.[1]
