Sines: In the above diagram, use the law of sines on triangles △ABD and △ACD: |AB||BD|=sin⁡∠ADBsin⁡∠DAB|AB|/|BD|=sin/sin (1) |AC||CD|=sin⁡∠ADCsin⁡∠DAC|AC|/|CD|=sin/sin (2) Angles ∠ ADB and ∠ ADC form a linear pair, that is, they are adjacent supplementary angles. Since supplementary angles have equal sines, sin⁡∠ADB=sin⁡∠ADC.sin=sin. Angles ∠ DAB and ∠ DAC are equal. Therefore, the right hand sides of equations (1) and (2) are equal, so their left hand sides must also be equal. |BD||CD|=|AB||AC|,|BD|/|CD|=|AB|/|AC|, which is the angle bisector theorem. If angles ∠ DAB, ∠ DAC are unequal, equations (1) and (2) can be re-written as: |AB||BD|sin⁡∠DAB=sin⁡∠ADB,|AB|/|BD|sin=sin, |AC||CD|sin⁡∠DAC=sin⁡∠ADC.|AC|/|CD|sin=sin. Angles ∠ ADB, ∠ ADC are still supplementary, so the right hand sides of these equations are still equal, so we obtain: |AB||BD|sin⁡∠DAB=|AC||CD|sin⁡∠DAC,|AB|/|BD|sin=|AC|/|CD|sin, which rearranges to the "generalized" version of the theorem.
