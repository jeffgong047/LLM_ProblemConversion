bisectors: exterior angle bisectors (dotted red): Points D, E, F are collinear and the following equations for ratios hold: |EB||EC|=|AB||AC||EB||EC|=|AB||AC|, |FB||FA|=|CB||CA||FB||FA|=|CB||CA|, |DA||DC|=|BA||BC||DA||DC|=|BA||BC| For the exterior angle bisectors in a non-equilateral triangle there exist similar equations for the ratios of the lengths of triangle sides. More precisely if the exterior angle bisector in A intersects the extended side BC in E, the exterior angle bisector in B intersects the extended side AC in D and the exterior angle bisector in C intersects the extended side AB in F, then the following equations hold:[1] |EB||EC|=|AB||AC||EB|/|EC|=|AB|/|AC|, |FB||FA|=|CB||CA||FB|/|FA|=|CB|/|CA|, |DA||DC|=|BA||BC||DA|/|DC|=|BA|/|BC| The three points of intersection between the exterior angle bisectors and the extended triangle sides D, E, F are collinear, that is they lie on a common line.[2]
