Geometrical theorem relating the lengths of two segments that divide a triangle The theorem states that if ∠ DAB is congruent to ∠ DAC, then |BD|:|CD|=|AB|:|AC|.|BD|:|CD|=|AB|:|AC|. In geometry, the angle bisector theorem is concerned with the relative lengths of the two segments that a triangle's side is divided into by a line that bisects the opposite angle. It equates their relative lengths to the relative lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.
