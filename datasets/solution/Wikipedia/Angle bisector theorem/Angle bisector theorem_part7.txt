areas: α=∠BAC2=∠BAD=∠CADα=/2== A quick proof can be obtained by looking at the ratio of the areas of the two triangles △BAD, △CAD, which are created by the angle bisector in A. Computing those areas twice using different formulas, that is 12gh12gh with base g and altitude h and 12absin⁡(γ)12absin(γ) with sides a, b and their enclosed angle γ, will yield the desired result. Let h denote the height of the triangles on base BC and αα be half of the angle in A. Then |△ABD||△ACD|=12|BD|h12|CD|h=|BD||CD|||/||=1/2|BD|h/1/2|CD|h=|BD|/|CD| and |△ABD||△ACD|=12|AB||AD|sin⁡(α)12|AC||AD|sin⁡(α)=|AB||AC|||/||=1/2|AB||AD|sin(α)/1/2|AC||AD|sin(α)=|AB|/|AC| yields |BD||CD|=|AB||AC|.|BD|/|CD|=|AB|/|AC|.
