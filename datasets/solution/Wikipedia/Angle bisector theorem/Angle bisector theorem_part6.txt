altitudes: Let D be a point on the line BC, not equal to B or C and such that AD is not an altitude of triangle △ABC. Let B1 be the base (foot) of the altitude in the triangle △ABD through B and let C1 be the base of the altitude in the triangle △ACD through C. Then, if D is strictly between B and C, one and only one of B1 or C1 lies inside △ABC and it can be assumed without loss of generality that B1 does. This case is depicted in the adjacent diagram. If D lies outside of segment BC, then neither B1 nor C1 lies inside the triangle. ∠ DB1B, ∠ DC1C are right angles, while the angles ∠ B1DB, ∠ C1DC are congruent if D lies on the segment BC (that is, between B and C) and they are identical in the other cases being considered, so the triangles △DB1B, △DC1C are similar (AAA), which implies that: |BD||CD|=|BB1||CC1|=|AB|sin⁡∠BAD|AC|sin⁡∠CAD.|BD|/|CD|=|BB_1|/|CC_1|=|AB|sin/|AC|sin. If D is the foot of an altitude, then, |BD||AB|=sin⁡∠BADand|CD||AC|=sin⁡∠DAC,|BD|/|AB|=sin∠and|CD|/|AC|=sin∠, and the generalized form follows. Proof using triangle
