triangles: Animated illustration of the angle bisector theorem. As shown in the accompanying animation, the theorem can be proved using similar triangles. In the version illustrated here, the triangle △ABC gets reflected across a line that is perpendicular to the angle bisector AD, resulting in the triangle △AB2C2_2C_2 with bisector AD2_2. The fact that the bisection-produced angles ∠BAD and ∠CAD are equal means that BAC2_2 and CAB2_2 are straight lines. This allows the construction of triangle △C2BC_2BC that is similar to △ABD. Because the ratios between corresponding sides of similar triangles are all equal, it follows that |AB|/|AC2|=|BD|/|CD||AB|/|AC_2|=|BD|/|CD|. However, AC2_2 was constructed as a reflection of the line AC, and so those two lines are of equal length. Therefore, |AB|/|AC|=|BD|/|CD||AB|/|AC|=|BD|/|CD|, yielding the result stated by the theorem. Proof using Law of
