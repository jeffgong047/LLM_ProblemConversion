case: Suppose F:R2→R:ℝ^2→ℝ is a continuously differentiable function defining a curve F(r)=F(x,y)=0(𝐫)=F(x,y)=0. Let (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) be a point on the curve. The statement of the theorem above can be rewritten for this simple case as follows: Theorem — If ∂F∂y|(x0,y0)≠0./|_(x_0,y_0)≠0 then in a neighbourhood of the point (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) we can write y=f(x)=f(x), where f is a real function. Proof. Since F is differentiable we write the differential of F through partial derivatives: dF=grad⁡F⋅dr=∂F∂xdx+∂F∂ydy.dF=gradF·d𝐫=/dx+/dy. Since we are restricted to movement on the curve dF=0dF=0 and by assumption ∂F∂y≠0≠0 around the point (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) (since ∂F∂y is continuous at (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) and ∂F∂y|(x0,y0)≠0.|_(x_0,y_0)≠0). Therefore we have a first-order ordinary differential equation: ∂xFdx+∂yFdy=0,y(x0)=y0∂_xFdx+∂_yFdy=0,(x_0)=y_0 Now we are looking for a solution to this ODE in an open interval around the point (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) for which, at every point in it, ∂yF≠0∂_yF≠0. Since F is continuously differentiable and from the assumption we have |∂xF|<∞,|∂yF|<∞,∂yF≠0.|∂_xF|<∞,|∂_yF|<∞,∂_yF≠0. From this we know that ∂xF∂yF∂_xF∂_yF is continuous and bounded on both ends. From here we know that −∂xF∂yF-∂_xF∂_yF is Lipschitz continuous in both x and y. Therefore, by Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, there exists unique y(x) that is the solution to the given ODE with the initial conditions. Q.E.D. The circle
