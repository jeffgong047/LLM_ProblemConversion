coordinates: Suppose we have an m-dimensional space, parametrised by a set of coordinates (x1,…,xm)(x_1,…,x_m). We can introduce a new coordinate system (x1′,…,xm′)(x'_1,…,x'_m) by supplying m functions h1…hm_1_m each being continuously differentiable. These functions allow us to calculate the new coordinates (x1′,…,xm′)(x'_1,…,x'_m) of a point, given the point's old coordinates (x1,…,xm)(x_1,…,x_m) using x1′=h1(x1,…,xm),…,xm′=hm(x1,…,xm)'_1=h_1(x_1,…,x_m),…,x'_m=h_m(x_1,…,x_m). One might want to verify if the opposite is possible: given coordinates (x1′,…,xm′)(x'_1,…,x'_m), can we 'go back' and calculate the same point's original coordinates (x1,…,xm)(x_1,…,x_m)? The implicit function theorem will provide an answer to this question. The (new and old) coordinates (x1′,…,xm′,x1,…,xm)(x'_1,…,x'_m,x_1,…,x_m) are related by f = 0, with f(x1′,…,xm′,x1,…,xm)=(h1(x1,…,xm)−x1′,…,hm(x1,…,xm)−xm′).(x'_1,…,x'_m,x_1,…,x_m)=(h_1(x_1,…,x_m)-x'_1,…,h_m(x_1,…,x_m)-x'_m). Now the Jacobian matrix of f at a certain point (a, b) [ where a=(x1′,…,xm′),b=(x1,…,xm)=(x'_1,…,x'_m),b=(x_1,…,x_m) ] is given by (Df)(a,b)=[−1⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯−1|∂h1∂x1(b)⋯∂h1∂xm(b)⋮⋱⋮∂hm∂x1(b)⋯∂hm∂xm(b)]=[−Im|J].(Df)(a,b)=[-1 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 ⋯ -1|_1/_1(b) ⋯ _1/_m(b) ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ _m/_1(b) ⋯ _m/_m(b) .]=[-I_m|J]. where Im denotes the m × m identity matrix, and J is the m × m matrix of partial derivatives, evaluated at (a, b). (In the above, these blocks were denoted by X and Y. As it happens, in this particular application of the theorem, neither matrix depends on a.) The implicit function theorem now states that we can locally express (x1,…,xm)(x_1,…,x_m) as a function of (x1′,…,xm′)(x'_1,…,x'_m) if J is invertible. Demanding J is invertible is equivalent to det J ≠ 0, thus we see that we can go back from the primed to the unprimed coordinates if the determinant of the Jacobian J is non-zero. This statement is also known as the inverse function theorem. Example: polar
