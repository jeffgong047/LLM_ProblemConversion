example: The unit circle can be specified as the level curve f(x, y) = 1 of the function f(x, y) = x2 + y2. Around point A, y can be expressed as a function y(x). In this example this function can be written explicitly as g1(x)=1−x2;_1(x)=√(1-x^2); in many cases no such explicit expression exists, but one can still refer to the implicit function y(x). No such function exists around point B. If we define the function f(x, y) = x2 + y2, then the equation f(x, y) = 1 cuts out the unit circle as the level set {(x, y) | f(x, y) = 1}. There is no way to represent the unit circle as the graph of a function of one variable y = g(x) because for each choice of x ∈ (−1, 1), there are two choices of y, namely ±1−x2±√(1-x^2). However, it is possible to represent part of the circle as the graph of a function of one variable. If we let g1(x)=1−x2_1(x)=√(1-x^2) for −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, then the graph of y = g1(x) provides the upper half of the circle. Similarly, if g2(x)=−1−x2_2(x)=-√(1-x^2), then the graph of y = g2(x) gives the lower half of the circle. The purpose of the implicit function theorem is to tell us that functions like g1(x) and g2(x) almost always exist, even in situations where we cannot write down explicit formulas. It guarantees that g1(x) and g2(x) are differentiable, and it even works in situations where we do not have a formula for f(x, y).
