version: Based on the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces, it is possible to extend the implicit function theorem to Banach space valued mappings.[5][6] Let X, Y, Z be Banach spaces. Let the mapping f : X × Y → Z be continuously Fréchet differentiable. If (x0,y0)∈X×Y(x_0,y_0), f(x0,y0)=0(x_0,y_0)=0, and y↦Df(x0,y0)(0,y)(x_0,y_0)(0,y) is a Banach space isomorphism from Y onto Z, then there exist neighbourhoods U of x0 and V of y0 and a Fréchet differentiable function g : U → V such that f(x, g(x)) = 0 and f(x, y) = 0 if and only if y = g(x), for all (x,y)∈U×V(x,y).
