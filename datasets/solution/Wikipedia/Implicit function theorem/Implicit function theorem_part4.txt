Definitions: Let f:Rn+m→Rm:ℝ^n+m→ℝ^m be a continuously differentiable function. We think of Rn+mℝ^n+m as the Cartesian product Rn×Rm,ℝ^n×ℝ^m, and we write a point of this product as (x,y)=(x1,…,xn,y1,…ym).(𝐱,𝐲)=(x_1,…,x_n,y_1,_m). Starting from the given function f, our goal is to construct a function g:Rn→Rm:ℝ^n→ℝ^m whose graph (x,g(x))(x,g(x)) is precisely the set of all (x,y)(x,y) such that f(x,y)=0(x,y)=0. As noted above, this may not always be possible. We will therefore fix a point (a,b)=(a1,…,an,b1,…,bm)(a,b)=(a_1,…,a_n,b_1,…,b_m) which satisfies f(a,b)=0(a,b)=0, and we will ask for a g that works near the point (a,b)(a,b). In other words, we want an open set U⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n containing aa, an open set V⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m containing bb, and a function g:U→V:U such that the graph of g satisfies the relation f=0=0 on U×V, and that no other points within U×V do so. In symbols, (x,g(x))∣x∈U=(x,y)∈U×V∣f(x,y)=0.{(𝐱,g(𝐱))|𝐱}={(𝐱,𝐲)(𝐱,𝐲)=0}. To state the implicit function theorem, we need the Jacobian matrix of f, which is the matrix of the partial derivatives of f. Abbreviating (a1,…,an,b1,…,bm)(a_1,…,a_n,b_1,…,b_m) to (a,b)(a,b), the Jacobian matrix is (Df)(a,b)=[∂f1∂x1(a,b)⋯∂f1∂xn(a,b)∂f1∂y1(a,b)⋯∂f1∂ym(a,b)⋮⋱⋮⋮⋱⋮∂fm∂x1(a,b)⋯∂fm∂xn(a,b)∂fm∂y1(a,b)⋯∂fm∂ym(a,b)]=[XY](Df)(𝐚,𝐛)=[[ _1/_1(𝐚,𝐛) ⋯ _1/_n(𝐚,𝐛) _1/_1(𝐚,𝐛) ⋯ _1/_m(𝐚,𝐛); ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮; _m/_1(𝐚,𝐛) ⋯ _m/_n(𝐚,𝐛) _m/_1(𝐚,𝐛) ⋯ _m/_m(𝐚,𝐛) ]]=[[ X Y ]] where X is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables xi_i and Y is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables yj_j. The implicit function theorem says that if Y is an invertible matrix, then there are U, V, and g as desired. Writing all the hypotheses together gives the following statement. Statement of the
