theorem: Let f:Rn+m→Rm:ℝ^n+m→ℝ^m be a continuously differentiable function, and let Rn+mℝ^n+m have coordinates (x,y)(x,y). Fix a point (a,b)=(a1,…,an,b1,…,bm)(a,b)=(a_1,…,a_n,b_1,…,b_m) with f(a,b)=0(a,b)=0, where 0∈Rm0∈ℝ^m is the zero vector. If the Jacobian matrix (this is the right-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section): Jf,y(a,b)=[∂fi∂yj(a,b)]_f,𝐲(𝐚,𝐛)=[_i/_j(𝐚,𝐛)] is invertible, then there exists an open set U⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n containing aa such that there exists a unique continuously differentiable function g:U→Rm:U→ℝ^m such that g(a)=b(𝐚)=𝐛, and f(x,g(x))=0forallx∈U(𝐱,g(𝐱))=0 forall 𝐱. Moreover, denoting the left-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section as: Jf,x(a,b)=[∂fi∂xj(a,b)],_f,𝐱(𝐚,𝐛)=[_i/_j(𝐚,𝐛)], the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of g in U is given by the matrix product:[3] [∂gi∂xj(x)]m×n=−[Jf,y(x,g(x))]m×m−1[Jf,x(x,g(x))]m×n[_i/_j(𝐱)]_m=-[J_f,𝐲(𝐱,g(𝐱))]_m^-1 [J_f,𝐱(𝐱,g(𝐱))]_m Higher
