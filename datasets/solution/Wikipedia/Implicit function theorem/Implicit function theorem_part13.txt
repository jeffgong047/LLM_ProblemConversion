functions: Various forms of the implicit function theorem exist for the case when the function f is not differentiable. It is standard that local strict monotonicity suffices in one dimension.[7] The following more general form was proven by Kumagai based on an observation by Jittorntrum.[8][9] Consider a continuous function f:Rn×Rm→Rn:ℝ^n×ℝ^m→ℝ^n such that f(x0,y0)=0(x_0,y_0)=0. If there exist open neighbourhoods A⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n and B⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m of x0 and y0, respectively, such that, for all y in B, f(⋅,y):A→Rn(·,y):A→ℝ^n is locally one-to-one then there exist open neighbourhoods A0⊂Rn_0⊂ℝ^n and B0⊂Rm_0⊂ℝ^m of x0 and y0, such that, for all y∈B0_0, the equation f(x, y) = 0 has a unique solution x=g(y)∈A0,=g(y)_0, where g is a continuous function from B0 into A0.
