example: Let us go back to the example of the unit circle. In this case n = m = 1 and f(x,y)=x2+y2−1(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1. The matrix of partial derivatives is just a 1 × 2 matrix, given by (Df)(a,b)=[∂f∂x(a,b)∂f∂y(a,b)]=[2a2b](Df)(a,b)=[ (a,b) (a,b) ]=[ 2a 2b ] Thus, here, the Y in the statement of the theorem is just the number 2b; the linear map defined by it is invertible if and only if b ≠ 0. By the implicit function theorem we see that we can locally write the circle in the form y = g(x) for all points where y ≠ 0. For (±1, 0) we run into trouble, as noted before. The implicit function theorem may still be applied to these two points, by writing x as a function of y, that is, x=h(y)=h(y); now the graph of the function will be (h(y),y)(h(y),y), since where b = 0 we have a = 1, and the conditions to locally express the function in this form are satisfied. The implicit derivative of y with respect to x, and that of x with respect to y, can be found by totally differentiating the implicit function x2+y2−1^2+y^2-1 and equating to 0: 2xdx+2ydy=0,2x dx+2y dy=0, giving dydx=−xydy/dx=-x/y and dxdy=−yx.dx/dy=-y/x.
