coordinates: As a simple application of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by polar coordinates (R, θ). We can go to a new coordinate system (cartesian coordinates) by defining functions x(R, θ) = R cos(θ) and y(R, θ) = R sin(θ). This makes it possible given any point (R, θ) to find corresponding Cartesian coordinates (x, y). When can we go back and convert Cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have det J ≠ 0, with J=[∂x(R,θ)∂R∂x(R,θ)∂θ∂y(R,θ)∂R∂y(R,θ)∂θ]=[cos⁡θ−Rsin⁡θsin⁡θRcos⁡θ].=[ (R,θ)/ (R,θ)/∂θ; (R,θ)/ (R,θ)/∂θ; ]=[ cosθ -Rsinθ; sinθ Rcosθ ]. Since det J = R, conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if R ≠ 0. So it remains to check the case R = 0. It is easy to see that in case R = 0, our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.
