A convex set S (in pink), a supporting hyperplane of S (the dashed line), and the supporting half-space delimited by the hyperplane which contains S (in light blue). In geometry, a supporting hyperplane of a set S in Euclidean space Rn‚Ñù^n is a hyperplane that has both of the following two properties:[1] S is entirely contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by the hyperplane, S has at least one boundary-point on the hyperplane. Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the points within the hyperplane. Supporting hyperplane
