results: Kolmogorov (1933) showed that when F is continuous, the supremum suptGn(t)sup_tG_n(t) and supremum of absolute value, supt|Gn(t)|sup_t|G_n(t)| converges in distribution to the laws of the same functionals of the Brownian bridge B(t), see the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test. In 1949 Doob asked whether the convergence in distribution held for more general functionals, thus formulating a problem of weak convergence of random functions in a suitable function space.[3] In 1952 Donsker stated and proved (not quite correctly)[4] a general extension for the Doob‚ÄìKolmogorov heuristic approach. In the original paper, Donsker proved that the convergence in law of Gn to the Brownian bridge holds for Uniform[0,1] distributions with respect to uniform convergence in t over the interval [0,1].[2] However Donsker's formulation was not quite correct because of the problem of measurability of the functionals of discontinuous processes. In 1956 Skorokhod and Kolmogorov defined a separable metric d, called the Skorokhod metric, on the space of c√†dl√†g functions on [0,1], such that convergence for d to a continuous function is equivalent to convergence for the sup norm, and showed that Gn converges in law in D[0,1]ùíü[0,1] to the Brownian bridge. Later Dudley reformulated Donsker's result to avoid the problem of measurability and the need of the Skorokhod metric. One can prove[4] that there exist Xi, iid uniform in [0,1] and a sequence of sample-continuous Brownian bridges Bn, such that ‚ÄñGn‚àíBn‚Äñ‚àûG_n-B_n_‚àû is measurable and converges in probability to 0. An improved version of this result, providing more detail on the rate of convergence, is the Koml√≥s‚ÄìMajor‚ÄìTusn√°dy approximation. See
