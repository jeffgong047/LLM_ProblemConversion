Donsker's invariance principle for simple random walk on Zℤ. In probability theory, Donsker's theorem (also known as Donsker's invariance principle, or the functional central limit theorem), named after Monroe D. Donsker, is a functional extension of the central limit theorem. Let X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Let Sn:=∑i=1nXi_n:=∑_i=1^nX_i. The stochastic process S:=(Sn)n∈N:=(S_n)_n∈ℕ is known as a random walk. Define the diffusively rescaled random walk (partial-sum process) by W(n)(t):=S⌊nt⌋n,t∈[0,1].^(n)(t):=S_⌋/√(n),∈[0,1]. The central limit theorem asserts that W(n)(1)^(n)(1) converges in distribution to a standard Gaussian random variable W(1)(1) as n→∞→∞. Donsker's invariance principle[1][2] extends this convergence to the whole function W(n):=(W(n)(t))t∈[0,1]^(n):=(W^(n)(t))_t∈[0,1]. More precisely, in its modern form, Donsker's invariance principle states that: As random variables taking values in the Skorokhod space D[0,1]𝒟[0,1], the random function W(n)^(n) converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion W:=(W(t))t∈[0,1]:=(W(t))_t∈[0,1] as n→∞.→∞.
