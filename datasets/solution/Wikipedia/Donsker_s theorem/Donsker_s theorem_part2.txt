statement: Let Fn be the empirical distribution function of the sequence of i.i.d. random variables X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… with distribution function F. Define the centered and scaled version of Fn by Gn(x)=n(Fn(x)−F(x))_n(x)=√(n)(F_n(x)-F(x)) indexed by x ∈ R. By the classical central limit theorem, for fixed x, the random variable Gn(x) converges in distribution to a Gaussian (normal) random variable G(x) with zero mean and variance F(x)(1 − F(x)) as the sample size n grows. Theorem (Donsker, Skorokhod, Kolmogorov) The sequence of Gn(x), as random elements of the Skorokhod space D(−∞,∞)𝒟(-∞,∞), converges in distribution to a Gaussian process G with zero mean and covariance given by cov⁡[G(s),G(t)]=E[G(s)G(t)]=minF(s),F(t)−F(s)cov[G(s),G(t)]=E[G(s)G(t)]=min{F(s),F(t)}-F(s)F(t).F(t). The process G(x) can be written as B(F(x)) where B is a standard Brownian bridge on the unit interval. History and related
