Example: Consider the vector field given by x˙=−x+x2y,y˙=xy2ẋ=-x+x^2y, ẏ=xy^2 In this case, A = -1 and X(0, y) = Y(0, y) = 0 for all y, so this system satisfy the hypothesis of Lyapunov-Malkin theorem. The figure below shows a plot of this vector field along with some trajectories that pass near (0,0). As expected by the theorem, it can be seen that trajectories in the neighborhood of (0,0) converges to a point in the form (0,c).
