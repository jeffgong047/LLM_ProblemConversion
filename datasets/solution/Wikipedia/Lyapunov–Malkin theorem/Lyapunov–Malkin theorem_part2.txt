Theorem: In the system of differential equations, x˙=Ax+X(x,y),y˙=Y(x,y)ẋ=Ax+X(x,y), ẏ=Y(x,y) where x∈Rm∈ℝ^m and y∈Rn∈ℝ^n are components of the system state, A∈Rm×m∈ℝ^m is a matrix that represents the linear dynamics of x, and X:Rm×Rn→Rm:ℝ^m×ℝ^n→ℝ^m and Y:Rm×Rn→Rn:ℝ^m×ℝ^n→ℝ^n represent higher-order nonlinear terms. If all eigenvalues of the matrix A have negative real parts, and X(x, y), Y(x, y) vanish when x = 0, then the solution x = 0, y = 0 of this system is stable with respect to (x, y) and asymptotically stable with respect to x. If a solution (x(t), y(t)) is close enough to the solution x = 0, y = 0, then limt→∞x(t)=0,limt→∞y(t)=c.lim_t→∞x(t)=0, lim_t→∞y(t)=c.
