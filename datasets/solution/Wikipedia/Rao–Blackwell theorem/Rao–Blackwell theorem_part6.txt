Properties: The improved estimator is unbiased if and only if the original estimator is unbiased, as may be seen at once by using the law of total expectation. The theorem holds regardless of whether biased or unbiased estimators are used. The theorem seems very weak: it says only that the Raoâ€“Blackwell estimator is no worse than the original estimator. In practice, however, the improvement is often enormous.[5]
