Applications: Serre's theorem on a semisimple Lie algebra uses a free Lie algebra to construct a semisimple algebra out of generators and relations. The Milnor invariants of a link group are related to the free Lie algebra on the components of the link, as discussed in that article. See also Lie operad for the use of a free Lie algebra in the construction of the operad. See
