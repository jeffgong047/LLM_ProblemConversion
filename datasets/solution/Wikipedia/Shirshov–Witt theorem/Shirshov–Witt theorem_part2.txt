Definition: The definition of the free Lie algebra generated by a set X is as follows: Let X be a set and i:X→L a morphism of sets (function) from X into a Lie algebra L. The Lie algebra L is called free on X if i is the universal morphism; that is, if for any Lie algebra A with a morphism of sets f:X→A, there is a unique Lie algebra morphism g:L→A such that f=g∘i=g. Given a set X, one can show that there exists a unique free Lie algebra L(X)(X) generated by X. In the language of category theory, the functor sending a set X to the Lie algebra generated by X is the free functor from the category of sets to the category of Lie algebras. That is, it is left adjoint to the forgetful functor. The free Lie algebra on a set X is naturally graded. The 1-graded component of the free Lie algebra is just the free vector space on that set. One can alternatively define a free Lie algebra on a vector space V as left adjoint to the forgetful functor from Lie algebras over a field K to vector spaces over the field K – forgetting the Lie algebra structure, but remembering the vector space structure.
