algebra: The universal enveloping algebra of a free Lie algebra on a set X is the free associative algebra generated by X. By the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem it is the "same size" as the symmetric algebra of the free Lie algebra (meaning that if both sides are graded by giving elements of X degree 1 then they are isomorphic as graded vector spaces). This can be used to describe the dimension of the piece of the free Lie algebra of any given degree. Ernst Witt showed that the number of basic commutators of degree k in the free Lie algebra on an m-element set is given by the necklace polynomial: Mm(k)=1k∑d|kμ(d)⋅mk/d,_m(k)=1/k∑_d|kμ(d)^k/d, where μμ is the Möbius function. The graded dual of the universal enveloping algebra of a free Lie algebra on a finite set is the shuffle algebra. This essentially follows because universal enveloping algebras have the structure of a Hopf algebra, and the shuffle product describes the action of comultiplication in this algebra. See tensor algebra for a detailed exposition of the inter-relation between the shuffle product and comultiplication. Hall
