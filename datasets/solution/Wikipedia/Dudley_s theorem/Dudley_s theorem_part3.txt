Statement: Let (Xt)t∈T be a Gaussian process and let dX be the pseudometric on T defined by dX(s,t)=E[|Xs−Xt|2]._X(s,t)=√(𝐄[|X_s-X_t|^2]). For ε > 0, denote by N(T, dX; ε) the entropy number, i.e. the minimal number of (open) dX-balls of radius ε required to cover T. Then E[supt∈TXt]≤24∫0+∞log⁡N(T,dX;ε)dε.𝐄[sup_tX_t]≤24∫_0^+∞√((T,d_X;ε)) dε. Furthermore, if the entropy integral on the right-hand side converges, then X has a version with almost all sample path bounded and (uniformly) continuous on (T, dX).
