Concept in probability theory
In probability theory, Dudley's theorem is a result relating the expected upper bound and regularity properties of a Gaussian process to its entropy and covariance structure.

History[edit]
The result was first stated and proved by V. N. Sudakov, as pointed out in a paper by Richard M. Dudley.[1] Dudley had earlier credited Volker Strassen with making the connection between entropy and regularity.

Statement[edit]
Let (Xt)t∈T be a Gaussian process and let dX be the pseudometric on T defined by

dX(s,t)=E[|Xs−Xt|2]._X(s,t)=√(𝐄[|X_s-X_t|^2]). 
For ε > 0, denote by N(T, dX; ε) the entropy number, i.e. the minimal number of (open) dX-balls of radius ε required to cover T.  Then

E[supt∈TXt]≤24∫0+∞log⁡N(T,dX;ε)dε.𝐄[sup_tX_t]≤24∫_0^+∞√((T,d_X;ε)) dε.
Furthermore, if the entropy integral on the right-hand side converges, then X has a version with almost all sample path bounded and (uniformly) continuous on (T, dX).
