Triangularization: Sometimes the theorem is also referred to as the Lie–Kolchin triangularization theorem because by induction it implies that with respect to a suitable basis of V the image ρ(G)ρ(G) has a triangular shape; in other words, the image group ρ(G)ρ(G) is conjugate in GL(n,K) (where n = dim V) to a subgroup of the group T of upper triangular matrices, the standard Borel subgroup of GL(n,K): the image is simultaneously triangularizable. The theorem applies in particular to a Borel subgroup of a semisimple linear algebraic group G.
