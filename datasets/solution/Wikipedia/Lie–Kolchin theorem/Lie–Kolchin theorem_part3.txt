Counter-example: If the field K is not algebraically closed, the theorem can fail. The standard unit circle, viewed as the set of complex numbers x+iy∈C∣x2+y2=1{x+iy∈ℂ^2+y^2=1} of absolute value one is a one-dimensional commutative (and therefore solvable) linear algebraic group over the real numbers which has a two-dimensional representation into the special orthogonal group SO(2) without an invariant (real) line. Here the image ρ(z)ρ(z) of z=x+iy=x+iy is the orthogonal matrix (xy−yx).[ x y; -y x ].
