In analytic number theory the Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem states that there are infinitely many prime numbers of the form a2+b4^2+b^4. The first few such primes are

2, 5, 17, 37, 41, 97, 101, 137, 181, 197, 241, 257, 277, 281, 337, 401, 457, 577, 617, 641, 661, 677, 757, 769, 821, 857, 881, 977, … (sequence A028916 in the OEIS).
The difficulty in this statement lies in the very sparse nature of this sequence: the number of integers of the form a2+b4^2+b^4 less than X is roughly of the order X3/4^3/4.


History[edit]
The theorem was proved in 1997 by John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec.[1] Iwaniec was awarded the 2001 Ostrowski Prize in part for his contributions to this work.[2]

Refinements[edit]
The theorem was refined by D.R. Heath-Brown and Xiannan Li in 2017.[3] In particular, they proved that the polynomial a2+b4^2+b^4 represents infinitely many primes when the variable b is also required to be prime. Namely, if f(n)(n) is the prime numbers less than n in the form a2+b4,^2+b^4, then
f(n)∼vx3/4log⁡x(n)x^3/4/logx
where
v=2πΓ(5/4)Γ(7/4)∏p≡1mod4p−2p−1∏p≡3mod4pp−1.=2√(π)Γ(5/4)/Γ(7/4)∏_p≡14p-2/p-1∏_p≡34p/p-1.

Special case[edit]
When b = 1, the Friedlander–Iwaniec primes have the form a2+1^2+1, forming the set

2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, 1601, 2917, 3137, 4357, 5477, 7057, 8101, 8837, 12101, 13457, 14401, 15377, … (sequence A002496 in the OEIS).
It is conjectured  (one of Landau's problems) that this set is infinite. However, this is not implied by the Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem.
