case: When b = 1, the Friedlander–Iwaniec primes have the form a2+1^2+1, forming the set 2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, 1601, 2917, 3137, 4357, 5477, 7057, 8101, 8837, 12101, 13457, 14401, 15377, … (sequence A002496 in the OEIS). It is conjectured (one of Landau's problems) that this set is infinite. However, this is not implied by the Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem.
