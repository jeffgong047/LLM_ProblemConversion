Refinements: The theorem was refined by D.R. Heath-Brown and Xiannan Li in 2017.[3] In particular, they proved that the polynomial a2+b4^2+b^4 represents infinitely many primes when the variable b is also required to be prime. Namely, if f(n)(n) is the prime numbers less than n in the form a2+b4,^2+b^4, then f(n)∼vx3/4log⁡x(n)x^3/4/logx where v=2πΓ(5/4)Γ(7/4)∏p≡1mod4p−2p−1∏p≡3mod4pp−1.=2√(π)Γ(5/4)/Γ(7/4)∏_p≡14p-2/p-1∏_p≡34p/p-1.
