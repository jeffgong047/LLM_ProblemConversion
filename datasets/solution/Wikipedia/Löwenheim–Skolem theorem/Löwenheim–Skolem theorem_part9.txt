part: For each first-order σσ-formula φ(y,x1,…,xn),φ(y,x_1,…,x_n) , the axiom of choice implies the existence of a function fφ:Mn→M_φ:M^n such that, for all a1,…,an∈M_1,…,a_n, either M⊨φ(fφ(a1,…,an),a1,…,an)φ(f_φ(a_1,…,a_n),a_1,…,a_n) or M⊨¬∃yφ(y,a1,…,an). φ(y,a_1,…,a_n) . Applying the axiom of choice again we get a function from the first-order formulas φφ to such functions fφ._φ . The family of functions fφ_φ gives rise to a preclosure operator F on the power set of M F(A)=fφ(a1,…,an)∈M∣φ∈σ;a1,…,an∈A(A)={f_φ(a_1,…,a_n)|φ∈σ; a_1,…,a_n} for A⊆M. . Iterating F countably many times results in a closure operator Fω.^ω . Taking an arbitrary subset A⊆M such that |A|=κ|=κ, and having defined N=Fω(A),=F^ω(A) , one can see that also |N|=κ.|=κ . Then N is an elementary substructure of M by the Tarski–Vaught test. The trick used in this proof is essentially due to Skolem, who introduced function symbols for the Skolem functions fφ_φ into the language. One could also define the fφ_φ as partial functions such that fφ_φ is defined if and only if M⊨∃yφ(y,a1,…,an). φ(y,a_1,…,a_n) . The only important point is that F is a preclosure operator such that F(A)(A) contains a solution for every formula with parameters in A which has a solution in M and that |F(A)|≤|A|+|σ|+ℵ0.(A)|≤|+|σ|+ℵ_0 .
