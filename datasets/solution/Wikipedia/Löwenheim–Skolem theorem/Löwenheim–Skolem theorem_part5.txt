Signatures: A signature consists of a set of function symbols Sfunc, a set of relation symbols Srel, and a function ar:Sfunc∪Srel→N0ar:S_func_rel→ℕ_0 representing the arity of function and relation symbols. (A nullary function symbol is called a constant symbol.) In the context of first-order logic, a signature is sometimes called a language. It is called countable if the set of function and relation symbols in it is countable, and in general the cardinality of a signature is the cardinality of the set of all the symbols it contains. A first-order theory consists of a fixed signature and a fixed set of sentences (formulas with no free variables) in that signature.[3]: 40 Theories are often specified by giving a list of axioms that generate the theory, or by giving a structure and taking the theory to consist of the sentences satisfied by the structure.
