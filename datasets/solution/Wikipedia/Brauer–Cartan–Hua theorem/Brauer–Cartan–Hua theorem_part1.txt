Result pertaining to division rings In abstract algebra, the Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem (named after Richard Brauer, Élie Cartan, and Hua Luogeng) is a theorem pertaining to division rings. It says that given two division rings K ⊆ D such that xKx−1 is contained in K for every x not equal to 0 in D, either K is contained in the center of D, or K = D. In other words, if the unit group of K is a normal subgroup of the unit group of D, then either K = D or K is central (Lam 2001, p. 211).
