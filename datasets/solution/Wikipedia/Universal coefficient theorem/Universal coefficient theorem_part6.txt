sequence: There is a generalization of the universal coefficient theorem for (co)homology with twisted coefficients. For cohomology we have E2p,q=ExtRq(Hp(C∗),G)⇒Hp+q(C∗;G)_2^p,q=Ext_R^q(H_p(C_*),G)^p+q(C_*;G) Where R is a ring with unit, C∗_* is a chain complex of free modules over R, G is any (R,S)(R,S)-bimodule for some ring with a unit S, Ext is the Ext group. The differential dr^r has degree (1−r,r)(1-r,r). Similarly for homology Ep,q2=TorqR(Hp(C∗),G)⇒H∗(C∗;G)_p,q^2=Tor_q^R(H_p(C_*),G)_*(C_*;G) for Tor the Tor group and the differential dr_r having degree (r−1,−r)(r-1,-r).
