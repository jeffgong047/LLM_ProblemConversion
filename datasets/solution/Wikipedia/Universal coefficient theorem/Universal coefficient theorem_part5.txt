Corollaries: A special case of the theorem is computing integral cohomology. For a finite CW complex X, Hi(X; Z) is finitely generated, and so we have the following decomposition. Hi(X;Z)≅Zβi(X)⊕Ti,_i(X;𝐙)≅𝐙^β_i(X)_i, where βi(X) are the Betti numbers of X and Ti_i is the torsion part of Hi_i. One may check that Hom⁡(Hi(X),Z)≅Hom⁡(Zβi(X),Z)⊕Hom⁡(Ti,Z)≅Zβi(X),Hom(H_i(X),𝐙)≅Hom(𝐙^β_i(X),𝐙)⊕Hom(T_i,𝐙)≅𝐙^β_i(X), and Ext⁡(Hi(X),Z)≅Ext⁡(Zβi(X),Z)⊕Ext⁡(Ti,Z)≅Ti.Ext(H_i(X),𝐙)≅Ext(𝐙^β_i(X),𝐙)⊕Ext(T_i,𝐙)_i. This gives the following statement for integral cohomology: Hi(X;Z)≅Zβi(X)⊕Ti−1.^i(X;𝐙)≅𝐙^β_i(X)_i-1. For X an orientable, closed, and connected n-manifold, this corollary coupled with Poincaré duality gives that βi(X) = βn−i(X). Universal coefficient spectral
