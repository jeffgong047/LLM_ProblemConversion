space: Let X = Pn(R), the real projective space. We compute the singular cohomology of X with coefficients in R = Z/2Z. Knowing that the integer homology is given by: Hi(X;Z)=Zi=0ori=nodd,Z/2Z0<i<n,iodd,0otherwise._i(X;𝐙)=𝐙 i=0ori=nodd, 𝐙/2𝐙 0<i<n,ı{odd, 0 otherwise. We have Ext(R, R) = R, Ext(Z, R) = 0, so that the above exact sequences yield ∀i=0,…,n:Hi(X;R)=R.=0,…,n: ^̋i(X;R)=R. In fact the total cohomology ring structure is H∗(X;R)=R[w]/⟨wn+1⟩.^*(X;R)=R[w]/^n+1⟩.
