cohomology: Let G be a module over a principal ideal domain R (e.g., Z or a field.) There is also a universal coefficient theorem for cohomology involving the Ext functor, which asserts that there is a natural short exact sequence 0→ExtR1⁡(Hi−1(X;R),G)→Hi(X;G)→hHomR⁡(Hi(X;R),G)→0.0→Ext_R^1(H_i-1(X;R),G)^i(X;G) h→ Hom_R(H_i(X;R),G)→0. As in the homology case, the sequence splits, though not naturally. In fact, suppose Hi(X;G)=ker⁡∂i⊗G/im⁡∂i+1⊗G_i(X;G)=∂_i/im∂_i+1 and define: H∗(X;G)=ker⁡(Hom⁡(∂,G))/im⁡(Hom⁡(∂,G)).^*(X;G)=(Hom(∂,G))/im(Hom(∂,G)). Then h above is the canonical map: h([f])([x])=f(x).([f])([x])=f(x). An alternative point-of-view can be based on representing cohomology via Eilenberg–MacLane space where the map h takes a homotopy class of maps from X to K(G, i) to the corresponding homomorphism induced in homology. Thus, the Eilenberg–MacLane space is a weak right adjoint to the homology functor.[1] Example: mod 2 cohomology of the real projective
