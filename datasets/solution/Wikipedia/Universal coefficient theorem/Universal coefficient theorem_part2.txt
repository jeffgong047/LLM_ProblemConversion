case: Consider the tensor product of modules Hi(X; Z) ⊗ A. The theorem states there is a short exact sequence involving the Tor functor 0→Hi(X;Z)⊗A→μHi(X;A)→Tor1⁡(Hi−1(X;Z),A)→0.0_i(X;𝐙) μ→ H_i(X;A)→Tor_1(H_i-1(X;𝐙),A)→0. Furthermore, this sequence splits, though not naturally. Here μ is the map induced by the bilinear map Hi(X; Z) × A → Hi(X; A). If the coefficient ring A is Z/pZ, this is a special case of the Bockstein spectral sequence. Universal coefficient theorem for
