postulates: The laws of probability derivable from these postulates are the following.[8] Let A∣B be the plausibility of the proposition A given B satisfying Cox's postulates. Then there is a function w mapping plausibilities to interval [0,1] and a positive number m such that Certainty is represented by w(A∣B)=1.(A)=1. wm(A|B)+wm(notA∣B)=1.^m(A|B)+w^m(notA)=1. w(AB∣C)=w(A∣C)w(B∣AC)=w(B∣C)w(A∣BC).(AB)=w(A)w(B)=w(B)w(A). It is important to note that the postulates imply only these general properties. We may recover the usual laws of probability by setting a new function, conventionally denoted P or Pr, equal to wm^m. Then we obtain the laws of probability in a more familiar form: Certain truth is represented by Pr(A∣B)=1(A)=1, and certain falsehood by Pr(A∣B)=0.(A)=0. Pr(A∣B)+Pr(notA∣B)=1.(A)+(notA)=1. Pr(AB∣C)=Pr(A∣C)Pr(B∣AC)=Pr(B∣C)Pr(A∣BC).(AB)=(A)(B)=(B)(A). Rule 2 is a rule for negation, and rule 3 is a rule for conjunction. Given that any proposition containing conjunction, disjunction, and negation can be equivalently rephrased using conjunction and negation alone (the conjunctive normal form), we can now handle any compound proposition. The laws thus derived yield finite additivity of probability, but not countable additivity. The measure-theoretic formulation of Kolmogorov assumes that a probability measure is countably additive. This slightly stronger condition is necessary for the proof of certain theorems.[citation needed] Interpretation and further
