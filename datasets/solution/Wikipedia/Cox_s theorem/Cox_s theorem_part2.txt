assumptions: Cox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions: Divisibility and comparability – The plausibility of a proposition is a real number and is dependent on information we have related to the proposition. Common sense – Plausibilities should vary sensibly with the assessment of plausibilities in the model. Consistency – If the plausibility of a proposition can be derived in many ways, all the results must be equal. The postulates as stated here are taken from Arnborg and Sjödin.[3][4][5] "Common sense" includes consistency with Aristotelian logic in the sense that logically equivalent propositions shall have the same plausibility. The postulates as originally stated by Cox were not mathematically rigorous (although more so than the informal description above), as noted by Halpern.[6][7] However it appears to be possible to augment them with various mathematical assumptions made either implicitly or explicitly by Cox to produce a valid proof. Cox's notation: The plausibility of a proposition A given some related information X is denoted by A∣X. Cox's postulates and functional equations are: The plausibility of the conjunction AB of two propositions A, B, given some related information X, is determined by the plausibility of A given X and that of B given AX. In form of a functional equation AB∣X=g(A∣X,B∣AX)=g(A,B) Because of the associative nature of the conjunction in propositional logic, the consistency with logic gives a functional equation saying that the function g is an associative binary operation. Additionally, Cox postulates the function g to be monotonic. All strictly increasing associative binary operations on the real numbers are isomorphic to multiplication of numbers in a subinterval of [0, +∞], which means that there is a monotonic function w mapping plausibilities to [0, +∞] such that w(AB∣X)=w(A∣X)w(B∣AX)(AB)=w(A)w(B) In case A given X is certain, we have AB∣X=B∣X=B and B∣AX=B∣X=B due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation then leads to w(B∣X)=w(A∣X)w(B∣X)(B)=w(A)w(B) This shall hold for any proposition B, which leads to w(A∣X)=1(A)=1 In case A given X is impossible, we have AB∣X=A∣X=A and A∣BX=A∣X=A due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation (with the A and B factors switched) then leads to w(A∣X)=w(B∣X)w(A∣X)(A)=w(B)w(A) This shall hold for any proposition B, which, without loss of generality, leads to a solution w(A∣X)=0(A)=0 Due to the requirement of monotonicity, this means that w maps plausibilities to interval [0, 1]. The plausibility of a proposition determines the plausibility of the proposition's negation. This postulates the existence of a function f such that w(notA∣X)=f(w(A∣X))(notA)=f(w(A)) Because "a double negative is an affirmative", consistency with logic gives a functional equation f(f(x))=x,(f(x))=x, saying that the function f is an involution, i.e., it is its own inverse. Furthermore, Cox postulates the function f to be monotonic. The above functional equations and consistency with logic imply that w(AB∣X)=w(A∣X)f(w(notB∣AX))=w(A∣X)f(w(AnotB∣X)w(A∣X))(AB)=w(A)f(w(notB))=w(A)f(w(AnotB)(A)) Since AB is logically equivalent to BA, we also get w(A∣X)f(w(AnotB∣X)w(A∣X))=w(B∣X)f(w(BnotA∣X)w(B∣X))(A)f(w(AnotB)(A))=w(B)f(w(BnotA)(B)) If, in particular, B=not(AD)=not(AD), then also AnotB=notBnotB=notB and BnotA=notAnotA=notA and we get w(AnotB∣X)=w(notB∣X)=f(w(B∣X))(AnotB)=w(notB)=f(w(B)) and w(BnotA∣X)=w(notA∣X)=f(w(A∣X))(BnotA)=w(notA)=f(w(A)) Abbreviating w(A∣X)=x(A)=x and w(B∣X)=y(B)=y we get the functional equation xf(f(y)x)=yf(f(x)y) f(f(y))=y f(f(x)) Implications of Cox's
