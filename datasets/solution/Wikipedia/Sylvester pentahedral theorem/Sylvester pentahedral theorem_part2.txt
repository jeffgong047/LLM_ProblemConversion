Invariants: Salmon (1860) and Clebsch (1861, 1861b) studied the ring of invariants of a quaternary cubic, which is a ring generated by invariants of degrees 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 100. The generators of degrees 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 generate a polynomial ring. The generator of degree 100 is a skew invariant, whose square is a polynomial in the other generators given explicitly by Salmon. Salmon also gave an explicit formula for the discriminant as a polynomial in the generators, though Edge (1980) pointed out that the formula has a widely copied misprint in it. Sylvester
