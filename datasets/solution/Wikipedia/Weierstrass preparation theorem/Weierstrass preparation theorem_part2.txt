functions: For one variable, the local form of an analytic function f(z) near 0 is zkh(z) where h(0) is not 0, and k is the order of the zero of f at 0. This is the result that the preparation theorem generalises. We pick out one variable z, which we may assume is first, and write our complex variables as (z, z2, ..., zn). A Weierstrass polynomial W(z) is zk + gk−1zk−1 + ... + g0 where gi(z2, ..., zn) is analytic and gi(0, ..., 0) = 0. Then the theorem states that for analytic functions f, if f(0, ...,0) = 0, and f(z, z2, ..., zn) as a power series has some term only involving z, we can write (locally near (0, ..., 0)) f(z, z2, ..., zn) = W(z)h(z, z2, ..., zn) with h analytic and h(0, ..., 0) not 0, and W a Weierstrass polynomial. This has the immediate consequence that the set of zeros of f, near (0, ..., 0), can be found by fixing any small values of z2, ..., zn and then solving the equation W(z)=0. The corresponding values of z form a number of continuously-varying branches, in number equal to the degree of W in z. In particular f cannot have an isolated zero. Division
