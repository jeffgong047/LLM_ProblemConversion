rings: There is an analogous result, also referred to as the Weierstrass preparation theorem, for the ring of formal power series over complete local rings A:[3] for any power series f=∑n=0∞antn∈A[[t]]=∑_n=0^∞a_nt^n[[t]] such that not all an_n are in the maximal ideal m𝔪 of A, there is a unique unit u in A[[t]][[t]] and a polynomial F of the form F=ts+bs−1ts−1+⋯+b0=t^s+b_s-1t^s-1+…+b_0 with bi∈m_i∈𝔪 (a so-called distinguished polynomial) such that f=uF.=uF. Since A[[t]][[t]] is again a complete local ring, the result can be iterated and therefore gives similar factorization results for formal power series in several variables. For example, this applies to the ring of integers in a p-adic field. In this case the theorem says that a power series f(z) can always be uniquely factored as πn·u(z)·p(z), where u(z) is a unit in the ring of power series, p(z) is a distinguished polynomial (monic, with the coefficients of the non-leading terms each in the maximal ideal), and π is a fixed uniformizer. An application of the Weierstrass preparation and division theorem for the ring Zp[[t]]𝐙_p[[t]] (also called Iwasawa algebra) occurs in Iwasawa theory in the description of finitely generated modules over this ring.[4] There exists a non-commutative version of Weierstrass division and preparation, with A being a not necessarily commutative ring, and with formal skew power series in place of formal power series.[5] Tate
