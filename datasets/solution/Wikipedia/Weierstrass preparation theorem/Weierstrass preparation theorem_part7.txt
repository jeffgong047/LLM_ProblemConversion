algebras: There is also a Weiertrass preparation theorem for Tate algebras Tn(k)=∑ν1,…,νn≥0aν1,…,νnX1ν1⋯Xnνn,|aν1,…,νn|→0forν1+⋯+νn→∞_n(k)={∑_ν_1,…,ν_n≥0a_ν_1,…,ν_nX_1^ν_1_n^ν_n,|a_ν_1,…,ν_n|→0forν_1+…+ν_n→∞} over a complete non-archimedean field k.[6] These algebras are the basic building blocks of rigid geometry. One application of this form of the Weierstrass preparation theorem is the fact that the rings Tn(k)_n(k) are Noetherian. See
