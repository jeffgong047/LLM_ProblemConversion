homothecies: The following proof[7] uses only notions of affine geometry, notably homothecies. Whether or not D, E, and F are collinear, there are three homothecies with centers D, E, F that respectively send B to C, C to A, and A to B. The composition of the three then is an element of the group of homothecy-translations that fixes B, so it is a homothecy with center B, possibly with ratio 1 (in which case it is the identity). This composition fixes the line DE if and only if F is collinear with D and E (since the first two homothecies certainly fix DE, and the third does so only if F lies on DE). Therefore D, E, and F are collinear if and only if this composition is the identity, which means that the magnitude of product of the three ratios is 1: DC→DB→×EA→EC→×FB→FA→=1,DC/DB×EA/EC×FB/FA=1, which is equivalent to the given equation.
