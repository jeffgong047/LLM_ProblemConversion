proof[4]: First, the sign of the left-hand side will be negative since either all three of the ratios are negative, the case where the line DEF misses the triangle (lower diagram), or one is negative and the other two are positive, the case where DEF crosses two sides of the triangle. (See Pasch's axiom.) To check the magnitude, construct perpendiculars from A, B, and C to the line DEF and let their lengths be a, b, and c respectively. Then by similar triangles it follows that |AF/FB| = |a/b|, |BD/DC| = |b/c|, and |CE/EA| = |c/a|. So |AFFB|⋅|BDDC|⋅|CEEA|=|ab⋅bc⋅ca|=1.(Magnitudeonly)|AF/FB|·|BD/DC|·|CE/EA|=|a/b·b/c·c/a|=1. (Magnitudeonly) For a simpler, if less symmetrical way to check the magnitude,[5] draw CK parallel to AB where DEF meets CK at K. Then by similar triangles |BDDC|=|BFCK|,|AEEC|=|AFCK||BD/DC|=|BF/CK|, |AE/EC|=|AF/CK| and the result follows by eliminating CK from these equations. The converse follows as a corollary.[6] Let D, E, and F be given on the lines BC, AC, and AB so that the equation holds. Let F′ be the point where DE crosses AB. Then by the theorem, the equation also holds for D, E, and F′. Comparing the two, AFFB=AF′F′B.AF/FB=AF'/F'B. But at most one point can cut a segment in a given ratio so F=F′. A proof using
