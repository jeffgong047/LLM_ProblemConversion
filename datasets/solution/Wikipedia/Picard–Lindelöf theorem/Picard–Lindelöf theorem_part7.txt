interval: We wish to remove the dependence of the interval Ia on L. To this end, there is a corollary of the Banach fixed-point theorem: if an operator Tn is a contraction for some n in N, then T has a unique fixed point. Before applying this theorem to the Picard operator, recall the following: Lemma — ‖Γmφ1(t)−Γmφ2(t)‖≤Lm|t−t0|mm!‖φ1−φ2‖Γ^mφ_1(t)-Γ^mφ_2(t)≤L^m|t-t_0|^m/m!φ_1-φ_2 for all t∈[t0−α,t0+α]∈[t_0-α,t_0+α] Proof. Induction on m. For the base of the induction (m = 1) we have already seen this, so suppose the inequality holds for m − 1, then we have: ‖Γmφ1(t)−Γmφ2(t)‖=‖ΓΓm−1φ1(t)−ΓΓm−1φ2(t)‖≤|∫t0t‖f(s,Γm−1φ1(s))−f(s,Γm−1φ2(s))‖ds|≤L|∫t0t‖Γm−1φ1(s)−Γm−1φ2(s)‖ds|≤L|∫t0tLm−1|s−t0|m−1(m−1)!‖φ1−φ2‖ds|≤Lm|t−t0|mm!‖φ1−φ2‖.Γ^mφ_1(t)-Γ^mφ_2(t) =ΓΓ^m-1φ_1(t)-ΓΓ^m-1φ_2(t) ≤|∫_t_0^tf(s,Γ^m-1φ_1(s))-f(s,Γ^m-1φ_2(s))ds| |∫_t_0^tΓ^m-1φ_1(s)-Γ^m-1φ_2(s)ds| |∫_t_0^tL^m-1|s-t_0|^m-1/(m-1)!φ_1-φ_2ds| ≤L^m|t-t_0|^m/m!φ_1-φ_2. By taking a supremum over t∈[t0−α,t0+α]∈[t_0-α,t_0+α] we see that ‖Γmφ1−Γmφ2‖≤Lmαmm!‖φ1−φ2‖Γ^mφ_1-Γ^mφ_2≤L^mα^m/m!φ_1-φ_2. This inequality assures that for some large m, Lmαmm!<1,L^mα^m/m!<1, and hence Γm will be a contraction. So by the previous corollary Γ will have a unique fixed point. Finally, we have been able to optimize the interval of the solution by taking α = min{a, b/M}. In the end, this result shows the interval of definition of the solution does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of the field, but only on the interval of definition of the field and its maximum absolute value.
