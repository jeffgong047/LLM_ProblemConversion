Theorem: Let D⊆R×Rn⊆ℝ×ℝ^n be a closed rectangle with (t0,y0)∈int⁡D(t_0,y_0)∈intD, the interior of D. Let f:D→Rn:D→ℝ^n be a function that is continuous in t and Lipschitz continuous in y. Then, there exists some ε > 0 such that the initial value problem y′(t)=f(t,y(t)),y(t0)=y0.'(t)=f(t,y(t)),(t_0)=y_0. has a unique solution y(t)(t) on the interval [t0−ε,t0+ε][t_0-ε,t_0+ε].[1][2] Proof
