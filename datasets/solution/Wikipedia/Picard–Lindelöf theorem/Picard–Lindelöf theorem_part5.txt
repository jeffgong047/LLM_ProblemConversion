non-uniqueness: To understand uniqueness of solutions, consider the following examples.[3] A differential equation can possess a stationary point. For example, for the equation dy/dt = ay (a<0<0), the stationary solution is y(t) = 0, which is obtained for the initial condition y(0) = 0. Beginning with another initial condition y(0) = y0 ≠ 0, the solution y(t) tends toward the stationary point, but reaches it only at the limit of infinite time, so the uniqueness of solutions (over all finite times) is guaranteed. However, for an equation in which the stationary solution is reached after a finite time, the uniqueness fails. This happens for example for the equation dy/dt = ay 2/3, which has at least two solutions corresponding to the initial condition y(0) = 0 such as: y(t) = 0 or y(t)=(at3)3t<00t≥0,(t)=(at3)^3 t<0 0 t≥0, so the previous state of the system is not uniquely determined by its state after t = 0. The uniqueness theorem does not apply because the function f (y) = y 2/3 has an infinite slope at y = 0 and therefore is not Lipschitz continuous, violating the hypothesis of the theorem. Detailed
