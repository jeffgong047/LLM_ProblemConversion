theorems: The Picard–Lindelöf theorem shows that the solution exists and that it is unique. The Peano existence theorem shows only existence, not uniqueness, but it assumes only that f is continuous in y, instead of Lipschitz continuous. For example, the right-hand side of the equation dy/dt = y 1/3 with initial condition y(0) = 0 is continuous but not Lipschitz continuous. Indeed, rather than being unique, this equation has three solutions:[4] y(t)=0,y(t)=±(23t)32(t)=0,(t)=±(23t)^3/2. Even more general is Carathéodory's existence theorem, which proves existence (in a more general sense) under weaker conditions on f . Although these conditions are only sufficient, there also exist necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique, such as Okamura's theorem.[5] See
