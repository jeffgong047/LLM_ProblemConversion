proof: Let Ca,b=Ia(t0)¯×Bb(y0)¯_a,b=I_a(t_0)×B_b(y_0) where: Ia(t0)¯=[t0−a,t0+a]Bb(y0)¯=[y0−b,y0+b].I_a(t_0) =[t_0-a,t_0+a] B_b(y_0) =[y_0-b,y_0+b]. This is the compact cylinder where f is defined. Let M=supCa,b‖f‖,=sup_C_a,bf, this is, the supremum of (the absolute values of) the slopes of the function. Finally, let L be the Lipschitz constant of f with respect to the second variable. We will proceed to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem using the metric on C(Ia(t0),Bb(y0))𝒞(I_a(t_0),B_b(y_0)) induced by the uniform norm ‖φ‖∞=supt∈Ia|φ(t)|.φ_∞=sup_t_a|φ(t)|. We define an operator between two function spaces of continuous functions, Picard's operator, as follows: Γ:C(Ia(t0),Bb(y0))⟶C(Ia(t0),Bb(y0))Γ:𝒞(I_a(t_0),B_b(y_0))⟶𝒞(I_a(t_0),B_b(y_0)) defined by: Γφ(t)=y0+∫t0tf(s,φ(s))ds.Γφ(t)=y_0+∫_t_0^tf(s,φ(s)) ds. We must show that this operator maps a complete non-empty metric space X into itself and also is a contraction mapping. We first show that, given certain restrictions on a, ΓΓ takes Bb(y0)¯B_b(y_0) into itself in the space of continuous functions with the uniform norm. Here, Bb(y0)¯B_b(y_0) is a closed ball in the space of continuous (and bounded) functions "centered" at the constant function y0_0. Hence we need to show that ‖φ−y0‖∞≤bφ-y_0_∞ implies ‖Γφ(t)−y0‖=‖∫t0tf(s,φ(s))ds‖≤∫t0t′‖f(s,φ(s))‖ds≤∫t0t′Mds=M|t′−t0|≤Ma≤bΓφ(t)-y_0=∫_t_0^tf(s,φ(s)) ds≤∫_t_0^t'f(s,φ(s))ds≤∫_t_0^t'M ds=M|t'-t_0| where t′' is some number in [t0−a,t0+a][t_0-a,t_0+a] where the maximum is achieved. The last inequality in the chain is true if we impose the requirement a<bM<b/M. Now let's prove that this operator is a contraction mapping. Given two functions φ1,φ2∈C(Ia(t0),Bb(y0))φ_1,φ_2∈𝒞(I_a(t_0),B_b(y_0)), in order to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem we require ‖Γφ1−Γφ2‖∞≤q‖φ1−φ2‖∞,Γφ_1-Γφ_2_∞≦φ_1-φ_2_∞, for some 0≤q<10≦<1. So let t be such that ‖Γφ1−Γφ2‖∞=‖(Γφ1−Γφ2)(t)‖.Γφ_1-Γφ_2_∞=(Γφ_1-Γφ_2)(t). Then using the definition of ΓΓ, ‖(Γφ1−Γφ2)(t)‖=‖∫t0t(f(s,φ1(s))−f(s,φ2(s)))ds‖≤∫t0t‖f(s,φ1(s))−f(s,φ2(s))‖ds≤L∫t0t‖φ1(s)−φ2(s)‖dssincefisLipschitz-continuous≤L∫t0t‖φ1−φ2‖∞ds≤La‖φ1−φ2‖∞(Γφ_1-Γφ_2)(t) =∫_t_0^t(f(s,φ_1(s))-f(s,φ_2(s)))ds ≤∫_t_0^tf(s,φ_1(s))-f(s,φ_2(s))ds ∫_t_0^tφ_1(s)-φ_2(s)ds sincefisLipschitz-continuous ∫_t_0^tφ_1-φ_2_∞ ds φ_1-φ_2_∞ This is a contraction if a<1L.<1L. We have established that the Picard's operator is a contraction on the Banach spaces with the metric induced by the uniform norm. This allows us to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem to conclude that the operator has a unique fixed point. In particular, there is a unique function φ∈C(Ia(t0),Bb(y0))φ∈𝒞(I_a(t_0),B_b(y_0)) such that Γφ = φ. This function is the unique solution of the initial value problem, valid on the interval Ia where a satisfies the condition a<minbM,1L.<min{bM,1L}. Optimization of the solution's
