sketch: The proof relies on transforming the differential equation, and applying the Banach fixed-point theorem. By integrating both sides, any function satisfying the differential equation must also satisfy the integral equation y(t)−y(t0)=∫t0tf(s,y(s))ds.(t)-y(t_0)=∫_t_0^tf(s,y(s)) ds. A simple proof of existence of the solution is obtained by successive approximations. In this context, the method is known as Picard iteration. Set φ0(t)=y0φ_0(t)=y_0 and φk+1(t)=y0+∫t0tf(s,φk(s))ds.φ_k+1(t)=y_0+∫_t_0^tf(s,φ_k(s)) ds. It can then be shown, by using the Banach fixed-point theorem, that the sequence of "Picard iterates" φk is convergent and that the limit is a solution to the problem. An application of Grönwall's lemma to |φ(t) − ψ(t)|, where φ and ψ are two solutions, shows that φ(t) = ψ(t), thus proving the global uniqueness (the local uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the Banach fixed point). See Newton's method of successive approximation for instruction. Example of Picard
