theorem: Let (H, ⟨ , ⟩) be a real or complex Hilbert space and let A : H → H be a bounded, compact, self-adjoint operator. Then there is a sequence of non-zero real eigenvalues λi, i = 1, …, N, with N equal to the rank of A, such that |λi| is monotonically non-increasing and, if N = +∞, limi→+∞λi=0.lim_i→+∞λ_i=0. Furthermore, if each eigenvalue of A is repeated in the sequence according to its multiplicity, then there exists an orthonormal set φi, i = 1, …, N, of corresponding eigenfunctions, i.e., Aφi=λiφifori=1,…,N.φ_i=λ_iφ_ii=1,…,N. Moreover, the functions φi form an orthonormal basis for the range of A and A can be written as Au=∑i=1Nλi⟨φi,u⟩φiforallu∈H.=∑_i=1^Nλ_i⟨φ_i,u⟩φ_iu.
