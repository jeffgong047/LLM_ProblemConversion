cubes: How many ways are there to color the sides of a three-dimensional cube with m colors, up to rotation of the cube? The rotation group C of the cube acts on the six sides of the cube, which are equivalent to beads. Its cycle index is ZC(t1,t2,t3,t4)=124(t16+6t12t4+3t12t22+8t32+6t23)_C(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4)=1/24(t_1^6+6t_1^2t_4+3t_1^2t_2^2+8t_3^2+6t_2^3) which is obtained by analyzing the action of each of the 24 elements of C on the 6 sides of the cube, see here for the details. We take all colors to have weight 0 and find that there are F(0)=ZC(m,m,m,m)=124(m6+3m4+12m3+8m2)(0)=Z_C(m,m,m,m)=1/24(m^6+3m^4+12m^3+8m^2) different colorings. Graphs on three and four
