vertices: A graph on m vertices can be interpreted as an arrangement of colored beads. The set X of "beads" is the set of (m2)m2 possible edges, while the set of colors Y = {black, white} corresponds to edges that are present (black) or absent (white). The Pólya enumeration theorem can be used to calculate the number of graphs up to isomorphism with a fixed number of vertices, or the generating function of these graphs according to the number of edges they have. For the latter purpose, we can say that a black or present edge has weight 1, while an absent or white edge has weight 0. Thus f(t)=1+t(t)=1+t is the generating function for the set of colors. The relevant symmetry group is G=Sm,=S_m, the symmetric group on m letters. This group acts on the set X of possible edges: a permutation φ turns the edge {a, b} into the edge {φ(a), φ(b)}. With these definitions, an isomorphism class of graphs with m vertices is the same as an orbit of the action of G on the set YX of colored arrangements; the number of edges of the graph equals the weight of the arrangement. All graphs on three vertices Nonisomorphic graphs on three vertices The eight graphs on three vertices (before identifying isomorphic graphs) are shown at the right. There are four isomorphism classes of graphs, also shown at the right. The cycle index of the group S3 acting on the set of three edges is ZG(t1,t2,t3)=16(t13+3t1t2+2t3)_G(t_1,t_2,t_3)=1/6(t_1^3+3t_1t_2+2t_3) (obtained by inspecting the cycle structure of the action of the group elements; see here). Thus, according to the enumeration theorem, the generating function of graphs on 3 vertices up to isomorphism is F(t)=ZG(t+1,t2+1,t3+1)=16((t+1)3+3(t+1)(t2+1)+2(t3+1)),(t)=Z_G(t+1,t^2+1,t^3+1)=1/6((t+1)^3+3(t+1)(t^2+1)+2(t^3+1)), which simplifies to F(t)=t3+t2+t+1.(t)=t^3+t^2+t+1. Thus there is one graph each with 0 to 3 edges. Isomorphism classes of graphs on four vertices. The cycle index of the group S4 acting on the set of 6 edges is ZG(t1,t2,t3,t4)=124(t16+9t12t22+8t32+6t2t4)_G(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4)=1/24(t_1^6+9t_1^2t_2^2+8t_3^2+6t_2t_4) (see here.) Hence F(t)=ZG(t+1,t2+1,t3+1,t4+1)=(t+1)6+9(t+1)2(t2+1)2+8(t3+1)2+6(t2+1)(t4+1)24(t)=Z_G(t+1,t^2+1,t^3+1,t^4+1)=(t+1)^6+9(t+1)^2(t^2+1)^2+8(t^3+1)^2+6(t^2+1)(t^4+1)/24 which simplifies to F(t)=t6+t5+2t4+3t3+2t2+t+1.(t)=t^6+t^5+2t^4+3t^3+2t^2+t+1. These graphs are shown at the right. Rooted ternary
