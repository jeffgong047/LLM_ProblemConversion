trees: The set T3 of rooted ternary trees consists of rooted trees where every node (or non-leaf vertex) has exactly three children (leaves or subtrees). Small ternary trees are shown at right. Note that rooted ternary trees with n nodes are equivalent to rooted trees with n vertices of degree at most 3 (by ignoring the leaves). In general, two rooted trees are isomorphic when one can be obtained from the other by permuting the children of its nodes. In other words, the group that acts on the children of a node is the symmetric group S3. We define the weight of such a ternary tree to be the number of nodes (or non-leaf vertices). Rooted ternary trees on 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 nodes (=non-leaf vertices). The root is shown in blue, the leaves are not shown. Every node has as many leaves as to make the number of its children equal to 3. One can view a rooted, ternary tree as a recursive object which is either a leaf or a node with three children which are themselves rooted ternary trees. These children are equivalent to beads; the cycle index of the symmetric group S3 that acts on them is ZS3(t1,t2,t3)=t13+3t1t2+2t36._S_3(t_1,t_2,t_3)=t_1^3+3t_1t_2+2t_3/6. The Polya enumeration theorem translates the recursive structure of rooted ternary trees into a functional equation for the generating function F(t) of rooted ternary trees by number of nodes. This is achieved by "coloring" the three children with rooted ternary trees, weighted by node number, so that the color generating function is given by f(t)=F(t)(t)=F(t) which by the enumeration theorem gives F(t)3+3F(t)F(t2)+2F(t3)6F(t)^3+3F(t)F(t^2)+2F(t^3)/6 as the generating function for rooted ternary trees, weighted by one less than the node number (since the sum of the children weights does not take the root into account), so that F(t)=1+t⋅F(t)3+3F(t)F(t2)+2F(t3)6.(t)=1+t·F(t)^3+3F(t)F(t^2)+2F(t^3)/6. This is equivalent to the following recurrence formula for the number tn of rooted ternary trees with n nodes: t0=1tn+1=16(∑a+b+c=ntatbtc+3∑a+2b=ntatb+2∑3a=nta)t_0 =1 t_n+1 =1/6(∑_a+b+c=nt_at_bt_c+3∑_a+2b=nt_at_b+2∑_3a=nt_a) where a, b and c are nonnegative integers. The first few values of tn_n are 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 17, 39, 89, 211, 507, 1238, 3057, 7639, 19241 (sequence A000598 in the OEIS). Proof of
