Improvements: If q is relatively small, e.g., q≤x9/20^9/20, then there exists a better bound: π(x;q,a)≤(2+o(1))xφ(q)log⁡(x/q3/8)π(x;q,a)≤(2+o(1))xφ(q)log(x/q^3/8) This is due to Y. Motohashi (1973). He used a bilinear structure in the error term in the Selberg sieve, discovered by himself. Later this idea of exploiting structures in sieving errors developed into a major method in Analytic Number Theory, due to H. Iwaniec's extension to combinatorial sieve. Comparison with Dirichlet's
