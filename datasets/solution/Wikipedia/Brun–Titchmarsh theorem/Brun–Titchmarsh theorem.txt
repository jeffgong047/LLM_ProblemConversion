In analytic number theory, the Brun–Titchmarsh theorem, named after Viggo Brun and Edward Charles Titchmarsh, is an upper bound on the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progression.  


Statement[edit]
Let π(x;q,a)π(x;q,a) count the number of primes p congruent to a modulo q with p ≤ x. Then

π(x;q,a)≤2xφ(q)log⁡(x/q)π(x;q,a)≤2xφ(q)log(x/q)
for all q < x.

History[edit]
The result was proven by sieve methods by Montgomery and Vaughan; an earlier result of Brun and Titchmarsh obtained a weaker version of this inequality with an additional multiplicative factor of 1+o(1)1+o(1).

Improvements[edit]
If q is relatively small, e.g., q≤x9/20^9/20, then there exists a better bound:

π(x;q,a)≤(2+o(1))xφ(q)log⁡(x/q3/8)π(x;q,a)≤(2+o(1))xφ(q)log(x/q^3/8)
This is due to Y. Motohashi (1973). He used a bilinear structure in the error term in the Selberg sieve, discovered by himself. Later this idea of exploiting structures in sieving errors developed into a major method in Analytic Number Theory, due to H. Iwaniec's extension to combinatorial sieve.

Comparison with Dirichlet's theorem[edit]
By contrast, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions gives an asymptotic result, which may be expressed in the form

π(x;q,a)=xφ(q)log⁡(x)(1+O(1log⁡x))π(x;q,a)=x/φ(q)log(x)(1+O(1/))
but this can only be proved to hold for the more restricted range q < (log x)c for constant c: this is the Siegel–Walfisz theorem.
