theorem: By contrast, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions gives an asymptotic result, which may be expressed in the form π(x;q,a)=xφ(q)log⁡(x)(1+O(1log⁡x))π(x;q,a)=x/φ(q)log(x)(1+O(1/)) but this can only be proved to hold for the more restricted range q < (log x)c for constant c: this is the Siegel–Walfisz theorem.
