resummation: Nachbin resummation (generalized Borel transform) can be used to sum divergent series that escape to the usual Borel summation or even to solve (asymptotically) integral equations of the form: g(s)=s∫0∞K(st)f(t)dt(s)=s∫_0^∞K(st)f(t) dt where f(t)(t) may or may not be of exponential growth and the kernel K(u)(u) has a Mellin transform. The solution can be obtained as f(x)=∑n=0∞anM(n+1)xn(x)=∑_n=0^∞a_n/M(n+1)x^n with g(s)=∑n=0∞ans−n(s)=∑_n=0^∞a_ns^-n and M(n)(n) is the Mellin transform of K(u)(u). An example of this is the Gram series π(x)≈1+∑n=1∞logn⁡(x)n⋅n!ζ(n+1).π(x)≈1+∑_n=1^∞log^n(x)/n!ζ(n+1). in some cases as an extra condition we require ∫0∞K(t)tndt∫_0^∞K(t)t^n dt to be finite for n=0,1,2,3,...=0,1,2,3,... and different from 0.
