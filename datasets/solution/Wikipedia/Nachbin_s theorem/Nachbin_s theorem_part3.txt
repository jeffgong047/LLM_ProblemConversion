type: Bounding may be defined for other functions besides the exponential function. In general, a function Ψ(t)Ψ(t) is a comparison function if it has a series Ψ(t)=∑n=0∞ΨntnΨ(t)=∑_n=0^∞Ψ_nt^n with Ψn>0Ψ_n>0 for all n, and limn→∞Ψn+1Ψn=0.lim_n→∞Ψ_n+1/Ψ_n=0. Comparison functions are necessarily entire, which follows from the ratio test. If Ψ(t)Ψ(t) is such a comparison function, one then says that f is of ΨΨ-type if there exist constants M and ττ such that |f(reiθ)|≤MΨ(τr)|f(re^iθ)|Ψ() as r→∞→∞. If ττ is the infimum of all such ττ one says that f is of ΨΨ-type ττ. Nachbin's theorem states that a function f(z)(z) with the series f(z)=∑n=0∞fnzn(z)=∑_n=0^∞f_nz^n is of ΨΨ-type ττ if and only if limsupn→∞|fnΨn|1/n=τ.lim sup_n→∞|f_n/Ψ_n|^1/n=τ. Borel
