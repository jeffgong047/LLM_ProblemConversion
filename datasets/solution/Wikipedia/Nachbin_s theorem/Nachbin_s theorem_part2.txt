type: Main article: Exponential type A function f(z)(z) defined on the complex plane is said to be of exponential type if there exist constants M and αα such that |f(reiθ)|≤Meαr|f(re^iθ)|^ in the limit of r→∞→∞. Here, the complex variable z was written as z=reiθ=re^iθ to emphasize that the limit must hold in all directions θθ. Letting αα stand for the infimum of all such αα, one then says that the function f is of exponential type αα. For example, let f(z)=sin⁡(πz)(z)=sin(). Then one says that sin⁡(πz)sin() is of exponential type ππ, since ππ is the smallest number that bounds the growth of sin⁡(πz)sin() along the imaginary axis. So, for this example, Carlson's theorem cannot apply, as it requires functions of exponential type less than ππ. Ψ
