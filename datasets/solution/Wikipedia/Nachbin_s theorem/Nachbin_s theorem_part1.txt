Theorem bounding the growth rate of analytic functions This article is about Nachbin's theorem on complex analysis. For Nachbin's theorem on approximation theory, see Stone–Weierstrass theorem § Nachbin's theorem. In mathematics, in the area of complex analysis, Nachbin's theorem (named after Leopoldo Nachbin) is commonly used to establish a bound on the growth rates for an analytic function. This article provides a brief review of growth rates, including the idea of a function of exponential type. Classification of growth rates based on type help provide a finer tool than big O or Landau notation, since a number of theorems about the analytic structure of the bounded function and its integral transforms can be stated. In particular, Nachbin's theorem may be used to give the domain of convergence of the generalized Borel transform, given below. Exponential
