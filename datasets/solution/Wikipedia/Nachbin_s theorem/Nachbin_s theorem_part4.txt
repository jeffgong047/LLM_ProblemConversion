transform: Nachbin's theorem has immediate applications in Cauchy theorem-like situations, and for integral transforms. For example, the generalized Borel transform is given by F(w)=∑n=0∞fnΨnwn+1.(w)=∑_n=0^∞f_n/Ψ_nw^n+1. If f is of ΨΨ-type ττ, then the exterior of the domain of convergence of F(w)(w), and all of its singular points, are contained within the disk |w|≤τ.|w|≤τ. Furthermore, one has f(z)=12πi∮γΨ(zw)F(w)dw(z)=1/2∮_γΨ(zw)F(w) dw where the contour of integration γ encircles the disk |w|≤τ|w|≤τ. This generalizes the usual Borel transform for exponential type, where Ψ(t)=etΨ(t)=e^t. The integral form for the generalized Borel transform follows as well. Let α(t)α(t) be a function whose first derivative is bounded on the interval [0,∞)[0,∞), so that 1Ψn=∫0∞tndα(t)1/Ψ_n=∫_0^∞t^n dα(t) where dα(t)=α′(t)dtα(t)=α^'(t) dt. Then the integral form of the generalized Borel transform is F(w)=1w∫0∞f(tw)dα(t).(w)=1/w∫_0^∞f(t/w) dα(t). The ordinary Borel transform is regained by setting α(t)=e−tα(t)=e^-t. Note that the integral form of the Borel transform is just the Laplace transform. Nachbin
