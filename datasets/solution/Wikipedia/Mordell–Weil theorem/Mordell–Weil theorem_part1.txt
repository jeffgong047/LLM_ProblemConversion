The group of K-rational points of an abelian variety is a finitely-generated abelian group Mordell–Weil theoremFieldNumber theoryConjectured byHenri PoincaréConjectured in1901First proof byAndré WeilFirst proof in1929GeneralizationsFaltings's theoremBombieri–Lang conjectureMordell–Lang conjecture In mathematics, the Mordell–Weil theorem states that for an abelian variety A over a number field K, the group A(K)(K) of K-rational points of A is a finitely-generated abelian group, called the Mordell–Weil group. The case with A an elliptic curve E and K the field of rational numbers is Mordell's theorem, answering a question apparently posed by Henri Poincaré around 1901; it was proved by Louis Mordell in 1922. It is a foundational theorem of Diophantine geometry and the arithmetic of abelian varieties.
