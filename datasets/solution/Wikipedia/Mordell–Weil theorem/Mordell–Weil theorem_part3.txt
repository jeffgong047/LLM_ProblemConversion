results: The theorem leaves a number of questions still unanswered: Calculation of the rank. This is still a demanding computational problem, and does not always have effective solutions. Meaning of the rank: see Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Possible torsion subgroups: Barry Mazur proved in 1978 that the Mordell–Weil group can have only finitely many torsion subgroups. This is the elliptic curve case of the torsion conjecture. For a curve C in its Jacobian variety as A, can the intersection of C with A(K)(K) be infinite? Because of Faltings's theorem, this is false unless C=A=A. In the same context, can C contain infinitely many torsion points of A? Because of the Manin–Mumford conjecture, proved by Michel Raynaud, this is false unless it is the elliptic curve case. See
