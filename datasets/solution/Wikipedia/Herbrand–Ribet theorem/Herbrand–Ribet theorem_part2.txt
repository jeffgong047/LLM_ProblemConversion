Statement: The Galois group Δ of the cyclotomic field of pth roots of unity for an odd prime p, Q(ζ) with ζp = 1, consists of the p − 1 group elements σa, where σa(ζ)=ζaσ_a(ζ)=ζ^a. As a consequence of Fermat's little theorem, in the ring of p-adic integers Zpℤ_p we have p − 1 roots of unity, each of which is congruent mod p to some number in the range 1 to p − 1; we can therefore define a Dirichlet character ω (the Teichmüller character) with values in Zpℤ_p by requiring that for n relatively prime to p, ω(n) be congruent to n modulo p. The p part of the class group is a Zpℤ_p-module (since it is p-primary), hence a module over the group ring Zp[Δ]ℤ_p[Δ]. We now define idempotent elements of the group ring for each n from 1 to p − 1, as ϵn=1p−1∑a=1p−1ω(a)nσa−1.ϵ_n=1/p-1∑_a=1^p-1ω(a)^nσ_a^-1. It is easy to see that ∑ϵn=1∑ϵ_n=1 and ϵiϵj=δijϵiϵ_iϵ_j=δ_ijϵ_i where δijδ_ij is the Kronecker delta. This allows us to break up the p part of the ideal class group G of Q(ζ) by means of the idempotents; if G is the p-primary part of the ideal class group, then, letting Gn = εn(G), we have G=⊕Gn=_n. The Herbrand–Ribet theorem states that for odd n, Gn is nontrivial if and only if p divides the Bernoulli number Bp−n.[1] The theorem makes no assertion about even values of n, but there is no known p for which Gn is nontrivial for any even n: triviality for all p would be a consequence of Vandiver's conjecture.[2]
