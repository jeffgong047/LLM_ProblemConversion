limits: For example, suppose that f1, f2, ... is a sequence of holomorphic functions, converging uniformly to a continuous function f on an open disc. By Cauchy's theorem, we know that ∮Cfn(z)dz=0∮_Cf_n(z) dz=0 for every n, along any closed curve C in the disc. Then the uniform convergence implies that ∮Cf(z)dz=∮Climn→∞fn(z)dz=limn→∞∮Cfn(z)dz=0∮_Cf(z) dz=∮_Clim_n→∞f_n(z) dz=lim_n→∞∮_Cf_n(z) dz=0 for every closed curve C, and therefore by Morera's theorem f must be holomorphic. This fact can be used to show that, for any open set Ω ⊆ C, the set A(Ω) of all bounded, analytic functions u : Ω → C is a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm. Infinite sums and
