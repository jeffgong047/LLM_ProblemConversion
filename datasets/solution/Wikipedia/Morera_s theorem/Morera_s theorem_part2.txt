Proof: The integrals along two paths from a to b are equal, since their difference is the integral along a closed loop. There is a relatively elementary proof of the theorem. One constructs an anti-derivative for f explicitly. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that D is connected. Fix a point z0 in D, and for any z∈D, let γ:[0,1]→Dγ:[0,1] be a piecewise C1 curve such that γ(0)=z0γ(0)=z_0 and γ(1)=zγ(1)=z. Then define the function F to be F(z)=∫γf(ζ)dζ.(z)=∫_γf(ζ) dζ. To see that the function is well-defined, suppose τ:[0,1]→Dτ:[0,1] is another piecewise C1 curve such that τ(0)=z0τ(0)=z_0 and τ(1)=zτ(1)=z. The curve γτ−1γτ^-1 (i.e. the curve combining γγ with ττ in reverse) is a closed piecewise C1 curve in D. Then, ∫γf(ζ)dζ+∫τ−1f(ζ)dζ=∮γτ−1f(ζ)dζ=0.∫_γf(ζ) dζ+∫_τ^-1f(ζ) dζ=∮_γτ^-1f(ζ) dζ=0. And it follows that ∫γf(ζ)dζ=∫τf(ζ)dζ.∫_γf(ζ) dζ=∫_τf(ζ) dζ. Then using the continuity of f to estimate difference quotients, we get that F′(z) = f(z). Had we chosen a different z0 in D, F would change by a constant: namely, the result of integrating f along any piecewise regular curve between the new z0 and the old, and this does not change the derivative. Since f is the derivative of the holomorphic function F, it is holomorphic. The fact that derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic can be proved by using the fact that holomorphic functions are analytic, i.e. can be represented by a convergent power series, and the fact that power series may be differentiated term by term. This completes the proof.
