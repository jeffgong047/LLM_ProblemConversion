integrals: Morera's theorem can also be used in conjunction with Fubini's theorem and the Weierstrass M-test to show the analyticity of functions defined by sums or integrals, such as the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)=∑n=1∞1nsζ(s)=∑_n=1^∞1/n^s or the Gamma function Γ(α)=∫0∞xα−1e−xdx.Γ(α)=∫_0^∞x^α-1e^-x dx. Specifically one shows that ∮CΓ(α)dα=0∮_CΓ(α) dα=0 for a suitable closed curve C, by writing ∮CΓ(α)dα=∮C∫0∞xα−1e−xdxdα∮_CΓ(α) dα=∮_C∫_0^∞x^α-1e^-x dx dα and then using Fubini's theorem to justify changing the order of integration, getting ∫0∞∮Cxα−1e−xdαdx=∫0∞e−x∮Cxα−1dαdx.∫_0^∞∮_Cx^α-1e^-x dα dx=∫_0^∞e^-x∮_Cx^α-1 dα dx. Then one uses the analyticity of α ↦ xα−1 to conclude that ∮Cxα−1dα=0,∮_Cx^α-1 dα=0, and hence the double integral above is 0. Similarly, in the case of the zeta function, the M-test justifies interchanging the integral along the closed curve and the sum. Weakening of
