statement: A binary relation R on a set X is formally defined as a set of ordered pairs (x,y)(x,y) of elements of X,, and (x,y)∈R(x,y) is often abbreviated as xRy.. A relation is reflexive if xRx holds for every element x∈X;; it is transitive if xRyandyRzandyRz imply xRz for all x,y,z∈X;,y,z; it is antisymmetric if xRyandyRxandyRx imply x=y=y for all x,y∈X;,y; and it is a connex relation if xRyoryRxoryRx holds for all x,y∈X.,y. A partial order is, by definition, a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation. A total order is a partial order that is connex. A relation R is contained in another relation S when all ordered pairs in R also appear in S;; that is,xRy implies xSy for all x,y∈X.,y. The extension theorem states that every relation R that is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric (that is, a partial order) is contained in another relation S which is reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric and connex (that is, a total order).
