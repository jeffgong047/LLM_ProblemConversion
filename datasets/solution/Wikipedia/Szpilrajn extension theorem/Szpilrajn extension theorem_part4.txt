theorems: Arrow[2] stated that every preorder (reflexive and transitive relation) can be extended to a total preorder (transitive and connex relation). This claim was later proved by Hansson.[3]: Lemma 3 [4] Suzumura proved that a binary relation can be extended to a total preorder if and only if it is Suzumura-consistent, which means that there is no cycle of elements such that xRy for every pair of consecutive elements (x,y),(x,y), and there is some pair of consecutive elements (x,y)(x,y) in the cycle for which yRx does not hold.[4] See
