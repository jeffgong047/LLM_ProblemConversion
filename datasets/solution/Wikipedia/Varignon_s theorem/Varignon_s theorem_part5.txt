Properties: A planar Varignon parallelogram also has the following properties: Each pair of opposite sides of the Varignon parallelogram are parallel to a diagonal in the original quadrilateral. A side of the Varignon parallelogram is half as long as the diagonal in the original quadrilateral it is parallel to. The area of the Varignon parallelogram equals half the area of the original quadrilateral. This is true in convex, concave and crossed quadrilaterals provided the area of the latter is defined to be the difference of the areas of the two triangles it is composed of.[2] The perimeter of the Varignon parallelogram equals the sum of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral. The diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram are the bimedians of the original quadrilateral. The two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.[3]: p.125 In a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c and d, the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides a and c is m=12−a2+b2−c2+d2+p2+q2=12√(-a^2+b^2-c^2+d^2+p^2+q^2) where p and q are the length of the diagonals.[4] The length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides b and d is n=12a2−b2+c2−d2+p2+q2.=12√(a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2+p^2+q^2). Hence[3]: p.126 p2+q2=2(m2+n2).^2+q^2=2(m^2+n^2). This is also a corollary to the parallelogram law applied in the Varignon parallelogram. The lengths of the bimedians can also be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the distance x between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is possible when using Euler's quadrilateral theorem in the above formulas. Whence[5] m=122(b2+d2)−4x2=12√(2(b^2+d^2)-4x^2) and n=122(a2+c2)−4x2.=12√(2(a^2+c^2)-4x^2). The two opposite sides in these formulas are not the two that the bimedian connects. In a convex quadrilateral, there is the following dual connection between the bimedians and the diagonals:[6] The two bimedians have equal length if and only if the two diagonals are perpendicular. The two bimedians are perpendicular if and only if the two diagonals have equal length. Special
