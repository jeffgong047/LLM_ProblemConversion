The midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form a parallelogram For the theorem about the moment of a force, see Varignon's theorem (mechanics). Area(EFGH) = (1/2)Area(ABCD) In Euclidean geometry, Varignon's theorem holds that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form a parallelogram, called the Varignon parallelogram. It is named after Pierre Varignon, whose proof was published posthumously in 1731.[1]
