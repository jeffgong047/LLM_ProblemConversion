History: In 1737, Euler related the study of prime numbers to what is known now as the Riemann zeta function: he showed that the value ζ(1)ζ(1) reduces to a ratio of two infinite products, Π p / Π (p–1), for all primes p, and that the ratio is infinite.[1][2] In 1775, Euler stated the theorem for the cases of a + nd, where a = 1.[3] This special case of Dirichlet's theorem can be proven using cyclotomic polynomials.[4] The general form of the theorem was first conjectured by Legendre in his attempted unsuccessful proofs of quadratic reciprocity[5] — as Gauss noted in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae[6] — but it was proved by Dirichlet (1837) with Dirichlet L-series. The proof is modeled on Euler's earlier work relating the Riemann zeta function to the distribution of primes. The theorem represents the beginning of rigorous analytic number theory. Atle Selberg (1949) gave an elementary proof.
