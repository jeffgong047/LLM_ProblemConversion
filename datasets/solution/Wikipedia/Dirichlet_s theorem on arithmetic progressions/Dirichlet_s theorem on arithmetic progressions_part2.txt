Examples: The primes of the form 4n + 3 are (sequence A002145 in the OEIS) 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 83, 103, 107, 127, 131, 139, 151, 163, 167, 179, 191, 199, 211, 223, 227, 239, 251, 263, 271, 283, ... They correspond to the following values of n: (sequence A095278 in the OEIS) 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, 26, 31, 32, 34, 37, 40, 41, 44, 47, 49, 52, 55, 56, 59, 62, 65, 67, 70, 76, 77, 82, 86, 89, 91, 94, 95, ... The strong form of Dirichlet's theorem implies that 13+17+111+119+123+131+143+147+159+167+⋯1/3+1/7+1/11+1/19+1/23+1/31+1/43+1/47+1/59+1/67+⋯ is a divergent series. Sequences dn + a with odd d are often ignored because half the numbers are even and the other half is the same numbers as a sequence with 2d, if we start with n = 0. For example, 6n + 1 produces the same primes as 3n + 1, while 6n + 5 produces the same as 3n + 2 except for the only even prime 2.
