geometry: Pythagorean fields can be used to construct models for some of Hilbert's axioms for geometry (Iyanaga & Kawada 1980, 163 C). The coordinate geometry given by Fn^n for F a Pythagorean field satisfies many of Hilbert's axioms, such as the incidence axioms, the congruence axioms and the axioms of parallels. However, in general this geometry need not satisfy all Hilbert's axioms unless the field F has extra properties: for example, if the field is also ordered then the geometry will satisfy Hilbert's ordering axioms, and if the field is also complete the geometry will satisfy Hilbert's completeness axiom. The Pythagorean closure of a non-archimedean ordered field, such as the Pythagorean closure of the field of rational functions Q(x)𝐐(x) in one variable over the rational numbers Q,𝐐, can be used to construct non-archimedean geometries that satisfy many of Hilbert's axioms but not his axiom of completeness.[10] Dehn used such a field to construct two Dehn planes, examples of non-Legendrian geometry and semi-Euclidean geometry respectively, in which there are many lines though a point not intersecting a given line but where the sum of the angles of a triangle is at least π.[11] Diller–Dress
