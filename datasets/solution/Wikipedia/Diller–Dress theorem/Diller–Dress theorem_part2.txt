Properties: Every Euclidean field (an ordered field in which all non-negative elements are squares) is an ordered Pythagorean field, but the converse does not hold.[3] A quadratically closed field is Pythagorean field but not conversely (R𝐑 is Pythagorean); however, a non formally real Pythagorean field is quadratically closed.[4] The Witt ring of a Pythagorean field is of order 2 if the field is not formally real, and torsion-free otherwise.[1] For a field F there is an exact sequence involving the Witt rings 0→Tor⁡IW(F)→W(F)→W(Fpy)0→TorIW(F)(F)(F^py) where IW(F)(F) is the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring of F[5] and Tor⁡IW(F)TorIW(F) denotes its torsion subgroup (which is just the nilradical of W(F)(F)).[6] Equivalent
