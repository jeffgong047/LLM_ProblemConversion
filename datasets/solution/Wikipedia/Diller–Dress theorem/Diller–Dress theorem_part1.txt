In algebra, a Pythagorean field is a field in which every sum of two squares is a square: equivalently it has Pythagoras number equal to 1. A Pythagorean extension of a field F is an extension obtained by adjoining an element 1+λ2√(1+λ^2) for some λλ in F. So a Pythagorean field is one closed under taking Pythagorean extensions. For any field F there is a minimal Pythagorean field Fpy^py containing it, unique up to isomorphism, called its Pythagorean closure.[1] The Hilbert field is the minimal ordered Pythagorean field.[2]
