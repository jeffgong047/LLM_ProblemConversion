Notes: ^ Gross & Yellen (2006). ^ Vishkin (1985) credits this observation to Atallah (1984), and Balakrishnan (1996) credits it to Roberts (1978). But as Clark & Holton (1991) point out, the same algorithm is already included (with the assumption of 2-vertex-connectivity rather than 2-edge-connectivity) in the seminal earlier work of Hopcroft & Tarjan (1973) on depth-first search. ^ Vishkin (1985). ^ Soroker (1988). ^ Baglivo & Graver (1983).
