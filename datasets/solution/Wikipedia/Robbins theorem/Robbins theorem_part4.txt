complexity: A strong orientation of a given bridgeless undirected graph may be found in linear time by performing a depth-first search of the graph, orienting all edges in the depth-first search tree away from the tree root, and orienting all the remaining edges (which must necessarily connect an ancestor and a descendant in the depth-first search tree) from the descendant to the ancestor.[2] Although this algorithm is not suitable for parallel computers, due to the difficulty of performing depth-first search on them, alternative algorithms are available that solve the problem efficiently in the parallel model.[3] Parallel algorithms are also known for finding strongly connected orientations of mixed graphs.[4]
