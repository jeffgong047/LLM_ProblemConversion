representation: The second part of the theorem gives the existence of a decomposition of a unitary representation of G into finite-dimensional representations. Now, intuitively groups were conceived as rotations on geometric objects, so it is only natural to study representations which essentially arise from continuous actions on Hilbert spaces. (For those who were first introduced to dual groups consisting of characters which are the continuous homomorphisms into the circle group, this approach is similar except that the circle group is (ultimately) generalised to the group of unitary operators on a given Hilbert space.) Let G be a topological group and H a complex Hilbert space. A continuous action ∗ : G × H → H, gives rise to a continuous map ρ∗ : G → HH (functions from H to H with the strong topology) defined by: ρ∗(g)(v) = ∗(g,v). This map is clearly a homomorphism from G into GL(H), the homeomorphic[clarification needed] automorphisms of H. Conversely, given such a map, we can uniquely recover the action in the obvious way. Thus we define the representations of G on a Hilbert space H to be those group homomorphisms, ρ, which arise from continuous actions of G on H. We say that a representation ρ is unitary if ρ(g) is a unitary operator for all g ∈ G; i.e., ⟨ρ(g)v,ρ(g)w⟩=⟨v,w⟩⟨ρ(g)v,ρ(g)w⟩=,w⟩ for all v, w ∈ H. (I.e. it is unitary if ρ : G → U(H). Notice how this generalises the special case of the one-dimensional Hilbert space, where U(C) is just the circle group.) Given these definitions, we can state the second part of the Peter–Weyl theorem (Knapp 1986, Theorem 1.12): Peter–Weyl Theorem (Part II). Let ρ be a unitary representation of a compact group G on a complex Hilbert space H. Then H splits into an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible finite-dimensional unitary representations of G.
