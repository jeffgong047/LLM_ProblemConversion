functions: To state the third and final part of the theorem, there is a natural Hilbert space over G consisting of square-integrable functions, L2(G)^2(G); this makes sense because the Haar measure exists on G. The group G has a unitary representation ρ on L2(G)^2(G) given by acting on the left, via ρ(h)f(g)=f(h−1g).ρ(h)f(g)=f(h^-1g). The final statement of the Peter–Weyl theorem (Knapp 1986, Theorem 1.12) gives an explicit orthonormal basis of L2(G)^2(G). Roughly it asserts that the matrix coefficients for G, suitably renormalized, are an orthonormal basis of L2(G). In particular, L2(G)^2(G) decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum of all the irreducible unitary representations, in which the multiplicity of each irreducible representation is equal to its degree (that is, the dimension of the underlying space of the representation). Thus, L2(G)=⨁^π∈ΣEπ⊕dim⁡Eπ^2(G)=π∈Σ⊕E_π^⊕_π where Σ denotes the set of (isomorphism classes of) irreducible unitary representations of G, and the summation denotes the closure of the direct sum of the total spaces Eπ of the representations π. We may also regard L2(G)^2(G) as a representation of the direct product group G×G, with the two factors acting by translation on the left and the right, respectively. Fix a representation (π,Eπ)(π,E_π) of G. The space of matrix coefficients for the representation may be identified with End⁡(Eπ)End(E_π), the space of linear maps of Eπ_π to itself. The natural left and right action of G×G on the matrix coefficients corresponds to the action on End⁡(Eπ)End(E_π) given by (g,h)⋅A=π(g)Aπ(h)−1.(g,h)=π(g)Aπ(h)^-1. Then we may decompose L2(G)^2(G) as unitary representation of G×G in the form L2(G)=⨁^π∈ΣEπ⊗Eπ∗.^2(G)=π∈Σ⊕E_π_π^*. Finally, we may form an orthonormal basis for L2(G)^2(G) as follows. Suppose that a representative π is chosen for each isomorphism class of irreducible unitary representation, and denote the collection of all such π by Σ. Let uij(π)u_ij^(π) be the matrix coefficients of π in an orthonormal basis, in other words uij(π)(g)=⟨π(g)ej,ei⟩._ij^(π)(g)=⟨π(g)e_j,e_i⟩. for each g ∈ G. Finally, let d(π) be the degree of the representation π. The theorem now asserts that the set of functions d(π)uij(π)∣π∈Σ,1≤i,j≤d(π){√(d^(π))u_ij^(π)| π∈Σ, 1,j^(π)} is an orthonormal basis of L2(G).^2(G). Restriction to class
