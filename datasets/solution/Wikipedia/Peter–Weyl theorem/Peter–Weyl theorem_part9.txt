groups: The Peter–Weyl theorem—specifically the assertion that the characters form an orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable class functions—plays a key role in the classification of the irreducible representations of a connected compact Lie group.[3] The argument also depends on the Weyl integral formula (for class functions) and the Weyl character formula. An outline of the argument may be found here. Linearity of compact Lie
