SU(2): We use the standard representation of the group SU(2) as SU⁡(2)=(α−β¯βα¯):α,β∈C,|α|2+|β|2=1,SU(2)={[ α -β; β α ]: α,β∈ℂ, |α|^2+|β|^2=1} , Thus, SU(2) is represented as the 3-sphere S3^3 sitting inside C2=R4ℂ^2=ℝ^4. The irreducible representations of SU(2), meanwhile, are labeled by a non-negative integer m and can be realized as the natural action of SU(2) on the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in two complex variables.[2] The matrix coefficients of the mth representation are hyperspherical harmonics of degree m, that is, the restrictions to S3^3 of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree m in αα and ββ. The key to verifying this claim is to compute that for any two complex numbers z1_1 and z2_2, the function (α,β)↦(z1α+z2β)m(α,β)↦(z_1α+z_2β)^m is harmonic as a function of (α,β)∈C2=R4(α,β)∈ℂ^2=ℝ^4. In this case, finding an orthonormal basis for L2(SU⁡(2))=L2(S3)^2(SU(2))=L^2(S^3) consisting of matrix coefficients amounts to finding an orthonormal basis consisting of hyperspherical harmonics, which is a standard construction in analysis on spheres.
