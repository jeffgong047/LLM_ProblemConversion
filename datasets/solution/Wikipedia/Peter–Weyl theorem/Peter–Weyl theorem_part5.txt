functions: A function f on G is called a class function if f(hgh−1)=f(g)(hgh^-1)=f(g) for all g and h in G. The space of square-integrable class functions forms a closed subspace of L2(G)^2(G), and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right. Within the space of matrix coefficients for a fixed representation ππ is the character χπχ_π of ππ, defined by χπ(g)=trace⁡(π(g)).χ_π(g)=trace(π(g)). In the notation above, the character is the sum of the diagonal matrix coefficients: χπ=∑i=1d(π)uii(π).χ_π=∑_i=1^d^(π)u_ii^(π). An important consequence of the preceding result is the following: Theorem: The characters of the irreducible representations of G form a Hilbert basis for the space of square-integrable class functions on G. This result plays an important part in Weyl's classification of the representations of a connected compact Lie group.[1] An example:
