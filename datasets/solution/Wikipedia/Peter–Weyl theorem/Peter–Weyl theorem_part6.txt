U(1): A simple but helpful example is the case of the group of complex numbers of magnitude 1, G=S1=S^1. In this case, the irreducible representations are one-dimensional and given by πn(eiθ)=einθ.π_n(e^iθ)=e^inθ. There is then a single matrix coefficient for each representation, the function un(eiθ)=einθ._n(e^iθ)=e^inθ. The last part of the Peter–Weyl theorem then asserts in this case that these functions form an orthonormal basis for L2(S1)^2(S^1). In this case, the theorem is simply a standard result from the theory of Fourier series. For any compact group G, we can regard the decomposition of L2(G)^2(G) in terms of matrix coefficients as a generalization of the theory of Fourier series. Indeed, this decomposition is often referred to as a Fourier series. An example:
