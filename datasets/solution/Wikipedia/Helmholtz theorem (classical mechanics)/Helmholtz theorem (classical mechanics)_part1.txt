For other uses, see Helmholtz theorem (disambiguation). The Helmholtz theorem of classical mechanics reads as follows: Let H(x,p;V)=K(p)+φ(x;V)(x,p;V)=K(p)+φ(x;V) be the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional system, where K=p22m=p^2/2m is the kinetic energy and φ(x;V)φ(x;V) is a "U-shaped" potential energy profile which depends on a parameter V. Let ⟨⋅⟩t⟨·⟩_t denote the time average. Let E=K+φ,=K+φ, T=2⟨K⟩t,=2⟩_t, P=⟨−∂φ∂V⟩t,=⟨-∂φ/⟩_t, S(E,V)=log⁡∮2m(E−φ(x,V))dx.(E,V)=log∮√(2m(E-φ(x,V))) dx. Then dS=dE+PdVT.=dE+PdV/T.
