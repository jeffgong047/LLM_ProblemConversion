proof: See also: Euler equations (fluid dynamics) The circulation ΓΓ around a closed material contour C(t)(t) is defined by: Γ(t)=∮Cu⋅dsΓ(t)=∮_Cu·ds where u is the velocity vector, and ds is an element along the closed contour. The governing equation for an inviscid fluid with a conservative body force is DuDt=−1ρ∇p+∇ΦDu/Dt=-1/ρ∇p+∇Φ where D/Dt is the convective derivative, ρ is the fluid density, p is the pressure and Φ is the potential for the body force. These are the Euler equations with a body force. The condition of barotropicity implies that the density is a function only of the pressure, i.e. ρ=ρ(p)ρ=ρ(p). Taking the convective derivative of circulation gives DΓDt=∮CDuDt⋅ds+∮Cu⋅DdsDt.DΓ/Dt=∮_CDu/Dt·ds+∮_Cu·Dds/Dt. For the first term, we substitute from the governing equation, and then apply Stokes' theorem, thus: ∮CDuDt⋅ds=∫A∇×(−1ρ∇p+∇Φ)⋅ndS=∫A1ρ2(∇ρ×∇p)⋅ndS=0.∮_CDu/Dt·ds=∫_A∇×(-1/ρ∇p+∇Φ)·n dS=∫_A1/ρ^2(∇ρ×∇p)·n dS=0. The final equality arises since ∇ρ×∇p=0∇ρ×∇p=0 owing to barotropicity. We have also made use of the fact that the curl of any gradient is necessarily 0, or ∇×∇f=0∇×∇f=0 for any function f. For the second term, we note that evolution of the material line element is given by DdsDt=(ds⋅∇)u.Dds/Dt=(ds·∇)u. Hence ∮Cu⋅DdsDt=∮Cu⋅(ds⋅∇)u=12∮C∇(|u|2)⋅ds=0.∮_Cu·Dds/Dt=∮_Cu·(ds·∇)u=1/2∮_C∇(|u|^2)·ds=0. The last equality is obtained by applying gradient theorem. Since both terms are zero, we obtain the result DΓDt=0.DΓ/Dt=0. Poincaré–Bjerknes circulation
