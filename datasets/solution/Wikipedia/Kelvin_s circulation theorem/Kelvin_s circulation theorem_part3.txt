theorem: A similar principle which conserves a quantity can be obtained for the rotating frame also, known as the Poincaré–Bjerknes theorem, named after Henri Poincaré and Vilhelm Bjerknes, who derived the invariant in 1893[3][4] and 1898.[5][6] The theorem can be applied to a rotating frame which is rotating at a constant angular velocity given by the vector ΩΩ, for the modified circulation Γ(t)=∮C(u+Ω×r)⋅dsΓ(t)=∮_C(u+Ω×r)·ds Here rr is the position of the area of fluid. From Stokes' theorem, this is: Γ(t)=∫A∇×(u+Ω×r)⋅ndS=∫A(∇×u+2Ω)⋅ndSΓ(t)=∫_A∇×(u+Ω×r)·n dS=∫_A(∇×u+2Ω)·n dS The Vorticity of a velocity field in fluid dynamics is defined by: ω=∇×uω=∇×u Then: Γ(t)=∫A(ω+2Ω)⋅ndSΓ(t)=∫_A(ω+2Ω)·n dS See
