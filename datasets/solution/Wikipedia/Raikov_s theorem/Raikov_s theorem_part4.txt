groups: Let X be a locally compact Abelian group. Denote by M1(X)^1(X) the convolution semigroup of probability distributions on X, and by Ex_xthe degenerate distribution concentrated at x∈X. Let x0∈X,λ>0_0,λ>0. The Poisson distribution generated by the measure λEx0_x_0 is defined as a shifted distribution of the form μ=e(λEx0)=e−λ(E0+λEx0+λ2E2x0/2!+…+λnEnx0/n!+…).μ=e(_x_0)=e^-λ(E_0+_x_0+λ^2E_2x_0/2!+…+λ^nE_nx_0/n!+…). One has the following Raikov's theorem on locally compact Abelian
