Raikov’s theorem, named for Russian mathematician Dmitrii Abramovich Raikov, is a result in probability theory. It is well known that if each of two independent random variables ξ1 and ξ2 has a Poisson distribution, then their sum ξ=ξ1+ξ2 has a Poisson distribution as well. It turns out that the converse is also valid.[1][2][3]


Statement of the theorem[edit]
Suppose that a random variable ξ  has Poisson's distribution and admits a decomposition as a sum ξ=ξ1+ξ2 of two independent random variables. Then the distribution of each summand is a shifted Poisson's distribution.

Comment[edit]
Raikov's theorem is similar to Cramér’s decomposition theorem. The latter result claims that if a sum of two independent random variables has normal distribution, then each summand is normally distributed as well. It was also proved by Yu.V.Linnik that a convolution of normal distribution and Poisson's distribution possesses a similar property (Linnik's theorem [ru]).

An extension to locally compact Abelian groups[edit]
Let  X be a locally compact Abelian group. Denote by M1(X)^1(X) the convolution semigroup of probability distributions on X, and by Ex_xthe degenerate distribution concentrated at x∈X. Let x0∈X,λ>0_0,λ>0.
The Poisson distribution generated by the measure λEx0_x_0 is defined as a shifted distribution of the form
μ=e(λEx0)=e−λ(E0+λEx0+λ2E2x0/2!+…+λnEnx0/n!+…).μ=e(_x_0)=e^-λ(E_0+_x_0+λ^2E_2x_0/2!+…+λ^nE_nx_0/n!+…).
One has the following

Raikov's theorem on locally compact Abelian groups[edit]
Let μμ be the Poisson distribution generated by the measure λEx0_x_0. Suppose that μ=μ1∗μ2μ=μ_1*μ_2, with μj∈M1(X)μ_j^1(X). If x0_0 is either an infinite order element, or has order 2, then μjμ_j is also a Poisson's distribution. In the case of x0_0 being an element of finite order  n≠2≠2, μjμ_j can fail to be a Poisson's distribution.
