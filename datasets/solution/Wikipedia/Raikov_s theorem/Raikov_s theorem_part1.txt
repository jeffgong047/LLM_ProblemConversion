Raikov’s theorem, named for Russian mathematician Dmitrii Abramovich Raikov, is a result in probability theory. It is well known that if each of two independent random variables ξ1 and ξ2 has a Poisson distribution, then their sum ξ=ξ1+ξ2 has a Poisson distribution as well. It turns out that the converse is also valid.[1][2][3] Statement of the
