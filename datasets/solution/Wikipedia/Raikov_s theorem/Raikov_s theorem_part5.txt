groups: Let μμ be the Poisson distribution generated by the measure λEx0_x_0. Suppose that μ=μ1∗μ2μ=μ_1*μ_2, with μj∈M1(X)μ_j^1(X). If x0_0 is either an infinite order element, or has order 2, then μjμ_j is also a Poisson's distribution. In the case of x0_0 being an element of finite order n≠2≠2, μjμ_j can fail to be a Poisson's distribution.
