Comment: Raikov's theorem is similar to Cramér’s decomposition theorem. The latter result claims that if a sum of two independent random variables has normal distribution, then each summand is normally distributed as well. It was also proved by Yu.V.Linnik that a convolution of normal distribution and Poisson's distribution possesses a similar property (Linnik's theorem [ru]). An extension to locally compact Abelian
