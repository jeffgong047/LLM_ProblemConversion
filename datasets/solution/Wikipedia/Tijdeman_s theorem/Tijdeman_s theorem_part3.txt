problem: That the powers are consecutive is essential to Tijdeman's proof; if we replace the difference of 1 by any other difference k and ask for the number of solutions of ym=xn+k^m=x^n+k with n and m greater than one we have an unsolved problem,[8] called the generalized Tijdeman problem. It is conjectured that this set also will be finite. This would follow from a yet stronger conjecture of Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai (1931), see Catalan's conjecture, stating that the equation Aym=Bxn+k^m=Bx^n+k only has a finite number of solutions. The truth of Pillai's conjecture, in turn, would follow from the truth of the abc conjecture.[9]
