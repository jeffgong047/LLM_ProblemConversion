There are at most a finite number of consecutive powers In number theory, Tijdeman's theorem states that there are at most a finite number of consecutive powers. Stated another way, the set of solutions in integers x, y, n, m of the exponential diophantine equation ym=xn+1,^m=x^n+1, for exponents n and m greater than one, is finite.[1][2]
