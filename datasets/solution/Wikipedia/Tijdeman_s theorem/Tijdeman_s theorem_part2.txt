History: The theorem was proven by Dutch number theorist Robert Tijdeman in 1976,[3] making use of Baker's method in transcendental number theory to give an effective upper bound for x,y,m,n. Michel Langevin computed a value of exp exp exp exp 730 for the bound.[1][4][5] Tijdeman's theorem provided a strong impetus towards the eventual proof of Catalan's conjecture by Preda Mihăilescu.[6] Mihăilescu's theorem states that there is only one member to the set of consecutive power pairs, namely 9=8+1.[7] Generalized Tijdeman
