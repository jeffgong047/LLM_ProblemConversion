variable: Consider the formal power series in one complex variable z of the form f(z)=∑n=0∞cn(z−a)n(z)=∑_n=0^∞c_n(z-a)^n where a,cn∈C.,c_n∈ℂ. Then the radius of convergence R of f at the point a is given by 1R=limsupn→∞(|cn|1/n)1/R=lim sup_n→∞(|c_n|^1/n) where lim sup denotes the limit superior, the limit as n approaches infinity of the supremum of the sequence values after the nth position. If the sequence values are unbounded so that the lim sup is ∞, then the power series does not converge near a, while if the lim sup is 0 then the radius of convergence is ∞, meaning that the series converges on the entire plane.
