Proof: Without loss of generality assume that a=0=0. We will show first that the power series ∑ncnzn∑_nc_nz^n converges for |z|<R|z|<R, and then that it diverges for |z|>R|z|>R. First suppose |z|<R|z|<R. Let t=1/R=1/R not be 00 or ±∞.±∞. For any ε>0ε>0, there exists only a finite number of n such that |cn|n≥t+ε√(|c_n|)+ε. Now |cn|≤(t+ε)n|c_n|≤(t+ε)^n for all but a finite number of cn_n, so the series ∑ncnzn∑_nc_nz^n converges if |z|<1/(t+ε)|z|<1/(t+ε). This proves the first part. Conversely, for ε>0ε>0, |cn|≥(t−ε)n|c_n|≥(t-ε)^n for infinitely many cn_n, so if |z|=1/(t−ε)>R|z|=1/(t-ε)>R, we see that the series cannot converge because its nth term does not tend to 0.[5] Theorem for several complex
