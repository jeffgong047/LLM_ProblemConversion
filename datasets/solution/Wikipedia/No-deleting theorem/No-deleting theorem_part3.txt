theorem: Let |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ be an unknown quantum state in some Hilbert space (and let other states have their usual meaning). Then, there is no linear isometric transformation such that |ψ⟩A|ψ⟩B|A⟩C→|ψ⟩A|0⟩B|A′⟩C|ψ⟩_A|ψ⟩_B|A⟩_C→|ψ⟩_A|0⟩_B|A'⟩_C, with the final state of the ancilla being independent of |ψ⟩|ψ⟩.
