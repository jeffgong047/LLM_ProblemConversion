deletion: Suppose that there are two copies of an unknown quantum state. A pertinent question in this context is to ask if it is possible, given two identical copies, to delete one of them using quantum mechanical operations? It turns out that one cannot. The no-deleting theorem is a consequence of linearity of quantum mechanics. Like the no-cloning theorem this has important implications in quantum computing, quantum information theory and quantum mechanics in general. The process of quantum deleting takes two copies of an arbitrary, unknown quantum state at the input port and outputs a blank state along with the original. Mathematically, this can be described by: U|ψ⟩A|ψ⟩B|A⟩C=|ψ⟩A|0⟩B|A′⟩C|ψ⟩_A|ψ⟩_B|A⟩_C=|ψ⟩_A|0⟩_B|A'⟩_C where U is the deleting operation which is not necessarily unitary (but a linear operator), |ψ⟩A|ψ⟩_A is the unknown quantum state, |0⟩B|0⟩_B is the blank state, |A⟩C|A⟩_C is the initial state of the deleting machine and |A′⟩C|A'⟩_C is the final state of the machine. It may be noted that classical bits can be copied and deleted, as can qubits in orthogonal states. For example, if we have two identical qubits |00⟩|00⟩ and |11⟩|11⟩ then we can transform to |00⟩|00⟩ and |10⟩|10⟩. In this case we have deleted the second copy. However, it follows from linearity of quantum theory that there is no U that can perform the deleting operation for any arbitrary state |ψ⟩|ψ⟩. Formal statement of the no-deleting
