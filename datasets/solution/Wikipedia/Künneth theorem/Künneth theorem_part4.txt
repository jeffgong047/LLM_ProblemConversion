Example: The short exact sequences just described can easily be used to compute the homology groups with integer coefficients of the product RP2×RP2ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2 of two real projective planes, in other words, Hk(RP2×RP2;Z)_k(ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2;ℤ). These spaces are CW complexes. Denoting the homology group Hi(RP2;Z)_i(ℝℙ^2;ℤ) by hi_i for brevity's sake, one knows from a simple calculation with cellular homology that h0≅Z_0≅ℤ, h1≅Z/2Z_1≅ℤ/2ℤ, hi=0_i=0 for all other values of i. The only non-zero Tor group (torsion product) which can be formed from these values of hi_i is Tor1Z(h1,h1)≅Tor1Z(Z/2Z,Z/2Z)≅Z/2ZTor_1^ℤ(h_1,h_1)≅Tor_1^ℤ(ℤ/2ℤ,ℤ/2ℤ)≅ℤ/2ℤ. Therefore, the Künneth short exact sequence reduces in every degree to an isomorphism, because there is a zero group in each case on either the left or the right side in the sequence. The result is H0(RP2×RP2;Z)≅h0⊗h0≅ZH1(RP2×RP2;Z)≅h0⊗h1⊕h1⊗h0≅Z/2Z⊕Z/2ZH2(RP2×RP2;Z)≅h1⊗h1≅Z/2ZH3(RP2×RP2;Z)≅Tor1Z(h1,h1)≅Z/2ZH_0(ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2;ℤ) ≅ h_0_0 ≅ ℤ H_1(ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2;ℤ) ≅ h_0_1 ⊕ h_1_0 ≅ ℤ/2ℤ⊕ℤ/2ℤ H_2(ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2;ℤ) ≅ h_1_1 ≅ ℤ/2ℤ H_3(ℝℙ^2×ℝℙ^2;ℤ) ≅ Tor_1^ℤ(h_1,h_1) ≅ ℤ/2ℤ and all the other homology groups are zero.
