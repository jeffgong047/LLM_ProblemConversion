proof: The chain complex of the space X × Y is related to the chain complexes of X and Y by a natural quasi-isomorphism C∗(X×Y)≅C∗(X)⊗C∗(Y)._*(X)_*(X)_*(Y). For singular chains this is the theorem of Eilenberg and Zilber. For cellular chains on CW complexes, it is a straightforward isomorphism. Then the homology of the tensor product on the right is given by the spectral Künneth formula of homological algebra.[1] The freeness of the chain modules means that in this geometric case it is not necessary to use any hyperhomology or total derived tensor product. There are analogues of the above statements for singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology. For sheaf cohomology on an algebraic variety, Alexander Grothendieck found six spectral sequences relating the possible hyperhomology groups of two chain complexes of sheaves and the hyperhomology groups of their tensor product.[2] Künneth theorems in generalized homology and cohomology
