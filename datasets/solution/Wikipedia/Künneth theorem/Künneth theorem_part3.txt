domain: The above formula is simple because vector spaces over a field have very restricted behavior. As the coefficient ring becomes more general, the relationship becomes more complicated. The next simplest case is the case when the coefficient ring is a principal ideal domain. This case is particularly important because the integers Zℤ are a PID. In this case the equation above is no longer always true. A correction factor appears to account for the possibility of torsion phenomena. This correction factor is expressed in terms of the Tor functor, the first derived functor of the tensor product. When R is a PID, then the correct statement of the Künneth theorem is that for any topological spaces X and Y there are natural short exact sequences 0→⨁i+j=kHi(X;R)⊗RHj(Y;R)→Hk(X×Y;R)→⨁i+j=k−1Tor1R(Hi(X;R),Hj(Y;R))→0.0→⊕_i+j=kH_i(X;R)⊗_RH_j(Y;R)_k(X;R)→⊕_i+j=k-1Tor_1^R(H_i(X;R),H_j(Y;R))→0. Furthermore, these sequences split, but not canonically.
