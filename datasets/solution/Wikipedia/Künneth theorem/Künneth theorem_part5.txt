sequence: For a general commutative ring R, the homology of X and Y is related to the homology of their product by a Künneth spectral sequence Epq2=⨁q1+q2=qTorpR(Hq1(X;R),Hq2(Y;R))⇒Hp+q(X×Y;R)._pq^2=⊕_q_1+q_2=qTor_p^R(H_q_1(X;R),H_q_2(Y;R))_p+q(X;R). In the cases described above, this spectral sequence collapses to give an isomorphism or a short exact sequence. Relation with homological algebra, and idea of
