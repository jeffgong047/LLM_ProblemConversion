theories: There are many generalized (or "extraordinary") homology and cohomology theories for topological spaces. K-theory and cobordism are the best-known. Unlike ordinary homology and cohomology, they typically cannot be defined using chain complexes. Thus Künneth theorems can not be obtained by the above methods of homological algebra. Nevertheless, Künneth theorems in just the same form have been proved in very many cases by various other methods. The first were Michael Atiyah's Künneth theorem for complex K-theory and Pierre Conner and Edwin E. Floyd's result in cobordism.[3][4] A general method of proof emerged, based upon a homotopical theory of modules over highly structured ring spectra.[5][6] The homotopy category of such modules closely resembles the derived category in homological algebra.
