Joseph Louis François Bertrand Existence of a prime number between any number and its double In number theory, Bertrand's postulate is a theorem stating that for any integer n>3>3, there always exists at least one prime number p with n<p<2n−2.<p<2n-2. A less restrictive formulation is: for every n>1>1, there is always at least one prime p such that n<p<2n.<p<2n. Another formulation, where pn_n is the n-th prime, is: for n≥1≥1 pn+1<2pn._n+1<2p_n.[1] This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand[2] (1822–1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all integers 2≤n≤30000002≤3 000 000. His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev (1821–1894) in 1852[3] and so the postulate is also called the Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev's theorem. Chebyshev's theorem can also be stated as a relationship with π(x)π(x), the prime-counting function (number of primes less than or equal to x): π(x)−π(x2)≥1π(x)-π(x2)≥1, for all x≥2≥2. Prime number
