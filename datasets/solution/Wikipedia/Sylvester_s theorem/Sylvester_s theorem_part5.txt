theorems: In 1932, Erdős (1913–1996) also published a simpler proof using binomial coefficients and the Chebyshev function ϑϑ, defined as: ϑ(x)=∑p=2xln⁡(p)ϑ(x)=∑_p=2^xln(p) where p ≤ x runs over primes. See proof of Bertrand's postulate for the details.[9] Erdős proved in 1934 that for any positive integer k, there is a natural number N such that for all n > N, there are at least k primes between n and 2n. An equivalent statement had been proved in 1919 by Ramanujan (see Ramanujan prime). Better
