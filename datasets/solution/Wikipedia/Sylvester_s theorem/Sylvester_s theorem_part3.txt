Generalizations: In 1919, Ramanujan (1887–1920) used properties of the Gamma function to give a simpler proof than Chebyshev's.[4] His short paper included a generalization of the postulate, from which would later arise the concept of Ramanujan primes. Further generalizations of Ramanujan primes have also been discovered; for instance, there is a proof that 2pi−n>pifori>kwherek=π(pk)=π(Rn),2p_i-n>p_ifori>kwherek=π(p_k)=π(R_n) , with pk the kth prime and Rn the nth Ramanujan prime. Other generalizations of Bertrand's postulate have been obtained using elementary methods. (In the following, n runs through the set of positive integers.) In 2006, M. El Bachraoui proved that there exists a prime between 2n and 3n.[5] In 1973, Denis Hanson proved that there exists a prime between 3n and 4n.[6] Furthermore, in 2011, Andy Loo proved that as n tends to infinity, the number of primes between 3n and 4n also goes to infinity,[7] thereby generalizing Erdős' and Ramanujan's results (see the section on Erdős' theorems below). The first result is obtained with elementary methods. The second one is based on analytic bounds for the factorial function. Bertrand’s postulate over the Gaussian integers is an extension of the idea of the distribution of primes, but in this case on the complex plane. Thus, as Gaussian primes extend over the plane and not only along a line, and doubling a complex number is not simply multiplying by 2 but doubling its norm (multiplying by 1+i), different definitions lead to different results, some are still conjectures, some proven.[8] Sylvester's
