results: It follows from the prime number theorem that for any real ε>0ε>0 there is a n0>0_0>0 such that for all n>n0>n_0 there is a prime p such that n<p<(1+ε)n<p<(1+ε)n. It can be shown, for instance, that limn→∞π((1+ε)n)−π(n)n/log⁡n=ε,lim_n→∞π((1+ε)n)-π(n)/n/=ε, which implies that π((1+ε)n)−π(n)π((1+ε)n)-π(n) goes to infinity (and, in particular, is greater than 1 for sufficiently large n).[10] Non-asymptotic bounds have also been proved. In 1952, Jitsuro Nagura proved that for n≥25≥25 there is always a prime between n and (1+15)n(1+15)n.[11] In 1976, Lowell Schoenfeld showed that for n≥2010760≥2 010 760, there is always a prime p in the open interval n<p<(1+116597)n<p<(1+116 597)n.[12] In his 1998 doctoral thesis, Pierre Dusart improved the above result, showing that for k≥463≥463, pk+1≤(1+12ln2⁡pk)pk_k+1≤(1+1/2ln^2p_k)p_k, and in particular for x≥3275≥3 275, there exists a prime p in the interval x<p≤(1+12ln2⁡x)x<p≤(1+1/2ln^2x)x.[13] In 2010 Pierre Dusart proved that for x≥396738≥396 738 there is at least one prime p in the interval x<p≤(1+125ln2⁡x)x<p≤(1+1/25ln^2x)x.[14] In 2016, Pierre Dusart improved his result from 2010, showing (Proposition 5.4) that if x≥89693≥89 693, there is at least one prime p in the interval x<p≤(1+1ln3⁡x)x<p≤(1+1/ln^3x)x.[15] He also shows (Corollary 5.5) that for x≥468991632≥468 991 632, there is at least one prime p in the interval x<p≤(1+15000ln2⁡x)x<p≤(1+1/5 000ln^2x)x. Baker, Harman and Pintz proved that there is a prime in the interval [x−x0.525,x][x-x^0.525, x] for all sufficiently large x.[16] Dudek proved that for all n≥ee33.3^e^33.3, there is at least one prime between n3^3 and (n+1)3(n+1)^3.[17] Dudek also proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies that for all x≥2≥2 there is a prime p satisfying x−4πxlog⁡x<p≤x-4/π√(x)<p.[18]
