statement: The space of complex-valued class functions of a finite group G has a natural inner product: ⟨α,β⟩:=1|G|∑g∈Gα(g)β(g)¯⟨α,β⟩:=1/|G|∑_gα(g)β(g) where β(g)¯β(g) means the complex conjugate of the value of ββ on g. With respect to this inner product, the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis for the space of class functions, and this yields the orthogonality relation for the rows of the character table: ⟨χi,χj⟩=0ifi≠j,1ifi=j.⟨χ_i,χ_j⟩=0 i, 1 i=j. For g,h∈G,h, applying the same inner product to the columns of the character table yields: ∑χiχi(g)χi(h)¯=|CG(g)|,ifg,hareconjugate0otherwise.∑_χ_iχ_i(g)χ_i(h)=|C_G(g)|, g,h 0 where the sum is over all of the irreducible characters χiχ_i of G and the symbol |CG(g)||C_G(g)| denotes the order of the centralizer of g. Note that since g and h are conjugate iff they are in the same column of the character table, this implies that the columns of the character table are orthogonal. The orthogonality relations can aid many computations including: decomposing an unknown character as a linear combination of irreducible characters; constructing the complete character table when only some of the irreducible characters are known; finding the orders of the centralizers of representatives of the conjugacy classes of a group; and finding the order of the group.
