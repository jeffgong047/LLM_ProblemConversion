statement: Let Γ(λ)(R)mnΓ^(λ)(R)_mn be a matrix element of an irreducible matrix representation Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) of a finite group G=R={R} of order |G|, i.e. G has |G| elements. Since it can be proven that any matrix representation of any finite group is equivalent to a unitary representation, we assume Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) is unitary: ∑n=1lλΓ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ(λ)(R)nk=δmkforallR∈G,∑_n=1^l_λ Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* Γ^(λ)(R)_nk=δ_mk forall, where lλ_λ is the (finite) dimension of the irreducible representation Γ(λ)Γ^(λ).[1] The orthogonality relations, only valid for matrix elements of irreducible representations, are: ∑R∈G|G|Γ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ(μ)(R)n′m′=δλμδnn′δmm′|G|lλ.∑_R^|G| Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* Γ^(μ)(R)_n'm'=δ_λμδ_nn'δ_mm'|G|/l_λ. Here Γ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* is the complex conjugate of Γ(λ)(R)nmΓ^(λ)(R)_nm and the sum is over all elements of G. The Kronecker delta δλμδ_λμ is unity if the matrices are in the same irreducible representation Γ(λ)=Γ(μ)Γ^(λ)=Γ^(μ). If Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) and Γ(μ)Γ^(μ) are non-equivalent it is zero. The other two Kronecker delta's state that the row and column indices must be equal (n=n′=n' and m=m′=m') in order to obtain a non-vanishing result. This theorem is also known as the Great (or Grand) Orthogonality Theorem. Every group has an identity representation (all group elements mapped onto the real number 1). This is an irreducible representation. The great orthogonality relations immediately imply that ∑R∈G|G|Γ(μ)(R)nm=0∑_R^|G| Γ^(μ)(R)_nm=0 for n,m=1,…,lμ,m=1,…,l_μ and any irreducible representation Γ(μ)Γ^(μ) not equal to the identity representation.
