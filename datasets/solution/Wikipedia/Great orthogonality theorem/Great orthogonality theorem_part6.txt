implications: The trace of a matrix is a sum of diagonal matrix elements, Tr⁡(Γ(R))=∑m=1lΓ(R)mm.Tr(Γ(R))=∑_m=1^lΓ(R)_mm. The collection of traces is the character χ≡Tr⁡(Γ(R))|R∈Gχ≡{Tr(Γ(R)) | R} of a representation. Often one writes for the trace of a matrix in an irreducible representation with character χ(λ)χ^(λ) χ(λ)(R)≡Tr⁡(Γ(λ)(R)).χ^(λ)(R)≡Tr(Γ^(λ)(R)). In this notation we can write several character formulas: ∑R∈G|G|χ(λ)(R)∗χ(μ)(R)=δλμ|G|,∑_R^|G|χ^(λ)(R)^* χ^(μ)(R)=δ_λμ|G|, which allows us to check whether or not a representation is irreducible. (The formula means that the lines in any character table have to be orthogonal vectors.) And ∑R∈G|G|χ(λ)(R)∗χ(R)=n(λ)|G|,∑_R^|G|χ^(λ)(R)^* χ(R)=n^(λ)|G|, which helps us to determine how often the irreducible representation Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) is contained within the reducible representation ΓΓ with character χ(R)χ(R). For instance, if n(λ)|G|=96^(λ) |G|=96 and the order of the group is |G|=24|G|=24 then the number of times that Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) is contained within the given reducible representation ΓΓ is n(λ)=4.^(λ)=4 .
