groups: The generalization of the orthogonality relations from finite groups to compact groups (which include compact Lie groups such as SO(3)) is basically simple: Replace the summation over the group by an integration over the group. Every compact group G has unique bi-invariant Haar measure, so that the volume of the group is 1. Denote this measure by dg. Let (πα)(π^α) be a complete set of irreducible representations of G, and let ϕv,wα(g)=⟨v,πα(g)w⟩ϕ_v,w^α(g)=,π^α(g)w⟩ be a matrix coefficient of the representation παπ^α. The orthogonality relations can then be stated in two parts: 1) If πα≆πβπ^απ^β then ∫Gϕv,wα(g)ϕv′,w′β(g)dg=0∫_Gϕ_v,w^α(g)ϕ_v',w'^β(g)dg=0 2) If ei{e_i} is an orthonormal basis of the representation space παπ^α then ∫Gϕei,ejα(g)ϕem,enα(g)¯dg=δi,mδj,n1dα∫_Gϕ_e_i,e_j^α(g)ϕ_e_m,e_n^α(g)dg=δ_i,mδ_j,n1/d^α where dα^α is the dimension of παπ^α. These orthogonality relations and the fact that all of the representations have finite dimensions are consequences of the Peter–Weyl theorem. An example:
