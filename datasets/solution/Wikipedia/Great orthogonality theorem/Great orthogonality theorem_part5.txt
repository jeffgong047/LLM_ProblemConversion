objects: The 3! permutations of three objects form a group of order 6, commonly denoted S3 (symmetric group). This group is isomorphic to the point group C3v_3v, consisting of a threefold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes. The groups have a 2-dimensional irreducible representation (l = 2). In the case of S3 one usually labels this representation by the Young tableau λ=[2,1]λ=[2,1] and in the case of C3v_3v one usually writes λ=Eλ=E. In both cases the representation consists of the following six real matrices, each representing a single group element:[2] (1001)(100−1)(−12323212)(−12−32−3212)(−1232−32−12)(−12−3232−12)[ 1 0; 0 1; ] [ 1 0; 0 -1; ] [ -1/2 √(3)/2; √(3)/2 1/2; ] [ -1/2 -√(3)/2; -√(3)/2 1/2; ] [ -1/2 √(3)/2; -√(3)/2 -1/2; ] [ -1/2 -√(3)/2; √(3)/2 -1/2; ] The normalization of the (1,1) element: ∑R∈G6Γ(R)11∗Γ(R)11=12+12+(−12)2+(−12)2+(−12)2+(−12)2=3.∑_R^6 Γ(R)_11^* Γ(R)_11=1^2+1^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2=3. In the same manner one can show the normalization of the other matrix elements: (2,2), (1,2), and (2,1). The orthogonality of the (1,1) and (2,2) elements: ∑R∈G6Γ(R)11∗Γ(R)22=12+(1)(−1)+(−12)(12)+(−12)(12)+(−12)2+(−12)2=0.∑_R^6 Γ(R)_11^* Γ(R)_22=1^2+(1)(-1)+(-12)(12)+(-12)(12)+(-12)^2+(-12)^2=0. Similar relations hold for the orthogonality of the elements (1,1) and (1,2), etc. One verifies easily in the example that all sums of corresponding matrix elements vanish because of the orthogonality of the given irreducible representation to the identity representation.
