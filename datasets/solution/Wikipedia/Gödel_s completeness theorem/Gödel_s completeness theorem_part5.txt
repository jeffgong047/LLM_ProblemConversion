form: The theorem can be expressed more generally in terms of logical consequence. We say that a sentence s is a syntactic consequence of a theory T, denoted T⊢s, if s is provable from T in our deductive system. We say that s is a semantic consequence of T, denoted T⊨s, if s holds in every model of T. The completeness theorem then says that for any first-order theory T with a well-orderable language, and any sentence s in the language of T, if T⊨s, then T⊢s. Since the converse (soundness) also holds, it follows that T⊨s if and only if T⊢s, and thus that syntactic and semantic consequence are equivalent for first-order logic. This more general theorem is used implicitly, for example, when a sentence is shown to be provable from the axioms of group theory by considering an arbitrary group and showing that the sentence is satisfied by that group. Gödel's original formulation is deduced by taking the particular case of a theory without any axiom. Model existence
