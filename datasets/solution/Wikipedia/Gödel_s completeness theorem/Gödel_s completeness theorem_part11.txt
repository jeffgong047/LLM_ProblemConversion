logics: The completeness theorem is a central property of first-order logic that does not hold for all logics. Second-order logic, for example, does not have a completeness theorem for its standard semantics (but does have the completeness property for Henkin semantics), and the set of logically-valid formulas in second-order logic is not recursively enumerable. The same is true of all higher-order logics. It is possible to produce sound deductive systems for higher-order logics, but no such system can be complete. Lindstr√∂m's theorem states that first-order logic is the strongest (subject to certain constraints) logic satisfying both compactness and completeness. A completeness theorem can be proved for modal logic or intuitionistic logic with respect to Kripke semantics.
