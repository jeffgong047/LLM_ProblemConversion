theorem: The completeness theorem can also be understood in terms of consistency, as a consequence of Henkin's model existence theorem. We say that a theory T is syntactically consistent if there is no sentence s such that both s and its negation ¬s are provable from T in our deductive system. The model existence theorem says that for any first-order theory T with a well-orderable language, if T is syntactically consistent, then T has a model. Another version, with connections to the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, says: Every syntactically consistent, countable first-order theory has a finite or countable model. Given Henkin's theorem, the completeness theorem can be proved as follows: If T⊨s, then T∪¬s∪ does not have models. By the contrapositive of Henkin's theorem, then T∪¬s∪ is syntactically inconsistent. So a contradiction (⊥) is provable from T∪¬s∪ in the deductive system. Hence (T∪¬s)⊢⊥(T∪)⊢, and then by the properties of the deductive system, T⊢s. As a theorem of
