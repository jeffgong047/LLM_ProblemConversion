Proof: As mentioned above, the Freudenthal suspension theorem follows quickly from homotopy excision; this proof is in terms of the natural map πk(X)→πk+1(ΣX)π_k(X)→π_k+1(). If a space X is n-connected, then the pair of spaces (CX,X)(CX,X) is (n+1)(n+1)-connected, where CX is the reduced cone over X; this follows from the relative homotopy long exact sequence. We can decompose ΣX as two copies of CX, say (CX)+,(CX)−(CX)_+,(CX)_-, whose intersection is X. Then, homotopy excision says the inclusion map: ((CX)+,X)⊂(ΣX,(CX)−)((CX)_+,X)⊂(,(CX)_-) induces isomorphisms on πi,i<2n+2π_i,i<2n+2 and a surjection on π2n+2π_2n+2. From the same relative long exact sequence, πi(X)=πi+1(CX,X),π_i(X)=π_i+1(CX,X), and since in addition cones are contractible, πi(ΣX,(CX)−)=πi(ΣX).π_i(,(CX)_-)=π_i(). Putting this all together, we get πi(X)=πi+1((CX)+,X)=πi+1((ΣX,(CX)−)=πi+1(ΣX)π_i(X)=π_i+1((CX)_+,X)=π_i+1((,(CX)_-)=π_i+1() for i+1<2n+2+1<2n+2, i.e. i⩽2n⩽2n, as claimed above; for i=2n+1=2n+1 the left and right maps are isomorphisms, regardless of how connected X is, and the middle one is a surjection by excision, so the composition is a surjection as claimed.
