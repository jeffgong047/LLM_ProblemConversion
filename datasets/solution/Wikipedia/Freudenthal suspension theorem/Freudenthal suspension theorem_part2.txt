theorem: Let X be an n-connected pointed space (a pointed CW-complex or pointed simplicial set). The map X→Ω(ΣX)→Ω() induces a map πk(X)→πk(Ω(ΣX))π_k(X)→π_k(Ω()) on homotopy groups, where Ω denotes the loop functor and Σ denotes the reduced suspension functor. The suspension theorem then states that the induced map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism if k ≤ 2n and an epimorphism if k = 2n + 1. A basic result on loop spaces gives the relation πk(Ω(ΣX))≅πk+1(ΣX)π_k(Ω())≅π_k+1() so the theorem could otherwise be stated in terms of the map πk(X)→πk+1(ΣX),π_k(X)→π_k+1(), with the small caveat that in this case one must be careful with the indexing.
