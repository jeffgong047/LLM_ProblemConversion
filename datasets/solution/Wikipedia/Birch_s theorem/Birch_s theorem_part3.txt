Remarks: The proof of the theorem is by induction over the maximal degree of the forms f1, ..., fk. Essential to the proof is a special case, which can be proved by an application of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method, of the theorem which states that if n is sufficiently large and r is odd, then the equation c1x1r+⋯+cnxnr=0,ci∈Z,i=1,…,n_1x_1^r+⋯+c_nx_n^r=0,_i∈ℤ,ı=1,…,n has a solution in integers x1, ..., xn, not all of which are 0. The restriction to odd r is necessary, since even degree forms, such as positive definite quadratic forms, may take the value 0 only at the origin.
