bounds: Let r∠(N)_∠(N) be the size of the largest subset of [N]2[N]^2 which contains no corner. The best known bounds are N22(c1+o(1))log2⁡N≤r∠(N)≤N2(log⁡log⁡N)c2,N^2/2^(c_1+o(1))√(log_2N)_∠(N)≤N^2/(log)^c_2, where c1≈1.822_1≈1.822 and c2≈0.0137_2≈0.0137. The lower bound is due to Green,[3] building on the work of Linial and Shraibman.[4] The upper bound is due to Shkredov.[5] Multidimensional
