Theorem: The multidimensional Szemerédi theorem states that for any fixed finite subset S⊆Zd⊆ℤ^d, and for every ε>0ε>0, there exists a positive integer N(S,ε)(S,ε) such that for any N≥N(S,ε)(S,ε), any subset A⊆1,…,Nd⊆{1,…,N}^d with size at least εNd^d contains a subset of the form a⋅S+h+h. This theorem follows from the multidimensional corners theorem by a simple projection argument.[6] In particular, Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions follows directly from the ordinary corners theorem.
