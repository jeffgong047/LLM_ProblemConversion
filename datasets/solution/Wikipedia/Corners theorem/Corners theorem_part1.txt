In arithmetic combinatorics, the corners theorem states that for every ε>0ε>0, for large enough N, any set of at least εN2^2 points in the N×N grid 1,…,N2{1,…,N}^2 contains a corner, i.e., a triple of points of the form (x,y),(x+h,y),(x,y+h){(x,y),(x+h,y),(x,y+h)} with h≠0≠0. It was first proved by Miklós Ajtai and Endre Szemerédi in 1974 using Szemerédi's theorem.[1] In 2003, József Solymosi gave a short proof using the triangle removal lemma.[2]
