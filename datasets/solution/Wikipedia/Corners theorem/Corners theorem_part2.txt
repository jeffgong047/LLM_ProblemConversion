Statement: Define a corner to be a subset of Z2ℤ^2 of the form (x,y),(x+h,y),(x,y+h){(x,y),(x+h,y),(x,y+h)}, where x,y,h∈Z,y,h∈ℤ and h≠0≠0. For every ε>0ε>0, there exists a positive integer N(ε)(ε) such that for any N≥N(ε)(ε), any subset A⊆1,…,N2⊆{1,…,N}^2 with size at least εN2^2 contains a corner. The condition h≠0≠0 can be relaxed to h>0>0 by showing that if A is dense, then it has some dense subset that is centrally symmetric. Proof
