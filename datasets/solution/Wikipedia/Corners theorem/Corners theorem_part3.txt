overview: What follows is a sketch of Solymosi's argument. Suppose A⊂1,…,N2⊂{1,…,N}^2 is corner-free. Construct an auxiliary tripartite graph G with parts X=x1,…,xN={x_1,…,x_N}, Y=y1,…,yN={y_1,…,y_N}, and Z=z1,…,z2N={z_1,…,z_2N}, where xi_i corresponds to the line x=i=i, yj_j corresponds to the line y=j=j, and zk_k corresponds to the line x+y=k+y=k. Connect two vertices if the intersection of their corresponding lines lies in A. Note that a triangle in G corresponds to a corner in A, except in the trivial case where the lines corresponding to the vertices of the triangle concur at a point in A. It follows that every edge of G is in exactly one triangle, so by the triangle removal lemma, G has o(|V(G)|2)(|V(G)|^2) edges, so |A|=o(N2)|A|=o(N^2), as desired. Quantitative
