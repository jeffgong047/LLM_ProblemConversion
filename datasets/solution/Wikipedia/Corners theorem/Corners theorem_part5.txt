extension: A corner in Zdℤ^d is a set of points of the form a∪a+hei:1≤i≤d{a}∪{a+he_i:1}, where e1,…,ed_1,…,e_d is the standard basis of Rdℝ^d, and h≠0≠0. The natural extension of the corners theorem to this setting can be shown using the hypergraph removal lemma, in the spirit of Solymosi's proof. The hypergraph removal lemma was shown independently by Gowers[6] and Nagle, Rödl, Schacht and Skokan.[7] Multidimensional Szemerédi's
