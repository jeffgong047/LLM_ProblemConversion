theorem: Brauer's second main theorem (Brauer 1944, 1959) gives, for an element t whose order is a power of a prime p, a criterion for a (characteristic p) block of CG(t)_G(t) to correspond to a given block of G, via generalized decomposition numbers. These are the coefficients which occur when the restrictions of ordinary characters of G (from the given block) to elements of the form tu, where u ranges over elements of order prime to p in CG(t)_G(t), are written as linear combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters of CG(t)_G(t). The content of the theorem is that it is only necessary to use Brauer characters from blocks of CG(t)_G(t) which are Brauer correspondents of the chosen block of G. Brauer's third main
