In mathematics, the quotient of subspace theorem is an important property of finite-dimensional normed spaces, discovered by Vitali Milman.[1] Let (X, ||·||) be an N-dimensional normed space. There exist subspaces Z ⊂ Y ⊂ X such that the following holds: The quotient space E = Y / Z is of dimension dim E ≥ c N, where c > 0 is a universal constant. The induced norm || · || on E, defined by ‖e‖=miny∈e‖y‖,e∈E,e=min_yy,, is uniformly isomorphic to Euclidean. That is, there exists a positive quadratic form ("Euclidean structure") Q on E, such that Q(e)K≤‖e‖≤KQ(e)√(Q(e))/K≤e√(Q(e)) for e∈E,, with K > 1 a universal constant. The statement is relative easy to prove by induction on the dimension of Z (even for Y=Z, X=0, c=1) with a K that depends only on N; the point of the theorem is that K is independent of N. In fact, the constant c can be made arbitrarily close to 1, at the expense of the constant K becoming large. The original proof allowed c(K)≈1−const/log⁡log⁡K.(K)≈1-const/log.[2]
