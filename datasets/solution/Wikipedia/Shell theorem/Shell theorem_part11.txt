relativity: An analogue for shell theorem exists in general relativity (GR). Spherical symmetry implies that the metric has time-independent Schwarzschild geometry, even if a central mass is undergoing gravitational collapse (Misner et al. 1973; see Birkhoff's theorem). The metric thus has form ds2=−(1−2M/r)dt2+(1−2M/r)−1dr2+r2dΩ2^2=-(1-2M/r) dt^2+(1-2M/r)^-1 dr^2+r^2 dΩ^2 (using geometrized units, where G=c=1=c=1). For r>R>0>R>0 (where R is the radius of some mass shell), mass acts as a delta function at the origin. For r<R<R, shells of mass may exist externally, but for the metric to be non-singular at the origin, M must be zero in the metric. This reduces the metric to flat Minkowski space; thus external shells have no gravitational effect. This result illuminates the gravitational collapse leading to a black hole and its effect on the motion of light-rays and particles outside and inside the event horizon (Hartle 2003, chapter 12). See
