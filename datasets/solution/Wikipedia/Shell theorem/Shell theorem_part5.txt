law: The shell theorem is an immediate consequence of Gauss's law for gravity saying that ∫Sg⋅dS=−4πGM∫_S𝐠· d𝐒=-4 where M is the mass of the part of the spherically symmetric mass distribution that is inside the sphere with radius r and ∫Sg⋅dS=∫Sg⋅n^dS∫_S𝐠· d𝐒=∫_S𝐠·𝐧̂ dS is the surface integral of the gravitational field g over any closed surface inside which the total mass is M, the unit vector n^𝐧̂ being the outward normal to the surface. The gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution like a mass point, a spherical shell or a homogeneous sphere must also be spherically symmetric. If n^𝐧̂ is a unit vector in the direction from the point of symmetry to another point the gravitational field at this other point must therefore be g=g(r)n^𝐠=g(r)𝐧̂ where g(r) only depends on the distance r to the point of symmetry Selecting the closed surface as a sphere with radius r with center at the point of symmetry the outward normal to a point on the surface, n^𝐧̂, is precisely the direction pointing away from the point of symmetry of the mass distribution. One, therefore, has that g=g(r)n^𝐠=g(r)𝐧̂ and ∫Sg⋅dS=g(r)∫SdS=g(r)4πr2∫_S𝐠· d𝐒=g(r)∫_S dS=g(r)4^2 as the area of the sphere is 4πr2. From Gauss's law it then follows that g(r)4πr2=−4πGM,(r)4^2=-4, or, g(r)=−GMr2.(r)=-GM/r^2. Converses and
