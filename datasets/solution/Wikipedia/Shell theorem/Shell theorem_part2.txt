sphere: There are three steps to proving Newton's shell theorem. First, the equation for a gravitational field due to a ring of mass will be derived. Arranging an infinite number of infinitely thin rings to make a disc, this equation involving a ring will be used to find the gravitational field due to a disk. Finally, arranging an infinite number of infinitely thin discs to make a sphere, this equation involving a disc will be used to find the gravitational field due to a sphere. The gravitational field E at a position called P at (x,y)=(−p,0)(x,y)=(-p,0) on the x-axis due to a point of mass M at the origin is Epoint=GMp2_point=GM/p^2 Suppose that this mass is moved upwards along the y-axis to the point (−p,R)(-p,R). The distance between P and the point mass is now longer than before; It becomes the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs p and R which is p2+R2√(p^2+R^2). Hence, the gravitational field of the elevated point is: Eelevatedpoint=GMp2+R2_elevatedpoint=GM/p^2+R^2 The magnitude of the gravitational field that would pull a particle at point P in the x-direction is the gravitational field multiplied by cos⁡(θ)cos(θ) where θθ is the angle adjacent to the x-axis. In this case, cos⁡(θ)=pp2+R2cos(θ)=p/√(p^2+R^2). Hence, the magnitude of the gravitational field in the x-direction, Ex_x is: Ex=GMcos⁡θp2+R2_x=GMcosθ/p^2+R^2 Substituting in cos⁡(θ)cos(θ) gives Ex=GMp(p2+R2)3/2_x=GMp/(p^2+R^2)^3/2 Suppose that this mass is evenly distributed in a ring centered at the origin and facing point P with the same radius R. Because all of the mass is located at the same angle with respect to the x-axis, and the distance between the points on the ring is the same distance as before, the gravitational field in the x-direction at point P due to the ring is the same as a point mass located at a point R units above the y-axis: Ering=GMp(p2+R2)3/2_ring=GMp/(p^2+R^2)^3/2 To find the gravitational field at point P due to a disc, an infinite number of infinitely thin rings facing P, each with a radius y, width of dy, and mass of dM may be placed inside one another to form a disc. The mass of any one of the rings dM is the mass of the disc multiplied by the ratio of the area of the ring 2πydy2 dy to the total area of the disc πR2^2. So, dM=M⋅2ydyR2=M·2y dy/R^2. Hence, a small change in the gravitational field, E is: dE=GpdM(p2+y2)3/2=Gp dM/(p^2+y^2)^3/2 Substituting in dM and integrating both sides gives the gravitational field of the disk: E=∫GMp⋅2ydyR2(p2+y2)3/2=∫GMp·2y dy/R^2/(p^2+y^2)^3/2 Adding up the contribution to the gravitational field from each of these rings will yield the expression for the gravitational field due to a disc. This is equivalent to integrating this above expression from y=0=0 to y=R=R, resulting in: Edisc=2GMR2(1−pp2+R2)_disc=2GM/R^2(1-p/√(p^2+R^2)) To find the gravitational field at point P due to a sphere centered at the origin, an infinite amount of infinitely thin discs facing P, each with a radius R, width of dx, and mass of dM may be placed together. These discs' radii R follow the height of the cross section of a sphere (with constant radius a) which is an equation of a semi-circle: R=a2−x2=√(a^2-x^2). x varies from −a-a to a. The mass of any of the discs dM is the mass of the sphere M multiplied by the ratio of the volume of an infinitely thin disc divided by the volume of a sphere (with constant radius a). The volume of an infinitely thin disc is πR2dx^2 dx, or π(a2−x2)dxπ(a^2-x^2)dx. So, dM=πM(a2−x2)dx43πa3=(a^2-x^2) dx/4/3^3. Simplifying gives dM=3M(a2−x2)dx4a3=3M(a^2-x^2) dx/4a^3. Each discs' position away from P will vary with its position within the 'sphere' made of the discs, so p must be replaced with p+x+x. Replacing M with dM, R with a2−x2√(a^2-x^2), and p with p+x+x in the 'disc' equation yields: dE=(2G[3M(a2−x2)]4a3)a2−x22⋅(1−p+x(p+x)2+a2−x22)dx=(2G[3M(a^2-x^2)]/4a^3)/√(a^2-x^2)^2·(1-p+x/√((p+x)^2+√(a^2-x^2)^2)) dx Simplifying, ∫dE=∫−aa3GM2a3(1−p+xp2+a2+2px)dx=∫_-a^a3GM/2a^3(1-p+x/√(p^2+a^2+2px))dx Integrating the gravitational field of each thin disc from x=−a=-a to x=+a=+a with respect to x, and doing some careful algebra, yields Newton's shell theorem: E=GMp2=GM/p^2 where p is the distance between the center of the spherical mass and an arbitrary point P. The gravitational field of a spherical mass may be calculated by treating all the mass as a point particle at the center of the sphere. Outside a
