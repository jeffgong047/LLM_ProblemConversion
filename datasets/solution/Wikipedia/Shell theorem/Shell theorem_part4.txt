shell: For a point inside the shell, the difference is that when θ is equal to zero, ϕ takes the value π radians and s the value R − r. When θ increases from 0 to π radians, ϕ decreases from the initial value π radians to zero and s increases from the initial value R − r to the value R + r. This can all be seen in the following figure Inserting these bounds into the primitive function s−r2−R2s-r^2-R^2/s one gets that, in this case Fr=0,_r=0, saying that the net gravitational forces acting on the point mass from the mass elements of the shell, outside the measurement point, cancel out. Generalization: If f=krp=k/r^p, the resultant force inside the shell is: F(r)=GMm4r2R∫R−rR+r(1sp−2+r2−R2sp)ds(r)=GMm/4r^2R∫_R-r^R+r(1/s^p-2+r^2-R^2/s^p) ds The above results into F(r)(r) being identically zero if and only if p=2=2 Outside the shell (i.e. r>R>R or r<−R<-R): F(r)=GMm4r2R∫r−Rr+R(1sp−2+r2−R2sp)ds(r)=GMm/4r^2R∫_r-R^r+R(1/s^p-2+r^2-R^2/s^p) ds Derivation using Gauss's
