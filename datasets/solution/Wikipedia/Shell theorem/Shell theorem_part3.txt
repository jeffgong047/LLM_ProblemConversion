shell: A solid, spherically symmetric body can be modeled as an infinite number of concentric, infinitesimally thin spherical shells. If one of these shells can be treated as a point mass, then a system of shells (i.e. the sphere) can also be treated as a point mass. Consider one such shell (the diagram shows a cross-section): (Note: the dθθ in the diagram refers to the small angle, not the arc length. The arc length is Rdθ dθ.) Applying Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, the sum of the forces due to the mass elements in the shaded band is dF=Gms2dM.=Gm/s^2dM. However, since there is partial cancellation due to the vector nature of the force in conjunction with the circular band's symmetry, the leftover component (in the direction pointing towards m) is given by dFr=Gms2cos⁡(φ)dM_r=Gm/s^2cos(φ) dM The total force on m, then, is simply the sum of the force exerted by all the bands. By shrinking the width of each band, and increasing the number of bands, the sum becomes an integral expression: Fr=∫dFr_r=_r Since G and m are constants, they may be taken out of the integral: Fr=Gm∫cos⁡(φ)s2dM._r=Gm∫cos(φ)/s^2 dM. To evaluate this integral, one must first express dM as a function of dθθ The total surface of a spherical shell is 4πR24^2 while the surface area of the thin slice between θθ and θ+dθθ+dθ is 2πRsin⁡(θ)Rdθ=2πR2sin⁡(θ)dθ2sin(θ)R dθ=2^2sin(θ) dθ If the mass of the shell is M, one therefore has that dM=2πR2sin⁡(θ)4πR2Mdθ=12Msin⁡(θ)dθ=2^2sin(θ)/4^2M dθ=1/2Msin(θ) dθ and Fr=GMm2∫sin⁡(θ)cos⁡(φ)s2dθ_r=GMm/2∫sin(θ)cos(φ)/s^2 dθ By the law of cosines, cos⁡(φ)=r2+s2−R22rscos(φ)=r^2+s^2-R^2/2rs and cos⁡(θ)=r2+R2−s22rR.cos(θ)=r^2+R^2-s^2/2rR. These two relations link the three parameters θθ, φφ and s that appear in the integral together. As θθ increases from 00 to ππ radians, φφ varies from the initial value 0 to a maximal value before finally returning to zero at θ=πθ=π. At the same time, s increases from the initial value r−R-R to the final value r+R+R as θθ increases from 0 to ππ radians. This is illustrated in the following animation: (Note: As viewed from m, the shaded blue band appears as a thin annulus whose inner and outer radii converge to Rsin⁡(θ)sin(θ) as dθθ vanishes.) To find a primitive function to the integrand, one has to make s the independent integration variable instead of θθ. Performing an implicit differentiation of the second of the "cosine law" expressions above yields −sin⁡(θ)dθ=−2s2rRds-sin(θ) dθ=-2s/2rR ds and thus sin⁡(θ)dθ=srRds.sin(θ) dθ=s/rR ds. It follows that Fr=GMm21rR∫scos⁡(φ)s2ds=GMm2rR∫cos⁡(φ)sds_r=GMm/21/rR∫scos(φ)/s^2 ds=GMm/2rR∫cos(φ)/s ds where the new integration variable s increases from r−R-R to r+R+R. Inserting the expression for cos⁡(φ)cos(φ) using the first of the "cosine law" expressions above, one finally gets that Fr=GMm4r2R∫(1+r2−R2s2)ds._r=GMm/4r^2R∫(1+r^2-R^2/s^2) A primitive function to the integrand is s−r2−R2s,-r^2-R^2/s and inserting the bounds r−R-R and r+R+R for the integration variable s in this primitive function, one gets that Fr=GMmr2,_r=GMm/r^2, saying that the gravitational force is the same as that of a point mass in the center of the shell with the same mass. Finally, integrate all infinitesimally thin spherical shell with mass of dM, and we can obtain the total gravity contribution of a solid ball to the object outside the ball Ftotal=∫dFr=Gmr2∫dM._total=_r=Gm/r^2. Between the radius of x to x+dx+dx, dM can be expressed as a function of x, i.e., dM=4πx2dx43πR3M=3Mx2dxR3=4^2dx/4/3^3M=3Mx^2dx/R^3 Therefore, the total gravity is Ftotal=3GMmr2R3∫0Rx2dx=GMmr2_total=3GMm/r^2R^3∫_0^Rx^2 dx=GMm/r^2 which suggests that the gravity of a solid spherical ball to an exterior object can be simplified as that of a point mass in the center of the ball with the same mass.
