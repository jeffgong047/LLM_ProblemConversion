proof: Consider two lattice points A and B separated by a translation vector r. Consider an angle α such that a rotation of angle α about any lattice point is a symmetry of the lattice. Rotating about point B by α maps point A to a new point A'. Similarly, rotating about point A by α maps B to a point B'. Since both rotations mentioned are symmetry operations, A' and B' must both be lattice points. Due to periodicity of the crystal, the new vector r' which connects them must be equal to an integer multiple of r: r′=mr𝐫'=m𝐫 with m integer. The four translation vectors, three of length r=|r|=|𝐫| and one, connecting A' and B', of length r′=|r′|'=|𝐫'|, form a trapezium. Therefore, the length of r' is also given by: r′=2rcos⁡α−r.'=2rcosα-r. Combining the two equations gives: cos⁡α=m+12=M2cosα=m+1/2=M/2 where M=m+1=m+1 is also an integer. Bearing in mind that |cos⁡α|≤1|cosα|≤1 we have allowed integers M∈−2,−1,0,1,2∈{-2,-1,0,1,2}. Solving for possible values of αα reveals that the only values in the 0° to 180° range are 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, and 180°. In radians, the only allowed rotations consistent with lattice periodicity are given by 2π/n, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. This corresponds to 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold symmetry, respectively, and therefore excludes the possibility of 5-fold or greater than 6-fold symmetry. Short trigonometry
