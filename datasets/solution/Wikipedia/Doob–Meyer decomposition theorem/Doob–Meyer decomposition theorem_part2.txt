History: In 1953, Doob published the Doob decomposition theorem which gives a unique decomposition for certain discrete time martingales.[1] He conjectured a continuous time version of the theorem and in two publications in 1962 and 1963 Paul-Andr√© Meyer proved such a theorem, which became known as the Doob-Meyer decomposition.[2][3] In honor of Doob, Meyer used the term "class D" to refer to the class of supermartingales for which his unique decomposition theorem applied.[4] Class D
