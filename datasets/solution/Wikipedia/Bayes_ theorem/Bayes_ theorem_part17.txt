Example: Figure 4: Tree diagram illustrating the beetle example. R, C, P and P¯P are the events rare, common, pattern and no pattern. Percentages in parentheses are calculated. Three independent values are given, so it is possible to calculate the inverse tree. An entomologist spots what might, due to the pattern on its back, be a rare subspecies of beetle. A full 98% of the members of the rare subspecies have the pattern, so P(Pattern | Rare) = 98%. Only 5% of members of the common subspecies have the pattern. The rare subspecies is 0.1% of the total population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare: what is P(Rare | Pattern)? From the extended form of Bayes' theorem (since any beetle is either rare or common), P(Rare|Pattern)=P(Pattern|Rare)P(Rare)P(Pattern)=P(Pattern|Rare)P(Rare)P(Pattern|Rare)P(Rare)+P(Pattern|Common)P(Common)=0.98×0.0010.98×0.001+0.05×0.999≈1.9
