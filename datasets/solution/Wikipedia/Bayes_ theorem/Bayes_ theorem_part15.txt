interpretation: In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, probability measures a "degree of belief". Bayes' theorem links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief will probably rise or fall, but might even remain the same, depending on the results. For proposition A and evidence B, P (A), the prior, is the initial degree of belief in A. P (A | B), the posterior, is the degree of belief after incorporating news that B is true. the quotient P(B | A)/P(B) represents the support B provides for A.
