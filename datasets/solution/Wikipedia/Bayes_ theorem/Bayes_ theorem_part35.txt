results: Parental genetic testing can detect around 90% of known disease alleles in parents that can lead to carrier or affected status in their child. Cystic fibrosis is a heritable disease caused by an autosomal recessive mutation on the CFTR gene,[29] located on the q arm of chromosome 7.[30] Bayesian analysis of a female patient with a family history of cystic fibrosis (CF), who has tested negative for CF, demonstrating how this method was used to determine her risk of having a child born with CF: Because the patient is unaffected, she is either homozygous for the wild-type allele, or heterozygous. To establish prior probabilities, a Punnett square is used, based on the knowledge that neither parent was affected by the disease but both could have been carriers: MotherFather W Homozygous for the wild-type allele (a non-carrier) M Heterozygous(a CF carrier) W Homozygous for the wild-type allele (a non-carrier) WW MW M Heterozygous (a CF carrier) MW MM (affected by cystic fibrosis) Given that the patient is unaffected, there are only three possibilities. Within these three, there are two scenarios in which the patient carries the mutant allele. Thus the prior probabilities are 2⁄3 and 1⁄3. Next, the patient undergoes genetic testing and tests negative for cystic fibrosis. This test has a 90% detection rate, so the conditional probabilities of a negative test are 1/10 and 1. Finally, the joint and posterior probabilities are calculated as before. Hypothesis Hypothesis 1: Patient is a carrier Hypothesis 2: Patient is not a carrier Prior Probability 2/3 1/3 Conditional Probability of a negative test 1/10 1 Joint Probability 1/15 1/3 Posterior Probability 1/6 5/6 After carrying out the same analysis on the patient's male partner (with a negative test result), the chances of their child being affected is equal to the product of the parents' respective posterior probabilities for being carriers times the chances that two carriers will produce an affected offspring (1⁄4).
