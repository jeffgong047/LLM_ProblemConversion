variables: Figure 5: Bayes' theorem applied to an event space generated by continuous random variables X and Y. There exists an instance of Bayes' theorem for each point in the domain. In practice, these instances might be parametrized by writing the specified probability densities as a function of x and y. Consider a sample space Î© generated by two random variables X and Y. In principle, Bayes' theorem applies to the events A = {X = x} and B = {Y = y}. P(X=x|Y=y)=P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)P(Y=y)(X=x|Y=y)=P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)/P(Y=y) However, terms become 0 at points where either variable has finite probability density. To remain useful, Bayes' theorem must be formulated in terms of the relevant densities (see Derivation). Simple
