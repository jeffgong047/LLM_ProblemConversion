logic: Using P(¬B|A)=1−P(B|A)()=1-P(B) twice, one may use Bayes' theorem to also express P(¬B|¬A)(|) in terms of P(A|B)(A) and without negations: P(¬B|¬A)=1−(1−P(A|B))P(B)P(¬A)(|)=1-(1-P(A))P(B)/P(), when P(¬A)=1−P(A)≠0()=1-P(A)≠0. From this we can read off the inference P(A|B)=1⟹P(¬B|¬A)=1(A)=1(|)=1. In words: If certainly B implies A, we infer that certainly ¬A implies ¬B. Where P(B)≠0(B)≠0, the two implications being certain are equivalent statements. In the probability formulas, the conditional probability P(A|B)(A) generalizes the logical implication B⟹A, where now beyond assigning true or false, we assign probability values to statements. The assertion of B⟹A is captured by certainty of the conditional, the assertion of P(A|B)=1(A)=1. Relating the directions of implication, Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of the contraposition law, which in classical propositional logic can be expressed as: (B⟹A)⟺(¬A⟹¬B)(B)(). In this relation between implications, the positions of A resp. B get flipped. The corresponding formula in terms of probability calculus is Bayes' theorem, which in its expanded form involving the prior probability/base rate a of only A, is expressed as:[24] P(A|B)=P(B|A)a(A)P(B|A)a(A)+P(B|¬A)a(¬A)(A)=P(B)a(A)/P(B) a(A)+P(B|) a().
