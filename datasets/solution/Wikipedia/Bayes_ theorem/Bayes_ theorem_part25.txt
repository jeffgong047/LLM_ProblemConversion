form: Figure 6: A way to conceptualize event spaces generated by continuous random variables X and Y A continuous event space is often conceptualized in terms of the numerator terms. It is then useful to eliminate the denominator using the law of total probability. For fY(y), this becomes an integral: fY(y)=∫−∞∞fY|X=ξ(y)fX(ξ)dξ._Y(y)=∫_-∞^∞f_Y|X=ξ(y)f_X(ξ) dξ. Bayes' rule in odds
