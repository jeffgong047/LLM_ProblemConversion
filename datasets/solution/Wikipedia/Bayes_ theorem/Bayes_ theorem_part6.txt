variables: For two continuous random variables X and Y, Bayes' theorem may be analogously derived from the definition of conditional density: fX|Y=y(x)=fX,Y(x,y)fY(y)_X=y(x)=f_X,Y(x,y)/f_Y(y) fY|X=x(y)=fX,Y(x,y)fX(x)_Y=x(y)=f_X,Y(x,y)/f_X(x) Therefore, fX|Y=y(x)=fY|X=x(y)fX(x)fY(y)._X=y(x)=f_Y=x(y)f_X(x)/f_Y(y).
