events: Bayes' theorem may be derived from the definition of conditional probability: P(A|B)=P(A∩B)P(B),ifP(B)≠0,(A)=P(A)/P(B),ifP(B)≠0, where P(A∩B)(A) is the probability of both A and B being true. Similarly, P(B|A)=P(A∩B)P(A),ifP(A)≠0.(B)=P(A)/P(A),ifP(A)≠0. Solving for P(A∩B)(A) and substituting into the above expression for P(A|B)(A) yields Bayes' theorem: P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)P(B),ifP(B)≠0.(A)=P(B)P(A)/P(B),ifP(B)≠0. For continuous random
