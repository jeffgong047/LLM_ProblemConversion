theorem: Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:[17] P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)P(B)(A)=P(B)P(A)/P(B) where A and B are events and P(B)≠0(B)≠0. P(A|B)(A) is a conditional probability: the probability of event A occurring given that B is true. It is also called the posterior probability of A given B. P(B|A)(B) is also a conditional probability: the probability of event B occurring given that A is true. It can also be interpreted as the likelihood of A given a fixed B because P(B|A)=L(A|B)(B)=L(A). P(A)(A) and P(B)(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the prior probability and marginal probability.
