testing: Figure 1: Using a frequency box to show P(User|Positive)(User|Positive) visually by comparison of shaded areas Suppose, a particular test for whether someone has been using cannabis is 90% sensitive, meaning the true positive rate (TPR) = 0.90. Therefore, it leads to 90% true positive results (correct identification of drug use) for cannabis users. The test is also 80% specific, meaning true negative rate (TNR) = 0.80. Therefore, the test correctly identifies 80% of non-use for non-users, but also generates 20% false positives, or false positive rate (FPR) = 0.20, for non-users. Assuming 0.05 prevalence, meaning 5% of people use cannabis, what is the probability that a random person who tests positive is really a cannabis user? The Positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the proportion of persons who are actually positive out of all those testing positive, and can be calculated from a sample as: PPV = True positive / Tested positive If sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are known, PPV can be calculated using Bayes theorem. Let P(User|Positive)(User|Positive) mean "the probability that someone is a cannabis user given that they test positive," which is what is meant by PPV. We can write: P(User|Positive)=P(Positive|User)P(User)P(Positive)=P(Positive|User)P(User)P(Positive|User)P(User)+P(Positive|Non-user)P(Non-user)=0.90×0.050.90×0.05+0.20×0.95=0.0450.045+0.19≈19 The fact that P(Positive)=P(Positive|User)P(User)+P(Positive|Non-user)P(Non-user)(Positive)=P(Positive|User)P(User)+P(Positive|Non-user)P(Non-user) is a direct application of the Law of Total Probability. In this case, it says that the probability that someone tests positive is the probability that a user tests positive, times the probability of being a user, plus the probability that a non-user tests positive, times the probability of being a non-user. This is true because the classifications user and non-user form a partition of a set, namely the set of people who take the drug test. This combined with the definition of conditional probability results in the above statement. In other words, even if someone tests positive, the probability that they are a cannabis user is only 19%—this is because in this group, only 5% of people are users, and most positives are false positives coming from the remaining 95%. If 1,000 people were tested: 950 are non-users and 190 of them give false positive (0.20 × 950) 50 of them are users and 45 of them give true positive (0.90 × 50) The 1,000 people thus yields 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine drug users, about 19%. See Figure 1 for an illustration using a frequency box, and note how small the pink area of true positives is compared to the blue area of false positives. Sensitivity or
