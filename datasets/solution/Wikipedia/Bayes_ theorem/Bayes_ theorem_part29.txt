logic: Bayes' theorem represents a special case of deriving inverted conditional opinions in subjective logic expressed as: (ωA| BS,ωA| ¬BS)=(ωB|AS,ωB|¬AS)ϕ aA,(ω_A|̃B^S,ω_A|̃^S)=(ω_B^S,ω_B|^S)ϕa_A, where ϕ ϕ denotes the operator for inverting conditional opinions. The argument (ωB|AS,ωB|¬AS)(ω_B^S,ω_B|^S) denotes a pair of binomial conditional opinions given by source S, and the argument aA_A denotes the prior probability (aka. the base rate) of A. The pair of derivative inverted conditional opinions is denoted (ωA| BS,ωA| ¬BS)(ω_A|̃B^S,ω_A|̃^S). The conditional opinion ωA|BSω_A^S generalizes the probabilistic conditional P(A|B)(A), i.e. in addition to assigning a probability the source S can assign any subjective opinion to the conditional statement (A|B)(A). A binomial subjective opinion ωASω_A^S is the belief in the truth of statement A with degrees of epistemic uncertainty, as expressed by source S. Every subjective opinion has a corresponding projected probability P(ωAS)(ω_A^S). The application of Bayes' theorem to projected probabilities of opinions is a homomorphism, meaning that Bayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of projected probabilities of opinions: P(ωA| BS)=P(ωB|AS)a(A)P(ωB|AS)a(A)+P(ωB|¬AS)a(¬A).(ω_A|̃B^S)=P(ω_B^S)a(A)/P(ω_B^S)a(A)+P(ω_B|^S)a(). Hence, the subjective Bayes' theorem represents a generalization of Bayes' theorem.[25]
