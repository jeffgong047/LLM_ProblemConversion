Statement: The L-balance theorem of Gorenstein and Walter states that if X is a finite group and T a 2-subgroup of X then L2′(CX(T))≤L2′(X)_2'(C_X(T))_2'(X) Here L2′(X) stands for the 2-layer of a group X, which is the product of all the 2-components of the group, the minimal subnormal subgroups of X mapping onto components of X/O(X). A consequence is that if a and b are commuting involutions of a group G then L2′(L2′(Ca)∩Cb)=L2′(L2′(Cb)∩Ca)_2'(L_2'(C_a)_b)=L_2'(L_2'(C_b)_a) This is the property called L-balance. More generally similar results are true if the prime 2 is replaced by a prime p, and in this case the condition is called Lp-balance, but the proof of this requires the classification of finite simple groups (more precisely the Schreier conjecture).
