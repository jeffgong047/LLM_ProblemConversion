Relates tightness of measures to relative compactness in the space of probability measures In measure theory Prokhorov's theorem relates tightness of measures to relative compactness (and hence weak convergence) in the space of probability measures. It is credited to the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov, who considered probability measures on complete separable metric spaces. The term "Prokhorovâ€™s theorem" is also applied to later generalizations to either the direct or the inverse statements.
