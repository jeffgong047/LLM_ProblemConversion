Corollaries: For Euclidean spaces we have that: If (μn)(μ_n) is a tight sequence in P(Rm)𝒫(ℝ^m) (the collection of probability measures on m-dimensional Euclidean space), then there exist a subsequence (μnk)(μ_n_k) and a probability measure μ∈P(Rm)μ∈𝒫(ℝ^m) such that μnkμ_n_k converges weakly to μμ. If (μn)(μ_n) is a tight sequence in P(Rm)𝒫(ℝ^m) such that every weakly convergent subsequence (μnk)(μ_n_k) has the same limit μ∈P(Rm)μ∈𝒫(ℝ^m), then the sequence (μn)(μ_n) converges weakly to μμ.
