Extension: Prokhorov's theorem can be extended to consider complex measures or finite signed measures. Theorem: Suppose that (S,ρ)(S,ρ) is a complete separable metric space and ΠΠ is a family of Borel complex measures on S. The following statements are equivalent: ΠΠ is sequentially precompact; that is, every sequence μn⊂Π{μ_n}⊂Π has a weakly convergent subsequence. ΠΠ is tight and uniformly bounded in total variation norm.
