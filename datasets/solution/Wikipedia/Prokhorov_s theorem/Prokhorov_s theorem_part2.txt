Statement: Let (S,ρ)(S,ρ) be a separable metric space. Let P(S)𝒫(S) denote the collection of all probability measures defined on S (with its Borel σ-algebra). Theorem. A collection K⊂P(S)⊂𝒫(S) of probability measures is tight if and only if the closure of K is sequentially compact in the space P(S)𝒫(S) equipped with the topology of weak convergence. The space P(S)𝒫(S) with the topology of weak convergence is metrizable. Suppose that in addition, (S,ρ)(S,ρ) is a complete metric space (so that (S,ρ)(S,ρ) is a Polish space). There is a complete metric d0_0 on P(S)𝒫(S) equivalent to the topology of weak convergence; moreover, K⊂P(S)⊂𝒫(S) is tight if and only if the closure of K in (P(S),d0)(𝒫(S),d_0) is compact.
