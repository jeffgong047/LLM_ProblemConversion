extension: Theorem[3] (Andenaes, 1970) — Let p:X→R:X→ℝ be a sublinear function on a real vector space X,, let f:M→R:M→ℝ be a linear functional on a vector subspace M of X such that f≤p on M,, and let S⊆X be any subset of X.. Then there exists a linear functional F:X→R:X→ℝ on X that extends f,, satisfies F≤p on X,, and is (pointwise) maximal on S in the following sense: if F^:X→RF:X→ℝ is a linear functional on X that extends f and satisfies F^≤pF on X,, then F≤F^≤F on S implies F=F^=F on S.. If S=s={s} is a singleton set (where s∈X is some vector) and if F:X→R:X→ℝ is such a maximal dominated linear extension of f:M→R,:M→ℝ, then F(s)=infm∈M[f(s)+p(s−m)].(s)=inf_m[f(s)+p(s-m)].[3] Vector valued
