spaces: The dominated extension theorem for real linear functionals implies the following alternative statement of the Hahn–Banach theorem that can be applied to linear functionals on real or complex vector spaces. Hahn–Banach theorem[3][9] — Suppose p:X→R:X→ℝ a seminorm on a vector space X over the field K,𝐊, which is either Rℝ or C.ℂ. If f:M→K:M→𝐊 is a linear functional on a vector subspace M such that |f(m)|≤p(m)forallm∈M.|f(m)|(m) forallm. then there exists a linear functional F:X→K:X→𝐊 such that F(m)=f(m)forallm∈M,(m)=f(m) forallm, |F(x)|≤p(x)forallx∈X.|F(x)|(x) forallx. The theorem remains true if the requirements on p are relaxed to require only that for all x,y∈X,y and all scalars a and b satisfying |a|+|b|≤1,|a|+|b|≤1,[8] p(ax+by)≤|a|p(x)+|b|p(y).(ax+by)≤|a|p(x)+|b|p(y). This condition holds if and only if p is a convex and balanced function satisfying p(0)≤0,(0)≤0, or equivalently, if and only if it is convex, satisfies p(0)≤0,(0)≤0, and p(ux)≤p(x)(ux)(x) for all x∈X and all unit length scalars u.. A complex-valued functional F is said to be dominated by p if |F(x)|≤p(x)|F(x)|(x) for all x in the domain of F.. With this terminology, the above statements of the Hahn–Banach theorem can be restated more succinctly: Hahn–Banach dominated extension theorem: If p:X→R:X→ℝ is a seminorm defined on a real or complex vector space X,, then every dominated linear functional defined on a vector subspace of X has a dominated linear extension to all of X.. In the case where X is a real vector space and p:X→R:X→ℝ is merely a convex or sublinear function, this conclusion will remain true if both instances of "dominated" (meaning |F|≤p|F|) are weakened to instead mean "dominated above" (meaning F≤p).[7][8] Proof The following observations allow the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces to be applied to (complex-valued) linear functionals on complex vector spaces. Every linear functional F:X→C:X→ℂ on a complex vector space is completely determined by its real part Re⁡F:X→R ReF:X→ℝ through the formula[6][proof 1] F(x)=Re⁡F(x)−iRe⁡F(ix)forallx∈X(x) = ReF(x)-iReF(ix) forallx and moreover, if ‖⋅‖· is a norm on X then their dual norms are equal: ‖F‖=‖Re⁡F‖.F=ReF.[10] In particular, a linear functional on X extends another one defined on M⊆X if and only if their real parts are equal on M (in other words, a linear functional F extends f if and only if Re⁡FReF extends Re⁡fRef). The real part of a linear functional on X is always a real-linear functional (meaning that it is linear when X is considered as a real vector space) and if R:X→R:X→ℝ is a real-linear functional on a complex vector space then x↦R(x)−iR(ix)(x)-iR(ix) defines the unique linear functional on X whose real part is R.. If F is a linear functional on a (complex or real) vector space X and if p:X→R:X→ℝ is a seminorm then[6][proof 2] |F|≤pifandonlyifRe⁡F≤p.|F| ≤ p ifandonlyif ReF ≤ p. Stated in simpler language, a linear functional is dominated by a seminorm p if and only if its real part is dominated above by p.. Proof of Hahn–Banach for complex vector spaces by reduction to real vector spaces[3] Suppose p:X→R:X→ℝ is a seminorm on a complex vector space X and let f:M→C:M→ℂ be a linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of X that satisfies |f|≤p|f| on M.. Consider X as a real vector space and apply the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces to the real-linear functional Re⁡f:M→R Ref:M→ℝ to obtain a real-linear extension R:X→R:X→ℝ that is also dominated above by p,, so that it satisfies R≤p on X and R=Re⁡f=Ref on M.. The map F:X→C:X→ℂ defined by F(x)=R(x)−iR(ix)(x) = R(x)-iR(ix) is a linear functional on X that extends f (because their real parts agree on M) and satisfies |F|≤p|F| on X (because Re⁡F≤pReF and p is a seminorm). ◼▪ The proof above shows that when p is a seminorm then there is a one-to-one correspondence between dominated linear extensions of f:M→C:M→ℂ and dominated real-linear extensions of Re⁡f:M→R;Ref:M→ℝ; the proof even gives a formula for explicitly constructing a linear extension of f from any given real-linear extension of its real part. Continuity A linear functional F on a topological vector space is continuous if and only if this is true of its real part Re⁡F;ReF; if the domain is a normed space then ‖F‖=‖Re⁡F‖F=ReF (where one side is infinite if and only if the other side is infinite).[10] Assume X is a topological vector space and p:X→R:X→ℝ is sublinear function. If p is a continuous sublinear function that dominates a linear functional F then F is necessarily continuous.[6] Moreover, a linear functional F is continuous if and only if its absolute value |F||F| (which is a seminorm that dominates F) is continuous.[6] In particular, a linear functional is continuous if and only if it is dominated by some continuous sublinear function.
