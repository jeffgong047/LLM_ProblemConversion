theorems: See also: Krein–Milman theorem § Relation to other statements The proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces (HB) commonly uses Zorn's lemma, which in the axiomatic framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is equivalent to the axiom of choice (AC). It was discovered by Łoś and Ryll-Nardzewski[12] and independently by Luxemburg[11] that HB can be proved using the ultrafilter lemma (UL), which is equivalent (under ZF) to the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI). BPI is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice and it was later shown that HB is strictly weaker than BPI.[32] The ultrafilter lemma is equivalent (under ZF) to the Banach–Alaoglu theorem,[33] which is another foundational theorem in functional analysis. Although the Banach–Alaoglu theorem implies HB,[34] it is not equivalent to it (said differently, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem is strictly stronger than HB). However, HB is equivalent to a certain weakened version of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem for normed spaces.[35] The Hahn–Banach theorem is also equivalent to the following statement:[36] (∗): On every Boolean algebra B there exists a "probability charge", that is: a non-constant finitely additive map from B into [0,1].[0,1]. (BPI is equivalent to the statement that there are always non-constant probability charges which take only the values 0 and 1.) In ZF, the Hahn–Banach theorem suffices to derive the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set.[37] Moreover, the Hahn–Banach theorem implies the Banach–Tarski paradox.[38] For separable Banach spaces, D. K. Brown and S. G. Simpson proved that the Hahn–Banach theorem follows from WKL0, a weak subsystem of second-order arithmetic that takes a form of Kőnig's lemma restricted to binary trees as an axiom. In fact, they prove that under a weak set of assumptions, the two are equivalent, an example of reverse mathematics.[39][40] See
