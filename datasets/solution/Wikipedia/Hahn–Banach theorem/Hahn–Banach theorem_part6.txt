theorem: The Hahn–Banach theorem can be used to guarantee the existence of continuous linear extensions of continuous linear functionals. Hahn–Banach continuous extension theorem[14] — Every continuous linear functional f defined on a vector subspace M of a (real or complex) locally convex topological vector space X has a continuous linear extension F to all of X.. If in addition X is a normed space, then this extension can be chosen so that its dual norm is equal to that of f.. In category-theoretic terms, the underlying field of the vector space is an injective object in the category of locally convex vector spaces. On a normed (or seminormed) space, a linear extension F of a bounded linear functional f is said to be norm-preserving if it has the same dual norm as the original functional: ‖F‖=‖f‖.F=f. Because of this terminology, the second part of the above theorem is sometimes referred to as the "norm-preserving" version of the Hahn–Banach theorem.[15] Explicitly: Norm-preserving Hahn–Banach continuous extension theorem[15] — Every continuous linear functional f defined on a vector subspace M of a (real or complex) normed space X has a continuous linear extension F to all of X that satisfies ‖f‖=‖F‖.f=F. Proof of the continuous extension
