spaces: The continuous extension theorem might fail if the topological vector space (TVS) X is not locally convex. For example, for 0<p<1,0<p<1, the Lebesgue space Lp([0,1])^p([0,1]) is a complete metrizable TVS (an F-space) that is not locally convex (in fact, its only convex open subsets are itself Lp([0,1])^p([0,1]) and the empty set) and the only continuous linear functional on Lp([0,1])^p([0,1]) is the constant 00 function (Rudin 1991, §1.47). Since Lp([0,1])^p([0,1]) is Hausdorff, every finite-dimensional vector subspace M⊆Lp([0,1])^p([0,1]) is linearly homeomorphic to Euclidean space Rdim⁡Mℝ^ or Cdim⁡Mℂ^ (by F. Riesz's theorem) and so every non-zero linear functional f on M is continuous but none has a continuous linear extension to all of Lp([0,1]).^p([0,1]). However, it is possible for a TVS X to not be locally convex but nevertheless have enough continuous linear functionals that its continuous dual space X∗^* separates points; for such a TVS, a continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace might have a continuous linear extension to the whole space. If the TVS X is not locally convex then there might not exist any continuous seminorm p:X→R:X→ℝ defined on X (not just on M) that dominates f,, in which case the Hahn–Banach theorem can not be applied as it was in the above proof of the continuous extension theorem. However, the proof's argument can be generalized to give a characterization of when a continuous linear functional has a continuous linear extension: If X is any TVS (not necessarily locally convex), then a continuous linear functional f defined on a vector subspace M has a continuous linear extension F to all of X if and only if there exists some continuous seminorm p on X that dominates f.. Specifically, if given a continuous linear extension F then p:=|F|:=|F| is a continuous seminorm on X that dominates f;; and conversely, if given a continuous seminorm p:X→R:X→ℝ on X that dominates f then any dominated linear extension of f to X (the existence of which is guaranteed by the Hahn–Banach theorem) will be a continuous linear extension.
