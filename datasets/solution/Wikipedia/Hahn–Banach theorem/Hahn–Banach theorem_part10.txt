hyperplanes: Since points are trivially convex, geometric Hahn-Banach implies that functionals can detect the boundary of a set. In particular, let X be a real topological vector space and A⊆X be convex with Int⁡A≠∅.IntA≠∅. If a0∈A∖Int⁡A_0∖IntA then there is a functional that is vanishing at a0,_0, but supported on the interior of A..[19] Call a normed space X smooth if at each point x in its unit ball there exists a unique closed hyperplane to the unit ball at x.. Köthe showed in 1983 that a normed space is smooth at a point x if and only if the norm is Gateaux differentiable at that point.[3] Balanced or disked
