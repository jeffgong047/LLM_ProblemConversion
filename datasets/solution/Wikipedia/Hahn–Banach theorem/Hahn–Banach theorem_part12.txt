Applications: The Hahn–Banach theorem is the first sign of an important philosophy in functional analysis: to understand a space, one should understand its continuous functionals. For example, linear subspaces are characterized by functionals: if X is a normed vector space with linear subspace M (not necessarily closed) and if z is an element of X not in the closure of M, then there exists a continuous linear map f:X→K:X→𝐊 with f(m)=0(m)=0 for all m∈M,, f(z)=1,(z)=1, and ‖f‖=dist⁡(z,M)−1.f=dist(z,M)^-1. (To see this, note that dist⁡(⋅,M)dist(·,M) is a sublinear function.) Moreover, if z is an element of X, then there exists a continuous linear map f:X→K:X→𝐊 such that f(z)=‖z‖(z)=z and ‖f‖≤1.f≤1. This implies that the natural injection J from a normed space X into its double dual V∗∗^** is isometric. That last result also suggests that the Hahn–Banach theorem can often be used to locate a "nicer" topology in which to work. For example, many results in functional analysis assume that a space is Hausdorff or locally convex. However, suppose X is a topological vector space, not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex, but with a nonempty, proper, convex, open set M. Then geometric Hahn-Banach implies that there is a hyperplane separating M from any other point. In particular, there must exist a nonzero functional on X — that is, the continuous dual space X∗^* is non-trivial.[3][25] Considering X with the weak topology induced by X∗,^*, then X becomes locally convex; by the second bullet of geometric Hahn-Banach, the weak topology on this new space separates points. Thus X with this weak topology becomes Hausdorff. This sometimes allows some results from locally convex topological vector spaces to be applied to non-Hausdorff and non-locally convex spaces.
