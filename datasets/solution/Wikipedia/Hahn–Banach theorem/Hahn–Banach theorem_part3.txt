theorem: A real-valued function f:M→R:M→ℝ defined on a subset M of X is said to be dominated (above) by a function p:X→R:X→ℝ if f(m)≤p(m)(m)(m) for every m∈M.. Hence the reason why the following version of the Hahn-Banach theorem is called the dominated extension theorem. Hahn–Banach dominated extension theorem (for real linear functionals)[4][5][6] — If p:X→R:X→ℝ is a sublinear function (such as a norm or seminorm for example) defined on a real vector space X then any linear functional defined on a vector subspace of X that is dominated above by p has at least one linear extension to all of X that is also dominated above by p.. Explicitly, if p:X→R:X→ℝ is a sublinear function, which by definition means that it satisfies p(x+y)≤p(x)+p(y)andp(tx)=tp(x)forallx,y∈Xandallrealt≥0,(x+y)(x)+p(y) and(tx)=tp(x) forall x,y andallreal t≥0, and if f:M→R:M→ℝ is a linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of X such that f(m)≤p(m)forallm∈M(m)(m) forallm then there exists a linear functional F:X→R:X→ℝ such that F(m)=f(m)forallm∈M,(m)=f(m) forallm, F(x)≤p(x)forallx∈X.(x)(x) forallx. Moreover, if p is a seminorm then |F(x)|≤p(x)|F(x)|(x) necessarily holds for all x∈X.. The theorem remains true if the requirements on p are relaxed to require only that p be a convex function:[7][8] p(tx+(1−t)y)≤tp(x)+(1−t)p(y)forall0<t<1andx,y∈X.(tx+(1-t)y)(x)+(1-t)p(y) forall0<t<1andx,y. A function p:X→R:X→ℝ is convex and satisfies p(0)≤0(0)≤0 if and only if p(ax+by)≤ap(x)+bp(y)(ax+by)(x)+bp(y) for all vectors x,y∈X,y and all non-negative real a,b≥0,b≥0 such that a+b≤1.+b≤1. Every sublinear function is a convex function. On the other hand, if p:X→R:X→ℝ is convex with p(0)≥0,(0)≥0, then, as it follows plainly from the definitions, the function defined by p0(x)=definft>0p(tx)t_0(x) def= inf_t>0p(tx)/t is sublinear, bounded above by p0≤p,_0, and satisfies F≤p0_0 for every linear functional F≤p.. So the extension of the Hahn–Banach theorem to convex functionals does not have a much larger content than the classical one stated for sublinear functionals. If F:X→R:X→ℝ is linear then F≤p if and only if[4] −p(−x)≤F(x)≤p(x)forallx∈X,-p(-x)(x)(x) forallx, which is the (equivalent) conclusion that some authors[4] write instead of F≤p.. It follows that if p:X→R:X→ℝ is also symmetric, meaning that p(−x)=p(x)(-x)=p(x) holds for all x∈X,, then F≤p if and only |F|≤p.|F|. Every norm is a seminorm and both are symmetric balanced sublinear functions. A sublinear function is a seminorm if and only if it is a balanced function. On a real vector space (although not on a complex vector space), a sublinear function is a seminorm if and only if it is symmetric. The identity function R→Rℝ→ℝ on X:=R:=ℝ is an example of a sublinear function that is not a seminorm. For complex or real vector
