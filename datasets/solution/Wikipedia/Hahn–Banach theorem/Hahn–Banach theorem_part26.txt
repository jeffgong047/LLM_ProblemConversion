Notes: ^ This definition means, for instance, that Fb(x)=Fb(0+1x)=f(0)+1b=b_b(x)=F_b(0+1x)=f(0)+1b=b and if m∈M then Fb(m)=Fb(m+0x)=f(m)+0b=f(m)._b(m)=F_b(m+0x)=f(m)+0b=f(m). In fact, if G:M⊕Rx→R:M⊕ℝx→ℝ is any linear extension of f to M⊕Rx⊕ℝx then G=Fb=F_b for b:=G(x).:=G(x). In other words, every linear extension of f to M⊕Rx⊕ℝx is of the form Fb_b for some (unique) b.. ^ Explicitly, for any real number b∈R,∈ℝ, Fb≤p_b on M⊕Rx⊕ℝx if and only if a≤b≤c.. Combined with the fact that Fb(x)=b,_b(x)=b, it follows that the dominated linear extension of f to M⊕Rx⊕ℝx is unique if and only if a=c,=c, in which case this scalar will be the extension's values at x.. Since every linear extension of f to M⊕Rx⊕ℝx is of the form Fb_b for some b,, the bounds a≤b=Fb(x)≤c=F_b(x) thus also limit the range of possible values (at x) that can be taken by any of f's dominated linear extensions. Specifically, if F:X→R:X→ℝ is any linear extension of f satisfying F≤p then for every x∈X∖M,, supm∈M[−p(−m−x)−f(m)]≤F(x)≤infm∈M[p(m+x)−f(m)].sup_m[-p(-m-x)-f(m)] ≤ F(x) ≤ inf_m[p(m+x)-f(m)]. ^ Geometric illustration: The geometric idea of the above proof can be fully presented in the case of X=R2,M=(x,0):x∈R.=ℝ^2,M={(x,0):x∈ℝ}. First, define the simple-minded extension f0(x,y)=f(x),_0(x,y)=f(x), It doesn't work, since maybe f0≤p_0. But it is a step in the right direction. p−f0-f_0 is still convex, and p−f0≥f−f0.-f_0-f_0. Further, f−f0-f_0 is identically zero on the x-axis. Thus we have reduced to the case of f=0,p≥0=0,p≥0 on the x-axis. If p≥0≥0 on R2,ℝ^2, then we are done. Otherwise, pick some v∈R2,∈ℝ^2, such that p(v)<0.(v)<0. The idea now is to perform a simultaneous bounding of p on v+M+M and −v+M-v+M such that p≥b on v+M+M and p≥−b≥-b on −v+M,-v+M, then defining f (w+rv)=rbf̃(w+rv)=rb would give the desired extension. Since −v+M,v+M-v+M,v+M are on opposite sides of M,, and p<0<0 at some point on v+M,+M, by convexity of p,, we must have p≥0≥0 on all points on −v+M.-v+M. Thus infu∈−v+Mp(u)inf_u∈-v+Mp(u) is finite. Geometrically, this works because z:p(z)<0{z:p(z)<0} is a convex set that is disjoint from M,, and thus must lie entirely on one side of M.. Define b=−infu∈−v+Mp(u).=-inf_u∈-v+Mp(u). This satisfies p≥−b≥-b on −v+M.-v+M. It remains to check the other side. For all v+w∈v+M,+w+M, convexity implies that for all −v+w′∈−v+M,p(v+w)+p(−v+w′)≥2p((w+w′)/2)=0,-v+w'∈-v+M,p(v+w)+p(-v+w')≥2p((w+w')/2)=0, thus p(v+w)≥supu∈−v+M−p(u)=b.(v+w)≥sup_u∈-v+M-p(u)=b. Since during the proof, we only used convexity of p, we see that the lemma remains true for merely convex p.. ^ Like every non-negative scalar multiple of a norm, this seminorm ‖f‖‖⋅‖f · (the product of the non-negative real number ‖f‖f with the norm ‖⋅‖·) is a norm when ‖f‖f is positive, although this fact is not needed for the proof. Proofs ^ If z=a+ib∈C=a+ib∈ℂ has real part Re⁡z=aRez=a then −Re⁡(iz)=b,-Re(iz)=b, which proves that z=Re⁡z−iRe⁡(iz).=Rez-iRe(iz). Substituting F(x)(x) in for z and using iF(x)=F(ix)(x)=F(ix) gives F(x)=Re⁡F(x)−iRe⁡F(ix).(x)=ReF(x)-iReF(ix). ◼▪ ^ Let F be any homogeneous scalar-valued map on X (such as a linear functional) and let p:X→R:X→ℝ be any map that satisfies p(ux)=p(x)(ux)=p(x) for all x and unit length scalars u (such as a seminorm). If |F|≤p|F| then Re⁡F≤|Re⁡F|≤|F|≤p.ReF≤|ReF|≤|F|. For the converse, assume Re⁡F≤pReF and fix x∈X.. Let r=|F(x)|=|F(x)| and pick any θ∈Rθ∈ℝ such that F(x)=reiθ;(x)=re^iθ; it remains to show r≤p(x).(x). Homogeneity of F implies F(e−iθx)=r(e^-iθx)=r is real so that Re⁡F(e−iθx)=F(e−iθx).ReF(e^-iθx)=F(e^-iθx). By assumption, Re⁡F≤pReF and p(e−iθx)=p(x),(e^-iθx)=p(x), so that r=Re⁡F(e−iθx)≤p(e−iθx)=p(x),=ReF(e^-iθx)(e^-iθx)=p(x), as desired. ◼▪ ^ The map F being an extension of f means that domain⁡f⊆domain⁡Fdomainf⊆domainF and F(m)=f(m)(m)=f(m) for every m∈domain⁡f.∈domainf. Consequently, |f(m)|:‖m‖≤1,m∈domain⁡f=|F(m)|:‖m‖≤1,m∈domain⁡f⊆|F(x)|:‖x‖≤1,x∈domain⁡F{|f(m)|:m≤1,m∈domainf}={|F(m)|:m≤1,m∈domainf}⊆{|F(x) |:x≤1,x∈domainF} and so the supremum of the set on the left hand side, which is ‖f‖,f, does not exceed the supremum of the right hand side, which is ‖F‖.F. In other words, ‖f‖≤‖F‖.f≤F.
