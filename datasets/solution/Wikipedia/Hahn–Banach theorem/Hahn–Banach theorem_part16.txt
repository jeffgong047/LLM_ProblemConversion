Generalizations: General template There are now many other versions of the Hahn–Banach theorem. The general template for the various versions of the Hahn–Banach theorem presented in this article is as follows: p:X→R:X→ℝ is a sublinear function (possibly a seminorm) on a vector space X,, M is a vector subspace of X (possibly closed), and f is a linear functional on M satisfying |f|≤p|f| on M (and possibly some other conditions). One then concludes that there exists a linear extension F of f to X such that |F|≤p|F| on X (possibly with additional properties). Theorem[3] — If D is an absorbing disk in a real or complex vector space X and if f be a linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of X such that |f|≤1|f|≤1 on M∩D,, then there exists a linear functional F on X extending f such that |F|≤1|F|≤1 on D..
