functions: The following theorem of Mazur–Orlicz (1953) is equivalent to the Hahn–Banach theorem. Mazur–Orlicz theorem[3] — Let p:X→R:X→ℝ be a sublinear function on a real or complex vector space X,, let T be any set, and let R:T→R:T→ℝ and v:T→X:T be any maps. The following statements are equivalent: there exists a real-valued linear functional F on X such that F≤p on X and R≤F∘v on T; for any finite sequence s1,…,sn_1,…,s_n of n>0>0 non-negative real numbers, and any sequence t1,…,tn∈T_1,…,t_n of elements of T,, ∑i=1nsiR(ti)≤p(∑i=1nsiv(ti)).∑_i=1^ns_iR(t_i)(∑_i=1^ns_iv(t_i)). The following theorem characterizes when any scalar function on X (not necessarily linear) has a continuous linear extension to all of X.. Theorem (The extension principle[30]) — Let f a scalar-valued function on a subset S of a topological vector space X.. Then there exists a continuous linear functional F on X extending f if and only if there exists a continuous seminorm p on X such that |∑i=1naif(si)|≤p(∑i=1naisi)|∑_i=1^na_if(s_i)|(∑_i=1^na_is_i) for all positive integers n and all finite sequences a1,…,an_1,…,a_n of scalars and elements s1,…,sn_1,…,s_n of S..
