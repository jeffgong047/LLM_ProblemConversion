Hahn–Banach: See also: Vector-valued Hahn–Banach theorems A set ΓΓ of maps X→X is commutative (with respect to function composition ∘ ∘ ) if F∘G=G∘F=G for all F,G∈Γ.,G∈Γ. Say that a function f defined on a subset M of X is ΓΓ-invariant if L(M)⊆M(M) and f∘L=f=f on M for every L∈Γ.∈Γ. An invariant Hahn–Banach theorem[29] — Suppose ΓΓ is a commutative set of continuous linear maps from a normed space X into itself and let f be a continuous linear functional defined some vector subspace M of X that is ΓΓ-invariant, which means that L(M)⊆M(M) and f∘L=f=f on M for every L∈Γ.∈Γ. Then f has a continuous linear extension F to all of X that has the same operator norm ‖f‖=‖F‖f=F and is also ΓΓ-invariant, meaning that F∘L=F=F on X for every L∈Γ.∈Γ. This theorem may be summarized: Every ΓΓ-invariant continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace of a normed space X has a ΓΓ-invariant Hahn–Banach extension to all of X..[29] For nonlinear
