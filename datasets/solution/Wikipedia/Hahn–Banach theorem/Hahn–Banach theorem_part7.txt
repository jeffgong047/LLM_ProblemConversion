theorem: The following observations allow the continuous extension theorem to be deduced from the Hahn–Banach theorem.[16] The absolute value of a linear functional is always a seminorm. A linear functional F on a topological vector space X is continuous if and only if its absolute value |F||F| is continuous, which happens if and only if there exists a continuous seminorm p on X such that |F|≤p|F| on the domain of F..[17] If X is a locally convex space then this statement remains true when the linear functional F is defined on a proper vector subspace of X.. Proof of the continuous extension theorem for locally convex spaces[16] Let f be a continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of a locally convex topological vector space X.. Because X is locally convex, there exists a continuous seminorm p:X→R:X→ℝ on X that dominates f (meaning that |f(m)|≤p(m)|f(m)|(m) for all m∈M). By the Hahn–Banach theorem, there exists a linear extension of f to X,, call it F,, that satisfies |F|≤p|F| on X.. This linear functional F is continuous since |F|≤p|F| and p is a continuous seminorm. Proof for normed spaces A linear functional f on a normed space is continuous if and only if it is bounded, which means that its dual norm ‖f‖=sup|f(m)|:‖m‖≤1,m∈domain⁡ff=sup{|f(m)|:m≤1,m∈domainf} is finite, in which case |f(m)|≤‖f‖‖m‖|f(m)|≤fm holds for every point m in its domain. Moreover, if c≥0≥0 is such that |f(m)|≤c‖m‖|f(m)|m for all m in the functional's domain, then necessarily ‖f‖≤c.f. If F is a linear extension of a linear functional f then their dual norms always satisfy ‖f‖≤‖F‖f≤F[proof 3] so that equality ‖f‖=‖F‖f=F is equivalent to ‖F‖≤‖f‖,F≤f, which holds if and only if |F(x)|≤‖f‖‖x‖|F(x)|≤fx for every point x in the extension's domain. This can be restated in terms of the function ‖f‖‖⋅‖:X→Rf ·:X→ℝ defined by x↦‖f‖‖x‖,↦f x, which is always a seminorm:[note 4] A linear extension of a bounded linear functional f is norm-preserving if and only if the extension is dominated by the seminorm ‖f‖‖⋅‖.f ·. Applying the Hahn–Banach theorem to f with this seminorm ‖f‖‖⋅‖f · thus produces a dominated linear extension whose norm is (necessarily) equal to that of f,, which proves the theorem: Proof of the norm-preserving Hahn–Banach continuous extension theorem[15] Let f be a continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of a normed space X.. Then the function p:X→R:X→ℝ defined by p(x)=‖f‖‖x‖(x)=f x is a seminorm on X that dominates f,, meaning that |f(m)|≤p(m)|f(m)|(m) holds for every m∈M.. By the Hahn–Banach theorem, there exists a linear functional F on X that extends f (which guarantees ‖f‖≤‖F‖f≤F) and that is also dominated by p,, meaning that |F(x)|≤p(x)|F(x)|(x) for every x∈X.. The fact that ‖f‖f is a real number such that |F(x)|≤‖f‖‖x‖|F(x)|≤fx for every x∈X,, guarantees ‖F‖≤‖f‖.F≤f. Since ‖F‖=‖f‖F=f is finite, the linear functional F is bounded and thus continuous.
