theory: To illustrate an actual application of the Hahn–Banach theorem, we will now prove a result that follows almost entirely from the Hahn–Banach theorem. Proposition — Suppose X is a Hausdorff locally convex TVS over the field K𝐊 and Y is a vector subspace of X that is TVS–isomorphic to KI𝐊^I for some set I.. Then Y is a closed and complemented vector subspace of X.. Proof Since KI𝐊^I is a complete TVS so is Y,, and since any complete subset of a Hausdorff TVS is closed, Y is a closed subset of X.. Let f=(fi)i∈I:Y→KI=(f_i)_i:Y→𝐊^I be a TVS isomorphism, so that each fi:Y→K_i:Y→𝐊 is a continuous surjective linear functional. By the Hahn–Banach theorem, we may extend each fi_i to a continuous linear functional Fi:X→K_i:X→𝐊 on X.. Let F:=(Fi)i∈I:X→KI:=(F_i)_i:X→𝐊^I so F is a continuous linear surjection such that its restriction to Y is F|Y=(Fi|Y)i∈I=(fi)i∈I=f.|_Y=(F_i|_Y)_i=(f_i)_i=f. Let P:=f−1∘F:X→Y,:=f^-1:X, which is a continuous linear map whose restriction to Y is P|Y=f−1∘F|Y=f−1∘f=1Y,|_Y=f^-1|_Y=f^-1=1_Y, where 1Y1_Y denotes the identity map on Y.. This shows that P is a continuous linear projection onto Y (that is, P∘P=P=P). Thus Y is complemented in X and X=Y⊕ker⁡P=Y⊕ in the category of TVSs. ◼▪ The above result may be used to show that every closed vector subspace of RNℝ^ℕ is complemented because any such space is either finite dimensional or else TVS–isomorphic to RN.ℝ^ℕ.
