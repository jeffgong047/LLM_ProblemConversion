seminorms: Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms[27][28] — If p:M→R:M→ℝ is a seminorm defined on a vector subspace M of X,, and if q:X→R:X→ℝ is a seminorm on X such that p≤q|M,≦|_M, then there exists a seminorm P:X→R:X→ℝ on X such that P|M=p|_M=p on M and P≤q≦ on X.. Proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms Let S be the convex hull of m∈M:p(m)≤1∪x∈X:q(x)≤1.{m:p(m)≤1}∪{x:q(x)≤1}. Because S is an absorbing disk in X,, its Minkowski functional P is a seminorm. Then p=P=P on M and P≤q≦ on X.. So for example, suppose that f is a bounded linear functional defined on a vector subspace M of a normed space X,, so its the operator norm ‖f‖f is a non-negative real number. Then the linear functional's absolute value p:=|f|:=|f| is a seminorm on M and the map q:X→R:X→ℝ defined by q(x)=‖f‖‖x‖(x)=f x is a seminorm on X that satisfies p≤q|M≦|_M on M.. The Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms guarantees the existence of a seminorm P:X→R:X→ℝ that is equal to |f||f| on M (since P|M=p=|f||_M=p=|f|) and is bounded above by P(x)≤‖f‖‖x‖(x)≤f x everywhere on X (since P≤q≦).
