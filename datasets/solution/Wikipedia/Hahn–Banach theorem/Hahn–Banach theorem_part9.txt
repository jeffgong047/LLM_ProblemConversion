theorems): See also: Hyperplane separation theorem The key element of the Hahn–Banach theorem is fundamentally a result about the separation of two convex sets: −p(−x−n)−f(n):n∈M,{-p(-x-n)-f(n):n}, and p(m+x)−f(m):m∈M.{p(m+x)-f(m):m}. This sort of argument appears widely in convex geometry,[18] optimization theory, and economics. Lemmas to this end derived from the original Hahn–Banach theorem are known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorems.[19][20] They are generalizations of the hyperplane separation theorem, which states that two disjoint nonempty convex subsets of a finite-dimensional space Rnℝ^n can be separated by some affine hyperplane, which is a fiber (level set) of the form f−1(s)=x:f(x)=s^-1(s)={x:f(x)=s} where f≠0≠0 is a non-zero linear functional and s is a scalar. Theorem[19] — Let A and B be non-empty convex subsets of a real locally convex topological vector space X.. If Int⁡A≠∅IntA≠∅ and B∩Int⁡A=∅∩IntA=∅ then there exists a continuous linear functional f on X such that supf(A)≤inff(B)(A)≤(B) and f(a)<inff(B)(a)<(B) for all a∈Int⁡A∈IntA (such an f is necessarily non-zero). When the convex sets have additional properties, such as being open or compact for example, then the conclusion can be substantially strengthened: Theorem[3][21] — Let A and B be convex non-empty disjoint subsets of a real topological vector space X.. If A is open then A and B are separated by a closed hyperplane. Explicitly, this means that there exists a continuous linear map f:X→K:X→𝐊 and s∈R∈ℝ such that f(a)<s≤f(b)(a)<s(b) for all a∈A,b∈B.,b. If both A and B are open then the right-hand side may be taken strict as well. If X is locally convex, A is compact, and B closed, then A and B are strictly separated: there exists a continuous linear map f:X→K:X→𝐊 and s,t∈R,t∈ℝ such that f(a)<t<s<f(b)(a)<t<s<f(b) for all a∈A,b∈B.,b. If X is complex (rather than real) then the same claims hold, but for the real part of f.. Then following important corollary is known as the Geometric Hahn–Banach theorem or Mazur's theorem (also known as Ascoli–Mazur theorem[22]). It follows from the first bullet above and the convexity of M.. Theorem (Mazur)[23] — Let M be a vector subspace of the topological vector space X and suppose K is a non-empty convex open subset of X with K∩M=∅.=∅. Then there is a closed hyperplane (codimension-1 vector subspace) N⊆X that contains M,, but remains disjoint from K.. Mazur's theorem clarifies that vector subspaces (even those that are not closed) can be characterized by linear functionals. Corollary[24] (Separation of a subspace and an open convex set) — Let M be a vector subspace of a locally convex topological vector space X,, and U be a non-empty open convex subset disjoint from M.. Then there exists a continuous linear functional f on X such that f(m)=0(m)=0 for all m∈M and Re⁡f>0Ref>0 on U.. Supporting
