equations: The Hahn–Banach theorem is often useful when one wishes to apply the method of a priori estimates. Suppose that we wish to solve the linear differential equation Pu=f=f for u,, with f given in some Banach space X. If we have control on the size of u in terms of ‖f‖Xf_X and we can think of u as a bounded linear functional on some suitable space of test functions g,, then we can view f as a linear functional by adjunction: (f,g)=(u,P∗g).(f,g)=(u,P^*g). At first, this functional is only defined on the image of P,, but using the Hahn–Banach theorem, we can try to extend it to the entire codomain X. The resulting functional is often defined to be a weak solution to the equation. Characterizing reflexive Banach
