echo: As a demonstration of Loschmidt's paradox, a famous modern counter example (not to Boltzmann's original gas-related H-theorem, but to a closely related analogue) is the phenomenon of spin echo.[15] In the spin echo effect, it is physically possible to induce time reversal in an interacting system of spins. An analogue to Boltzmann's H for the spin system can be defined in terms of the distribution of spin states in the system. In the experiment, the spin system is initially perturbed into a non-equilibrium state (high H), and, as predicted by the H theorem the quantity H soon decreases to the equilibrium value. At some point, a carefully constructed electromagnetic pulse is applied that reverses the motions of all the spins. The spins then undo the time evolution from before the pulse, and after some time the H actually increases away from equilibrium (once the evolution has completely unwound, the H decreases once again to the minimum value). In some sense, the time reversed states noted by Loschmidt turned out to be not completely impractical. Poincar√©
