mechanical: We let qi and pi be our generalized coordinates for a set of r particles. Then we consider a function f that returns the probability density of particles, over the states in phase space. Note how this can be multiplied by a small region in phase space, denoted by δq1...δpr_1..._r, to yield the (average) expected number of particles in that region. δn=f(q1...pr,t)δq1δp1...δqrδpr.=f(q_1...p_r,t) _1_1..._r_r. Tolman offers the following equations for the definition of the quantity H in Boltzmann's original H theorem. H=∑ifiln⁡fiδq1⋯δpr=∑_if_i_i _1⋯_r[17] Here we sum over the regions into which phase space is divided, indexed by i. And in the limit for an infinitesimal phase space volume δqi→0,δpi→0∀i_i→0,_i→0 ∀ i, we can write the sum as an integral. H=∫⋯∫fln⁡fdq1⋯dpr=∫⋯ dq_1_r[18] H can also be written in terms of the number of molecules present in each of the cells. H=∑(niln⁡ni−niln⁡δvγ)=∑niln⁡ni+constantH =∑(n_i_i-n_iln_γ) =_i_i+constant[19][clarification needed] An additional way to calculate the quantity H is: H=−ln⁡P+constant=-+constant [20] where P is the probability of finding a system chosen at random from the specified microcanonical ensemble. It can finally be written as: H=−ln⁡G+constant=-+constant [21] where G is the number of classical states.[clarification needed] The quantity H can also be defined as the integral over velocity space[citation needed] : H=def∫P(ln⁡P)d3v=⟨ln⁡P⟩{def= intP() d^3v=⟨⟩ (1) where P(v) is the probability distribution. Using the Boltzmann equation one can prove that H can only decrease. For a system of N statistically independent particles, H is related to the thermodynamic entropy S through:[22] S=def−VkH+constant{def=­VkH+constant So, according to the H-theorem, S can only increase.
