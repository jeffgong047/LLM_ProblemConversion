theory: H is a forerunner of Shannon's information entropy. Claude Shannon denoted his measure of information entropy H after the H-theorem.[16] The article on Shannon's information entropy contains an explanation of the discrete counterpart of the quantity H, known as the information entropy or information uncertainty (with a minus sign). By extending the discrete information entropy to the continuous information entropy, also called differential entropy, one obtains the expression in the equation from the section above, Definition and Meaning of Boltzmann's H, and thus a better feel for the meaning of H. The H-theorem's connection between information and entropy plays a central role in a recent controversy called the Black hole information paradox. Tolman's
