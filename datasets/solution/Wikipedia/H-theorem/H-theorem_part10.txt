systems: Since H is a mechanically defined variable that is not conserved, then like any other such variable (pressure, etc.) it will show thermal fluctuations. This means that H regularly shows spontaneous increases from the minimum value. Technically this is not an exception to the H theorem, since the H theorem was only intended to apply for a gas with a very large number of particles. These fluctuations are only perceptible when the system is small and the time interval over which it is observed is not enormously large. If H is interpreted as entropy as Boltzmann intended, then this can be seen as a manifestation of the fluctuation theorem. Connection to information
