mechanical: In quantum statistical mechanics (which is the quantum version of classical statistical mechanics), the H-function is the function:[23] H=∑ipiln⁡pi,=∑_ip_i_i, where summation runs over all possible distinct states of the system, and pi is the probability that the system could be found in the i-th state. This is closely related to the entropy formula of Gibbs, S=−k∑ipiln⁡pi=-k∑_ip_i_i and we shall (following e.g., Waldram (1985), p. 39) proceed using S rather than H. First, differentiating with respect to time gives dSdt=−k∑i(dpidtln⁡pi+dpidt)=−k∑idpidtln⁡pidS/dt =-k∑_i(dp_i/dt_i+dp_i/dt) =-k∑_idp_i/dt_i (using the fact that Σ dpi/dt = 0, since Σ pi = 1, so the second term vanishes. We will see later that it will be useful to break this into two sums.) Now Fermi's golden rule gives a master equation for the average rate of quantum jumps from state α to β; and from state β to α. (Of course, Fermi's golden rule itself makes certain approximations, and the introduction of this rule is what introduces irreversibility. It is essentially the quantum version of Boltzmann's Stosszahlansatz.) For an isolated system the jumps will make contributions dpαdt=∑βναβ(pβ−pα)dpβdt=∑αναβ(pα−pβ)dp_α/dt =∑_βν_αβ(p_β-p_α) dp_β/dt =∑_αν_αβ(p_α-p_β) where the reversibility of the dynamics ensures that the same transition constant ναβ appears in both expressions. So dSdt=12k∑α,βναβ(ln⁡pβ−ln⁡pα)(pβ−pα).dS/dt=1/2k∑_α,βν_αβ(_β-_α)(p_β-p_α). The two differences terms in the summation always have the same sign. For example: wβ<wαw_β<w_α then ln⁡wβ<ln⁡wα_β<_α so overall the two negative signs will cancel. Therefore, ΔS≥0≥0 for an isolated system. The same mathematics is sometimes used to show that relative entropy is a Lyapunov function of a Markov process in detailed balance, and other chemistry contexts. Gibbs'
