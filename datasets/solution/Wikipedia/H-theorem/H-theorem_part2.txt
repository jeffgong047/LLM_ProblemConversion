pronunciation: Boltzmann in his original publication writes the symbol E (as in entropy) for its statistical function.[1] Years later, Samuel Hawksley Burbury, one of the critics of the theorem,[6] wrote the function with the symbol H,[7] a notation that was subsequently adopted by Boltzmann when referring to his "H-theorem".[8] The notation has led to some confusion regarding the name of the theorem. Even though the statement is usually referred to as the "Aitch theorem", sometimes it is instead called the "Eta theorem", as the capital Greek letter Eta (Î—) is undistinguishable from the capital version of Latin letter h (H).[9] Discussions have been raised on how the symbol should be understood, but it remains unclear due to the lack of written sources from the time of the theorem.[9][10] Studies of the typography and the work of J.W. Gibbs[11] seem to favour the interpretation of H as Eta.[12] Definition and meaning of Boltzmann's
