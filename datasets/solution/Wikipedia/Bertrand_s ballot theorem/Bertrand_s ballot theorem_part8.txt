lemma: A simple proof is based on the cycle lemma of Dvoretzky and Motzkin.[5] Call a ballot sequence dominating if A is strictly ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes. The cycle lemma asserts that any sequence of p A's and q B's, where p>q>q, has precisely p−q-q dominating cyclic permutations. To see this, just arrange the given sequence of p+q+q A's and B's in a circle and repeatedly remove adjacent pairs AB until only p−q-q A's remain. Each of these A's was the start of a dominating cyclic permutation before anything was removed. So p−q-q out of the p+q+q cyclic permutations of any arrangement of p A votes and q B votes are dominating. Proof by
