proofs: Bertrand expressed the solution as 2m−μμ2m-μ/μ where μ=p+qμ=p+q is the total number of voters and m=p=p is the number of voters for the first candidate. He states that the result follows from the formula Pm+1,μ+1=Pm,μ+Pm+1,μ,_m+1,μ+1=P_m,μ+P_m+1,μ, where Pm,μ_m,μ is the number of favourable sequences, but "it seems probable that such a simple result could be shown in a more direct way". Indeed, a more direct proof was soon produced by Désiré André. His approach is often mistakenly labelled "the reflection principle" by modern authors but in fact uses a permutation. He shows that the "unfavourable" sequences (those that reach an intermediate tie) consist of an equal number of sequences that begin with A as those that begin with B. Every sequence that begins with B is unfavourable, and there are (p+q−1q−1)p+q-1q-1 such sequences with a B followed by an arbitrary sequence of (q-1) B's and p A's. Each unfavourable sequence that begins with A can be transformed to an arbitrary sequence of (q-1) B's and p A's by finding the first B that violates the rule (by causing the vote counts to tie) and deleting it, and interchanging the order of the remaining parts. To reverse the process, take any sequence of (q-1) B's and p A's and search from the end to find where the number of A's first exceeds the number of B's, and then interchange the order of the parts and place a B in between. For example, the unfavourable sequence AABBABAA corresponds uniquely to the arbitrary sequence ABAAAAB. From this, it follows that the number of favourable sequences of p A's and q B's is (p+qq)−2(p+q−1q−1)=(p+qq)p−qp+qp+qq-2p+q-1q-1=p+qqp-q/p+q and thus the required probability is p−qp+qp-q/p+q as expected.
