walks: Another equivalent problem is to calculate the number of random walks on the integers that consist of n steps of unit length, beginning at the origin and ending at the point m, that never become negative. As n and m have the same parity and n≥m≥0≥0, this number is (nn+m2)−(nn+m2+1)=m+1n+m2+1(nn+m2).nn+m2-nn+m2+1=m+1/n+m2+1nn+m2. When m=0=0 and n is even, this gives the Catalan number 1n2+1(nn2)1/n2+1nn2. Thus the probability that the a random walk is never negative and returns to origin at time n is 2−n1n2+1(nn2)2^-n1/n2+1nn2. By Stirling's formula, when n→∞→∞, this probability is ∼2n3/2∼√(2)/n^3/2. [Note that m,n,n have the same parity as follows: let P be the number of "positive" moves, i.e., to the right, and let N be the number of "negative" moves, i.e., to the left. Since P+N=n+N=n and P−N=m-N=m, we have P=n+m2=n+m/2 and N=n−m2=n-m/2. Since P and N are integers,m,n,n have the same parity] Proof by
