martingales: Let n=p+q=p+q. Define the "backwards counting" stochastic process Xk=Sn−kn−k;k=0,1,...,n−1_k=S_n-k/n-k;=0,1,...,n-1 where Sn−k_n-k is the lead of candidate A over B, after n−k-k votes have come in. Claim: Xk_k is a martingale process. Given Xk_k, we know that Sn−k=(n−k)Xk_n-k=(n-k)X_k, so of the first n−k-k votes, Xk+12(n−k)X_k+1/2(n-k) were for candidate A, and −Xk+12(n−k)-X_k+1/2(n-k) were for candidate B. So, with probability Xk+12X_k+1/2, we have Sn−k−1=Sn−k−1_n-k-1=S_n-k-1, and Xk+1=n−kn−k−1Xk−1n−k−1_k+1=n-k/n-k-1X_k-1/n-k-1. Similarly for the other one. Then compute to find E[Xk+1|Xk]=Xk[X_k+1|X_k]=X_k. Define the stopping time T as either the minimum k such that Xk=0_k=0, or n−1-1 if there's no such k. Then the probability that candidate A leads all the time is just E[XT][X_T], which by the optional stopping theorem is E[XT]=E[X0]=p−qp+q[X_T]=E[X_0]=p-q/p+q Bertrand's and André's
