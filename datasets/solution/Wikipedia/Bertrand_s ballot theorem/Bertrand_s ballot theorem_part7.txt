induction: Another method of proof is by mathematical induction: We loosen the condition p>q>q to p≥q≧. Clearly, the theorem is correct when p=q=q, since in this case the first candidate will not be strictly ahead after all the votes have been counted (so the probability is 0). Clearly the theorem is true if p > 0 and q = 0 when the probability is 1, given that the first candidate receives all the votes; it is also true when p = q > 0 as we have just seen. Assume it is true both when p = a − 1 and q = b, and when p = a and q = b − 1, with a > b > 0. (We don't need to consider the case a=b=b here, since we have already disposed of it before.) Then considering the case with p = a and q = b, the last vote counted is either for the first candidate with probability a/(a + b), or for the second with probability b/(a + b). So the probability of the first being ahead throughout the count to the penultimate vote counted (and also after the final vote) is: a(a+b)(a−1)−b(a+b−1)+b(a+b)a−(b−1)(a+b−1)=a−ba+b.a(a+b)(a-1)-b(a+b-1)+b(a+b)a-(b-1)(a+b-1)=a-b+b. And so it is true for all p and q with p > q > 0. Proof by the cycle
