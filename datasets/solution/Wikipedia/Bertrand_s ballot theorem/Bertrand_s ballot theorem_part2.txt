Example: Suppose there are 5 voters, of whom 3 vote for candidate A and 2 vote for candidate B (so p = 3 and q = 2). There are ten equally likely orders in which the votes could be counted: AAABB AABAB ABAAB BAAAB AABBA ABABA BAABA ABBAA BABAA BBAAA For the order AABAB, the tally of the votes as the election progresses is: Candidate A A B A B A 1 2 2 3 3 B 0 0 1 1 2 For each column the tally for A is always larger than the tally for B, so A is always strictly ahead of B. For the order AABBA the tally of the votes as the election progresses is: Candidate A A B B A A 1 2 2 2 3 B 0 0 1 2 2 For this order, B is tied with A after the fourth vote, so A is not always strictly ahead of B. Of the 10 possible orders, A is always ahead of B only for AAABB and AABAB. So the probability that A will always be strictly ahead is 210=15,2/10=1/5, and this is indeed equal to 3âˆ’23+23-2/3+2 as the theorem predicts. Equivalent
