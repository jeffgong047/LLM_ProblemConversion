Proofs: Maier proved his theorem using Buchstab's equivalent for the counting function of quasi-primes (set of numbers without prime factors lower to bound z=x1/u=x^1/u, u fixed). He also used an equivalent of the number of primes in arithmetic progressions of sufficient length due to Gallagher. Pintz (2007) gave another proof, and also showed that most probabilistic models of primes incorrectly predict the mean square error ∫2Y(∑2<p≤xlog⁡p−∑2<n≤x1)2dx∫_2^Y(∑_2<p-∑_2<n1)^2 dx of one version of the prime number theorem.
