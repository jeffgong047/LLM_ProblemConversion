In number theory, Maier's theorem (Maier 1985) is a theorem about the numbers of primes in short intervals for which Cramér's probabilistic model of primes gives a wrong answer. The theorem states that if π is the prime-counting function and λ is greater than 1 then π(x+(log⁡x)λ)−π(x)(log⁡x)λ−1π(x+()^λ)-π(x)/()^λ-1 does not have a limit as x tends to infinity; more precisely the limit superior is greater than 1, and the limit inferior is less than 1. The Cramér model of primes predicts incorrectly that it has limit 1 when λ≥2 (using the Borel–Cantelli lemma).
