notation: Goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called "hereditary base-n notation". This notation is very similar to usual base-n positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein's theorem. In ordinary base-n notation, where n is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number m is written as a sum of multiples of powers of n: m=aknk+ak−1nk−1+⋯+a0,=a_kn^k+a_k-1n^k-1+⋯+a_0, where each coefficient ai satisfies 0 ≤ ai < n, and ak ≠ 0. For example, in base 2, 35=32+2+1=25+21+20.35=32+2+1=2^5+2^1+2^0. Thus the base-2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means 25 + 2 + 1. Similarly, 100 represented in base-3 is 10201: 100=81+18+1=34+2⋅32+30.100=81+18+1=3^4+2·3^2+3^0. Note that the exponents themselves are not written in base-n notation. For example, the expressions above include 25 and 34, and 5 > 2, 4 > 3. To convert a base-n representation to hereditary base-n notation, first rewrite all of the exponents in base-n notation. Then rewrite any exponents inside the exponents, and continue in this way until every number appearing in the expression (except the bases themselves) has been converted to base-n notation. For example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is 25 + 2 + 1, it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as 35=2221+1+21+1,35=2^2^2^1+1+2^1+1, using the fact that 5 = 221 + 1. Similarly, 100 in hereditary base-3 notation is 100=331+1+2⋅32+1.100=3^3^1+1+2·3^2+1. Goodstein
