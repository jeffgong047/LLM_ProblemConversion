theorem: Goodstein's theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence G(m), we construct a parallel sequence P(m) of ordinal numbers in Cantor normal form which is strictly decreasing and terminates. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that G(m) goes to 0 because it is dominated by P(m). Actually, the fact that P(m) dominates G(m) plays no role at all. The important point is: G(m)(k) exists if and only if P(m)(k) exists (parallelism), and comparison between two members of G(m) is preserved when comparing corresponding entries of P(m).[2] Then if P(m) terminates, so does G(m). By infinite regress, G(m) must reach 0, which guarantees termination. We define a function f=f(u,k)=f(u,k) which computes the hereditary base k representation of u and then replaces each occurrence of the base k with the first infinite ordinal number ω. For example, f(100,3)=f(331+1+2⋅32+1,3)=ωω1+1+ω2⋅2+1=ωω+1+ω2⋅2+1(100,3)=f(3^3^1+1+2·3^2+1,3)=ω^ω^1+1+ω^2·2+1=ω^ω+1+ω^2·2+1. Each term P(m)(n) of the sequence P(m) is then defined as f(G(m)(n),n+1). For example, G(3)(1) = 3 = 21 + 20 and P(3)(1) = f(21 + 20,2) = ω1 + ω0 = ω + 1. Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined. We claim that f(G(m)(n),n+1)>f(G(m)(n+1),n+2)(G(m)(n),n+1)>f(G(m)(n+1),n+2): Let G′(m)(n)'(m)(n) be G(m)(n) after applying the first, base-changing operation in generating the next element of the Goodstein sequence, but before the second minus 1 operation in this generation. Observe that G(m)(n+1)=G′(m)(n)−1(m)(n+1)=G'(m)(n)-1. Then f(G(m)(n),n+1)=f(G′(m)(n),n+2)(G(m)(n),n+1)=f(G'(m)(n),n+2). Now we apply the minus 1 operation, and f(G′(m)(n),n+2)>f(G(m)(n+1),n+2)(G'(m)(n),n+2)>f(G(m)(n+1),n+2), as G′(m)(n)=G(m)(n+1)+1'(m)(n)=G(m)(n+1)+1. For example, G(4)(1)=22(4)(1)=2^2 and G(4)(2)=2⋅32+2⋅3+2(4)(2)=2·3^2+2·3+2, so f(22,2)=ωω(2^2,2)=ω^ω and f(2⋅32+2⋅3+2,3)=ω2⋅2+ω⋅2+2(2·3^2+2·3+2,3)=ω^2·2+ω·2+2, which is strictly smaller. Note that in order to calculate f(G(m)(n),n+1), we first need to write G(m)(n) in hereditary base n+1 notation, as for instance the expression ωω−1ω^ω-1 is not an ordinal. Thus the sequence P(m) is strictly decreasing. As the standard order < on ordinals is well-founded, an infinite strictly decreasing sequence cannot exist, or equivalently, every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals terminates (and cannot be infinite). But P(m)(n) is calculated directly from G(m)(n). Hence the sequence G(m) must terminate as well, meaning that it must reach 0. While this proof of Goodstein's theorem is fairly easy, the Kirby–Paris theorem,[1] which shows that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of countable nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic. Extended Goodstein's
