graphs: For any tree with maximum degree Δ, the equitable chromatic number is at most 1+⌈Δ/2⌉1+⌈Δ/2⌉[6] with the worst case occurring for a star. However, most trees have significantly smaller equitable chromatic number: if a tree with n vertices has Δ ≤ n/3 − O(1), then it has an equitable coloring with only three colors.[7] Furmańczyk (2006) studies the equitable chromatic number of graph products.
