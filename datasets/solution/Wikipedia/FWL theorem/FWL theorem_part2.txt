History: The origin of the theorem is uncertain, but it was well-established in the realm of linear regression before the Frisch and Waugh paper. George Udny Yule's comprehensive analysis of partial regressions, published in 1907, included the theorem in section 9 on page 184.[8] Yule emphasized the theorem's importance for understanding multiple and partial regression and correlation coefficients, as mentioned in section 10 of the same paper.[8] By 1933, Yule's findings were generally recognized[weasel words], thanks in part to the detailed discussion of partial correlation and the introduction of his innovative notation in 1907.[citation needed] The theorem, later associated with Frisch, Waugh, and Lovell, was also included in chapter 10 of Yule's successful statistics textbook, first published in 1911. The book reached its tenth edition by 1932.[9] In a 1931 paper co-authored with Mudgett, Frisch cited Yule's results.[10] Yule's formulas for partial regressions were quoted and explicitly attributed to him in order to rectify a misquotation by another author.[10] Although Yule was not explicitly mentioned in the 1933 paper by Frisch and Waugh, they utilized the notation for partial regression coefficients initially introduced by Yule in 1907, which was widely accepted by 1933[original research?]. In 1963, Lovell published a proof[11] considered more straightforward and intuitive. In recognition, people generally add his name to the theorem name.
