form: Tarski proved a stronger theorem than the one stated above, using an entirely syntactical method. The resulting theorem applies to any formal language with negation, and with sufficient capability for self-reference that the diagonal lemma holds. First-order arithmetic satisfies these preconditions, but the theorem applies to much more general formal systems, such as ZFC. Tarski's undefinability theorem (general form): Let (L,N)(L,N) be any interpreted formal language which includes negation and has a Gödel numbering g(φ)(φ) satisfying the diagonal lemma, i.e. for every L-formula B(x)(x) (with one free variable x) there is a sentence A such that A⟺B(g(A))(g(A)) holds in N.. Then there is no L-formula True(n)(n) with the following property: for every L-sentence A,, True(g(A))⟺A(g(A)) is true in N.. The proof of Tarski's undefinability theorem in this form is again by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that an L-formula True(n)(n) as above existed, i.e., if A is a sentence of arithmetic, then True(g(A))(g(A)) holds in N if and only if A holds in N.. Hence for all A,, the formula True(g(A))⟺A(g(A)) holds in N.. But the diagonal lemma yields a counterexample to this equivalence, by giving a "liar" formula S such that S⟺¬True(g(S))(g(S)) holds in N.. This is a contradiction. QED.
