Proof: By the Stone–Weierstrass theorem any complex-valued continuous function on K can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial in z and z¯z. So it suffices to show that z¯z can be uniformly approximated by a rational function on K. Let g(z) be a smooth function of compact support on C equal to 1 on K and set f(z)=g(z)⋅z¯.(z)=g(z)·z. By the generalized Cauchy integral formula f(z)=12πi∬C∖K∂f∂w¯dw∧dw¯w−z,(z)=1/2∬_C/∂w̅dww̅/w-z, since K has measure zero. Restricting z to K and taking Riemann approximating sums for the integral on the right hand side yields the required uniform approximation of z¯z̅ by a rational function.[1] See
