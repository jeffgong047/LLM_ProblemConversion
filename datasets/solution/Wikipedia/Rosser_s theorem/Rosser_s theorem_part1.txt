For Rosser's technique for proving incompleteness theorems, see Rosser's trick. In number theory, Rosser's theorem states that the nth prime number is greater than nlog⁡n, where loglog is the natural logarithm function. It was published by J. Barkley Rosser in 1939.[1] Its full statement is: Let pn_n be the nth prime number. Then for n≥1≥1 pn>nlog⁡n._n>n. In 1999, Pierre Dusart proved a tighter lower bound:[2] pn>n(log⁡n+log⁡log⁡n−1)._n>n(+log-1). See
