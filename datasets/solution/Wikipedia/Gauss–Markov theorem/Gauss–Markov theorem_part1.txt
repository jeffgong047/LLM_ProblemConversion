The requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. See, for example, the James–Stein estimator (which also drops linearity), ridge regression, or simply any degenerate estimator. The theorem was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov, although Gauss' work significantly predates Markov's.[3] But while Gauss derived the result under the assumption of independence and normality, Markov reduced the assumptions to the form stated above.[4] A further generalization to non-spherical errors was given by Alexander Aitken.[5]
