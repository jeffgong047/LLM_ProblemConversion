proof: As it has been stated before, the condition of Var⁡(β )−Var⁡(β^)Var(β̃)-Var(β) is a positive semidefinite matrix is equivalent to the property that the best linear unbiased estimator of ℓTβℓ^Tβ is ℓTβ^ℓ^Tβ (best in the sense that it has minimum variance). To see this, let ℓTβ ℓ^Tβ̃ another linear unbiased estimator of ℓTβℓ^Tβ. Var⁡(ℓTβ )=ℓTVar⁡(β )ℓ=σ2ℓT(XTX)−1ℓ+ℓTDDTℓ=Var⁡(ℓTβ^)+(DTℓ)t(DTℓ)σ2ℓT(XTX)−1ℓ=Var⁡(ℓTβ^)=Var⁡(ℓTβ^)+‖DTℓ‖≥Var⁡(ℓTβ^)Var(ℓ^Tβ̃) =ℓ^TVar(β̃)ℓ =σ^2ℓ^T(X^TX)^-1ℓ+ℓ^TDD^Tℓ =Var(ℓ^Tβ)+(D^Tℓ)^t(D^Tℓ) σ^2ℓ^T(X^TX)^-1ℓ=Var(ℓ^Tβ) =Var(ℓ^Tβ)+D^Tℓ ≥Var(ℓ^Tβ) Moreover, equality holds if and only if DTℓ=0^Tℓ=0. We calculate ℓTβ =ℓT(((XTX)−1XT+D)Y)fromabove=ℓT(XTX)−1XTY+ℓTDY=ℓTβ^+(DTℓ)tY=ℓTβ^DTℓ=0ℓ^Tβ̃ =ℓ^T(((X^TX)^-1X^T+D)Y) fromabove =ℓ^T(X^TX)^-1X^TY+ℓ^TDY =ℓ^Tβ+(D^Tℓ)^tY =ℓ^Tβ D^Tℓ=0 This proves that the equality holds if and only if ℓTβ =ℓTβ^ℓ^Tβ̃=ℓ^Tβ which gives the uniqueness of the OLS estimator as a BLUE.
