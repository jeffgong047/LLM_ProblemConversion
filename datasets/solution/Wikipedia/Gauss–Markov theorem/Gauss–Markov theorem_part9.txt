exogeneity: For all n observations, the expectation—conditional on the regressors—of the error term is zero:[9] E⁡[εi∣X]=E⁡[εi∣x1,…,xn]=0.E[ ε_i|𝐗]=E[ ε_i|𝐱_1,…,𝐱_n]=0. where xi=[xi1xi2⋯xik]T𝐱_i=[ x_i1 x_i2 ⋯ x_ik ]^T is the data vector of regressors for the ith observation, and consequently X=[x1Tx2T⋯xnT]T𝐗=[ 𝐱_1^T 𝐱_2^T ⋯ 𝐱_n^T ]^T is the data matrix or design matrix. Geometrically, this assumption implies that xi𝐱_i and εiε_i are orthogonal to each other, so that their inner product (i.e., their cross moment) is zero.

Instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem. Full
