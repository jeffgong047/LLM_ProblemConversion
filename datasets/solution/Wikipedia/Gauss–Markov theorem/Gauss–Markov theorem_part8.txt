Linearity: The dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the variables specified in the model. The specification must be linear in its parameters. This does not mean that there must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The independent variables can take non-linear forms as long as the parameters are linear. The equation y=β0+β1x2,=β_0+β_1x^2, qualifies as linear while y=β0+β12x=β_0+β_1^2x can be transformed to be linear by replacing β12β_1^2 by another parameter, say γγ. An equation with a parameter dependent on an independent variable does not qualify as linear, for example y=β0+β1(x)⋅x=β_0+β_1(x), where β1(x)β_1(x) is a function of x. Data transformations are often used to convert an equation into a linear form. For example, the Cobb–Douglas function—often used in economics—is nonlinear: Y=ALαK1−αeε=AL^αK^1-αe^ε But it can be expressed in linear form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:[8] ln⁡Y=ln⁡A+αln⁡L+(1−α)ln⁡K+ε=β0+β1ln⁡L+β2ln⁡K+ε=+α+(1-α)+ε=β_0+β_1+β_2+ε This assumption also covers specification issues: assuming that the proper functional form has been selected and there are no omitted variables. One should be aware, however, that the parameters that minimize the residuals of the transformed equation do not necessarily minimize the residuals of the original equation. Strict
