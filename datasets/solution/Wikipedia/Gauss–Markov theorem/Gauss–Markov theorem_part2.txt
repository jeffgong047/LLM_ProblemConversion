Statement: Suppose we have, in matrix notation, the linear relationship y=Xβ+ε,(y,ε∈Rn,β∈RKandX∈Rn×K)=Xβ+ε, (y,ε∈ℝ^n,β∈ℝ^KandX∈ℝ^n) expanding to, yi=∑j=1KβjXij+εi∀i=1,2,…,n_i=∑_j=1^Kβ_jX_ij+ε_i =1,2,…,n where βjβ_j are non-random but unobservable parameters, Xij_ij are non-random and observable (called the "explanatory variables"), εiε_i are random, and so yi_i are random. The random variables εiε_i are called the "disturbance", "noise" or simply "error" (will be contrasted with "residual" later in the article; see errors and residuals in statistics). Note that to include a constant in the model above, one can choose to introduce the constant as a variable βK+1β_K+1 with a newly introduced last column of X being unity i.e., Xi(K+1)=1_i(K+1)=1 for all i. Note that though yi,_i, as sample responses, are observable, the following statements and arguments including assumptions, proofs and the others assume under the only condition of knowing Xij,_ij, but not yi._i. The Gauss–Markov assumptions concern the set of error random variables, εiε_i: They have mean zero: E⁡[εi]=0.E[ε_i]=0. They are homoscedastic, that is all have the same finite variance: Var⁡(εi)=σ2<∞Var(ε_i)=σ^2<∞ for all i and Distinct error terms are uncorrelated: Cov(εi,εj)=0,∀i≠j.Cov(ε_i,ε_j)=0,. A linear estimator of βjβ_j is a linear combination β^j=c1jy1+⋯+cnjynβ_j=c_1jy_1+⋯+c_njy_n in which the coefficients cij_ij are not allowed to depend on the underlying coefficients βjβ_j, since those are not observable, but are allowed to depend on the values Xij_ij, since these data are observable. (The dependence of the coefficients on each Xij_ij is typically nonlinear; the estimator is linear in each yi_i and hence in each random ε,ε, which is why this is "linear" regression.) The estimator is said to be unbiased if and only if E⁡[β^j]=βjE[β_j]=β_j regardless of the values of Xij_ij. Now, let ∑j=1Kλjβj∑_j=1^Kλ_jβ_j be some linear combination of the coefficients. Then the mean squared error of the corresponding estimation is E⁡[(∑j=1Kλj(β^j−βj))2],E[(∑_j=1^Kλ_j(β_j-β_j))^2], in other words, it is the expectation of the square of the weighted sum (across parameters) of the differences between the estimators and the corresponding parameters to be estimated. (Since we are considering the case in which all the parameter estimates are unbiased, this mean squared error is the same as the variance of the linear combination.) The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the vector ββ of parameters βjβ_j is one with the smallest mean squared error for every vector λλ of linear combination parameters. This is equivalent to the condition that Var⁡(β )−Var⁡(β^)Var(β)-Var(β) is a positive semi-definite matrix for every other linear unbiased estimator β β. The ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) is the function β^=(XTX)−1XTyβ=(X^TX)^-1X^Ty of y and X (where XT^T denotes the transpose of X) that minimizes the sum of squares of residuals (misprediction amounts): ∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2=∑i=1n(yi−∑j=1Kβ^jXij)2.∑_i=1^n(y_i-y_i)^2=∑_i=1^n(y_i-∑_j=1^Kβ_jX_ij)^2. The theorem now states that the OLS estimator is a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). The main idea of the proof is that the least-squares estimator is uncorrelated with every linear unbiased estimator of zero, i.e., with every linear combination a1y1+⋯+anyn_1y_1+⋯+a_ny_n whose coefficients do not depend upon the unobservable ββ but whose expected value is always zero.
