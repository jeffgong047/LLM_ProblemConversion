rank: The sample data matrix X𝐗 must have full column rank. rank⁡(X)=krank(𝐗)=k Otherwise XTX𝐗^T𝐗 is not invertible and the OLS estimator cannot be computed. A violation of this assumption is perfect multicollinearity, i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent. One scenario in which this will occur is called "dummy variable trap," when a base dummy variable is not omitted resulting in perfect correlation between the dummy variables and the constant term.[11] Multicollinearity (as long as it is not "perfect") can be present resulting in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate. The estimates will be less precise and highly sensitive to particular sets of data.[12] Multicollinearity can be detected from condition number or the variance inflation factor, among other tests.
