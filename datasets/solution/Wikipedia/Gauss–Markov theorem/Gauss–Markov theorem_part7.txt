econometrics: In most treatments of OLS, the regressors (parameters of interest) in the design matrix X𝐗 are assumed to be fixed in repeated samples. This assumption is considered inappropriate for a predominantly nonexperimental science like econometrics.[7] Instead, the assumptions of the Gauss–Markov theorem are stated conditional on X𝐗.
