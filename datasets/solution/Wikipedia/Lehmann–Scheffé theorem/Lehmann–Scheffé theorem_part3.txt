Proof: By the Rao–Blackwell theorem, if Z is an unbiased estimator of θ then φ(Y):=E⁡[Z∣Y]φ(Y):=E[Z] defines an unbiased estimator of θ with the property that its variance is not greater than that of Z. Now we show that this function is unique. Suppose W is another candidate MVUE estimator of θ. Then again ψ(Y):=E⁡[W∣Y]ψ(Y):=E[W] defines an unbiased estimator of θ with the property that its variance is not greater than that of W. Then E⁡[φ(Y)−ψ(Y)]=0,θ∈Ω.E[φ(Y)-ψ(Y)]=0,θ∈Ω. Since fY(y:θ):θ∈Ω{f_Y(y:θ):θ∈Ω} is a complete family E⁡[φ(Y)−ψ(Y)]=0⟹φ(y)−ψ(y)=0,θ∈ΩE[φ(Y)-ψ(Y)]=0φ(y)-ψ(y)=0,θ∈Ω and therefore the function φφ is the unique function of Y with variance not greater than that of any other unbiased estimator. We conclude that φ(Y)φ(Y) is the MVUE. Example for when using a non-complete minimal sufficient
