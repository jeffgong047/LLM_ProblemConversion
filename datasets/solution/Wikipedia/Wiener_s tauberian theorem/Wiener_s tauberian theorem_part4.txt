version: Wiener's theorem has a counterpart in l1(Z)^1(ℤ): the span of the translations of f∈l1(Z)^1(ℤ) is dense if and only if the Fourier series φ(θ)=∑n∈Zf(n)e−inθφ(θ)=∑_n∈ℤf(n)e^-inθ has no real zeros. The following statements are equivalent version of this result: Suppose the Fourier series of f∈l1(Z)^1(ℤ) has no real zeros, and for some bounded sequence h the convolution f∗h*h tends to zero at infinity. Then g∗h*h also tends to zero at infinity for any g∈l1(Z)^1(ℤ). Let φφ be a function on the unit circle with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Then 1/φ1/φ has absolutely convergent Fourier series if and only if φφ has no zeros. Gelfand (1941a, 1941b) showed that this is equivalent to the following property of the Wiener algebra A(T)(𝕋), which he proved using the theory of Banach algebras, thereby giving a new proof of Wiener's result: The maximal ideals of A(T)(𝕋) are all of the form Mx=f∈A(T)∣f(x)=0,x∈T._x={f(𝕋)(x)=0},∈𝕋.
