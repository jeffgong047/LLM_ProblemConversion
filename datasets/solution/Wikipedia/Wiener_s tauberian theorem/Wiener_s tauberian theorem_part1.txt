In mathematical analysis, Wiener's tauberian theorem is any of several related results proved by Norbert Wiener in 1932.[1] They provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which any function in L1^1 or L2^2 can be approximated by linear combinations of translations of a given function.[2] Informally, if the Fourier transform of a function f vanishes on a certain set Z, the Fourier transform of any linear combination of translations of f also vanishes on Z. Therefore, the linear combinations of translations of f cannot approximate a function whose Fourier transform does not vanish on Z. Wiener's theorems make this precise, stating that linear combinations of translations of f are dense if and only if the zero set of the Fourier transform of f is empty (in the case of L1^1) or of Lebesgue measure zero (in the case of L2^2). Gelfand reformulated Wiener's theorem in terms of commutative C*-algebras, when it states that the spectrum of the L1^1 group ring L1(R)^1(ℝ) of the group Rℝ of real numbers is the dual group of Rℝ. A similar result is true when Rℝ is replaced by any locally compact abelian group. The condition in
