reformulation: The following statement is equivalent to the previous result,[citation needed] and explains why Wiener's result is a Tauberian theorem: Suppose the Fourier transform of f∈L1^1 has no real zeros, and suppose the convolution f∗h*h tends to zero at infinity for some h∈L∞^∞. Then the convolution g∗h*h tends to zero at infinity for any g∈L1^1. More generally, if limx→∞(f∗h)(x)=A∫f(x)dxlim_x→∞(f*h)(x)=A(x) dx for some f∈L1^1 the Fourier transform of which has no real zeros, then also limx→∞(g∗h)(x)=A∫g(x)dxlim_x→∞(g*h)(x)=A(x) dx for any g∈L1^1.
