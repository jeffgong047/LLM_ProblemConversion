L2: Let f∈L2(R)^2(ℝ) be a square-integrable function. The span of translations fa(x)=f(x+a)_a(x)=f(x+a) is dense in L2(R)^2(ℝ) if and only if the real zeros of the Fourier transform of f form a set of zero Lebesgue measure. The parallel statement in l2(Z)^2(ℤ) is as follows: the span of translations of a sequence f∈l2(Z)^2(ℤ) is dense if and only if the zero set of the Fourier series φ(θ)=∑n∈Zf(n)e−inθφ(θ)=∑_n∈ℤf(n)e^-inθ has zero Lebesgue measure.
