Statement: Suppose that G is a finite group and p a prime such that all p-local subgroups are p-constrained. If A is a self-centralizing normal abelian subgroup of a p-Sylow subgroup such that A has rank at least 3, then the centralizer CG(A) act transitively on the maximal A-invariant q subgroups of G for any prime q â‰  p.
