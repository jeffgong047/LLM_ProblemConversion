In the mathematical field of complex analysis, Akhiezer's theorem is a result about entire functions proved by Naum Akhiezer.[1]


Statement[edit]
Let f(z) be an entire function of exponential type τ, with f(x) ≥ 0 for real x. Then the following are equivalent:

There exists an entire function F, of exponential type τ/2, having all its zeros in the (closed) upper half plane, such that
f(z)=F(z)F(z¯)¯(z)=F(z)F(z)
One has:
∑|Im⁡(1/zn)|<∞∑|Im(1/z_n)|<∞
where zn are the zeros of f.

Related results[edit]
It is not hard to show that the Fejér–Riesz theorem is a special case.[2]
