Statement: Let f(z) be an entire function of exponential type τ, with f(x) ≥ 0 for real x. Then the following are equivalent: There exists an entire function F, of exponential type τ/2, having all its zeros in the (closed) upper half plane, such that f(z)=F(z)F(z¯)¯(z)=F(z)F(z) One has: ∑|Im⁡(1/zn)|<∞∑|Im(1/z_n)|<∞ where zn are the zeros of f.
