Statement: A divisor on a Riemann surface C is a formal sum D=∑PmPP=∑_Pm_PP of points P on C with integer coefficients. One considers a divisor as a set of constraints on meromorphic functions in the function field of C, defining L(D)(D) as the vector space of functions having poles only at points of D with positive coefficient, at most as bad as the coefficient indicates, and having zeros at points of D with negative coefficient, with at least that multiplicity. The dimension of L(D)(D) is finite, and denoted ℓ(D)ℓ(D). The linear system of divisors attached to D is the corresponding projective space of dimension ℓ(D)−1ℓ(D)-1. The other significant invariant of D is its degree d, which is the sum of all its coefficients. A divisor is called special if ℓ(K − D) > 0, where K is the canonical divisor.[1] Clifford's theorem states that for an effective special divisor D, one has: 2(ℓ(D)−1)≤d2(ℓ(D)-1), and that equality holds only if D is zero or a canonical divisor, or if C is a hyperelliptic curve and D linearly equivalent to an integral multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor. The Clifford index of C is then defined as the minimum of d−2(ℓ(D)−1)-2(ℓ(D)-1) taken over all special divisors (except canonical and trivial), and Clifford's theorem states this is non-negative. It can be shown that the Clifford index for a generic curve of genus g is equal to the floor function ⌊g−12⌋.⌊g-12⌋. The Clifford index measures how far the curve is from being hyperelliptic. It may be thought of as a refinement of the gonality: in many cases the Clifford index is equal to the gonality minus 2.[2] Green's
