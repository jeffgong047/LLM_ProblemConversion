conjecture: A conjecture of Mark Green states that the Clifford index for a curve over the complex numbers that is not hyperelliptic should be determined by the extent to which C as canonical curve has linear syzygies. In detail, one defines the invariant a(C) in terms of the minimal free resolution of the homogeneous coordinate ring of C in its canonical embedding, as the largest index i for which the graded Betti number Î²i, i + 2 is zero. Green and Robert Lazarsfeld showed that a(C) + 1 is a lower bound for the Clifford index, and Green's conjecture states that equality always holds. There are numerous partial results.[3] Claire Voisin was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics for her solution of the generic case of Green's conjecture in two papers.[4][5] The case of Green's conjecture for generic curves had attracted a huge amount of effort by algebraic geometers over twenty years before finally being laid to rest by Voisin.[6] The conjecture for arbitrary curves remains open.
