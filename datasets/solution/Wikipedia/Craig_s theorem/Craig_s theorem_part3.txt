axiomatizations: The proof above shows that for each recursively enumerable set of axioms there is a recursive set of axioms with the same deductive closure. A set of axioms is primitive recursive if there is a primitive recursive function that decides membership in the set. To obtain a primitive recursive axiomatization, instead of replacing a formula Ai_i with Ai∧⋯∧Ai⏟iA_i…_i_i one instead replaces it with Ai∧⋯∧Ai⏟f(i)A_i…_i_f(i) (*) where f(x) is a function that, given i, returns a computation history showing that Ai_i is in the original recursively enumerable set of axioms. It is possible for a primitive recursive function to parse an expression of form (*) to obtain Ai_i and j. Then, because Kleene's T predicate is primitive recursive, it is possible for a primitive recursive function to verify that j is indeed a computation history as required. Philosophical
