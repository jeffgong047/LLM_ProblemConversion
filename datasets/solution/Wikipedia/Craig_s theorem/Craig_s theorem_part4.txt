implications: If T is a recursively axiomatizable theory and we divide its predicates into two disjoint sets VA_A and VB_B, then those theorems of T that are in the vocabulary VA_A are recursively enumerable, and hence, based on Craig's theorem, axiomatizable. Carl G. Hempel argued based on this that since all science's predictions are in the vocabulary of observation terms, the theoretical vocabulary of science is in principle eliminable. He himself raised two objections to this argument: 1) the new axioms of science are practically unmanageable, and 2) science uses inductive reasoning and eliminating theoretical terms may alter the inductive relations between observational sentences. Hilary Putnam argues that this argument is based on a misconception that the sole aim of science is successful prediction. He proposes that the main reason we need theoretical terms is that we wish to talk about theoretical entities (such as viruses, radio stars, and elementary particles).
