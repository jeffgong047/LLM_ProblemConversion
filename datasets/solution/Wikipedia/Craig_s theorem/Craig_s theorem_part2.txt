axiomatization: Let A1,A2,…_1,A_2,… be an enumeration of the axioms of a recursively enumerable set T of first-order formulas. Construct another set T* consisting of Ai∧⋯∧Ai⏟iA_i…_i_i for each positive integer i. The deductive closures of T* and T are thus equivalent; the proof will show that T* is a recursive set. A decision procedure for T* lends itself according to the following informal reasoning. Each member of T* is of the form Bj∧⋯∧Bj⏟j.B_j…_j_j. Since each formula has finite length, it is checkable whether or not it is of the said form. If it is of the said form and consists of j conjuncts, it is in T* if the (reoccurring) conjunct is Aj_j; otherwise it is not in T*. Again, it is checkable whether the conjunct is in fact An_n by going through the enumeration of the axioms of T and then checking symbol-for-symbol whether the expressions are identical.
