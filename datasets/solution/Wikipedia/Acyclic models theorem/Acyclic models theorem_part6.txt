Example: Here is an example of this last theorem in action. Let X be the category of triangulable spaces and C be the category of abelian group valued functors on X. Let K be the singular chain complex functor and L be the simplicial chain complex functor. Let E:X→X:X be the functor that assigns to each space X the space ∑n≥0∑Hom(Δn,X)Δn∑_n≥0∑_Hom(Δ_n,X)Δ_n. Here, ΔnΔ_n is the n-simplex and this functor assigns to X the sum of as many copies of each n-simplex as there are maps Δn→XΔ_n. Then let G be defined by G(C)=CE(C)=CE. There is an obvious augmentation EX→X and this induces one on G. It can be shown that both K and L are both G-presentable and G-acyclic (the proof that L is presentable and acyclic is not entirely straightforward and uses a detour through simplicial subdivision, which can also be handled using the above theorem). The class ΓΓ is the class of homology equivalences. It is rather obvious that H0(K)≃H0(L)_0(K)_0(L) and so we conclude that singular and simplicial homology are isomorphic on X. There are many other examples in both algebra and topology, some of which are described in [4][5]
