complexes: What is above is one of the earliest versions of the theorem. Another version is the one that says that if K is a complex of projectives in an abelian category and L is an acyclic complex in that category, then any map K0→L0_0_0 extends to a chain map K→L, unique up to homotopy. This specializes almost to the above theorem if one uses the functor category C(R)K𝒞(R)^𝒦 as the abelian category. Free functors are projective objects in that category. The morphisms in the functor category are natural transformations, so the constructed chain maps and homotopies are all natural. The difference is that in the above version, V being acyclic is a stronger assumption than being acyclic only at certain objects. On the other hand, the above version almost implies this version by letting K𝒦 a category with only one object. Then the free functor F is basically just a free (and hence projective) module. V being acyclic at the models (there is only one) means nothing else than that the complex V is acyclic. Acyclic
