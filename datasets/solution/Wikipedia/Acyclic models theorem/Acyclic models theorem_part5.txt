classes: There is a grand theorem that unifies both of the above.[4][5] Let A𝒜 be an abelian category (for example, C(R)𝒞(R) or C(R)K𝒞(R)^𝒦). A class ΓΓ of chain complexes over A𝒜 will be called an acyclic class provided that: The 0 complex is in ΓΓ. The complex C belongs to ΓΓ if and only if the suspension of C does. If the complexes K and L are homotopic and K∈Γ∈Γ, then L∈Γ∈Γ. Every complex in ΓΓ is acyclic. If D is a double complex, all of whose rows are in ΓΓ, then the total complex of D belongs to ΓΓ. There are three natural examples of acyclic classes, although doubtless others exist. The first is that of homotopy contractible complexes. The second is that of acyclic complexes. In functor categories (e.g. the category of all functors from topological spaces to abelian groups), there is a class of complexes that are contractible on each object, but where the contractions might not be given by natural transformations. Another example is again in functor categories but this time the complexes are acyclic only at certain objects. Let ΣΣ denote the class of chain maps between complexes whose mapping cone belongs to ΓΓ. Although ΣΣ does not necessarily have a calculus of either right or left fractions, it has weaker properties of having homotopy classes of both left and right fractions that permit forming the class Σ−1CΣ^-1C gotten by inverting the arrows in ΣΣ.[4] Let G be an augmented endofunctor on C, meaning there is given a natural transformation ϵ:G→Idϵ:G (the identity functor on C). We say that the chain complex K is G-presentable if for each n, the chain complex ⋯KnGm+1→KnGm→⋯→Kn_nG^m+1_nG^m→⋯_n belongs to ΓΓ. The boundary operator is given by ∑(−1)iKnGiϵGm−i:KnGm+1→KnGm∑(-1)^iK_nG^i^m-i:K_nG^m+1_nG^m. We say that the chain complex functor L is G-acyclic if the augmented chain complex L→H0(L)→0_0(L)→0 belongs to ΓΓ. Theorem. Let ΓΓ be an acyclic class and ΣΣ the corresponding class of arrows in the category of chain complexes. Suppose that K is G-presentable and L is G-acyclic. Then any natural transformation f0:H0(K)→H0(L)_0:H_0(K)_0(L) extends, in the category Σ−1(C)Σ^-1(C) to a natural transformation of chain functors f:K→L:K and this is unique in Σ−1(C)Σ^-1(C) up to chain homotopies. If we suppose, in addition, that L is G-presentable, that K is G-acyclic, and that f0_0 is an isomorphism, then f is homotopy equivalence.
