theorem: Let K𝒦 be an arbitrary category and C(R)𝒞(R) be the category of chain complexes of R-modules over some ring R. Let F,V:K→C(R),V:𝒦→𝒞(R) be covariant functors such that: Fi=Vi=0_i=V_i=0 for i<0<0. There are Mk⊆Kℳ_k⊆𝒦 for k≥0≥0 such that Fk_k has a basis in Mkℳ_k, so F is a free functor. V is k- and (k+1)(k+1)-acyclic at these models, which means that Hk(V(M))=0_k(V(M))=0 for all k>0>0 and all M∈Mk∪Mk+1∈ℳ_k∪ℳ_k+1. Then the following assertions hold:[2][3] Every natural transformation φ:H0(F)→H0(V)φ:H_0(F)_0(V) induces a natural chain map f:F→V:F. If φ,ψ:H0(F)→H0(V)φ,ψ:H_0(F)_0(V) are natural transformations, f,g:F→V,g:F are natural chain maps as before and φM=ψMφ^M=ψ^M for all models M∈M0∈ℳ_0, then there is a natural chain homotopy between f and g. In particular the chain map f is unique up to natural chain homotopy.
