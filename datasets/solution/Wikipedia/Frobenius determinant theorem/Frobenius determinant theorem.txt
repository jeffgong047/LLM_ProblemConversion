In mathematics, the Frobenius determinant theorem was a conjecture made in 1896 by the mathematician Richard Dedekind, who wrote a letter to F. G. Frobenius about it (reproduced in (Dedekind 1968), with an English translation in (Curtis 2003, p. 51)).
If one takes the multiplication table of a finite group G and replaces each entry g with the variable xg, and subsequently takes the determinant, then the determinant factors as a product of n irreducible polynomials, where n is the number of conjugacy classes.  Moreover, each polynomial is raised to a power equal to its degree.  Frobenius proved this surprising conjecture, and it became known as the Frobenius determinant theorem.

Formal statement[edit]
Let a finite group G have elements g1,g2,…,gn_1,g_2,…,g_n, and let xgi_g_i be associated with each element of G. Define the matrix XG_G with entries aij=xgigj_ij=x_g_ig_j. Then

detXG=∏j=1rPj(xg1,xg2,…,xgn)deg⁡Pj_G=∏_j=1^rP_j(x_g_1,x_g_2,…,x_g_n)^_j
where the Pj_j's are pairwise non-proportional irreducible polynomials and r is the number of conjugacy classes of G.[1]
