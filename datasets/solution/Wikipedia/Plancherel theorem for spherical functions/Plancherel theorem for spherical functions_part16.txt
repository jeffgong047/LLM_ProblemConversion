theorem: The Paley-Wiener theorem generalizes the classical Paley-Wiener theorem by characterizing the spherical transforms of smooth K-bivariant functions of compact support on G. It is a necessary and sufficient condition that the spherical transform be W-invariant and that there is an R > 0 such that for each N there is an estimate |f (λ)|≤CN(1+|λ|)−NeR|Im⁡λ|.|f̃(λ)|_N(1+|λ|)^-Ne^R|Imλ|. In this case f is supported in the closed ball of radius R about the origin in G/K. This was proved by Helgason and Gangolli (Helgason (1970) pg. 37). The theorem was later proved by Flensted-Jensen (1986) independently of the spherical inversion theorem, using a modification of his method of reduction to the complex case.[47] Rosenberg's proof of inversion
