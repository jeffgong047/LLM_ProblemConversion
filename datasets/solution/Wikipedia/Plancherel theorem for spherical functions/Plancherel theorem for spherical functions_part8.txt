descent: Hadamard's method of descent relied on functions invariant under the action of 1-parameter subgroup of translations in the y parameter in H3ℌ^3. Flensted–Jensen's method uses the centraliser of SO(2) in SL(2,C) which splits as a direct product of SO(2) and the 1-parameter subgroup K1 of matrices gt=(cosh⁡tisinh⁡t−isinh⁡tcosh⁡t)._t=[ i; -i ]. The symmetric space SL(2,C)/SU(2) can be identified with the space H3 of positive 2×2 matrices A with determinant 1 A=(a+bx+iyx−iya−b)=[ a+b x+iy; x-iy a-b ] with the group action given by g⋅A=gAg∗.=gAg^*. Thus gt⋅A=(acosh⁡2t+ysinh⁡2t+bx+i(ycosh⁡2t+asinh⁡2t)x−i(ycosh⁡2t+asinh⁡2t)acosh⁡2t+ysinh⁡2t−b)._t=[ acosh2t+ysinh2t+b x+i(ycosh2t+asinh2t); x-i(ycosh2t+asinh2t) acosh2t+ysinh2t-b ]. So on the hyperboloid a2=1+b2+x2+y2^2=1+b^2+x^2+y^2, gt only changes the coordinates y and a. Similarly the action of SO(2) acts by rotation on the coordinates (b,x) leaving a and y unchanged. The space H2 of real-valued positive matrices A with y = 0 can be identified with the orbit of the identity matrix under SL(2,R). Taking coordinates (b,x,y) in H3 and (b,x) on H2 the volume and area elements are given by dV=(1+r2)−1/2dbdxdy,dA=(1+r2)−1/2dbdx,=(1+r^2)^-1/2 db dx dy, dA=(1+r^2)^-1/2 db dx, where r2 equals b2 + x2 + y2 or b2 + x2, so that r is related to hyperbolic distance from the origin by r=sinh⁡t=. The Laplacian operators are given by the formula Δn=−Ln−Rn2−(n−1)Rn,Δ_n=-L_n-R_n^2-(n-1)R_n, where L2=∂b2+∂x2,R2=b∂b+x∂x_2=∂_b^2+∂_x^2, R_2=b∂_b+x∂_x and L3=∂b2+∂x2+∂y2,R3=b∂b+x∂x+y∂y._3=∂_b^2+∂_x^2+∂_y^2, R_3=b∂_b+x∂_x+y∂_y. For an SU(2)-invariant function F on H3 and an SO(2)-invariant function on H2, regarded as functions of r or t, ∫H3FdV=4π∫−∞∞F(t)sinh2⁡tdt,∫H2fdV=2π∫−∞∞f(t)sinh⁡tdt.∫_H^3F dV=4π∫_-∞^∞F(t)sinh^2t dt, ∫_H^2f dV=2π∫_-∞^∞f(t) dt. If f(b,x) is a function on H2, Ef is defined by Ef(b,x,y)=f(b,x).(b,x,y)=f(b,x). Thus Δ3Ef=E(Δ2−R2)f.Δ_3Ef=E(Δ_2-R_2)f. If f is SO(2)-invariant, then, regarding f as a function of r or t, (−Δ2+R2)f=∂t2f+coth⁡t∂tf+r∂rf=∂t2f+(coth⁡t+tanh⁡t)∂tf.(-Δ_2+R_2)f=∂_t^2f+∂_tf+r∂_rf=∂_t^2f+(+)∂_tf. On the other hand, ∂t2+(coth⁡t+tanh⁡t)∂t=∂t2+2coth⁡(2t)∂t.∂_t^2+(+)∂_t=∂_t^2+2(2t)∂_t. Thus, setting Sf(t) = f(2t), (Δ2−R2)Sf=4SΔ2f,(Δ_2-R_2)Sf=4SΔ_2f, leading to the fundamental descent relation of Flensted-Jensen for M0 = ES: Δ3M0f=4M0Δ2f.Δ_3M_0f=4M_0Δ_2f. The same relation holds with M0 by M, where Mf is obtained by averaging M0f over SU(2). The extension Ef is constant in the y variable and therefore invariant under the transformations gs. On the other hand, for F a suitable function on H3, the function QF defined by QF=∫K1F∘gsds=∫_K_1F_s ds is independent of the y variable. A straightforward change of variables shows that ∫H3FdV=∫H2(1+b2+x2)1/2QFdA.∫_H^3F dV=∫_H^2(1+b^2+x^2)^1/2QF dA. Since K1 commutes with SO(2), QF is SO(2)--invariant if F is, in particular if F is SU(2)-invariant. In this case QF is a function of r or t, so that M*F can be defined by M∗F(t)=QF(t/2).^*F(t)=QF(t/2). The integral formula above then yields ∫H3FdV=∫H2M∗FdA∫_H^3F dV=∫_H^2M^*F dA and hence, since for f SO(2)-invariant, M∗((Mf)⋅F)=f⋅(M∗F),^*((Mf))=f·(M^*F), the following adjoint formula: ∫H3(Mf)⋅FdV=∫H2f⋅(M∗F)dV.∫_H^3(Mf) dV=∫_H^2f·(M*F) dV. As a consequence M∗Δ3=4Δ2M∗.^*Δ_3=4Δ_2M^*. Thus, as in the case of Hadamard's method of descent. M∗Φ2λ=b(λ)φλ^*Φ_2λ=b(λ)φ_λ with b(λ)=M∗Φ2λ(0)=πtanh⁡πλ(λ)=M^*Φ_2λ(0)=πtanhπλ and Φ2λ=Mφλ.Φ_2λ=Mφ_λ. It follows that (M∗F)∼(λ)=F (2λ).(M^*F)^∼(λ)=F̃(2λ). Taking f=M*F, the SL(2,C) inversion formula for F then immediately yields f(x)=∫−∞∞φλ(x)f (λ)λπ2tanh⁡(πλ2)dλ,(x)=∫_-∞^∞φ_λ(x)f̃(λ) λπ2tanh(πλ/2) dλ, Abel's integral
