expansion: Since G = KAK, functions on G/K that are invariant under K can be identified with functions on A, and hence a𝔞, that are invariant under the Weyl group W. In particular since the Laplacian Δ on G/K commutes with the action of G, it defines a second order differential operator L on a𝔞, invariant under W, called the radial part of the Laplacian. In general if X is in a𝔞, it defines a first order differential operator (or vector field) by Xf(y)=ddtf(y+tX)|t=0.(y)=.d/dtf(y+tX)|_t=0. L can be expressed in terms of these operators by the formula[34] L=Δa−∑α>0mαcoth⁡αAα,=Δ_𝔞-∑_α>0m_α α A_α, where Aα in a𝔞 is defined by (Aα,X)=α(X)(A_α,X)=α(X) and Δa=−∑Xi2Δ_𝔞=-_i^2 is the Laplacian on a𝔞, corresponding to any choice of orthonormal basis (Xi). Thus L=L0−∑α>0mα(coth⁡α−1)Aα,=L_0-∑_α>0m_α (α-1)A_α, where L0=Δa−∑α>0Aα,_0=Δ_𝔞-∑_α>0A_α, so that L can be regarded as a perturbation of the constant-coefficient operator L0. Now the spherical function φλ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian: Δφλ=(‖λ‖2+‖ρ‖2)φλΔφ_λ=(λ^2+ρ^2)φ_λ and therefore of L, when viewed as a W-invariant function on a𝔞. Since eiλ–ρ and its transforms under W are eigenfunctions of L0 with the same eigenvalue, it is natural look for a formula for φλ in terms of a perturbation series fλ=eiλ−ρ∑μ∈Λaμ(λ)e−μ,_λ=e^iλ-ρ∑_μ∈Λa_μ(λ)e^-μ, with Λ the cone of all non-negative integer combinations of positive roots, and the transforms of fλ under W. The expansion coth⁡x−1=2∑m>0e−2mx,-1=2∑_m>0e^-2mx, leads to a recursive formula for the coefficients aμ(λ). In particular they are uniquely determined and the series and its derivatives converges absolutely on a+𝔞_+, a fundamental domain for W. Remarkably it turns out that fλ is also an eigenfunction of the other G-invariant differential operators on G/K, each of which induces a W-invariant differential operator on a𝔞. It follows that φλ can be expressed in terms as a linear combination of fλ and its transforms under W:[35] φλ=∑s∈Wc(sλ)fsλ.φ_λ=∑_sc(sλ)f_sλ. Here c(λ) is Harish-Chandra's c-function. It describes the asymptotic behaviour of φλ in a+𝔞_+, since[36] φλ(etX)∼c(λ)e(iλ−ρ)Xtφ_λ(e^tX)(λ)e^(iλ-ρ)Xt for X in a+𝔞_+ and t > 0 large. Harish-Chandra obtained a second integral formula for φλ and hence c(λ) using the Bruhat decomposition of G:[37] G=⋃s∈WBsB,=⋃_sBsB, where B = MAN and the union is disjoint. Taking the Coxeter element s0 of W, the unique element mapping a+𝔞_+ onto −a+-𝔞_+, it follows that σ(N) has a dense open orbit G/B = K/M whose complement is a union of cells of strictly smaller dimension and therefore has measure zero. It follows that the integral formula for φλ initially defined over K/M φλ(g)=∫K/Mλ′(gk)−1dk.φ_λ(g)=∫_K/Mλ'(gk)^-1 dk. can be transferred to σ(N):[38] φλ(eX)=eiλ−ρ∫σ(N)λ′(n)¯λ′(eXne−X)dn,φ_λ(e^X)=e^iλ-ρ∫_σ(N)λ'(n)λ'(e^Xne^-X) dn, for X in a𝔞. Since limt→∞etXne−tX=1lim_t→∞e^tXne^-tX=1 for X in a+𝔞_+, the asymptotic behaviour of φλ can be read off from this integral, leading to the formula:[39] c(λ)=∫σ(N)λ′(n)¯dn.(λ)=∫_σ(N)λ'(n) dn.
