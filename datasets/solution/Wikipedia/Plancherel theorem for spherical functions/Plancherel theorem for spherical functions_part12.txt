groups: Let G0 be a normal real form of the complex semisimple Lie group G, the fixed points of an involution σ, conjugate linear on the Lie algebra of G. Let τ be a Cartan involution of G0 extended to an involution of G, complex linear on its Lie algebra, chosen to commute with σ. The fixed point subgroup of τσ is a compact real form U of G, intersecting G0 in a maximal compact subgroup K0. The fixed point subgroup of τ is K, the complexification of K0. Let G0= K0·P0 be the corresponding Cartan decomposition of G0 and let A be a maximal Abelian subgroup of P0. Flensted-Jensen (1978) proved that G=KA+U,=KA_+U, where A+ is the image of the closure of a Weyl chamber in a𝔞 under the exponential map. Moreover, K∖G/U=A+./U=A_+. Since K0∖G0/K0=A+_0_0/K_0=A_+ it follows that there is a canonical identification between K \ G / U, K0 \ G0 /K0 and A+. Thus K0-biinvariant functions on G0 can be identified with functions on A+ as can functions on G that are left invariant under K and right invariant under U. Let f be a function in Cc∞(K0∖G0/K0)_c^∞(K_0_0/K_0) and define Mf in Cc∞(U∖G/U)_c^∞(U/U) by Mf(a)=∫Uf(ua2)du.(a)=∫_Uf(ua^2) du. Here a third Cartan decomposition of G = UAU has been used to identify U \ G / U with A+. Let Δ be the Laplacian on G0/K0 and let Δc be the Laplacian on G/U. Then 4MΔ=ΔcM.4MΔ=Δ_cM. For F in Cc∞(U∖G/U)_c^∞(U/U), define M*F in Cc∞(K0∖G0/K0)_c^∞(K_0_0/K_0) by M∗F(a2)=∫KF(ga)dg.^*F(a^2)=∫_KF(ga) dg. Then M and M* satisfy the duality relations ∫G/U(Mf)⋅F=∫G0/K0f⋅(M∗F).∫_G/U(Mf)=∫_G_0/K_0f·(M^*F). In particular M∗Δc=4ΔM∗.^*Δ_c=4^*. There is a similar compatibility for other operators in the center of the universal enveloping algebra of G0. It follows from the eigenfunction characterisation of spherical functions that M∗Φ2λ^*Φ_2λ is proportional to φλ on G0, the constant of proportionality being given by b(λ)=M∗Φ2λ(1)=∫KΦ2λ(k)dk.(λ)=M^*Φ_2λ(1)=∫_KΦ_2λ(k) dk. Moreover, in this case[27] (M∗F)∼(λ)=F (2λ).(M^*F)^∼(λ)=F̃(2λ). If f = M*F, then the spherical inversion formula for F on G implies that for f on G0:[28][29] f(g)=∫a+∗f (λ)φλ(g)2dimA⋅|b(λ)|⋅|d(2λ)|2dλ,(g)=∫_𝔞_+^*f̃(λ)φ_λ(g) 2^dim A·|b(λ)|·|d(2λ)|^2 dλ, since f(g)=M∗F(g)=∫a+∗F (2λ)M∗Φ2λ(g)2dimA|d(2λ)|2dλ=∫a+∗f (λ)φλ(g)b(λ)2dimA|d(2λ)|2dλ.(g)=M^*F(g)=∫_𝔞_+^*F̃(2λ)M^*Φ_2λ(g)2^dim A|d(2λ)|^2 dλ=∫_𝔞_+^*f̃(λ)φ_λ(g) b(λ)2^dim A|d(2λ)|^2 dλ. The direct calculation of the integral for b(λ), generalising the computation of Godement (1957) for SL(2,R), was left as an open problem by Flensted-Jensen (1978).[30] An explicit product formula for b(λ) was known from the prior determination of the Plancherel measure by Harish-Chandra (1966), giving[31][32] b(λ)=C⋅d(2λ)−1⋅∏α>0tanh⁡π(α,λ)(α,α),(λ)=C(2λ)^-1·∏_α>0tanhπ(α,λ)(α,α), where α ranges over the positive roots of the root system in a𝔞 and C is a normalising constant, given as a quotient of products of Gamma functions.
