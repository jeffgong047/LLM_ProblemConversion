C): The group G = SL(2,C) acts transitively on the quaternionic upper half space H3=x+yi+tj∣t>0ℌ^3={x+yi+tj>0} by Möbius transformations. The complex matrix g=(abcd)=[ a b; c d ] acts as g(w)=(aw+b)(cw+d)−1.(w)=(aw+b)(cw+d)^-1. The stabiliser of the point j is the maximal compact subgroup K = SU(2), so that H3=G/K.ℌ^3=G/K. It carries the G-invariant Riemannian metric ds2=r−2(dx2+dy2+dr2)^2=r^-2(dx^2+dy^2+dr^2) with associated volume element dV=r−3dxdydr=r^-3 dx dy dr and Laplacian operator Δ=−r2(∂x2+∂y2+∂r2)+r∂r.Δ=-r^2(∂_x^2+∂_y^2+∂_r^2)+r∂_r. Every point in H3ℌ^3 can be written as k(etj) with k in SU(2) and t determined up to a sign. The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SU(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter t: Δ=−∂t2−2coth⁡t∂t.Δ=-∂_t^2-2∂_t. The integral of an SU(2)-invariant function is given by ∫fdV=∫−∞∞f(t)sinh2⁡tdt. dV=∫_-∞^∞f(t) sinh^2t dt. Identifying the square integrable SU(2)-invariant functions with L2(R) by the unitary transformation Uf(t) = f(t) sinh t, Δ is transformed into the operator U∗ΔU=−d2dt2+1.^*=-d^2^2+1. By the Plancherel theorem and Fourier inversion formula for R, any SU(2)-invariant function f can be expressed in terms of the spherical functions Φλ(t)=sin⁡λtλsinh⁡t,Φ_λ(t)=sinλ, by the spherical transform f (λ)=∫fΦ−λdVf̃(λ)=Φ_-λ dV and the spherical inversion formula f(x)=∫f (λ)Φλ(x)λ2dλ.(x)=∫f̃(λ)Φ_λ(x)λ^2 dλ. Taking f=f2∗⋆f1=f_2^*_1 with fi in Cc(G / K) and f∗(g)=f(g−1)¯^*(g)=f(g^-1), and evaluating at i yields the Plancherel formula ∫Gf1f2¯dg=∫f 1(λ)f 2(λ)¯λ2dλ.∫_Gf_1f_2 dg=∫f̃_1(λ)f̃_2(λ) λ^2 dλ. For biinvariant functions this establishes the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions: the map U:L2(K∖G/K)→L2(R,λ2dλ)U:f⟼f U:L^2(K/K)^2(ℝ,λ^2 dλ) U:f⟼f̃ is unitary and sends the convolution operator defined by f∈L1(K∖G/K)^1(K/K) into the multiplication operator defined by f f̃. The spherical function Φλ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian: ΔΦλ=(λ2+1)Φλ.ΔΦ_λ=(λ^2+1)Φ_λ. Schwartz functions on R are the spherical transforms of functions f belonging to the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space S=f|supt|(1+t2)N(I+Δ)Mf(t)sinh⁡(t)|<∞.𝒮={f|sup_t|(1+t^2)^N(I+Δ)^Mf(t)sinh(t)|<∞}.. By the Paley-Wiener theorem, the spherical transforms of smooth SU(2)-invariant functions of compact support are precisely functions on R which are restrictions of holomorphic functions on C satisfying an exponential growth condition |F(λ)|≤CeR|Im⁡λ|.|F(λ)|^R|Imλ|. As a function on G, Φλ is the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series defined on L2(C), where C is identified with the boundary of H3ℌ^3. The representation is given by the formula πλ(g−1)ξ(z)=|cz+d|−2−iλξ(g(z)).π_λ(g^-1)ξ(z)=|cz+d|^-2-iλξ(g(z)). The function ξ0(z)=π−1(1+|z|2)−2ξ_0(z)=π^-1(1+|z|^2)^-2 is fixed by SU(2) and Φλ(g)=(πλ(g)ξ0,ξ0).Φ_λ(g)=(π_λ(g)ξ_0,ξ_0). The representations πλ are irreducible and unitarily equivalent only when the sign of λ is changed. The map W of L2(H3)^2(ℌ^3) onto L2([0,∞) × C) (with measure λ2 dλ on the first factor) given by Wf(λ,z)=∫G/Kf(g)πλ(g)ξ0(z)dg(λ,z)=∫_G/Kf(g)π_λ(g)ξ_0(z) dg is unitary and gives the decomposition of L2(H3)^2(ℌ^3) as a direct integral of the spherical principal series.
