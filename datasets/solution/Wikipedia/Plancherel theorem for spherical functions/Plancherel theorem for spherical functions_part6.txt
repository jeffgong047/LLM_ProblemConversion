R): The group G = SL(2,R) acts transitively on the Poincaré upper half plane H2=x+ri∣r>0ℌ^2={x+ri>0} by Möbius transformations. The real matrix g=(abcd)=[ a b; c d ] acts as g(w)=(aw+b)(cw+d)−1.(w)=(aw+b)(cw+d)^-1. The stabiliser of the point i is the maximal compact subgroup K = SO(2), so that H2ℌ^2 = G / K. It carries the G-invariant Riemannian metric ds2=r−2(dx2+dr2)^2=r^-2(dx^2+dr^2) with associated area element dA=r−2dxdr=r^-2 dx dr and Laplacian operator Δ=−r2(∂x2+∂r2).Δ=-r^2(∂_x^2+∂_r^2). Every point in H2ℌ^2 can be written as k( et i ) with k in SO(2) and t determined up to a sign. The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SO(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter t: Δ=−∂t2−coth⁡t∂t.Δ=-∂_t^2-∂_t. The integral of an SO(2)-invariant function is given by ∫fdA=∫−∞∞f(t)|sinh⁡t|dt. dA=∫_-∞^∞f(t)||dt. There are several methods for deriving the corresponding eigenfunction expansion for this ordinary differential equation including: the classical spectral theory of ordinary differential equations applied to the hypergeometric equation (Mehler, Weyl, Fock); variants of Hadamard's method of descent, realising 2-dimensional hyperbolic space as the quotient of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space by the free action of a 1-parameter subgroup of SL(2,C); Abel's integral equation, following Selberg and Godement; orbital integrals (Harish-Chandra, Gelfand & Naimark). The second and third technique will be described below, with two different methods of descent: the classical one due Hadamard, familiar from treatments of the heat equation[12] and the wave equation[13] on hyperbolic space; and Flensted-Jensen's method on the hyperboloid. Hadamard's method of
