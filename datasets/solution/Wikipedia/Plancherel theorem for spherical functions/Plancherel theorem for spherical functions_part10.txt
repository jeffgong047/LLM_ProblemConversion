cases: All complex semisimple Lie groups or the Lorentz groups SO0(N,1) with N odd can be treated directly by reduction to the usual Fourier transform.[15][20] The remaining real Lorentz groups can be deduced by Flensted-Jensen's method of descent, as can other semisimple Lie groups of real rank one.[21] Flensted-Jensen's method of descent also applies to the treatment of real semisimple Lie groups for which the Lie algebras are normal real forms of complex semisimple Lie algebras.[15] The special case of SL(N,R) is treated in detail in Jorgenson & Lang (2001); this group is also the normal real form of SL(N,C). The approach of Flensted-Jensen (1978) applies to a wide class of real semisimple Lie groups of arbitrary real rank and yields the explicit product form of the Plancherel measure on aùîû* without using Harish-Chandra's expansion of the spherical functions œÜŒª in terms of his c-function, discussed below. Although less general, it gives a simpler approach to the Plancherel theorem for this class of groups. Complex semisimple Lie
