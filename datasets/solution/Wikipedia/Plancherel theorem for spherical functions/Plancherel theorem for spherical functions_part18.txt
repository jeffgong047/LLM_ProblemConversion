functions: The Harish-Chandra Schwartz space can be defined as[51] S(K∖G/K)=f∈C∞(G/K)K:supx|(1+d(x,o))m(Δ+I)nf(x)|<∞.𝒮(K/K)={f^∞(G/K)^K:sup_x|(1+d(x,o))^m(Δ+I)^nf(x)|<∞}. Under the spherical transform it is mapped onto S(a∗)W,𝒮(𝔞^*)^W, the space of W-invariant Schwartz functions on a∗.𝔞^*. The original proof of Harish-Chandra was a long argument by induction.[6][7][52] Anker (1991) found a short and simple proof, allowing the result to be deduced directly from versions of the Paley-Wiener and spherical inversion formula. He proved that the spherical transform of a Harish-Chandra Schwartz function is a classical Schwartz function. His key observation was then to show that the inverse transform was continuous on the Paley-Wiener space endowed with classical Schwartz space seminorms, using classical estimates.
