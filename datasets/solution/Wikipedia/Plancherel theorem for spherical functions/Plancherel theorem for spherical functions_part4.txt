series: See also: Principal series representation The spherical function φλ can be identified with the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series of G. If M is the centralizer of A in K, this is defined as the unitary representation πλ of G induced by the character of B = MAN given by the composition of the homomorphism of MAN onto A and the character λ. The induced representation is defined on functions f on G with f(gb)=Δ(b)1/2λ(b)f(g)(gb)=Δ(b)^1/2λ(b)f(g) for b in B by π(g)f(x)=f(g−1x),π(g)f(x)=f(g^-1x), where ‖f‖2=∫K|f(k)|2dk<∞.f^2=∫_K|f(k)|^2 dk<∞. The functions f can be identified with functions in L2(K / M) and χλ(g)=(π(g)1,1).χ_λ(g)=(π(g)1,1). As Kostant (1969) proved, the representations of the spherical principal series are irreducible and two representations πλ and πμ are unitarily equivalent if and only if μ = σ(λ) for some σ in the Weyl group of A.
