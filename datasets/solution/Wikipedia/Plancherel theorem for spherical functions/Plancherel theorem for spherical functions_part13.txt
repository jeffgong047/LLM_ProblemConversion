theorem: Let G be a noncompact connected real semisimple Lie group with finite center. Let g𝔤 denote its Lie algebra. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup given as the subgroup of fixed points of a Cartan involution σ. Let g±𝔤_± be the ±1 eigenspaces of σ in g𝔤, so that k=g+𝔨=𝔤_+ is the Lie algebra of K and p=g−𝔭=𝔤_- give the Cartan decomposition g=k+p,G=exp⁡p⋅K.𝔤=𝔨+𝔭, G=exp𝔭. Let a𝔞 be a maximal Abelian subalgebra of p𝔭 and for α in a∗𝔞^* let gα=X∈g:[H,X]=α(H)X(H∈a).𝔤_α={X∈𝔤:[H,X]=α(H)X (H∈𝔞)}. If α ≠ 0 and gα≠(0)𝔤_α≠(0), then α is called a restricted root and mα=dim⁡gα_α=𝔤_α is called its multiplicity. Let A = exp a𝔞, so that G = KAK.The restriction of the Killing form defines an inner product on p𝔭 and hence a𝔞, which allows a∗𝔞^* to be identified with a𝔞. With respect to this inner product, the restricted roots Σ give a root system. Its Weyl group can be identified with W=NK(A)/CK(A)=N_K(A)/C_K(A). A choice of positive roots defines a Weyl chamber a+∗𝔞_+^*. The reduced root system Σ0 consists of roots α such that α/2 is not a root. Defining the spherical functions φ λ as above for λ in a∗𝔞^*, the spherical transform of f in Cc∞(K \ G / K) is defined by f (λ)=∫Gf(g)φ−λ(g)dg.f̃(λ)=∫_Gf(g)φ_-λ(g) dg. The spherical inversion formula states that f(g)=∫a+∗f (λ)φλ(g)|c(λ)|−2dλ,(g)=∫_𝔞_+^*f̃(λ)φ_λ(g) |c(λ)|^-2 dλ, where Harish-Chandra's c-function c(λ) is defined by[33] c(λ)=c0⋅∏α∈Σ0+2−i(λ,α0)Γ(i(λ,α0))Γ(12[12mα+1+i(λ,α0)])Γ(12[12mα+m2α+i(λ,α0)])(λ)=c_0·∏_α∈Σ_0^+2^-i(λ,α_0)Γ(i(λ,α_0))/Γ(1/2[1/2m_α+1+i(λ,α_0)])Γ(1/2[1/2m_α+m_2α+i(λ,α_0)]) with α0=(α,α)−1αα_0=(α,α)^-1α and the constant c0 chosen so that c(−iρ) = 1 where ρ=12∑α∈Σ+mαα.ρ=1/2∑_α∈Σ^+m_αα. The Plancherel theorem for spherical functions states that the map W:f↦f ,L2(K∖G/K)→L2(a+∗,|c(λ)|−2dλ):f↦f̃, Ł^2(K/K)^2(𝔞_+^*,|c(λ)|^-2 dλ) is unitary and transforms convolution by f∈L1(K∖G/K)^1(K/K) into multiplication by f f̃.
