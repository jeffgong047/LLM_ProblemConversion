functions: Main article: Zonal spherical function Let G be a semisimple Lie group and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. The Hecke algebra Cc(K \G/K), consisting of compactly supported K-biinvariant continuous functions on G, acts by convolution on the Hilbert space H=L2(G / K). Because G / K is a symmetric space, this *-algebra is commutative. The closure of its (the Hecke algebra's) image in the operator norm is a non-unital commutative C* algebra A𝔄, so by the Gelfand isomorphism can be identified with the continuous functions vanishing at infinity on its spectrum X.[10] Points in the spectrum are given by continuous *-homomorphisms of A𝔄 into C, i.e. characters of A𝔄. If S' denotes the commutant of a set of operators S on H, then A′𝔄^' can be identified with the commutant of the regular representation of G on H. Now A𝔄 leaves invariant the subspace H0 of K-invariant vectors in H. Moreover, the abelian von Neumann algebra it generates on H0 is maximal Abelian. By spectral theory, there is an essentially unique[11] measure μ on the locally compact space X and a unitary transformation U between H0 and L2(X, μ) which carries the operators in A𝔄 onto the corresponding multiplication operators. The transformation U is called the spherical Fourier transform or sometimes just the spherical transform and μ is called the Plancherel measure. The Hilbert space H0 can be identified with L2(K\G/K), the space of K-biinvariant square integrable functions on G. The characters χλ of A𝔄 (i.e. the points of X) can be described by positive definite spherical functions φλ on G, via the formula χλ(π(f))=∫Gf(g)⋅φλ(g)dg.χ_λ(π(f))=∫_Gf(g)·φ_λ(g) dg. for f in Cc(K\G/K), where π(f) denotes the convolution operator in A𝔄 and the integral is with respect to Haar measure on G. The spherical functions φλ on G are given by Harish-Chandra's formula: φλ(g)=∫Kλ′(gk)−1dk.φ_λ(g)=∫_Kλ^'(gk)^-1 dk. In this formula: the integral is with respect to Haar measure on K; λ is an element of A* =Hom(A,T) where A is the Abelian vector subgroup in the Iwasawa decomposition G =KAN of G; λ' is defined on G by first extending λ to a character of the solvable subgroup AN, using the group homomorphism onto A, and then setting λ′(kx)=ΔAN(x)1/2λ(x)λ'(kx)=Δ_AN(x)^1/2λ(x) for k in K and x in AN, where ΔAN is the modular function of AN. Two different characters λ1 and λ2 give the same spherical function if and only if λ1 = λ2·s, where s is in the Weyl group of A W=NK(A)/CK(A),=N_K(A)/C_K(A), the quotient of the normaliser of A in K by its centraliser, a finite reflection group. It follows that X can be identified with the quotient space A*/W. Spherical principal
