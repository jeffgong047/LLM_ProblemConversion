groups: If G is a complex semisimple Lie group, it is the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup U, a compact semisimple Lie group. If g𝔤 and u𝔲 are their Lie algebras, then g=u⊕iu.𝔤=𝔲𝔲. Let T be a maximal torus in U with Lie algebra t.𝔱. Then setting A=exp⁡it,P=exp⁡iu,=𝔱,=𝔲, there is the Cartan decomposition: G=P⋅U=UAU.=P=UAU. The finite-dimensional irreducible representations πλ of U are indexed by certain λ in t∗𝔱^*.[22] The corresponding character formula and dimension formula of Hermann Weyl give explicit formulas for χλ(eX)=Tr⁡πλ(eX),(X∈t),d(λ)=dim⁡πλ.χ_λ(e^X)=Trπ_λ(e^X),(X∈𝔱),(λ)=π_λ. These formulas, initially defined on t∗×t𝔱^*×𝔱 and t∗𝔱^*, extend holomorphic to their complexifications. Moreover, χλ(eX)=∑σ∈Wsign(σ)eiλ(σX)δ(eX),χ_λ(e^X)=∑_σsign(σ)e^iλ()δ(e^X), where W is the Weyl group W=NU(T)/T=N_U(T)/T and δ(eX) is given by a product formula (Weyl's denominator formula) which extends holomorphically to the complexification of t𝔱. There is a similar product formula for d(λ), a polynomial in λ. On the complex group G, the integral of a U-biinvariant function F can be evaluated as ∫GF(g)dg=1|W|∫aF(eX)|δ(eX)|2dX.∫_GF(g) dg=1|W|∫_𝔞F(e^X) |δ(e^X)|^2 dX. where a=it𝔞=i𝔱. The spherical functions of G are labelled by λ in a=it∗𝔞=i𝔱^* and given by the Harish-Chandra-Berezin formula[23] Φλ(eX)=χλ(eX)d(λ).Φ_λ(e^X)=χ_λ(e^X)(λ). They are the matrix coefficients of the irreducible spherical principal series of G induced from the character of the Borel subgroup of G corresponding to λ; these representations are irreducible and can all be realized on L2(U/T). The spherical transform of a U-biinvariant function F is given by F (λ)=∫GF(g)Φ−λ(g)dgF̃(λ)=∫_GF(g)Φ_-λ(g) dg and the spherical inversion formula by F(g)=1|W|∫a∗F (λ)Φλ(g)|d(λ)|2dλ=∫a+∗F (λ)Φλ(g)|d(λ)|2dλ,(g)=1|W|∫_𝔞^*F̃(λ)Φ_λ(g)|d(λ)|^2 d λ=∫_𝔞_+^*F̃(λ)Φ_λ(g)|d(λ)|^2 d λ, where a+∗𝔞_+^* is a Weyl chamber. In fact the result follows from the Fourier inversion formula on a𝔞 since[24] d(λ)δ(eX)Φλ(eX)=∑σ∈Wsign(σ)eiλ(X),(λ)δ(e^X)Φ_λ(e^X)=∑_σsign(σ)e^iλ(X), so that d(λ)¯F (λ)d(λ)F̃(λ) is just the Fourier transform of F(eX)δ(eX)(e^X)δ(e^X). Note that the symmetric space G/U has as compact dual[25] the compact symmetric space U x U / U, where U is the diagonal subgroup. The spherical functions for the latter space, which can be identified with U itself, are the normalized characters χλ/d(λ) indexed by lattice points in the interior of a+∗𝔞_+^* and the role of A is played by T. The spherical transform of f of a class function on U is given by f (λ)=∫Uf(u)χλ(u)¯d(λ)duf̃(λ)=∫_Uf(u)χ_λ(u)(λ) du and the spherical inversion formula now follows from the theory of Fourier series on T: f(u)=∑λf (λ)χλ(u)d(λ)d(λ)2.(u)=∑_λf̃(λ)χ_λ(u)(λ)d(λ)^2. There is an evident duality between these formulas and those for the non-compact dual.[26] Real semisimple Lie
