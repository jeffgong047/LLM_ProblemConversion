c-function: Main article: Harish-Chandra's c-function The many roles of Harish-Chandra's c-function in non-commutative harmonic analysis are surveyed in Helgason (2000). Although it was originally introduced by Harish-Chandra in the asymptotic expansions of spherical functions, discussed above, it was also soon understood to be intimately related to intertwining operators between induced representations, first studied in this context by Bruhat (1957) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFBruhat1957 (help). These operators exhibit the unitary equivalence between πλ and πsλ for s in the Weyl group and a c-function cs(λ) can be attached to each such operator: namely the value at 1 of the intertwining operator applied to ξ0, the constant function 1, in L2(K/M).[40] Equivalently, since ξ0 is up to scalar multiplication the unique vector fixed by K, it is an eigenvector of the intertwining operator with eigenvalue cs(λ). These operators all act on the same space L2(K/M), which can be identified with the representation induced from the 1-dimensional representation defined by λ on MAN. Once A has been chosen, the compact subgroup M is uniquely determined as the centraliser of A in K. The nilpotent subgroup N, however, depends on a choice of a Weyl chamber in a∗𝔞^*, the various choices being permuted by the Weyl group W = M ' / M, where M ' is the normaliser of A in K. The standard intertwining operator corresponding to (s, λ) is defined on the induced representation by[41] A(s,λ)F(k)=∫σ(N)∩s−1NsF(ksn)dn,(s,λ)F(k)=∫_σ(N)^-1NsF(ksn) dn, where σ is the Cartan involution. It satisfies the intertwining relation A(s,λ)πλ(g)=πsλ(g)A(s,λ).(s,λ)π_λ(g)=π_sλ(g)A(s,λ). The key property of the intertwining operators and their integrals is the multiplicative cocycle property[42] A(s1s2,λ)=A(s1,s2λ)A(s2,λ),(s_1s_2,λ)=A(s_1,s_2λ)A(s_2,λ), whenever ℓ(s1s2)=ℓ(s1)+ℓ(s2)ℓ(s_1s_2)=ℓ(s_1)+ℓ(s_2) for the length function on the Weyl group associated with the choice of Weyl chamber. For s in W, this is the number of chambers crossed by the straight line segment between X and sX for any point X in the interior of the chamber. The unique element of greatest length s0, namely the number of positive restricted roots, is the unique element that carries the Weyl chamber a+∗𝔞_+^* onto −a+∗-𝔞_+^*. By Harish-Chandra's integral formula, it corresponds to Harish-Chandra's c-function: c(λ)=cs0(λ).(λ)=c_s_0(λ). The c-functions are in general defined by the equation A(s,λ)ξ0=cs(λ)ξ0,(s,λ)ξ_0=c_s(λ)ξ_0, where ξ0 is the constant function 1 in L2(K/M). The cocycle property of the intertwining operators implies a similar multiplicative property for the c-functions: cs1s2(λ)=cs1(s2λ)cs2(λ)_s_1s_2(λ)=c_s_1(s_2λ)c_s_2(λ) provided ℓ(s1s2)=ℓ(s1)+ℓ(s2).ℓ(s_1s_2)=ℓ(s_1)+ℓ(s_2). This reduces the computation of cs to the case when s = sα, the reflection in a (simple) root α, the so-called "rank-one reduction" of Gindikin & Karpelevich (1962). In fact the integral involves only the closed connected subgroup Gα corresponding to the Lie subalgebra generated by g±α𝔤_±α where α lies in Σ0+.[43] Then Gα is a real semisimple Lie group with real rank one, i.e. dim Aα = 1, and cs is just the Harish-Chandra c-function of Gα. In this case the c-function can be computed directly by various means: by noting that φλ can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function for which the asymptotic expansion is known from the classical formulas of Gauss for the connection coefficients;[6][44] by directly computing the integral, which can be expressed as an integral in two variables and hence a product of two beta functions.[45][46] This yields the following formula: csα(λ)=c02−i(λ,α0)Γ(i(λ,α0))Γ(12(12mα+1+i(λ,α0)))Γ(12(12mα+m2α+i(λ,α0))),_s_α(λ)=c_02^-i(λ,α_0)Γ(i(λ,α_0))/Γ(1/2(1/2m_α+1+i(λ,α_0)))Γ(1/2(1/2m_α+m_2α+i(λ,α_0))), where c0=2mα/2+m2αΓ(12(mα+m2α+1))._0=2^m_α/2+m_2αΓ(12(m_α+m_2α+1)). The general Gindikin–Karpelevich formula for c(λ) is an immediate consequence of this formula and the multiplicative properties of cs(λ). Paley–Wiener
