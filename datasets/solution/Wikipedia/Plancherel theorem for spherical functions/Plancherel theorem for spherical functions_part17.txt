formula: Rosenberg (1977) noticed that the Paley-Wiener theorem and the spherical inversion theorem could be proved simultaneously, by a trick which considerably simplified previous proofs. The first step of his proof consists in showing directly that the inverse transform, defined using Harish-Chandra's c-function, defines a function supported in the closed ball of radius R about the origin if the Paley-Wiener estimate is satisfied. This follows because the integrand defining the inverse transform extends to a meromorphic function on the complexification of a∗𝔞^*; the integral can be shifted to a∗+iμt𝔞^*+i for μ in a+∗𝔞_+^* and t > 0. Using Harish-Chandra's expansion of φλ and the formulas for c(λ) in terms of Gamma functions, the integral can be bounded for t large and hence can be shown to vanish outside the closed ball of radius R about the origin.[48] This part of the Paley-Wiener theorem shows that T(f)=∫a+∗f (λ)|c(λ)|−2dλ(f)=∫_𝔞_+^*f̃(λ)|c(λ)|^-2 dλ defines a distribution on G/K with support at the origin o. A further estimate for the integral shows that it is in fact given by a measure and that therefore there is a constant C such that T(f)=Cf(o).(f)=Cf(o). By applying this result to f1(g)=∫Kf(x−1kg)dk,_1(g)=∫_Kf(x^-1kg) dk, it follows that Cf=∫a+∗f (λ)φλ|c(λ)|−2dλ.=∫_𝔞_+^*f̃(λ)φ_λ|c(λ)|^-2 dλ. A further scaling argument allows the inequality C = 1 to be deduced from the Plancherel theorem and Paley-Wiener theorem on a𝔞.[49][50] Schwartz
