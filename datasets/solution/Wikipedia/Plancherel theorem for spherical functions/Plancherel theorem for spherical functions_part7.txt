descent: If f(x,r) is a function on H2ℌ^2 and M1f(x,y,r)=r1/2⋅f(x,r)_1f(x,y,r)=r^1/2(x,r) then Δ3M1f=M1(Δ2+34)f,Δ_3M_1f=M_1(Δ_2+34)f, where Δn is the Laplacian on Hnℌ^n. Since the action of SL(2,C) commutes with Δ3, the operator M0 on S0(2)-invariant functions obtained by averaging M1f by the action of SU(2) also satisfies Δ3M0=M0(Δ2+34).Δ_3M_0=M_0(Δ_2+34). The adjoint operator M1* defined by M1∗F(x,r)=r1/2∫−∞∞F(x,y,r)dy_1^*F(x,r)=r^1/2∫_-∞^∞F(x,y,r) dy satisfies ∫H3(M1f)⋅FdV=∫H2f⋅(M1∗F)dA.∫_ℌ^3(M_1f) dV=∫_ℌ^2f·(M_1^*F) dA. The adjoint M0*, defined by averaging M*f over SO(2), satisfies ∫H3(M0f)⋅FdV=∫H2f⋅(M0∗F)dA∫_ℌ^3(M_0f) dV=∫_ℌ^2f·(M_0^*F) dA for SU(2)-invariant functions F and SO(2)-invariant functions f. It follows that Mi∗Δ3=(Δ2+34)Mi∗._i^*Δ_3=(Δ_2+34)M_i^*. The function fλ=M1∗Φλ_λ=M_1^*Φ_λ is SO(2)-invariant and satisfies Δ2fλ=(λ2+14)fλ.Δ_2f_λ=(λ^2+14)f_λ. On the other hand, b(λ)=fλ(i)=∫sin⁡λtλsinh⁡tdt=πλtanh⁡πλ2,(λ)=f_λ(i)=∫sinλ dt=πλtanhπλ2, since the integral can be computed by integrating eiλt/sinh⁡t^i/ around the rectangular indented contour with vertices at ±R and ±R + πi. Thus the eigenfunction ϕλ=b(λ)−1M1Φλϕ_λ=b(λ)^-1M_1Φ_λ satisfies the normalisation condition φλ(i) = 1. There can only be one such solution either because the Wronskian of the ordinary differential equation must vanish or by expanding as a power series in sinh r.[14] It follows that φλ(eti)=12π∫02π(cosh⁡t−sinh⁡tcos⁡θ)−1−iλdθ.φ_λ(e^ti)=1/2π∫_0^2π(-cosθ)^-1-iλ dθ. Similarly it follows that Φλ=M1ϕλ.Φ_λ=M_1ϕ_λ. If the spherical transform of an SO(2)-invariant function on H2ℌ^2 is defined by f (λ)=∫fφ−λdA,f̃(λ)=φ_-λ dA, then (M1∗F)∼(λ)=F (λ).(M_1^*F)^∼(λ)=F̃(λ). Taking f=M1*F, the SL(2, C) inversion formula for F immediately yields f(x)=∫−∞∞φλ(x)f (λ)λπ2tanh⁡(πλ2)dλ,(x)=∫_-∞^∞φ_λ(x)f̃(λ)λπ2tanh(πλ2) dλ, the spherical inversion formula for SO(2)-invariant functions on H2ℌ^2. As for SL(2,C), this immediately implies the Plancherel formula for fi in Cc(SL(2,R) / SO(2)): ∫H2f1f2¯dA=∫−∞∞f 1f2 ¯λπ2tanh⁡(πλ2)dλ.∫_ℌ^2f_1f_2 dA=∫_-∞^∞f̃_1f̃_̃2̃λπ2tanh(πλ2) dλ. The spherical function φλ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian: Δ2φλ=(λ2+14)φλ.Δ_2φ_λ=(λ^2+14)φ_λ. Schwartz functions on R are the spherical transforms of functions f belonging to the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space S=f|supt|(1+t2)N(I+Δ)Mf(t)φ0(t)|<∞.𝒮={f|sup_t|(1+t^2)^N(I+Δ)^Mf(t)φ_0(t)|<∞}.. The spherical transforms of smooth SO(2)-invariant functions of compact support are precisely functions on R which are restrictions of holomorphic functions on C satisfying an exponential growth condition |F(λ)|≤CeR|ℑλ|.|F(λ)|^R|λ|. Both these results can be deduced by descent from the corresponding results for SL(2,C),[15] by verifying directly that the spherical transform satisfies the given growth conditions[16][17] and then using the relation (M1∗F)∼=F (M_1^*F)^∼=F̃. As a function on G, φλ is the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series defined on L2(R), where R is identified with the boundary of H2ℌ^2. The representation is given by the formula πλ(g−1)ξ(x)=|cx+d|−1−iλξ(g(x)).π_λ(g^-1)ξ(x)=|cx+d|^-1-iλξ(g(x)). The function ξ0(x)=π−1(1+|x|2)−1ξ_0(x)=π^-1(1+|x|^2)^-1 is fixed by SO(2) and Φλ(g)=(πλ(g)ξ0,ξ0).Φ_λ(g)=(π_λ(g)ξ_0,ξ_0). The representations πλ are irreducible and unitarily equivalent only when the sign of λ is changed. The map W:L2(H2)→L2([0,∞)×R):L^2(ℌ^2)^2([0,∞)×ℝ) with measure λπ2tanh⁡(πλ2)dλλπ/2tanh(πλ/2) dλ on the first factor, is given by the formula Wf(λ,x)=∫G/Kf(g)πλ(g)ξ0(x)dg(λ,x)=∫_G/Kf(g)π_λ(g)ξ_0(x) dg is unitary and gives the decomposition of L2(H2)^2(ℌ^2) as a direct integral of the spherical principal series.
