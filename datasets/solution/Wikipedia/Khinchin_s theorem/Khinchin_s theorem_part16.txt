sets: An important example of a function ψψ to which Khinchin's theorem can be applied is the function ψc(q)=q−cψ_c(q)=q^-c, where c > 1 is a real number. For this function, the relevant series converges and so Khinchin's theorem tells us that almost every point is not ψcψ_c-approximable. Thus, the set of numbers which are ψcψ_c-approximable forms a subset of the real line of Lebesgue measure zero. The Jarník-Besicovitch theorem, due to V. Jarník and A. S. Besicovitch, states that the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal to 1/c1/c.[19] In particular, the set of numbers which are ψcψ_c-approximable for some c>1>1 (known as the set of very well approximable numbers) has Hausdorff dimension one, while the set of numbers which are ψcψ_c-approximable for all c>1>1 (known as the set of Liouville numbers) has Hausdorff dimension zero. Another important example is the function ψε(q)=εq−1ψ_ε(q)=^-1, where ε>0ε>0 is a real number. For this function, the relevant series diverges and so Khinchin's theorem tells us that almost every number is ψεψ_ε-approximable. This is the same as saying that every such number is well approximable, where a number is called well approximable if it is not badly approximable. So an appropriate analogue of the Jarník-Besicovitch theorem should concern the Hausdorff dimension of the set of badly approximable numbers. And indeed, V. Jarník proved that the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal to one. This result was improved by W. M. Schmidt, who showed that the set of badly approximable numbers is incompressible, meaning that if f1,f2,…_1,f_2,… is a sequence of bi-Lipschitz maps, then the set of numbers x for which f1(x),f2(x),…_1(x),f_2(x),… are all badly approximable has Hausdorff dimension one. Schmidt also generalized Jarník's theorem to higher dimensions, a significant achievement because Jarník's argument is essentially one-dimensional, depending on the apparatus of continued fractions.
