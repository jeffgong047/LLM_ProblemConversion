numbers: A badly approximable number is an x for which there is a positive constant c such that for all rational p/q we have |xâˆ’pq|>cq2.|x-p/q|>c/q^2 The badly approximable numbers are precisely those with bounded partial quotients.[6] Equivalently, a number is badly approximable if and only if its Markov constant is bounded.
