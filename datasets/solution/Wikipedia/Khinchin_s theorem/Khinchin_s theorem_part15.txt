extensions: Let ψψ be a positive real-valued function on positive integers (i.e., a positive sequence) such that qψ(q)ψ(q) is non-increasing. A real number x (not necessarily algebraic) is called ψψ-approximable if there exist infinitely many rational numbers p/q such that |x−pq|<ψ(q)|q|.|x-p/q|<ψ(q)/|q|. Aleksandr Khinchin proved in 1926 that if the series ∑qψ(q)∑_qψ(q) diverges, then almost every real number (in the sense of Lebesgue measure) is ψψ-approximable, and if the series converges, then almost every real number is not ψψ-approximable. The circle of ideas surrounding this theorem and its relatives is known as metric Diophantine approximation or the metric theory of Diophantine approximation (not to be confused with height "metrics" in Diophantine geometry) or metric number theory. Duffin & Schaeffer (1941) proved a generalization of Khinchin's result, and posed what is now known as the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture on the analogue of Khinchin's dichotomy for general, not necessarily decreasing, sequences ψψ . Beresnevich & Velani (2006) proved that a Hausdorff measure analogue of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture is equivalent to the original Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture, which is a priori weaker. In July 2019, Dimitris Koukoulopoulos and James Maynard announced a proof of the conjecture.[17][18] Hausdorff dimension of exceptional
