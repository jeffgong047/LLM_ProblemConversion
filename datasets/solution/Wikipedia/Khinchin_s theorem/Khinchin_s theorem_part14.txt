spectrum: Main article: Markov spectrum As said above, the constant in Borel's theorem may not be improved, as shown by Adolf Hurwitz in 1891.[12] Let ϕ=1+52ϕ=1+√(5)2 be the golden ratio. Then for any real constant c with c>5>√(5) there are only a finite number of rational numbers p/q such that |ϕ−pq|<1cq2.|ϕ-p/q|<1/c q^2. Hence an improvement can only be achieved, if the numbers which are equivalent to ϕϕ are excluded. More precisely:[13][14] For every irrational number αα, which is not equivalent to ϕϕ, there are infinite many fractions pqpq such that |α−pq|<18q2.|α-p/q|<1/√(8)q^2. By successive exclusions — next one must exclude the numbers equivalent to 2√(2) — of more and more classes of equivalence, the lower bound can be further enlarged. The values which may be generated in this way are Lagrange numbers, which are part of the Lagrange spectrum. They converge to the number 3 and are related to the Markov numbers.[15][16] Khinchin's theorem on metric Diophantine approximation and
