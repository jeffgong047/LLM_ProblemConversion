numbers: Main article: Subspace theorem Subsequently, Wolfgang M. Schmidt generalized this to the case of simultaneous approximations, proving that: If x1, ..., xn are algebraic numbers such that 1, x1, ..., xn are linearly independent over the rational numbers and ε is any given positive real number, then there are only finitely many rational n-tuples (p1/q, ..., pn/q) such that |xi−piq|<q−(1+1/n+ε),i=1,…,n.|x_i-p_i/q|<q^-(1+1/n+ε),=1,…,n. Again, this result is optimal in the sense that one may not remove ε from the exponent. Effective
