bound: Main article: Hurwitz's theorem (number theory) The first important result about upper bounds for Diophantine approximations is Dirichlet's approximation theorem, which implies that, for every irrational number α, there are infinitely many fractions pqpq such that |α−pq|<1q2.|α-p/q|<1/q^2 . This implies immediately that one cannot suppress the ε in the statement of Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem. Adolf Hurwitz (1891)[7] strengthened this result, proving that for every irrational number α, there are infinitely many fractions pqpq such that |α−pq|<15q2.|α-p/q|<1/√(5)q^2 . Therefore, 15q21/√(5) q^2 is an upper bound for the Diophantine approximations of any irrational number. The constant in this result may not be further improved without excluding some irrational numbers (see below). Émile Borel (1903)[8] showed that, in fact, given any irrational number α, and given three consecutive convergents of α, at least one must satisfy the inequality given in Hurwitz's Theorem.
