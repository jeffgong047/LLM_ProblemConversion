result: Main article: Liouville number In the 1840s, Joseph Liouville obtained the first lower bound for the approximation of algebraic numbers: If x is an irrational algebraic number of degree n over the rational numbers, then there exists a constant c(x) > 0 such that |x−pq|>c(x)qn|x-p/q|>c(x)/q^n holds for all integers p and q where q > 0. This result allowed him to produce the first proven example of a transcendental number, the Liouville constant ∑j=1∞10−j!=0.110001000000000000000001000…,∑_j=1^∞10^-j!=0.110001000000000000000001000… , which does not satisfy Liouville's theorem, whichever degree n is chosen. This link between Diophantine approximations and transcendental number theory continues to the present day. Many of the proof techniques are shared between the two areas.
