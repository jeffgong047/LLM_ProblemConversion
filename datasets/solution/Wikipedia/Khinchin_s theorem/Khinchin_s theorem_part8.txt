theorem: Main article: Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem Over more than a century, there were many efforts to improve Liouville's theorem: every improvement of the bound enables us to prove that more numbers are transcendental. The main improvements are due to Axel Thue (1909), Siegel (1921), Freeman Dyson (1947), and Klaus Roth (1955), leading finally to the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem: If x is an irrational algebraic number and ε a (small) positive real number, then there exists a positive constant c(x, ε) such that |x−pq|>c(x,ε)q2+ε|x-p/q|>c(x,ε)/q^2+ε holds for every integer p and q such that q > 0. In some sense, this result is optimal, as the theorem would be false with ε = 0. This is an immediate consequence of the upper bounds described below. Simultaneous approximations of algebraic
