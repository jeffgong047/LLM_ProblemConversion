numbers: Definition: Two real numbers x,y,y are called equivalent[9][10] if there are integers a,b,c,d,b,c,d with ad−bc=±1-bc=±1 such that: y=ax+bcx+d.=ax+b/cx+d . So equivalence is defined by an integer Möbius transformation on the real numbers, or by a member of the Modular group SL2±(Z)SL_2^±(ℤ), the set of invertible 2 × 2 matrices over the integers. Each rational number is equivalent to 0; thus the rational numbers are an equivalence class for this relation. The equivalence may be read on the regular continued fraction representation, as shown by the following theorem of Serret: Theorem: Two irrational numbers x and y are equivalent if and only if there exist two positive integers h and k such that the regular continued fraction representations of x and y x=[u0;u1,u2,…],y=[v0;v1,v2,…],x =[u_0;u_1,u_2,…] , y =[v_0;v_1,v_2,…] , satisfy uh+i=vk+i_h+i=v_k+i for every non negative integer i.[11] Thus, except for a finite initial sequence, equivalent numbers have the same continued fraction representation. Equivalent numbers are approximable to the same degree, in the sense that they have the same Markov constant. Lagrange
