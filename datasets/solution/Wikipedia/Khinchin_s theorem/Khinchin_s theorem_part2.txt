number: Main article: Continued fraction § Best rational approximations Given a real number α, there are two ways to define a best Diophantine approximation of α. For the first definition,[1] the rational number p/q is a best Diophantine approximation of α if |α−pq|<|α−p′q′|,|α-p/q|<|α-p'/q'|, for every rational number p'/q' different from p/q such that 0 < q′ ≤ q. For the second definition,[2][3] the above inequality is replaced by |qα−p|<|q′α−p′|.|qα-p|<|q^'α-p^'|. A best approximation for the second definition is also a best approximation for the first one, but the converse is not true in general.[4] The theory of continued fractions allows us to compute the best approximations of a real number: for the second definition, they are the convergents of its expression as a regular continued fraction.[3][4][5] For the first definition, one has to consider also the semiconvergents.[1] For example, the constant e = 2.718281828459045235... has the (regular) continued fraction representation [2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,1,…].[2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,1,… ]. Its best approximations for the second definition are 3,83,114,197,8732,…,3,83,114,197,8732,… , while, for the first definition, they are 3,52,83,114,197,4918,6825,8732,10639,….3,52,83,114,197,4918,6825,8732,10639,… .
