surfaces: Bordiga surfaces: A degree 6 embedding of the projective plane into P4 defined by the quartics through 10 points in general position. Châtelet surfaces Coble surfaces Cubic surfaces Nonsingular cubic surfaces are isomorphic to the projective plane blown up in 6 points, and are Fano surfaces. Named examples include the Fermat cubic, the Cayley cubic surface, and the Clebsch diagonal surface. del Pezzo surfaces (Fano surfaces) Enneper surface Hirzebruch surfaces Σn P1×P1 The product of two projective lines is the Hirzebruch surface Σ0. It is the only surface with two different rulings. The projective plane Segre surface An intersection of two quadrics, isomorphic to the projective plane blown up in 5 points. Steiner surface A surface in P4 with singularities which is birational to the projective plane. White surfaces, a generalization of Bordiga surfaces. Veronese surface An embedding of the projective plane into P5. See
