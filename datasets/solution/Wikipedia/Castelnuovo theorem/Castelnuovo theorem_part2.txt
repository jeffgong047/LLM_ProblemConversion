Structure: Every non-singular rational surface can be obtained by repeatedly blowing up a minimal rational surface. The minimal rational surfaces are the projective plane and the Hirzebruch surfaces Σr for r = 0 or r ≥ 2. Invariants: The plurigenera are all 0 and the fundamental group is trivial. Hodge diamond: 10001+n0001 where n is 0 for the projective plane, and 1 for Hirzebruch surfaces and greater than 1 for other rational surfaces. The Picard group is the odd unimodular lattice I1,n, except for the Hirzebruch surfaces Σ2m when it is the even unimodular lattice II1,1. Castelnuovo's
