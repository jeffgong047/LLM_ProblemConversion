Surface birationally equivalent to the projective plane ; rational variety of dimension two In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, a rational surface is a surface birationally equivalent to the projective plane, or in other words a rational variety of dimension two. Rational surfaces are the simplest of the 10 or so classes of surface in the Enriquesâ€“Kodaira classification of complex surfaces, and were the first surfaces to be investigated.
