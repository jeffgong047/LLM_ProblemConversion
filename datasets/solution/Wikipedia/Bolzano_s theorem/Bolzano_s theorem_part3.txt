Theorem: The intermediate value theorem states the following: Consider an interval I=[a,b]=[a,b] of real numbers Rℝ and a continuous function f:I→R→ℝ. Then Version I. if u is a number between f(a)(a) and f(b)(b), that is, min(f(a),f(b))<u<max(f(a),f(b)),min(f(a),f(b))<u<max(f(a),f(b)), then there is a c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) such that f(c)=u(c)=u. Version II. the image set f(I)(I) is also an interval (closed), and it contains [min(f(a),f(b)),max(f(a),f(b))][min(f(a),f(b)),max(f(a),f(b))]. Remark: Version II states that the set of function values has no gap. For any two function values c,d∈f(I),dinf(I) with c<d<d, even if they are outside the interval between f(a)(a) and f(b)(b), all points in the interval [c,d][c,d] are also function values, [c,d]⊆f(I).[c,d](I). A subset of the real numbers with no internal gap is an interval. Version I is naturally contained in Version II. Relation to
