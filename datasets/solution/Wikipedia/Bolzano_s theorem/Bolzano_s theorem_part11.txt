spaces: The Poincaré-Miranda theorem is a generalization of the Intermediate value theorem from a (one-dimensional) interval to a (two-dimensional) rectangle, or more generally, to an n-dimensional cube. Vrahatis[12] presents a similar generalization to triangles, or more generally, n-dimensional simplices. Let Dn be an n-dimensional simplex with n+1 vertices denoted by v0,...,vn. Let F=(f1,...,fn) be a function from Dn to Rn, that never equals 0 on the boundary of Dn. Suppose F satisfies the following conditions: For all i in 1,...,n, the sign of fi(vi) is opposite to the sign of fi(x) for all points x on the face opposite to vi; The sign-vector of f1,...,fn on v0 is not equal to the sign-vector of f1,...,fn on all points on the face opposite to v0. Then there is a point z in the interior of Dn on which F(z)=(0,...,0). It is possible to normalize the fi such that fi(vi)>0 for all i; then the conditions become simpler: For all i in 1,...,n, fi(vi)>0, and fi(x)<0 for all points x on the face opposite to vi. In particular, fi(v0)<0. For all points x on the face opposite to v0, fi(x)>0 for at least one i in 1,...,n. The theorem can be proved based on the Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma. In can be used for approximations of fixed points and zeros.[13] General metric and topological
