completeness: The theorem depends on, and is equivalent to, the completeness of the real numbers. The intermediate value theorem does not apply to the rational numbers Q because gaps exist between rational numbers; irrational numbers fill those gaps. For example, the function f(x)=x2(x)=x^2 for x∈Q∈ℚ satisfies f(0)=0(0)=0 and f(2)=4(2)=4. However, there is no rational number x such that f(x)=2(x)=2, because 2√(2) is an irrational number.
