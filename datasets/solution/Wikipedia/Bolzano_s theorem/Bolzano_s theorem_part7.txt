B: We will only prove the case of f(a)<u<f(b)(a)<u<f(b), as the f(a)>u>f(b)(a)>u>f(b) case is similar.[4] Define g(x)=f(x)−u(x)=f(x)-u which is equivalent to f(x)=g(x)+u(x)=g(x)+u and lets us rewrite f(a)<u<f(b)(a)<u<f(b) as g(a)<0<g(b)(a)<0<g(b), and we have to prove, that g(c)=0(c)=0 for some c∈[a,b]∈[a,b], which is more intuitive. We further define the set S=x∈[a,b]:g(x)≤0={x∈[a,b]:g(x)≤0}. Because g(a)<0(a)<0 we know, that a∈S so, that S is not empty. Moreover, as S⊆[a,b]⊆[a,b], we know that S is bounded and non-empty, so by Completeness, the supremum c=sup(S)=sup(S) exists. There are 3 cases for the value of g(c)(c), those being g(c)<0,g(c)>0(c)<0,g(c)>0 and g(c)=0(c)=0. For contradiction, let us assume, that g(c)<0(c)<0. Then, by the definition of continuity, for ϵ=0−g(c)ϵ=0-g(c), there exists a δ>0δ>0 such that x∈(c−δ,c+δ)∈(c-δ,c+δ) implies, that |g(x)−g(c)|<−g(c)|g(x)-g(c)|<-g(c), which is equivalent to g(x)<0(x)<0. If we just chose x=c+δN=c+δ/N, where N>δb−c>δ/b-c, then g(x)<0(x)<0 and c<x<b<x<b, so x∈S. It follows that x is an upper bound for S. However, x>c>c, contradicting the upper bound property of the least upper bound c, so g(c)≥0(c)≥0. Assume then, that g(c)>0(c)>0. We similarly chose ϵ=g(c)−0ϵ=g(c)-0 and know, that there exists a δ>0δ>0 such that x∈(c−δ,c+δ)∈(c-δ,c+δ) implies |g(x)−g(c)|<g(c)|g(x)-g(c)|<g(c). We can rewrite this as −g(c)<g(x)−g(c)<g(c)-g(c)<g(x)-g(c)<g(c) which implies, that g(x)>0(x)>0. If we now chose x=c−δ2=c-δ/2, then g(x)>0(x)>0 and a<x<c<x<c. It follows that x is an upper bound for S. However, x<c<c, which contradict the least property of the least upper bound c, which means, that g(c)>0(c)>0 is impossible. If we combine both results, we get that g(c)=0(c)=0 or f(c)=u(c)=u is the only remaining possibility. Remark: The intermediate value theorem can also be proved using the methods of non-standard analysis, which places "intuitive" arguments involving infinitesimals on a rigorous[clarification needed] footing.[5]
