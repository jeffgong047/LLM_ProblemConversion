Refinement: Lebesgue's decomposition theorem can be refined in a number of ways. First, the decomposition of a regular Borel measure on the real line can be refined:[4] ν=νcont+νsing+νpp ν=ν_cont+ν_sing+ν_pp where νcont is the absolutely continuous part νsing is the singular continuous part νpp is the pure point part (a discrete measure). Second, absolutely continuous measures are classified by the Radon–Nikodym theorem, and discrete measures are easily understood. Hence (singular continuous measures aside), Lebesgue decomposition gives a very explicit description of measures. The Cantor measure (the probability measure on the real line whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function) is an example of a singular continuous measure. Related
