In mathematics, more precisely in measure theory, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem[1][2][3] states that for every two σ-finite signed measures μμ and νν on a measurable space (Ω,Σ),(Ω,Σ),  there exist two σ-finite signed measures ν0ν_0 and ν1ν_1 such that:

ν=ν0+ν1ν=ν_0+ν_1 
ν0≪μν_0≪μ (that is, ν0ν_0 is absolutely continuous with respect to μμ)
ν1⊥μν_1⊥μ (that is, ν1ν_1 and μμ are singular).
These two measures are uniquely determined by μμ and ν.ν.


Refinement[edit]
Lebesgue's decomposition theorem can be refined in a number of ways.
First, the decomposition of a regular Borel measure on the real line can be refined:[4]

ν=νcont+νsing+νpp ν=ν_cont+ν_sing+ν_pp
where

νcont is the absolutely continuous part
νsing is the singular continuous part
νpp is the pure point part (a discrete measure).
Second, absolutely continuous measures are classified by the Radon–Nikodym theorem, and discrete measures are easily understood. Hence (singular continuous measures aside), Lebesgue decomposition gives a very explicit description of measures.  The Cantor measure (the probability measure on the real line whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function) is an example of a singular continuous measure.

Main article: Lévy–Itō decomposition
The analogous[citation needed] decomposition for a stochastic processes is the Lévy–Itō decomposition: given a Lévy process X, it can be decomposed as a sum of three independent Lévy processes X=X(1)+X(2)+X(3)=X^(1)+X^(2)+X^(3) where:

X(1)^(1) is a Brownian motion with drift, corresponding to the absolutely continuous part;
X(2)^(2) is a compound Poisson process, corresponding to the pure point part;
X(3)^(3) is a square integrable pure jump martingale that almost surely has a countable number of jumps on a finite interval, corresponding to the singular continuous part.
