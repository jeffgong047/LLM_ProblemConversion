In mathematics, more precisely in measure theory, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem[1][2][3] states that for every two σ-finite signed measures μμ and νν on a measurable space (Ω,Σ),(Ω,Σ), there exist two σ-finite signed measures ν0ν_0 and ν1ν_1 such that: ν=ν0+ν1ν=ν_0+ν_1 ν0≪μν_0≪μ (that is, ν0ν_0 is absolutely continuous with respect to μμ) ν1⊥μν_1⊥μ (that is, ν1ν_1 and μμ are singular). These two measures are uniquely determined by μμ and ν.ν.
