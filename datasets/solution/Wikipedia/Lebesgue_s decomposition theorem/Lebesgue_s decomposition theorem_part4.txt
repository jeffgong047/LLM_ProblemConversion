decomposition: Main article: Lévy–Itō decomposition The analogous[citation needed] decomposition for a stochastic processes is the Lévy–Itō decomposition: given a Lévy process X, it can be decomposed as a sum of three independent Lévy processes X=X(1)+X(2)+X(3)=X^(1)+X^(2)+X^(3) where: X(1)^(1) is a Brownian motion with drift, corresponding to the absolutely continuous part; X(2)^(2) is a compound Poisson process, corresponding to the pure point part; X(3)^(3) is a square integrable pure jump martingale that almost surely has a countable number of jumps on a finite interval, corresponding to the singular continuous part.
