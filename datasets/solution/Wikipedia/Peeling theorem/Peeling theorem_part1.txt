In general relativity, the peeling theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the Weyl tensor as one goes to null infinity. Let γγ be a null geodesic in a spacetime (M,gab)(M,g_ab) from a point p to null infinity, with affine parameter λλ. Then the theorem states that, as λλ tends to infinity: Cabcd=Cabcd(1)λ+Cabcd(2)λ2+Cabcd(3)λ3+Cabcd(4)λ4+O(1λ5)_abcd=C_abcd^(1)/λ+C_abcd^(2)/λ^2+C_abcd^(3)/λ^3+C_abcd^(4)/λ^4+O(1/λ^5) where Cabcd_abcd is the Weyl tensor, and we used the abstract index notation. Moreover, in the Petrov classification, Cabcd(1)_abcd^(1) is type N, Cabcd(2)_abcd^(2) is type III, Cabcd(3)_abcd^(3) is type II (or II-II) and Cabcd(4)_abcd^(4) is type I.
