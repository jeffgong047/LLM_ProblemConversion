theorem: Recall that any vector space V over a field has a basis; this is a set S such that any element of V is a unique (finite) linear combination of elements of S. In the formulation of Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem we consider bases of which the elements are totally ordered by some relation which we denote ≤. If L is a Lie algebra over a field K, let h denote the canonical K-linear map from L into the universal enveloping algebra U(L). Theorem.[1] Let L be a Lie algebra over K and X a totally ordered basis of L. A canonical monomial over X is a finite sequence (x1, x2 ..., xn) of elements of X which is non-decreasing in the order ≤, that is, x1 ≤x2 ≤ ... ≤ xn. Extend h to all canonical monomials as follows: if (x1, x2, ..., xn) is a canonical monomial, let h(x1,x2,…,xn)=h(x1)⋅h(x2)⋯h(xn).(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)=h(x_1)(x_2)(x_n). Then h is injective on the set of canonical monomials and the image of this set h(x1,…,xn)|x1≤...≤xn{h(x_1,…,x_n)|x_1≤..._n} forms a basis for U(L) as a K-vector space. Stated somewhat differently, consider Y = h(X). Y is totally ordered by the induced ordering from X. The set of monomials y1k1y2k2⋯yℓkℓ_1^k_1y_2^k_2_ℓ^k_ℓ where y1 <y2 < ... < yn are elements of Y, and the exponents are non-negative, together with the multiplicative unit 1, form a basis for U(L). Note that the unit element 1 corresponds to the empty canonical monomial. The theorem then asserts that these monomials form a basis for U(L) as a vector space. It is easy to see that these monomials span U(L); the content of the theorem is that they are linearly independent. The multiplicative structure of U(L) is determined by the structure constants in the basis X, that is, the coefficients cu,vx_u,v^x such that [u,v]=∑x∈Xcu,vxx.[u,v]=∑_xc_u,v^x x. This relation allows one to reduce any product of y's to a linear combination of canonical monomials: The structure constants determine yiyj – yjyi, i.e. what to do in order to change the order of two elements of Y in a product. This fact, modulo an inductive argument on the degree of (non-canonical) monomials, shows one can always achieve products where the factors are ordered in a non-decreasing fashion. The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem can be interpreted as saying that the end result of this reduction is unique and does not depend on the order in which one swaps adjacent elements. Corollary. If L is a Lie algebra over a field, the canonical map L → U(L) is injective. In particular, any Lie algebra over a field is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra. More general
