theorem: In four papers from the 1880s Alfredo Capelli proved, in different terminology, what is now known as the Poincar√©‚ÄìBirkhoff‚ÄìWitt theorem in the case of L=gln,=ùî§ùî©_n, the General linear Lie algebra; while Poincar√© later stated it more generally in 1900.[2] Armand Borel says that these results of Capelli were "completely forgotten for almost a century", and he does not suggest that Poincar√© was aware of Capelli's result.[2] Ton-That and Tran [3] have investigated the history of the theorem. They have found out that the majority of the sources before Bourbaki's 1960 book call it Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Following this old tradition, Fofanova[4] in her encyclopaedic entry says that Poincar√© obtained the first variant of the theorem. She further says that the theorem was subsequently completely demonstrated by Witt and Birkhoff. It appears that pre-Bourbaki sources were not familiar with Poincar√©'s paper. Birkhoff [5] and Witt [6] do not mention Poincar√©'s work in their 1937 papers. Cartan and Eilenberg[7] call the theorem Poincar√©-Witt Theorem and attribute the complete proof to Witt. Bourbaki[8] were the first to use all three names in their 1960 book. Knapp presents a clear illustration of the shifting tradition. In his 1986 book[9] he calls it Birkhoff-Witt Theorem, while in his later 1996 book[10] he switches to Poincar√©-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem. It is not clear whether Poincar√©'s result was complete. Ton-That and Tran[3] conclude that "Poincar√© had discovered and completely demonstrated this theorem at least thirty-seven years before Witt and Birkhoff". On the other hand, they point out that "Poincar√© makes several statements without bothering to prove them". Their own proofs of all the steps are rather long according to their admission. Borel states that Poincar√© "more or less proved the Poincar√©-Birkhoff-Witt theorem" in 1900.[2]
