bounds: It is an open problem to determine the exact growth rate of rk(N). The best known general bounds are CNexp⁡(−n2(n−1)/2log⁡Nn+12nlog⁡log⁡N)≤rk(N)≤N(log⁡log⁡N)2−2k+9,exp(-n2^(n-1)/2√()+1/2nlog)_k(N)≤N/(log)^2^-2^k+9, where n=⌈log⁡k⌉=⌈⌉. The lower bound is due to O'Bryant[11] building on the work of Behrend,[12] Rankin,[13] and Elkin.[14][15] The upper bound is due to Gowers.[9] For small k, there are tighter bounds than the general case. When k = 3, Bourgain,[16][17] Heath-Brown,[18] Szemerédi,[19] Sanders,[20] and Bloom[21] established progressively smaller upper bounds, and Bloom and Sisask then proved the first bound that broke the so-called ``logarithmic barrier".[22] The current best bounds are N2−8log⁡N≤r3(N)≤Ne−c(log⁡N)1/112^-√(8)_3(N)^-c()^1/11, for some constant c>0>0, due to O'Bryant,[11] and Kelley and Meka[23] respectively. For k = 4, Green and Tao[24][25] proved that r4(N)≤CN(log⁡N)c_4(N)N/()^c for some c > 0. Extensions and
