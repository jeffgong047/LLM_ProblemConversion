Statement: A subset A of the natural numbers is said to have positive upper density if limsupn→∞|A∩1,2,3,…,n|n>0.lim sup_n→∞|A∩{1,2,3,…,n}|/n>0. Szemerédi's theorem asserts that a subset of the natural numbers with positive upper density contains infinitely many arithmetic progressions of length k for all positive integers k. An often-used equivalent finitary version of the theorem states that for every positive integer k and real number δ∈(0,1]δ∈(0,1], there exists a positive integer N=N(k,δ)=N(k,δ) such that every subset of {1, 2, ..., N} of size at least δN contains an arithmetic progression of length k. Another formulation uses the function rk(N), the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ..., N} without an arithmetic progression of length k. Szemerédi's theorem is equivalent to the asymptotic bound rk(N)=o(N)._k(N)=o(N). That is, rk(N) grows less than linearly with N.
