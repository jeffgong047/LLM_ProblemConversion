generalizations: A multidimensional generalization of Szemer√©di's theorem was first proven by Hillel Furstenberg and Yitzhak Katznelson using ergodic theory.[26] Timothy Gowers,[27] Vojtƒõch R√∂dl and Jozef Skokan[28][29] with Brendan Nagle, R√∂dl, and Mathias Schacht,[30] and Terence Tao[31] provided combinatorial proofs. Alexander Leibman and Vitaly Bergelson[32] generalized Szemer√©di's to polynomial progressions: If A‚äÇN‚äÇ‚Ñï is a set with positive upper density and p1(n),p2(n),‚Ä¶,pk(n)_1(n),p_2(n),‚Ä¶,p_k(n) are integer-valued polynomials such that pi(0)=0_i(0)=0, then there are infinitely many u,n‚ààZ,n‚àà‚Ñ§ such that u+pi(n)‚ààA+p_i(n) for all 1‚â§i‚â§k1. Leibman and Bergelson's result also holds in a multidimensional setting. The finitary version of Szemer√©di's theorem can be generalized to finite additive groups including vector spaces over finite fields.[33] The finite field analog can be used as a model for understanding the theorem in the natural numbers.[34] The problem of obtaining bounds in the k=3 case of Szemer√©di's theorem in the vector space F3nùîΩ_3^n is known as the cap set problem. The Green‚ÄìTao theorem asserts the prime numbers contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. It is not implied by Szemer√©di's theorem because the primes have density 0 in the natural numbers. As part of their proof, Ben Green and Tao introduced a "relative" Szemer√©di theorem which applies to subsets of the integers (even those with 0 density) satisfying certain pseudorandomness conditions. A more general relative Szemer√©di theorem has since been given by David Conlon, Jacob Fox, and Yufei Zhao.[35][36] The Erd≈ës conjecture on arithmetic progressions would imply both Szemer√©di's theorem and the Green‚ÄìTao theorem.
