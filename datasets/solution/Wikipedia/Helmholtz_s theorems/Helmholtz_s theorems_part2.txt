Notes: ^ Kuethe and Schetzer, Foundations of Aerodynamics, Section 2.14 ^ The strength of a vortex tube (circulation), is defined as: Γ=∫Aω→⋅n→dA=∮cu→⋅ds→Γ=∫_Aω⃗·n⃗dA=∮_cu⃗s⃗ where ΓΓ is also the circulation, ω→ω⃗ is the vorticity vector, n→n⃗ is the normal vector to a surface A, formed by taking a cross-section of the vortex-tube with elemental area dA, u→u⃗ is the velocity vector on the closed curve C, which bounds the surface A. The convention for defining the sense of circulation and the normal to the surface A is given by the right-hand screw rule. The third theorem states that this strength is the same for all cross-sections A of the tube and is independent of time. This is equivalent to saying DΓDt=0DΓ/Dt=0 ^ Helmholtz, H. (1858).
