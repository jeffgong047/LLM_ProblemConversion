Work-arounds: Among the assumptions that lead to Haag’s theorem is translation invariance of the system. Consequently, systems that can be set up inside a box with periodic boundary conditions or that interact with suitable external potentials escape the conclusions of the theorem.[7] Haag (1958)[8] and Ruelle (1962)[9] have presented the Haag–Ruelle scattering theory, which deals with asymptotic free states and thereby serves to formalize some of the assumptions needed for the LSZ reduction formula.[10] These techniques, however, cannot be applied to massless particles and have unsolved issues with bound states.
