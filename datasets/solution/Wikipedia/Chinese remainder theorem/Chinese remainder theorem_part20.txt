moduli: The Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to non-coprime moduli. Let m,n,a,b,n,a,b be any integers, let g=gcd(m,n)=(m,n); M=lcm⁡(m,n)=lcm(m,n), and consider the system of congruences: x≡a(modm)x≡b(modn),x m x n, If a≡b(modg)g, then this system has a unique solution modulo M=mn/g=mn/g. Otherwise, it has no solutions. If one uses Bézout's identity to write g=um+vn=um+vn, then the solution is given by x=avn+bumg.=avn+bum/g. This defines an integer, as g divides both m and n. Otherwise, the proof is very similar to that for coprime moduli.[16] Generalization to arbitrary
