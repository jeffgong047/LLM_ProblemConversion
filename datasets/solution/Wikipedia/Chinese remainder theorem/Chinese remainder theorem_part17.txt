domains: The statement in terms of remainders given in § Theorem statement cannot be generalized to any principal ideal domain, but its generalization to Euclidean domains is straightforward. The univariate polynomials over a field is the typical example of a Euclidean domain which is not the integers. Therefore, we state the theorem for the case of the ring R=K[X]=K[X] for a field K.. For getting the theorem for a general Euclidean domain, it suffices to replace the degree by the Euclidean function of the Euclidean domain. The Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is thus: Let Pi(X)_i(X) (the moduli) be, for i=1,…,k=1,…,k, pairwise coprime polynomials in R=K[X]=K[X]. Let di=deg⁡Pi_i=_i be the degree of Pi(X)_i(X), and D be the sum of the di._i. If Ai(X),…,Ak(X)_i(X),…,A_k(X) are polynomials such that Ai(X)=0_i(X)=0 or deg⁡Ai<di_i<d_i for every i, then, there is one and only one polynomial P(X)(X), such that deg⁡P<D<D and the remainder of the Euclidean division of P(X)(X) by Pi(X)_i(X) is Ai(X)_i(X) for every i. The construction of the solution may be done as in § Existence (constructive proof) or § Existence (direct proof). However, the latter construction may be simplified by using, as follows, partial fraction decomposition instead of the extended Euclidean algorithm. Thus, we want to find a polynomial P(X)(X), which satisfies the congruences P(X)≡Ai(X)(modPi(X)),(X)_i(X)P_i(X), for i=1,…,k.=1,…,k. Consider the polynomials Q(X)=∏i=1kPi(X)Qi(X)=Q(X)Pi(X).Q(X) =∏_i=1^kP_i(X) Q_i(X) =Q(X)/P_i(X). The partial fraction decomposition of 1/Q(X)1/Q(X) gives k polynomials Si(X)_i(X) with degrees deg⁡Si(X)<di,_i(X)<d_i, such that 1Q(X)=∑i=1kSi(X)Pi(X),1/Q(X)=∑_i=1^kS_i(X)/P_i(X), and thus 1=∑i=1kSi(X)Qi(X).1=∑_i=1^kS_i(X)Q_i(X). Then a solution of the simultaneous congruence system is given by the polynomial ∑i=1kAi(X)Si(X)Qi(X).∑_i=1^kA_i(X)S_i(X)Q_i(X). In fact, we have ∑i=1kAi(X)Si(X)Qi(X)=Ai(X)+∑j=1k(Aj(X)−Ai(X))Sj(X)Qj(X)≡Ai(X)(modPi(X)),∑_i=1^kA_i(X)S_i(X)Q_i(X)=A_i(X)+∑_j=1^k(A_j(X)-A_i(X))S_j(X)Q_j(X)_i(X)P_i(X), for 1≤i≤k.1. This solution may have a degree larger than D=∑i=1kdi.=∑_i=1^kd_i. The unique solution of degree less than D may be deduced by considering the remainder Bi(X)_i(X) of the Euclidean division of Ai(X)Si(X)_i(X)S_i(X) by Pi(X)._i(X). This solution is P(X)=∑i=1kBi(X)Qi(X).(X)=∑_i=1^kB_i(X)Q_i(X). Lagrange
