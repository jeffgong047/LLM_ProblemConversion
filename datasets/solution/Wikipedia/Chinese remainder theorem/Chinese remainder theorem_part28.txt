groups: Given a surjection Z/n→Z/mℤ/n→ℤ/m of finite abelian groups, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem to give a complete description of any such map. First of all, the theorem gives isomorphisms Z/n≅Z/pn1a1×⋯×Z/pniaiZ/m≅Z/pm1b1×⋯×Z/pmjbjℤ/n ≅ℤ/p_n_1^a_1×⋯×ℤ/p_n_i^a_i ℤ/m ≅ℤ/p_m_1^b_1×⋯×ℤ/p_m_j^b_j where pm1,…,pmj⊆pn1,…,pni{p_m_1,…,p_m_j}⊆{p_n_1,…,p_n_i}. In addition, for any induced map Z/pnkak→Z/pmlblℤ/p_n_k^a_k→ℤ/p_m_l^b_l from the original surjection, we have ak≥bl_k_l and pnk=pml,_n_k=p_m_l, since for a pair of primes p,q,q, the only non-zero surjections Z/pa→Z/qbℤ/p^a→ℤ/q^b can be defined if p=q=q and a≥b. These observations are pivotal for constructing the ring of profinite integers, which is given as an inverse limit of all such maps. Dedekind's
