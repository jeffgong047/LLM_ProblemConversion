moduli: We want to solve the system: x≡a1(modn1)x≡a2(modn2),x _1n_1 x _2n_2, where n1_1 and n2_2 are coprime. Bézout's identity asserts the existence of two integers m1_1 and m2_2 such that m1n1+m2n2=1._1n_1+m_2n_2=1. The integers m1_1 and m2_2 may be computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. A solution is given by x=a1m2n2+a2m1n1.=a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1. Indeed, x=a1m2n2+a2m1n1=a1(1−m1n1)+a2m1n1=a1+(a2−a1)m1n1,x =a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1 =a_1(1-m_1n_1)+a_2m_1n_1 =a_1+(a_2-a_1)m_1n_1, implying that x≡a1(modn1)._1n_1. The second congruence is proved similarly, by exchanging the subscripts 1 and 2. General
