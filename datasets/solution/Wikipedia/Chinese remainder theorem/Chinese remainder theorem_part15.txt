system: The system of congruences solved by the Chinese remainder theorem may be rewritten as a system of linear Diophantine equations: x=a1+x1n1⋮x=ak+xknk,x =a_1+x_1n_1 ⋮ x =a_k+x_kn_k, where the unknown integers are x and the xi._i. Therefore, every general method for solving such systems may be used for finding the solution of Chinese remainder theorem, such as the reduction of the matrix of the system to Smith normal form or Hermite normal form. However, as usual when using a general algorithm for a more specific problem, this approach is less efficient than the method of the preceding section, based on a direct use of Bézout's identity.
