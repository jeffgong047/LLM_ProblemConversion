Computation: Consider a system of congruences: x≡a1(modn1)⋮x≡ak(modnk),x _1n_1 ⋮ x _kn_k, where the ni_i are pairwise coprime, and let N=n1n2⋯nk.=n_1n_2_k. In this section several methods are described for computing the unique solution for x, such that 0≤x<N,0<N, and these methods are applied on the example x≡0(mod3)x≡3(mod4)x≡4(mod5).x ≡03 x ≡34 x ≡45. Several methods of computation are presented. The two first ones are useful for small examples, but become very inefficient when the product n1⋯nk_1_k is large. The third one uses the existence proof given in § Existence (constructive proof). It is the most convenient when the product n1⋯nk_1_k is large, or for computer computation. Systematic
