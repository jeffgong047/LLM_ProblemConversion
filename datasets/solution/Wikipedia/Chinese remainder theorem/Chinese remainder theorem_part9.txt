case: Consider a sequence of congruence equations: x≡a1(modn1)⋮x≡ak(modnk),x _1n_1 ⋮ x _kn_k, where the ni_i are pairwise coprime. The two first equations have a solution a1,2_1,2 provided by the method of the previous section. The set of the solutions of these two first equations is the set of all solutions of the equation x≡a1,2(modn1n2)._1,2n_1n_2. As the other ni_i are coprime with n1n2,_1n_2, this reduces solving the initial problem of k equations to a similar problem with k−1-1 equations. Iterating the process, one gets eventually the solutions of the initial problem. Existence (direct
