rings: The Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to any ring, by using coprime ideals (also called comaximal ideals). Two ideals I and J are coprime if there are elements i∈I and j∈J such that i+j=1.+j=1. This relation plays the role of Bézout's identity in the proofs related to this generalization, which otherwise are very similar. The generalization may be stated as follows.[17][18] Let I1, ..., Ik be two-sided ideals of a ring R and let I be their intersection. If the ideals are pairwise coprime, we have the isomorphism: R/I→(R/I1)×⋯×(R/Ik)xmodI↦(xmodI1,…,xmodIk),R/I →(R/I_1)×⋯×(R/I_k) xI ↦(xI_1, …, xI_k), between the quotient ring R/I/I and the direct product of the R/Ii,/I_i, where "xmodII" denotes the image of the element x in the quotient ring defined by the ideal I.. Moreover, if R is commutative, then the ideal intersection of pairwise coprime ideals is equal to their product; that is I=I1∩I2∩⋯∩Ik=I1I2⋯Ik,=I_1_2∩⋯_k=I_1I_2_k, if Ii and Ij are coprime for all i ≠ j.
