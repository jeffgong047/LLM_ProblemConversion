construction): For constructing a solution, it is not necessary to make an induction on the number of moduli. However, such a direct construction involves more computation with large numbers, which makes it less efficient and less used. Nevertheless, Lagrange interpolation is a special case of this construction, applied to polynomials instead of integers. Let Ni=N/ni_i=N/n_i be the product of all moduli but one. As the ni_i are pairwise coprime, Ni_i and ni_i are coprime. Thus Bézout's identity applies, and there exist integers Mi_i and mi_i such that MiNi+mini=1._iN_i+m_in_i=1. A solution of the system of congruences is x=∑i=1kaiMiNi.=∑_i=1^ka_iM_iN_i. In fact, as Nj_j is a multiple of ni_i for i≠j,, we have x≡aiMiNi≡ai(1−mini)≡ai(modni),_iM_iN_i_i(1-m_in_i)_in_i, for every i..
