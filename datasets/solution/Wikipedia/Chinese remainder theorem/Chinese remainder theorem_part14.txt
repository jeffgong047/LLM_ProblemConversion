construction: The constructive existence proof shows that, in the case of two moduli, the solution may be obtained by the computation of the Bézout coefficients of the moduli, followed by a few multiplications, additions and reductions modulo n1n2_1n_2 (for getting a result in the interval (0,n1n2−1)(0,n_1n_2-1)). As the Bézout's coefficients may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm, the whole computation, at most, has a quadratic time complexity of O((s1+s2)2),((s_1+s_2)^2), where si_i denotes the number of digits of ni._i. For more than two moduli, the method for two moduli allows the replacement of any two congruences by a single congruence modulo the product of the moduli. Iterating this process provides eventually the solution with a complexity, which is quadratic in the number of digits of the product of all moduli. This quadratic time complexity does not depend on the order in which the moduli are regrouped. One may regroup the two first moduli, then regroup the resulting modulus with the next one, and so on. This strategy is the easiest to implement, but it also requires more computation involving large numbers. Another strategy consists in partitioning the moduli in pairs whose product have comparable sizes (as much as possible), applying, in parallel, the method of two moduli to each pair, and iterating with a number of moduli approximatively divided by two. This method allows an easy parallelization of the algorithm. Also, if fast algorithms (that is, algorithms working in quasilinear time) are used for the basic operations, this method provides an algorithm for the whole computation that works in quasilinear time. On the current example (which has only three moduli), both strategies are identical and work as follows. Bézout's identity for 3 and 4 is 1×4+(−1)×3=1.1×4+(-1)×3=1. Putting this in the formula given for proving the existence gives 0×1×4+3×(−1)×3=−90×1×4+3×(-1)×3=-9 for a solution of the two first congruences, the other solutions being obtained by adding to −9 any multiple of 3 × 4 = 12. One may continue with any of these solutions, but the solution 3 = −9 +12 is smaller (in absolute value) and thus leads probably to an easier computation Bézout identity for 5 and 3 × 4 = 12 is 5×5+(−2)×12=1.5×5+(-2)×12=1. Applying the same formula again, we get a solution of the problem: 5×5×3+12×(−2)×4=−21.5×5×3+12×(-2)×4=-21. The other solutions are obtained by adding any multiple of 3 × 4 × 5 = 60, and the smallest positive solution is −21 + 60 = 39. As a linear Diophantine
