transform: The prime-factor FFT algorithm (also called Good-Thomas algorithm) uses the Chinese remainder theorem for reducing the computation of a fast Fourier transform of size n1n2_1n_2 to the computation of two fast Fourier transforms of smaller sizes n1_1 and n2_2 (providing that n1_1 and n2_2 are coprime).
