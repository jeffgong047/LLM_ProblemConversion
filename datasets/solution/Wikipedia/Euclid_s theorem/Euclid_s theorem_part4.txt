proof: Another proof, by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, relies on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: that every integer has a unique prime factorization. What Euler wrote (not with this modern notation and, unlike modern standards, not restricting the arguments in sums and products to any finite sets of integers) is equivalent to the statement that we have[9] ∏p∈Pk11−1p=∑n∈Nk1n,∏_p_k1/1-1/p=∑_n_k1/n, where Pk_k denotes the set of the k first prime numbers, and Nk_k is the set of the positive integers whose prime factors are all in Pk._k. In order to show this, one expands each factor in the product as a geometric series, and distributes the product over the sum (this is a special case of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function). ∏p∈Pk11−1p=∏p∈Pk∑i≥01pi=(∑i≥012i)⋅(∑i≥013i)⋅(∑i≥015i)⋅(∑i≥017i)⋯=∑ℓ,m,n,p,…≥012ℓ3m5n7p⋯=∑n∈Nk1n.∏_p_k1/1-1/p =∏_p_k∑_i≥01/p^i =(∑_i≥01/2^i)·(∑_i≥01/3^i)·(∑_i≥01/5^i)·(∑_i≥01/7^i)⋯ =∑_ℓ,m,n,p,…≥01/2^ℓ3^m5^n7^p⋯ =∑_n_k1/n. In the penultimate sum every product of primes appears exactly once, and so the last equality is true by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. In his first corollary to this result Euler denotes by a symbol similar to ∞∞ the « absolute infinity » and writes that the infinite sum in the statement equals the « value » log⁡∞log∞, to which the infinite product is thus also equal (in modern terminology this is equivalent to say that the partial sum up to x of the harmonic series diverges asymptotically like log⁡x). Then in his second corollary Euler notes that the product ∏n≥211−1n2∏_n≥21/1-1/n^2 converges to the finite value 2, and that there are consequently more primes than squares (« sequitur infinities plures esse numeros primos »). This proves Euclid's Theorem.[10] Symbol used by Euler to denote infinity In the same paper (Theorem 19) Euler in fact used the above equality to prove a much stronger theorem that was unknown before him, namely that the series ∑p∈P1p∑_p1/p is divergent, where P denotes the set of all prime numbers (Euler writes that the infinite sum =log⁡log⁡∞=loglog∞, which in modern terminology is equivalent to say that the partial sum up to x of this series behaves asymptotically like log⁡log⁡xlog).
