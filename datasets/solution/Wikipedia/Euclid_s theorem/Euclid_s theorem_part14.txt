theorem: Main article: Prime number theorem Let π(x) be the prime-counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to x, for any real number x. The prime number theorem then states that x / log x is a good approximation to π(x), in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions π(x) and x / log x as x increases without bound is 1: limx→∞π(x)x/log⁡(x)=1.lim_x→∞π(x)/x/log(x)=1. Using asymptotic notation this result can be restated as π(x)∼xlog⁡x.π(x)∼x/. This yields Euclid's theorem, since limx→∞xlog⁡x=∞.lim_x→∞x/=∞. Bertrand–Chebyshev
