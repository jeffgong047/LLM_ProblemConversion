formula: In 2010, Junho Peter Whang published the following proof by contradiction.[14] Let k be any positive integer. Then according to Legendre's formula (sometimes attributed to de Polignac) k!=∏pprimepf(p,k)!=∏_pprimep^f(p,k) where f(p,k)=⌊kp⌋+⌊kp2⌋+⋯.(p,k)=⌊k/p⌋+⌊k/p^2⌋+⋯. f(p,k)<kp+kp2+⋯=kp−1≤k.(p,k)<k/p+k/p^2+⋯=k/p-1. But if only finitely many primes exist, then limk→∞(∏pp)kk!=0,lim_k→∞(∏_pp)^k/k!=0, (the numerator of the fraction would grow singly exponentially while by Stirling's approximation the denominator grows more quickly than singly exponentially), contradicting the fact that for each k the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
