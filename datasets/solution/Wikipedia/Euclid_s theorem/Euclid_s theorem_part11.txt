method: Further information: incompressibility method Suppose there were only k primes (p1, ..., pk). By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any positive integer n could then be represented as n=p1e1p2e2⋯pkek,=p_1^e_1p_2^e_2⋯p_k^e_k, where the non-negative integer exponents ei together with the finite-sized list of primes are enough to reconstruct the number. Since pi≥2_i≥2 for all i, it follows that ei≤lg⁡n_i≤ for all i (where lg denotes the base-2 logarithm). This yields an encoding for n of the following size (using big O notation): O(primelistsize+klg⁡lg⁡n)=O(lg⁡lg⁡n)(primelistsize+k)=O() bits. This is a much more efficient encoding than representing n directly in binary, which takes N=O(lg⁡n)=O() bits. An established result in lossless data compression states that one cannot generally compress N bits of information into fewer than N bits. The representation above violates this by far when n is large enough since lg⁡lg⁡n=o(lg⁡n)=o(). Therefore, the number of primes must not be finite.[16] Stronger
