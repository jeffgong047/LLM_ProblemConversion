proof: Main article: Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes In the 1950s, Hillel Furstenberg introduced a proof by contradiction using point-set topology.[12] Define a topology on the integers Z, called the evenly spaced integer topology, by declaring a subset U ⊆ Z to be an open set if and only if it is either the empty set, ∅, or it is a union of arithmetic sequences S(a, b) (for a ≠ 0), where S(a,b)=an+b∣n∈Z=aZ+b.(a,b)={an+b∈ℤ}=aℤ+b. Then a contradiction follows from the property that a finite set of integers cannot be open and the property that the basis sets S(a, b) are both open and closed, since Z∖−1,+1=⋃pprimeS(p,0)ℤ∖{-1,+1}=⋃_p primeS(p,0) cannot be closed because its complement is finite, but is closed since it is a finite union of closed sets.
