proof: Paul Erdős gave a proof[11] that also relies on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Every positive integer has a unique factorization into a square-free number and a square number rs2. For example, 75,600 = 24 33 52 71 = 21 ⋅ 602. Let N be a positive integer, and let k be the number of primes less than or equal to N. Call those primes p1, ... , pk. Any positive integer a which is less than or equal to N can then be written in the form a=(p1e1p2e2⋯pkek)s2,=(p_1^e_1p_2^e_2_k^e_k)s^2, where each ei is either 0 or 1. There are 2k ways of forming the square-free part of a. And s2 can be at most N, so s ≤ √N. Thus, at most 2k √N numbers can be written in this form. In other words, N≤2kN.≤2^k√(N). Or, rearranging, k, the number of primes less than or equal to N, is greater than or equal to 1/2log2 N. Since N was arbitrary, k can be as large as desired by choosing N appropriately. Furstenberg's
