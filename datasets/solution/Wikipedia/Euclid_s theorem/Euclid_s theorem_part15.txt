theorem: In number theory, Bertrand's postulate is a theorem stating that for any integer n>1>1, there always exists at least one prime number such that n<p<2n.<p<2n. Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem can also be stated as a relationship with π(x)π(x), where π(x)π(x) is the prime-counting function (number of primes less than or equal to x ): π(x)−π(x2)≥1,π(x)-π(x2)≥1, for all x≥2.≥2. This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand[17] (1822–1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all numbers in the interval [2, 3 × 106]. His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev (1821–1894) in 1852[18] and so the postulate is also called the Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev's theorem. Notes and
