principle: Juan Pablo Pinasco has written the following proof.[13] Let p1, ..., pN be the smallest N primes. Then by the inclusion–exclusion principle, the number of positive integers less than or equal to x that are divisible by one of those primes is 1+∑i⌊xpi⌋−∑i<j⌊xpipj⌋+∑i<j<k⌊xpipjpk⌋−⋯⋯±(−1)N+1⌊xp1⋯pN⌋.(1)1+∑_i⌊x/p_i⌋-∑_i<j⌊x/p_ip_j⌋ +∑_i<j<k⌊x/p_ip_jp_k⌋-⋯ ⋯±(-1)^N+1⌊x/p_1_N⌋. (1) Dividing by x and letting x → ∞ gives ∑i1pi−∑i<j1pipj+∑i<j<k1pipjpk−⋯±(−1)N+11p1⋯pN.(2)∑_i1/p_i-∑_i<j1/p_ip_j+∑_i<j<k1/p_ip_jp_k-⋯±(-1)^N+11/p_1_N. (2) This can be written as 1−∏i=1N(1−1pi).(3)1-∏_i=1^N(1-1/p_i). (3) If no other primes than p1, ..., pN exist, then the expression in (1) is equal to ⌊x⌋⌋ and the expression in (2) is equal to 1, but clearly the expression in (3) is not equal to 1. Therefore, there must be more primes than p1, ..., pN. Proof using Legendre's
