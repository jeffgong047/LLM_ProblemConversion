statement: Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. An Eulerian circuit is a directed closed path which visits each edge exactly once. In 1736, Euler showed that G has an Eulerian circuit if and only if G is connected and the indegree is equal to outdegree at every vertex. In this case G is called Eulerian. We denote the indegree of a vertex v by deg(v). The BEST theorem states that the number ec(G) of Eulerian circuits in a connected Eulerian graph G is given by the formula ec⁡(G)=tw(G)∏v∈V(deg⁡(v)−1)!.ec(G)=t_w(G)∏_v((v)-1)!. Here tw(G) is the number of arborescences, which are trees directed towards the root at a fixed vertex w in G. The number tw(G) can be computed as a determinant, by the version of the matrix tree theorem for directed graphs. It is a property of Eulerian graphs that tv(G) = tw(G) for every two vertices v and w in a connected Eulerian graph G.
