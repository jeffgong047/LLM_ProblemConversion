Applications: The BEST theorem shows that the number of Eulerian circuits in directed graphs can be computed in polynomial time, a problem which is #P-complete for undirected graphs.[1] It is also used in the asymptotic enumeration of Eulerian circuits of complete and complete bipartite graphs.[2][3]
