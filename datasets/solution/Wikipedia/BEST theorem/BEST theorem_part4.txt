History: The BEST theorem is due to van Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn (1951),[4] ยง6, Theorem 6. Their proof is bijective and generalizes the de Bruijn sequences. In a "note added in proof", they refer to an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941) which proves the formula for graphs with deg(v)=2 at every vertex.
