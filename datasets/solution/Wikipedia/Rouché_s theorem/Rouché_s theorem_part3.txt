explanation: As z travels along a closed curve C (not shown in the picture), f(z) and h(z) will trace out closed curves in the complex plane (shown in blue and red). So long as the curves never veer too far apart from each other (we require that f(z) remains closer to h(z) than the origin at all times), then the curves will wind around the origin the same number of times. Then, by the argument principle, f(z) and h(z) have the same number of zeros inside C (not shown). It is possible to provide an informal explanation of Rouché's theorem. Let C be a closed, simple curve (i.e., not self-intersecting). Let h(z) = f(z) + g(z). If f and g are both holomorphic on the interior of C, then h must also be holomorphic on the interior of C. Then, with the conditions imposed above, the Rouche's theorem in its original (and not symmetric) form says that If |f(z)| > |h(z) − f(z)|, for every z in C, then f and h have the same number of zeros in the interior of C. Notice that the condition |f(z)| > |h(z) − f(z)| means that for any z, the distance from f(z) to the origin is larger than the length of h(z) − f(z), which in the following picture means that for each point on the blue curve, the segment joining it to the origin is larger than the green segment associated with it. Informally we can say that the blue curve f(z) is always closer to the red curve h(z) than it is to the origin. The previous paragraph shows that h(z) must wind around the origin exactly as many times as f(z). The index of both curves around zero is therefore the same, so by the argument principle, f(z) and h(z) must have the same number of zeros inside C. One popular, informal way to summarize this argument is as follows: If a person were to walk a dog on a leash around and around a tree, such that the distance between the person and the tree is always greater than the length of the leash, then the person and the dog go around the tree the same number of times.
