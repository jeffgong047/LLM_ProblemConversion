roots: Consider the polynomial z2+2az+b2^2+2az+b^2 (where a>b>0>b>0). By the quadratic formula it has two zeros at −a±a2−b2-a±√(a^2-b^2). Rouché's theorem can be used to obtain more precise positions of them. Since |z2+b2|≤2b2<2a|z|forall|z|=b,|z^2+b^2|≤2b^2<2a|z|forall|z|=b, Rouché's theorem says that the polynomial has exactly one zero inside the disk |z|<b|z|<b. Since −a−a2−b2-a-√(a^2-b^2) is clearly outside the disk, we conclude that the zero is −a+a2−b2-a+√(a^2-b^2). In general, a polynomial f(z)=anzn+⋯+a0(z)=a_nz^n+⋯+a_0. If |ak|rk>∑j≠k|aj|rj|a_k|r^k>∑_j|a_j|r^j for some r>0,k∈0:n>0,k∈0:n, then by Rouche's theorem, the polynomial has exactly k roots inside B(0,r)(0,r). This sort of argument can be useful in locating residues when one applies Cauchy's residue theorem. Fundamental theorem of
