Usage: The theorem is usually used to simplify the problem of locating zeros, as follows. Given an analytic function, we write it as the sum of two parts, one of which is simpler and grows faster than (thus dominates) the other part. We can then locate the zeros by looking at only the dominating part. For example, the polynomial z5+3z3+7^5+3z^3+7 has exactly 5 zeros in the disk |z|<2|z|<2 since |3z3+7|≤31<32=|z5||3z^3+7|≤31<32=|z^5| for every |z|=2|z|=2, and z5^5, the dominating part, has five zeros in the disk.
