theorem: Let C:[0,1]→C[0,1]→ℂ be a simple closed curve whose image is the boundary ∂K. The hypothesis implies that f has no roots on ∂K, hence by the argument principle, the number Nf(K) of zeros of f in K is 12πi∮Cf′(z)f(z)dz=12πi∮f∘Cdzz=Indf∘C(0),1/2∮_Cf'(z)/f(z) dz=1/2∮_fdz/z=Ind_f(0), i.e., the winding number of the closed curve f∘C around the origin; similarly for g. The hypothesis ensures that g(z) is not a negative real multiple of f(z) for any z = C(x), thus 0 does not lie on the line segment joining f(C(x)) to g(C(x)), and Ht(x)=(1−t)f(C(x))+tg(C(x))_t(x)=(1-t)f(C(x))+tg(C(x)) is a homotopy between the curves f∘C and g∘C avoiding the origin. The winding number is homotopy-invariant: the function I(t)=IndHt(0)=12πi∮Htdzz(t)=Ind_H_t(0)=1/2∮_H_tdz/z is continuous and integer-valued, hence constant. This shows Nf(K)=Indf∘C(0)=Indg∘C(0)=Ng(K)._f(K)=Ind_f(0)=Ind_g(0)=N_g(K). See
