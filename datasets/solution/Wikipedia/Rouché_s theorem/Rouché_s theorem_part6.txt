algebra: Rouché's theorem can also be used to give a short proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Let p(z)=a0+a1z+a2z2+⋯+anzn,an≠0(z)=a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+⋯+a_nz^n,_n≠0 and choose R>0>0 so large that: |a0+a1z+⋯+an−1zn−1|≤∑j=0n−1|aj|Rj<|an|Rn=|anzn|for|z|=R.|a_0+a_1z+⋯+a_n-1z^n-1|≤∑_j=0^n-1|a_j|R^j<|a_n|R^n=|a_nz^n|for|z|=R. Since anzn_nz^n has n zeros inside the disk |z|<R|z|<R (because R>0>0), it follows from Rouché's theorem that p also has the same number of zeros inside the disk. One advantage of this proof over the others is that it shows not only that a polynomial must have a zero but the number of its zeros is equal to its degree (counting, as usual, multiplicity). Another use of Rouché's theorem is to prove the open mapping theorem for analytic functions. We refer to the article for the proof. Symmetric
