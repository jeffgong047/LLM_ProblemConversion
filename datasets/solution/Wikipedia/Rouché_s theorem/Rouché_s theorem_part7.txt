version: A stronger version of Rouché's theorem was published by Theodor Estermann in 1962.[1] It states: let K⊂G be a bounded region with continuous boundary ∂K. Two holomorphic functions f,g∈H(G), g∈ℋ(G) have the same number of roots (counting multiplicity) in K, if the strict inequality |f(z)−g(z)|<|f(z)|+|g(z)|(z∈∂K)|f(z)-g(z)|<|f(z)|+|g(z)| (z∈) holds on the boundary ∂K.. The original version of Rouché's theorem then follows from this symmetric version applied to the functions f+g,f+g,f together with the trivial inequality |f(z)+g(z)|≥0|f(z)+g(z)|≥0 (in fact this inequality is strict since f(z)+g(z)=0(z)+g(z)=0 for some z∈∂K∈ would imply |g(z)|=|f(z)||g(z)|=|f(z)|). The statement can be understood intuitively as follows. By considering −g-g in place of g, the condition can be rewritten as |f(z)+g(z)|<|f(z)|+|g(z)||f(z)+g(z)|<|f(z)|+|g(z)| for z∈∂K∈. Since |f(z)+g(z)|≤|f(z)|+|g(z)||f(z)+g(z)|≤|f(z)|+|g(z)| always holds by the triangle inequality, this is equivalent to saying that |f(z)+g(z)|≠|f(z)|+|g(z)||f(z)+g(z)|≠|f(z)|+|g(z)| on ∂K, which in turn means that for z∈∂K∈ the functions f(z)(z) and g(z)(z) are non-vanishing and arg⁡f(z)≠arg⁡g(z)f(z)≠g(z). Intuitively, if the values of f and g never pass through the origin and never point in the same direction as z circles along ∂K, then f(z)(z) and g(z)(z) must wind around the origin the same number of times.
