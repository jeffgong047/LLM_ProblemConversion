theorem: A near-pencil on seven points Let P be a configuration of n points in a projective plane, not all on a line. Let t be the number of lines determined by P. Then, t â‰¥ n, and if t = n, any two lines have exactly one point of P in common. In this case, P is either a projective plane or P is a near pencil, meaning that exactly n - 1 of the points are collinear. Euclidean
