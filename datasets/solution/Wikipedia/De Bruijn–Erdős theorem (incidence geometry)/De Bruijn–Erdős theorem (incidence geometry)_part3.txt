proof: The theorem is clearly true for three non-collinear points. We proceed by induction. Assume n > 3 and the theorem is true for n − 1. Let P be a set of n points not all collinear. The Sylvester–Gallai theorem states that there is a line containing exactly two points of P. Such two point lines are called ordinary lines. Let a and b be the two points of P on an ordinary line. If the removal of point a produces a set of collinear points then P generates a near pencil of n lines (the n - 1 ordinary lines through a plus the one line containing the other n - 1 points). Otherwise, the removal of a produces a set, P' , of n − 1 points that are not all collinear. By the induction hypothesis, P' determines at least n − 1 lines. The ordinary line determined by a and b is not among these, so P determines at least n lines. J. H. Conway's
