Consequences: Since a finite-dimensional algebra over a field is Artinian, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem implies that every finite-dimensional simple algebra over a field is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over some finite-dimensional division algebra D over k, where both n and D are uniquely determined.[1] This was shown by Joseph Wedderburn. Emil Artin later generalized this result to the case of simple left or right Artinian rings. Since the only finite-dimensional division algebra over an algebraically closed field is the field itself, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem has strong consequences in this case. Let R be a semisimple ring that is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k. Then R is a finite product ∏i=1rMni(k)∏_i=1^rM_n_i(k) where the ni_i are positive integers and Mni(k)_n_i(k) is the algebra of ni×ni_i_i matrices over k. Furthermore, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem reduces the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central simple algebras over a field k to the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central division algebras over k: that is, division algebras over k whose center is k. It implies that any finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k is isomorphic to a matrix algebra Mn(D)_n(D) where D is a finite-dimensional central division algebra over k. See
