Classification of semi-simple rings and algebras In algebra, the Wedderburnâ€“Artin theorem is a classification theorem for semisimple rings and semisimple algebras. The theorem states that an (Artinian)[a] semisimple ring R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i. In particular, any simple left or right Artinian ring is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over a division ring D, where both n and D are uniquely determined.[1]
