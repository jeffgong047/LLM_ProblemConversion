Classification of semi-simple rings and algebras
In algebra, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem is a classification theorem for semisimple rings and semisimple algebras.  The theorem states that an (Artinian)[a] semisimple ring R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i.  In particular, any simple left or right Artinian ring is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over a division ring D, where both n and D are uniquely determined.[1]


Theorem[edit]
Let R be a (Artinian) semisimple ring. Then the Wedderburn–Artin theorem states that R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings Mni(Di)_n_i(D_i) over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i. 
There is also a version of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem for algebras over a field k. If R is a finite-dimensional semisimple k-algebra, then each Di in the above statement is a finite-dimensional division algebra over k.  The center of each Di need not be k; it could be a finite extension of k.
Note that if R is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a division ring E, D need not be contained in E.  For example, matrix rings over the complex numbers are finite-dimensional simple algebras over the real numbers.

Proof[edit]
There are various proofs of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem.[2][3] A common modern one[4] takes the following approach.  
Suppose the ring R is semisimple. Then the right R-module RR_R is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of simple modules (which are the same as minimal right ideals of R).  Write this direct sum as

RR≅⨁i=1mIi⊕ni_R ≅ ⊕_i=1^mI_i^_i
where the Ii_i are mutually nonisomorphic simple right R-modules, the ith one appearing with multiplicity ni_i.  This gives an isomorphism of endomorphism rings

End(RR)≅⨁i=1mEnd(Ii⊕ni)End(R_R) ≅ ⊕_i=1^mEnd(I_i^_i)
and we can identify End(Ii⊕ni)End(I_i^_i) with a ring of matrices

End(Ii⊕ni)≅Mni(End(Ii))End(I_i^_i) ≅ M_n_i(End(I_i))
where the endomorphism ring End(Ii)End(I_i) of Ii_i is a division ring by Schur's lemma, because Ii_i is simple.   Since R≅End(RR)≅End(R_R) we conclude

R≅⨁i=1mMni(End(Ii)). ≅ ⊕_i=1^mM_n_i(End(I_i)) .
Here we used right modules because R≅End(RR)≅End(R_R); if we used left modules R would be isomorphic to the opposite algebra of End(RR)End(_RR), but the proof would still go through.  To see this proof in a larger context, see Decomposition of a module.  For the proof of an important special case, see Simple Artinian ring.

Consequences[edit]
Since a finite-dimensional algebra over a field is Artinian, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem implies that every finite-dimensional simple algebra over a field is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over some finite-dimensional division algebra D over k, where both n and D are uniquely determined.[1] This was shown by Joseph Wedderburn. Emil Artin later generalized this result to the case of simple left or right Artinian rings. 
Since the only finite-dimensional division algebra over an algebraically closed field is the field itself, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem has strong consequences in this case.  Let R be a semisimple ring that is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k.  Then R is a finite product ∏i=1rMni(k)∏_i=1^rM_n_i(k) where the ni_i are positive integers and Mni(k)_n_i(k) is the algebra of ni×ni_i_i matrices over k.   
Furthermore, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem reduces the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central simple algebras over a field k to the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central division algebras over k: that is, division algebras over k whose center is k.  It implies that any finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k is isomorphic to a matrix algebra Mn(D)_n(D)
where D is a finite-dimensional central division algebra over k.

Notes[edit]


^ By the definition used here, semisimple rings are automatically Artinian rings. However, some authors use "semisimple" differently, to mean that the ring has a trivial Jacobson radical. For Artinian rings, the two notions are equivalent, so "Artinian" is included here to eliminate that ambiguity.
