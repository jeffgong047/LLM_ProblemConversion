theorem: If the assumption that M and N are simply connected is dropped, h-cobordisms need not be cylinders; the obstruction is exactly the Whitehead torsion τ (W, M) of the inclusion M↪W. Precisely, the s-cobordism theorem (the s stands for simple-homotopy equivalence), proved independently by Barry Mazur, John Stallings, and Dennis Barden, states (assumptions as above but where M and N need not be simply connected): An h-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if Whitehead torsion τ (W, M) vanishes. The torsion vanishes if and only if the inclusion M↪W is not just a homotopy equivalence, but a simple homotopy equivalence. Note that one need not assume that the other inclusion N↪W is also a simple homotopy equivalence—that follows from the theorem. Categorically, h-cobordisms form a groupoid. Then a finer statement of the s-cobordism theorem is that the isomorphism classes of this groupoid (up to C-isomorphism of h-cobordisms) are torsors for the respective[5] Whitehead groups Wh(π), where π≅π1(M)≅π1(W)≅π1(N).π≅π_1(M)≅π_1(W)≅π_1(N).
