sketch: A Morse function f:W→[a,b]:W→[a,b] induces a handle decomposition of W, i.e., if there is a single critical point of index k in f−1([c,c′])^-1([c,c']), then the ascending cobordism Wc′_c' is obtained from Wc_c by attaching a k-handle. The goal of the proof is to find a handle decomposition with no handles at all so that integrating the non-zero gradient vector field of f gives the desired diffeomorphism to the trivial cobordism. This is achieved through a series of techniques. 1) Handle rearrangement First, we want to rearrange all handles by order so that lower order handles are attached first. The question is thus when can we slide an i-handle off of a j-handle? This can be done by a radial isotopy so long as the i attaching sphere and the j belt sphere do not intersect. We thus want (i−1)+(n−j)≤dim⁡∂W−1=n−1(i-1)+(n-j)≤-1=n-1 which is equivalent to i≤j. We then define the handle chain complex (C∗,∂∗)(C_*,∂_*) by letting Ck_k be the free abelian group on the k-handles and defining ∂k:Ck→Ck−1∂_k:C_k_k-1 by sending a k-handle hαk_α^k to ∑β⟨hαk∣hβk−1⟩hβk−1∑_β_α^k_β^k-1_β^k-1, where ⟨hαk∣hβk−1⟩_α^k_β^k-1⟩ is the intersection number of the k-attaching sphere and the (k − 1)-belt sphere. 2) Handle cancellation Next, we want to "cancel" handles. The idea is that attaching a k-handle hαk_α^k might create a hole that can be filled in by attaching a (k + 1)-handle hβk+1_β^k+1. This would imply that ∂k+1hβk+1=±hαk∂_k+1h_β^k+1=_α^k and so the (α,β)(α,β) entry in the matrix of ∂k+1∂_k+1 would be ±1±1. However, when is this condition sufficient? That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The answer lies in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the Whitney trick. This analysis leads to the requirement that n must be at least 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,n-, or (n + 1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique. 3) Handle trading The idea of handle trading is to create a cancelling pair of (k + 1)- and (k + 2)-handles so that a given k-handle cancels with the (k + 1)-handle leaving behind the (k + 2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the k-handle which is an element in πk(W,M)π_k(W,M). This group is trivial since W is an h-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk Dk+1^k+1 which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so long as we can embed this disk into the boundary of W. This embedding exists if dim⁡∂W−1=n−1≥2(k+1)-1=n-1≥2(k+1). Since we are assuming n is at least 5 this means that k is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −f, we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the n- and (n + 1)-handles as desired. 4) Handle sliding Finally, we want to make sure that doing row and column operations on ∂k∂_k corresponds to a geometric operation. Indeed, it isn't hard to show (best done by drawing a picture) that sliding a k-handle hαk_α^k over another k-handle hβk_β^k replaces hαk_α^k by hαk±hβk_α^k_β^k in the basis for Ck_k. The proof of the theorem now follows: the handle chain complex is exact since H∗(W,M;Z)=0_*(W,M;ℤ)=0. Thus Ck≅coker⁡∂k+1⊕im⁡∂k+1_k≅coker∂_k+1⊕im∂_k+1 since the Ck_k are free. Then ∂k∂_k, which is an integer matrix, restricts to an invertible morphism which can thus be diagonalized via elementary row operations (handle sliding) and must have only ±1±1 on the diagonal because it is invertible. Thus, all handles are paired with a single other cancelling handle yielding a decomposition with no handles. The s-cobordism
