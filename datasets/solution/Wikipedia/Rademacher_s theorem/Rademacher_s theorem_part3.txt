Applications: Rademacher's theorem can be used to prove that, for any p ≥ 1, the Sobolev space W1,p(Ω) is preserved under a bi-Lipschitz transformation of the domain, with the chain rule holding in its standard form.[5] With appropriate modification, this also extends to the more general Sobolev spaces Wk,p(Ω).[6] Rademacher's theorem is also significant in the study of geometric measure theory and rectifiable sets, as it allows the analysis of first-order differential geometry, specifically tangent planes and normal vectors.[7] Higher-order concepts such as curvature remain more subtle, since their usual definitions require more differentiability than is achieved by the Rademacher theorem. In the presence of convexity, second-order differentiability is achieved by the Alexandrov theorem, the proof of which can be modeled on that of the Rademacher theorem. In some special cases, the Rademacher theorem is even used as part of the proof.[8]
