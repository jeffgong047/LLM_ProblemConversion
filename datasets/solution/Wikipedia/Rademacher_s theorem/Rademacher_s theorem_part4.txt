Generalizations: Alberto Calderón proved the more general fact that if Ω is an open bounded set in Rn then every function in the Sobolev space W1,p(Ω) is differentiable almost everywhere, provided that p > n.[9] Calderón's theorem is a relatively direct corollary of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem and Sobolev embedding theorem. Rademacher's theorem is a special case, due to the fact that any Lipschitz function on Ω is an element of the space W1,∞(Ω).[9] There is a version of Rademacher's theorem that holds for Lipschitz functions from a Euclidean space into an arbitrary metric space in terms of metric differentials instead of the usual derivative.
