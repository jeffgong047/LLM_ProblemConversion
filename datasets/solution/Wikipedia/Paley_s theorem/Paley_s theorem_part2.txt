matrix: Let q be a power of an odd prime. In the finite field GF(q) the quadratic character χ(a) indicates whether the element a is zero, a non-zero perfect square, or a non-square: χ(a)=0ifa=01ifa=b2forsomenon-zerofinitefieldelementb−1ifaisnotthesquareofanyfinitefieldelement.χ(a)=0 ifa=0 1 ifa=b^2forsomenon-zerofinitefieldelementb -1 ifaisnotthesquareofanyfinitefieldelement. For example, in GF(7) the non-zero squares are 1 = 12 = 62, 4 = 22 = 52, and 2 = 32 = 42. Hence χ(0) = 0, χ(1) = χ(2) = χ(4) = 1, and χ(3) = χ(5) = χ(6) = −1. The Jacobsthal matrix Q for GF(q) is the q×q matrix with rows and columns indexed by finite field elements such that the entry in row a and column b is χ(a − b). For example, in GF(7), if the rows and columns of the Jacobsthal matrix are indexed by the field elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then Q=[0−1−11−11110−1−11−11110−1−11−1−1110−1−111−1110−1−1−11−1110−1−1−11−1110].=[ 0 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1; 1 0 -1 -1 1 -1 1; 1 1 0 -1 -1 1 -1; -1 1 1 0 -1 -1 1; 1 -1 1 1 0 -1 -1; -1 1 -1 1 1 0 -1; -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 0 ]. The Jacobsthal matrix has the properties Q QT = q I − J and Q J = J Q = 0 where I is the q×q identity matrix and J is the q×q all 1 matrix. If q is congruent to 1 (mod 4) then −1 is a square in GF(q) which implies that Q is a symmetric matrix. If q is congruent to 3 (mod 4) then −1 is not a square, and Q is a skew-symmetric matrix. When q is a prime number and rows and columns are indexed by field elements in the usual 0, 1, 2, … order, Q is a circulant matrix. That is, each row is obtained from the row above by cyclic permutation. Paley construction
