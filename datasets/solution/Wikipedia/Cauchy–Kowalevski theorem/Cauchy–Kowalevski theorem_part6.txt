theorem: There is a wide generalization of the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem for systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients, the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya–Kashiwara theorem, due to Masaki Kashiwara (1983). This theorem involves a cohomological formulation, presented in the language of D-modules. The existence condition involves a compatibility condition among the non homogeneous parts of each equation and the vanishing of a derived functor Ext1^1.
