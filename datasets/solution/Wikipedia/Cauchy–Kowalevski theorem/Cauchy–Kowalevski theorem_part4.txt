theorem: If F and fj are analytic functions near 0, then the non-linear Cauchy problem ∂tkh=F(x,t,∂tj∂xαh),wherej<kand|α|+j≤k,∂_t^kh=F(x,t,∂_t^j ∂_x^αh),wherej<kand|α|+j, with initial conditions ∂tjh(x,0)=fj(x),0≤j<k,∂_t^jh(x,0)=f_j(x), 0<k, has a unique analytic solution near 0. This follows from the first order problem by considering the derivatives of h appearing on the right hand side as components of a vector-valued function.
