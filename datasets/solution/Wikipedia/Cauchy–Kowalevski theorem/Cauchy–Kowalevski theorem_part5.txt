Example: The heat equation ∂th=∂x2h∂_th=∂_x^2h with the condition h(0,x)=11+x2fort=0(0,x)=11+x^2fort=0 has a unique formal power series solution (expanded around (0, 0)). However this formal power series does not converge for any non-zero values of t, so there are no analytic solutions in a neighborhood of the origin. This shows that the condition |α| + j ≤ k above cannot be dropped. (This example is due to Kowalevski.) Cauchy–Kovalevskaya–Kashiwara
