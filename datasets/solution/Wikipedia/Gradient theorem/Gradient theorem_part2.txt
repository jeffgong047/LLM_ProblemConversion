Proof: If φ is a differentiable function from some open subset U ⊆ Rn to R and r is a differentiable function from some closed interval [a, b] to U (Note that r is differentiable at the interval endpoints a and b. To do this, r is defined on an interval that is larger than and includes [a, b].), then by the multivariate chain rule, the composite function φ ∘ r is differentiable on [a, b]: ddt(φ∘r)(t)=∇φ(r(t))⋅r′(t)d/dt(φ∘𝐫)(t)=∇φ(𝐫(t))·𝐫'(t) for all t in [a, b]. Here the ⋅ denotes the usual inner product. Now suppose the domain U of φ contains the differentiable curve γ with endpoints p and q. (This is oriented in the direction from p to q). If r parametrizes γ for t in [a, b] (i.e., r represents γ as a function of t), then ∫γ∇φ(r)⋅dr=∫ab∇φ(r(t))⋅r′(t)dt=∫abddtφ(r(t))dt=φ(r(b))−φ(r(a))=φ(q)−φ(p),∫_γ∇φ(𝐫)·d𝐫 =∫_a^b∇φ(𝐫(t))·𝐫'(t)dt =∫_a^bd/dtφ(𝐫(t))dt=φ(𝐫(b))-φ(𝐫(a))=φ(𝐪)-φ(𝐩), where the definition of a line integral is used in the first equality, the above equation is used in the second equality, and the second fundamental theorem of calculus is used in the third equality.[1] Even if the gradient theorem (also called fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals) has been proved for a differentiable (so looked as smooth) curve so far, the theorem is also proved for a piecewise-smooth curve since this curve is made by joining multiple differentiable curves so the proof for this curve is made by the proof per differentiable curve component.[2]
