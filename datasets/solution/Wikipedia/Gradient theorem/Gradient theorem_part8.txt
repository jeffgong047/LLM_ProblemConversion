converse: Suppose U is an open, path-connected subset of Rn, and F : U → Rn is a continuous and path-independent vector field. Fix some element a of U, and define f : U → R byf(x):=∫γ[a,x]F(u)⋅du(𝐱):=∫_γ[𝐚,𝐱]𝐅(𝐮)·d𝐮Here γ[a, x] is any (differentiable) curve in U originating at a and terminating at x. We know that f is well-defined because F is path-independent. Let v be any nonzero vector in Rn. By the definition of the directional derivative,∂f(x)∂v=limt→0f(x+tv)−f(x)t=limt→0∫γ[a,x+tv]F(u)⋅du−∫γ[a,x]F(u)⋅dut=limt→01t∫γ[x,x+tv]F(u)⋅du(𝐱)/∂𝐯 =lim_t→0f(𝐱+t𝐯)-f(𝐱)/t =lim_t→0∫_γ[𝐚,𝐱+t𝐯]𝐅(𝐮)·d𝐮-∫_γ[𝐚,𝐱]𝐅(𝐮)𝐮/t =lim_t→01/t∫_γ[𝐱,𝐱+t𝐯]𝐅(𝐮)·d𝐮To calculate the integral within the final limit, we must parametrize γ[x, x + tv]. Since F is path-independent, U is open, and t is approaching zero, we may assume that this path is a straight line, and parametrize it as u(s) = x + sv for 0 < s < t. Now, since u'(s) = v, the limit becomeslimt→01t∫0tF(u(s))⋅u′(s)ds=ddt∫0tF(x+sv)⋅vds|t=0=F(x)⋅vlim_t→01/t∫_0^t𝐅(𝐮(s))·𝐮'(s) ds=d/dt∫_0^t𝐅(𝐱+s𝐯)·𝐯 ds|_t=0=𝐅(𝐱)·𝐯where the first equality is from the definition of the derivative with a fact that the integral is equal to 0 at t = 0, and the second equality is from the first fundamental theorem of calculus. Thus we have a formula for ∂vf, (one of ways to represent the directional derivative) where v is arbitrary; for f(x):=∫γ[a,x]F(u)⋅du(𝐱):=∫_γ[𝐚,𝐱]𝐅(𝐮)·d𝐮 (see its full definition above), its directional derivative with respect to v is∂f(x)∂v=∂vf(x)=Dvf(x)=F(x)⋅v(𝐱)/∂𝐯=∂_𝐯f(𝐱)=D_𝐯f(𝐱)=𝐅(𝐱)·𝐯where the first two equalities just show different representations of the directional derivative. According to the definition of the gradient of a scalar function f, ∇f(x)=F(x)(𝐱)=𝐅(𝐱), thus we have found a scalar-valued function f whose gradient is the path-independent vector field F (i.e., F is a conservative vector field.), as desired.[3] Example of the converse
