3: Suppose there are n point charges arranged in three-dimensional space, and the i-th point charge has charge Qi and is located at position pi in R3. We would like to calculate the work done on a particle of charge q as it travels from a point a to a point b in R3. Using Coulomb's law, we can easily determine that the force on the particle at position r will be F(r)=kq∑i=1nQi(r−pi)|r−pi|3𝐅(𝐫)=kq∑_i=1^nQ_i(𝐫-𝐩_i)/|𝐫-𝐩_i|^3 Here |u| denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector u in R3, and k = 1/(4πε0), where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Let γ ⊂ R3 − {p1, ..., pn} be an arbitrary differentiable curve from a to b. Then the work done on the particle is W=∫γF(r)⋅dr=∫γ(kq∑i=1nQi(r−pi)|r−pi|3)⋅dr=kq∑i=1n(Qi∫γr−pi|r−pi|3⋅dr)=∫_γ𝐅(𝐫)·d𝐫=∫_γ(kq∑_i=1^nQ_i(𝐫-𝐩_i)/|𝐫-𝐩_i|^3)·d𝐫=kq∑_i=1^n(Q_i∫_γ𝐫-𝐩_i/|𝐫-𝐩_i|^3·d𝐫) Now for each i, direct computation shows that r−pi|r−pi|3=−∇1|r−pi|.𝐫-𝐩_i/|𝐫-𝐩_i|^3=-∇1/|𝐫-𝐩_i|. Thus, continuing from above and using the gradient theorem, W=−kq∑i=1n(Qi∫γ∇1|r−pi|⋅dr)=kq∑i=1nQi(1|a−pi|−1|b−pi|)=-kq∑_i=1^n(Q_i∫_γ∇1/|𝐫-𝐩_i|·d𝐫)=kq∑_i=1^nQ_i(1/|𝐚-𝐩_i|-1/|𝐛-𝐩_i|) We are finished. Of course, we could have easily completed this calculation using the powerful language of electrostatic potential or electrostatic potential energy (with the familiar formulas W = −ΔU = −qΔV). However, we have not yet defined potential or potential energy, because the converse of the gradient theorem is required to prove that these are well-defined, differentiable functions and that these formulas hold (see below). Thus, we have solved this problem using only Coulomb's Law, the definition of work, and the gradient theorem. Converse of the gradient
