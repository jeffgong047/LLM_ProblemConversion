2: For a more abstract example, suppose γ ⊂ Rn has endpoints p, q, with orientation from p to q. For u in Rn, let |u| denote the Euclidean norm of u. If α ≥ 1 is a real number, then ∫γ|x|α−1x⋅dx=1α+1∫γ(α+1)|x|(α+1)−2x⋅dx=1α+1∫γ∇|x|α+1⋅dx=|q|α+1−|p|α+1α+1∫_γ|𝐱|^α-1𝐱·d𝐱 =1/α+1∫_γ(α+1)|𝐱|^(α+1)-2𝐱·d𝐱 =1/α+1∫_γ∇|𝐱|^α+1·d𝐱=|𝐪|^α+1-|𝐩|^α+1/α+1 Here the final equality follows by the gradient theorem, since the function f(x) = |x|α+1 is differentiable on Rn if α ≥ 1. If α < 1 then this equality will still hold in most cases, but caution must be taken if γ passes through or encloses the origin, because the integrand vector field |x|α − 1x will fail to be defined there. However, the case α = −1 is somewhat different; in this case, the integrand becomes |x|−2x = ∇(log |x|), so that the final equality becomes log |q| − log |p|. Note that if n = 1, then this example is simply a slight variant of the familiar power rule from single-variable calculus. Example
