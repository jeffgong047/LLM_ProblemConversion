theorem: The theorem can be reversed to say: for three circles intersecting at M, a line can be drawn from any point A on one circle, through its intersection C´ with another to give B (at the second intersection). B is then similarly connected, via intersection at A´ of the second and third circles, giving point C. Points C, A and the remaining point of intersection, B´, will then be collinear, and triangle ABC will always pass through the circle intersections A´, B´ and C´. Miquel and Steiner's Quadrilateral Theorem Miquel's Pentagon Theorem Miquel's six circles theorem states that if five circles share four triple-points of intersection then the remaining four points of intersection lie on a sixth circle Similar inscribed
