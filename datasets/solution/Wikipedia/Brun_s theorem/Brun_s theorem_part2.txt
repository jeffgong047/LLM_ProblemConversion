primes: The convergence of the sum of reciprocals of twin primes follows from bounds on the density of the sequence of twin primes. Let π2(x)π_2(x) denote the number of primes p ≤ x for which p + 2 is also prime (i.e. π2(x)π_2(x) is the number of twin primes with the smaller at most x). Then, we have π2(x)=O(x(log⁡log⁡x)2(log⁡x)2).π_2(x)=O(x(log)^2/()^2). That is, twin primes are less frequent than prime numbers by nearly a logarithmic factor. This bound gives the intuition that the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges, or stated in other words, the twin primes form a small set. In explicit terms, the sum ∑p:p+2∈P(1p+1p+2)=(13+15)+(15+17)+(111+113)+⋯∑_p : p+2∈ℙ(1/p+1/p+2)=(1/3+1/5)+(1/5+1/7)+(1/11+1/13)+⋯ either has finitely many terms or has infinitely many terms but is convergent: its value is known as Brun's constant. If it were the case that the sum diverged, then that fact would imply that there are infinitely many twin primes. Because the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes instead converges, it is not possible to conclude from this result that there are finitely many or infinitely many twin primes. Brun's constant could be an irrational number only if there are infinitely many twin primes. Numerical
