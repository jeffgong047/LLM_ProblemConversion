estimates: The series converges extremely slowly. Thomas Nicely remarks that after summing the first billion (109) terms, the relative error is still more than 5%.[1] By calculating the twin primes up to 1014 (and discovering the Pentium FDIV bug along the way), Nicely heuristically estimated Brun's constant to be 1.902160578.[1] Nicely has extended his computation to 1.6×1015 as of 18 January 2010 but this is not the largest computation of its type. In 2002, Pascal Sebah and Patrick Demichel used all twin primes up to 1016 to give the estimate[2] that B2 ≈ 1.902160583104. Hence, Year B2 set of twin primes below # by 1976 1.902160540 1 × 1011 Brent 1996 1.902160578 1 × 1014 Nicely 2002 1.902160583104 1 × 1016 Sebah and Demichel The last is based on extrapolation from the sum 1.830484424658... for the twin primes below 1016. Dominic Klyve showed conditionally (in an unpublished thesis) that B2 < 2.1754 (assuming the extended Riemann hypothesis). It has been shown unconditionally that B2 < 2.347.[3] There is also a Brun's constant for prime quadruplets. A prime quadruplet is a pair of two twin prime pairs, separated by a distance of 4 (the smallest possible distance). The first prime quadruplets are (5, 7, 11, 13), (11, 13, 17, 19), (101, 103, 107, 109). Brun's constant for prime quadruplets, denoted by B4, is the sum of the reciprocals of all prime quadruplets: B4=(15+17+111+113)+(111+113+117+119)+(1101+1103+1107+1109)+⋯_4=(1/5+1/7+1/11+1/13)+(1/11+1/13+1/17+1/19)+(1/101+1/103+1/107+1/109)+⋯ with value: B4 = 0.87058 83800 ± 0.00000 00005, the error range having a 99% confidence level according to Nicely.[1] This constant should not be confused with the Brun's constant for cousin primes, as prime pairs of the form (p, p + 4), which is also written as B4. Wolf derived an estimate for the Brun-type sums Bn of 4/n. Further
