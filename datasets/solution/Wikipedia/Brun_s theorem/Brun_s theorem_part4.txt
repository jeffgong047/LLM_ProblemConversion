results: Let C2=0.6601…_2=0.6601… (sequence A005597 in the OEIS) be the twin prime constant. Then it is conjectured that π2(x)∼2C2x(log⁡x)2.π_2(x)∼2C_2x/()^2. In particular, π2(x)<(2C2+ε)x(log⁡x)2π_2(x)<(2C_2+ε)x/()^2 for every ε>0ε>0 and all sufficiently large x. Many special cases of the above have been proved. Most recently, Jie Wu proved that for sufficiently large x, π2(x)<4.5x(log⁡x)2π_2(x)<4.5 x/()^2 where 4.5 corresponds to ε≈3.18ε≈3.18 in the above. In popular
