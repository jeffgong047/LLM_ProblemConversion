Proof: An elementary proof, given in Sarason (1998), proceeds as follows. There is a closed piecewise-linear contour Γ in the open set, containing K in its interior. By Cauchy's integral formula f(w)=12πi∫Γf(z)dzz−w(w)=12∫_Γf(z) dz-w for w in K. Riemann approximating sums can be used to approximate the contour integral uniformly over K. Each term in the sum is a scalar multiple of (z − w)−1 for some point z on the contour. This gives a uniform approximation by a rational function with poles on Γ. To modify this to an approximation with poles at specified points in each component of the complement of K, it is enough to check this for terms of the form (z − w)−1. If z0 is the point in the same component as z, take a piecewise-linear path from z to z0. If two points are sufficiently close on the path, any rational function with poles only at the first point can be expanded as a Laurent series about the second point. That Laurent series can be truncated to give a rational function with poles only at the second point uniformly close to the original function on K. Proceeding by steps along the path from z to z0 the original function (z − w)−1 can be successively modified to give a rational function with poles only at z0. If z0 is the point at infinity, then by the above procedure the rational function (z − w)−1 can first be approximated by a rational function g with poles at R > 0 where R is so large that K lies in w < R. The Taylor series expansion of g about 0 can then be truncated to give a polynomial approximation on K. See
