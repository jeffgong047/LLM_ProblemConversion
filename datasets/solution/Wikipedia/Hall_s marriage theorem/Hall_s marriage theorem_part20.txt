However, the situation of having an infinite number of sets while allowing infinite sets is not allowed. ^ Reichmeider 1984, p.90 ^ Haxell, P. (2011). "On Forming Committees".

For H a finite index subgroup of G, the existence of a left-right transversal is well known, sometimes presented as an application of Hall's marriage theorem. ^ Hall, Marshall (1945).

There is the result concerning matchings in bipartite graphs and its interpretation as a covering of (0,1)-matrices. Hall (1986) and van Lint & Wilson (1992) refer to the matrix form as König's theorem, while Roberts & Tesman (2009) refer to this version as the Kőnig-Egerváry theorem. The bipartite graph version is called Kőnig's theorem by Cameron (1994) and Roberts & Tesman (2009). ^ Equivalence of seven major theorems in combinatorics ^ Reichmeider 1984 ^ Hall 1986, pg. 51 ^ Hall 1986, pg. 51 ^ Aharoni, Ron (February 1984).
