Sufficiency: Consider the contrapositive: if there is no X-perfect matching then Hall's condition must be violated for at least one W⊆X. Let M be a maximum matching, and let u be any unmatched vertex in X. Consider all alternating paths (paths in G that alternately use edges outside and inside M) starting from u. Let W be the set of vertices in these paths that belong to X (including u itself) and let Z be the set of vertices in these paths that belong to Y. Then every vertex in Z is matched by M to a vertex in W, because an alternating path to an unmatched vertex could be used to increase the size of the matching by toggling whether each of its edges belongs to M or not. Therefore, the size of W is at least the number |Z||Z| of these matched neighbors of Z, plus one for the unmatched vertex u. That is, |W|≥|Z|+1|W|≥|Z|+1. However, for every vertex v∈W, every neighbor w of v belongs to Z: an alternating path to w can be found either by removing the matched edge vw from the alternating path to v, or by adding the unmatched edge vw to the alternating path to v. Therefore, Z=NG(W)=N_G(W) and |W|≥|NG(W)|+1|W|≥|N_G(W)|+1, showing that Hall's condition is violated. Equivalence of the combinatorial formulation and the graph-theoretic
