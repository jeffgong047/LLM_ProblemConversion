variant: By examining Philip Hall's original proof carefully, Marshall Hall Jr. (no relation to Philip Hall) was able to tweak the result in a way that permitted the proof to work for infinite Fℱ.[10] This variant extends Philip Hall's Marriage theorem. Suppose that F=Aii∈Iℱ={A_i}_i, is a (possibly infinite) family of finite sets that need not be distinct, then Fℱ has a transversal if and only if Fℱ satisfies the marriage condition. Marriage condition does not
