Applications: The theorem has many applications. For example, for a standard deck of cards, dealt into 13 piles of 4 cards each, the marriage theorem implies that it is possible to select one card from each pile so that the selected cards contain exactly one card of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King). More generally, any regular bipartite graph has a perfect matching.[4]: 2 More abstractly, let G be a group, and H be a finite index subgroup of G. Then the marriage theorem can be used to show that there is a set T such that T is a transversal for both the set of left cosets and right cosets of H in G.[5] The marriage theorem is used in the usual proofs of the fact that an r×n Latin rectangle can always be extended to an (r+1)×n(r+1) Latin rectangle when r<n<n, and so, ultimately to a Latin square.[6] Logical
