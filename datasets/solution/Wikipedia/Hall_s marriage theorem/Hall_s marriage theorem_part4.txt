Examples: example 1, marriage condition met Example 1 Consider the family F=A1,A2,A3ℱ={A_1,A_2,A_3} with X=1,2,3,4,5={1,2,3,4,5} and A1=1,2,3A2=1,4,5A3=3,5.A_1 ={1,2,3} A_2 ={1,4,5} A_3 ={3,5}. The transversal 1,3,5{1,3,5} could be generated by the function that maps A1_1 to 11, A2_2 to 55, and A3_3 to 33, or alternatively by the function that maps A1_1 to 33, A2_2 to 11, and A3_3 to 55. There are other transversals, such as 2,1,3{2,1,3} and 1,4,5{1,4,5}. Because this family has at least one transversal, the marriage condition is met. Every subfamily of Fℱ has equal size to the set of representatives it is mapped to, which is less than or equal to the size of the union of the subfamily. example 2, marriage condition violated Example 2 Consider F=A1,A2,A3,A4ℱ={A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4} with A1=2,3,4,5A2=4,5A3=5A4=4.A_1 ={2,3,4,5} A_2 ={4,5} A_3 ={5} A_4 ={4}. No valid transversal exists; the marriage condition is violated as is shown by the subfamily G=A2,A3,A4𝒢={A_2,A_3,A_4}. Here the number of sets in the subfamily is |G|=3|𝒢|=3, while the union of the three sets A2∪A3∪A4=4,5_2_3_4={4,5} contains only two elements. A lower bound on the different number of transversals that a given finite family Fℱ of size n may have is obtained as follows: If each of the sets in Fℱ has cardinality ≥r, then the number of different transversals for Fℱ is either r!! if r≤n, or r(r−1)⋯(r−n+1)(r-1)⋯(r-n+1) if r>n>n.[2] Recall that a transversal for a family Fℱ is an ordered sequence, so two different transversals could have exactly the same elements. For instance, the collection A1=1,2,3_1={1,2,3}, A2=1,2,5_2={1,2,5} has (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1) as distinct transversals. Graph theoretic
