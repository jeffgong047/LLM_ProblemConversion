extend: The following example, due to Marshall Hall Jr., shows that the marriage condition will not guarantee the existence of a transversal in an infinite family in which infinite sets are allowed. Let Fℱ be the family, A0=N_0=ℕ, Ai=i−1_i={i-1} for i≥1≥1. The marriage condition holds for this infinite family, but no transversal can be constructed.[11] Graph theoretic formulation of Marshall Hall's
