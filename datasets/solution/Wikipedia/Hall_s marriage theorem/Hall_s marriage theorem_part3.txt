Statement: Let Fℱ be a finite family of sets (note that although Fℱ is not itself allowed to be infinite, the sets in it may be so, and Fℱ may contain the same set multiple times).[1] Let X be the union of all the sets in Fℱ, the set of elements that belong to at least one of its sets. A transversal for Fℱ is a subset of X that can be obtained by choosing a distinct element from each set in Fℱ. This concept can be formalized by defining a transversal to be the image of an injective function f:F→X:ℱ such that f(S)∈S(S) for each S∈F∈ℱ. An alternative term for transversal is system of distinct representatives. The collection Fℱ satisfies the marriage condition when each subfamily of Fℱ contains at least as many distinct members as its number of sets. That is, for all G⊆F𝒢⊆ℱ, |G|≤|⋃S∈GS|.|𝒢|≤|⋃_S∈𝒢S|. If a transversal exists then the marriage condition must be true: the function f used to define the transversal maps G𝒢 to a subset of its union, of size equal to |G||𝒢|, so the whole union must be at least as large. Hall's theorem states that the converse is also true: Hall's Marriage Theorem — A family Fℱ of finite sets has a transversal if and only if Fℱ satisfies the marriage condition.
