formulation: blue edges represent a matching Let G=(X,Y,E)=(X,Y,E) be a finite bipartite graph with bipartite sets X and Y and edge set E. An X-perfect matching (also called an X-saturating matching) is a matching, a set of disjoint edges, which covers every vertex in X. For a subset W of X, let NG(W)_G(W) denote the neighborhood of W in G, the set of all vertices in Y that are adjacent to at least one element of W. The marriage theorem in this formulation states that there is an X-perfect matching if and only if for every subset W of X: |W|≤|NG(W)|.|W|≤|N_G(W)|. In other words, every subset W of X must have sufficiently many neighbors in Y.
