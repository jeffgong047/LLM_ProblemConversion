In polynomial algebra and field theory, Joubert's theorem states that if K and L are fields, L is a separable field extension of K of degree 6, and the characteristic of K is not equal to 2, then L is generated over K by some element λ in L, such that the minimal polynomial p of λ has the form p(t)(t) = t6+c4t4+c2t2+c1t+c0^6+c_4t^4+c_2t^2+c_1t+c_0, for some constants c4,c2,c1,c0_4,c_2,c_1,c_0 in K.[1] The theorem is named in honor of Charles Joubert, a French mathematician, lycée professor, and Jesuit priest.[2][3][4][5][6] In 1867 Joubert published his theorem in his paper Sur l'équation du sixième degré in tome 64 of Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences.[7] He seems to have made the assumption that the fields involved in the theorem are subfields of the complex field.[1] Using arithmetic properties of hypersurfaces, Daniel F. Coray gave, in 1987, a proof of Joubert's theorem (with the assumption that the characteristic of K is neither 2 nor 3).[1][8] In 2006 Hanspeter Kraft [de] gave a proof of Joubert's theorem[9] "based on an enhanced version of Joubert’s argument".[1] In 2014 Zinovy Reichstein proved that the condition characteristic(K) ≠ 2 is necessary in general to prove the theorem, but the theorem's conclusion can be proved in the characteristic 2 case with some additional assumptions on K and L.[1]
