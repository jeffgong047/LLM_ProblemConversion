employed: A key tool used in the formulation and proof of the singularity theorems is the Raychaudhuri equation, which describes the divergence θθ of a congruence (family) of geodesics. The divergence of a congruence is defined as the derivative of the log of the determinant of the congruence volume. The Raychaudhuri equation is θ˙=−σabσab−13θ2−E[X→]aaθ̇=-σ_abσ^ab-1/3θ^2-E[X⃗]^a_a where σabσ_ab is the shear tensor of the congruence and E[X→]aa=RmnXmXnE[X⃗]^a_a=R_mn X^m X^n is also known as the Raychaudhuri scalar (see the congruence page for details). The key point is that E[X→]aaE[X⃗]^a_a will be non-negative provided that the Einstein field equations hold and[6] the null energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is null, or the strong energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is timelike. When these hold, the divergence becomes infinite at some finite value of the affine parameter. Thus all geodesics leaving a point will eventually reconverge after a finite time, provided the appropriate energy condition holds, a result also known as the focusing theorem. This is relevant for singularities thanks to the following argument: Suppose we have a spacetime that is globally hyperbolic, and two points p and q that can be connected by a timelike or null curve. Then there exists a geodesic of maximal length connecting p and q. Call this geodesic γγ. The geodesic γγ can be varied to a longer curve if another geodesic from p intersects γγ at another point, called a conjugate point. From the focusing theorem, we know that all geodesics from p have conjugate points at finite values of the affine parameter. In particular, this is true for the geodesic of maximal length. But this is a contradiction – one can therefore conclude that the spacetime is geodesically incomplete. In general relativity, there are several versions of the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorem. Most versions state, roughly, that if there is a trapped null surface and the energy density is nonnegative, then there exist geodesics of finite length that cannot be extended.[7] These theorems, strictly speaking, prove that there is at least one non-spacelike geodesic that is only finitely extendible into the past but there are cases in which the conditions of these theorems obtain in such a way that all past-directed spacetime paths terminate at a singularity.
