truth: The hypothesis of universal gravitation is generally considered as an exact truth. This leads to the Einstein's equations which form the basis of the singularity theorem[10] Recently it has been shown[11] that the back reaction of the test mass renders the hypothesis of universal gravitation to be an approximate truth. Such conceptions are realized through some elementary constructions based on the refinement of the first axiom of geometry, namely, the concept of a point [12] by considering Klein's prescription of accounting for the extension of a small spot that represents or demonstrates a point,[13] which was a programmatic call that he called as a fusion of arithmetic and geometry.[14] Klein's program, according to Born, was actually a mathematical route to consider `natural uncertainty in all observations' while describing `a physical situation' by means of `real numbers'.[15] As a consequence of such results, the singularity theorem can now be considered as an approximate truth as well.
