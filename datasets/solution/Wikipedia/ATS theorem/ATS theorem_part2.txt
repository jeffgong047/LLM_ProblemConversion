problem: In some fields of mathematics and mathematical physics, sums of the form S=∑a<k≤bφ(k)e2πif(k)(1)=∑_a<kφ(k)e^2(k) (1) are under study. Here φ(x)φ(x) and f(x)(x) are real valued functions of a real argument, and i2=−1.^2=-1. Such sums appear, for example, in number theory in the analysis of the Riemann zeta function, in the solution of problems connected with integer points in the domains on plane and in space, in the study of the Fourier series, and in the solution of such differential equations as the wave equation, the potential equation, the heat conductivity equation. The problem of approximation of the series (1) by a suitable function was studied already by Euler and Poisson. We shall define the length of the sum S to be the number b−a-a (for the integers a and b,, this is the number of the summands in S). Under certain conditions on φ(x)φ(x) and f(x)(x) the sum S can be substituted with good accuracy by another sum S1,_1, S1=∑α<k≤βΦ(k)e2πiF(k),(2)_1=∑_α<k≤βΦ(k)e^2(k), 2) where the length β−αβ-α is far less than b−a.-a. First relations of the form S=S1+R,(3)=S_1+R, (3) where S,, S1_1 are the sums (1) and (2) respectively, R is a remainder term, with concrete functions φ(x)φ(x) and f(x),(x), were obtained by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood,[1][2][3] when they deduced approximate functional equation for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)ζ(s) and by I. M. Vinogradov,[4] in the study of the amounts of integer points in the domains on plane. In general form the theorem was proved by J. Van der Corput,[5][6] (on the recent results connected with the Van der Corput theorem one can read at [7]). In every one of the above-mentioned works, some restrictions on the functions φ(x)φ(x) and f(x)(x) were imposed. With convenient (for applications) restrictions on φ(x)φ(x) and f(x),(x), the theorem was proved by A. A. Karatsuba in [8] (see also,[9][10]). Certain
