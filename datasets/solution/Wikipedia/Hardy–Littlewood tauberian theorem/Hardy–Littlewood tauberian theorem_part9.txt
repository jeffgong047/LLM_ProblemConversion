theorem: In 1915 Hardy and Littlewood developed a proof of the prime number theorem based on their Tauberian theorem; they proved ∑n=2∞Λ(n)e−ny∼1y,∑_n=2^∞Λ(n)e^-ny∼1/y, where ΛΛ is the von Mangoldt function, and then conclude ∑n≤xΛ(n)∼x,∑_nΛ(n), an equivalent form of the prime number theorem.[5]: 34–35 [6]: 302–307 Littlewood developed a simpler proof, still based on this Tauberian theorem, in 1971.[6]: 307–309
