theorem: Main article: Littlewood's Tauberian theorem In 1911 Littlewood proved an extension of Tauber's converse of Abel's theorem. Littlewood showed the following: If an=O(1/n)_n=O(1/n), and we have ∑anxn→sasx↑1_nx^n{as↑1 then ∑an=s._n=s. This came historically before the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem, but can be proved as a simple application of it.[1]: 233–235 Prime number
