formulation: The following more general formulation is from Feller.[3]: 445 Consider a real-valued function F:[0,∞)→R:[0,∞)→ℝ of bounded variation.[4] The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of F is defined by the Stieltjes integral ω(s)=∫0∞e−stdF(t).ω(s)=∫_0^∞e^-st dF(t). The theorem relates the asymptotics of ω with those of F in the following way. If ρρ is a non-negative real number, then the following statements are equivalent ω(s)∼Cs−ρ,ass→0ω(s)^-ρ, as}s→0 F(t)∼CΓ(ρ+1)tρ,ast→∞.(t)∼C/Γ(ρ+1)t^ρ,{as→∞. Here ΓΓ denotes the Gamma function. One obtains the theorem for series as a special case by taking ρ=1ρ=1 and F(t)(t) to be a piecewise constant function with value ∑k=0nak∑_k=0^na_k between t=n=n and t=n+1=n+1. A slight improvement is possible. According to the definition of a slowly varying function, L(x)(x) is slow varying at infinity iff L(tx)L(x)→1,x→∞L(tx)/L(x)→1,→∞ for every t>0>0. Let L be a function slowly varying at infinity and ρ≥0ρ≥0. Then the following statements are equivalent ω(s)∼s−ρL(s−1),ass→0ω(s)^-ρL(s^-1), as→0 F(t)∼1Γ(ρ+1)tρL(t),ast→∞.(t)∼1/Γ(ρ+1)t^ρL(t), as→∞.
