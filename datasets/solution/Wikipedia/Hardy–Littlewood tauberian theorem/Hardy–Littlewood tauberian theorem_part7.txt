coefficients: The theorem can fail without the condition that the coefficients are non-negative. For example, the function 1(1+x)2(1−x)=1−x+2x2−2x3+3x4−3x5+⋯1/(1+x)^2(1-x)=1-x+2x^2-2x^3+3x^4-3x^5+⋯ is asymptotic to 1/4(1−x)1/4(1-x) as x→1→1, but the partial sums of its coefficients are 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, ... and are not asymptotic to any linear function.
