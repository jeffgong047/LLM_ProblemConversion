proof: Karamata (1930) found a short proof of the theorem by considering the functions g such that limx→1(1−x)∑anxng(xn)=∫01g(t)dtlim_x→1(1-x)_nx^ng(x^n)=∫_0^1g(t)dt An easy calculation shows that all monomials g(x)=xk(x)=x^k have this property, and therefore so do all polynomials g. This can be extended to a function g with simple (step) discontinuities by approximating it by polynomials from above and below (using the Weierstrass approximation theorem and a little extra fudging) and using the fact that the coefficients an_n are positive. In particular the function given by g(t)=1/t(t)=1/t if 1/e<t<11/e<t<1 and 00 otherwise has this property. But then for x−1/N^-1/N the sum ∑anxng(xn)_nx^ng(x^n) is a0+⋯+aN_0+⋯+a_N and the integral of g is 11, from which the Hardy–Littlewood theorem follows immediately.
