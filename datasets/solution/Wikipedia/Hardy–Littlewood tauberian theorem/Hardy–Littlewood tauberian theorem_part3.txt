formulation: This formulation is from Titchmarsh.[1]: 226 Suppose an≥0_n≥0 for all n∈N∈ℕ, and we have ∑n=0∞anxn∼11−xasx↑1.∑_n=0^∞a_nx^n∼1/1-x{as↑1. Then as n→∞→∞ we have ∑k=0nak∼n.∑_k=0^na_k. The theorem is sometimes quoted in equivalent forms, where instead of requiring an≥0_n≥0, we require an=O(1)_n=O(1), or we require an≥−K_n≥-K for some constant K.[2]: 155 The theorem is sometimes quoted in another equivalent formulation (through the change of variable x=1/ey=1/e^y).[2]: 155 If, ∑n=0∞ane−ny∼1yasy↓0∑_n=0^∞a_ne^-ny∼1/y{as↓0 then ∑k=0nak∼n.∑_k=0^na_k.
