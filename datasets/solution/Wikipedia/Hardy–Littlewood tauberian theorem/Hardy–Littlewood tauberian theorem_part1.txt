In mathematical analysis, the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem is a Tauberian theorem relating the asymptotics of the partial sums of a series with the asymptotics of its Abel summation. In this form, the theorem asserts that if the sequence an≥0_n≥0 is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence ∑n=0∞ane−ny∼1yasy↓0∑_n=0^∞a_ne^-ny∼1/y{as↓0 then there is also an asymptotic equivalence ∑k=0nak∼n∑_k=0^na_k as n→∞→∞. The integral formulation of the theorem relates in an analogous manner the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution function of a function with the asymptotics of its Laplace transform. The theorem was proved in 1914 by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood.[1]: 226 In 1930, Jovan Karamata gave a new and much simpler proof.[1]: 226 Statement of the
