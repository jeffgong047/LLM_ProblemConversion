Cross section theorem
Pomeranchuk's theorem, named after Soviet physicist Isaak Pomeranchuk, states that difference of cross sections of interactions of elementary particles κ1+κ2κ_1+κ_2 and κ1+κ2¯κ_1+κ̅_̅2̅ (i. e. particle κ1κ_1 with particle κ2κ_2, and with its antiparticle κ2¯κ̅_̅2̅) approach 0 when s→∞→∞, where s is the energy in center of mass system.
