Complexity: Glueck et al. note that the Bapatâ€’Beg formula is computationally intractable, because it involves an exponential number of permanents of the size of the number of random variables.[3] However, when the random variables have only two possible distributions, the complexity can be reduced to O(m2k)(m^2k).[3] Thus, in the case of two populations, the complexity is polynomial in m for any fixed number of statistics k.
