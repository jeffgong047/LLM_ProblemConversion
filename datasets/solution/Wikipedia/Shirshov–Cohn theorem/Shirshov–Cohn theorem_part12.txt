superalgebras: Jordan superalgebras were introduced by Kac, Kantor and Kaplansky; these are Z/2ℤ/2-graded algebras J0⊕J1_0_1 where J0_0 is a Jordan algebra and J1_1 has a "Lie-like" product with values in J0_0.[8] Any Z/2ℤ/2-graded associative algebra A0⊕A1_0_1 becomes a Jordan superalgebra with respect to the graded Jordan brace xi,yj=xiyj+(−1)ijyjxi.{x_i,y_j}=x_iy_j+(-1)^ijy_jx_i Jordan simple superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 were classified by Kac (1977). They include several families and some exceptional algebras, notably K3_3 and K10_10.
