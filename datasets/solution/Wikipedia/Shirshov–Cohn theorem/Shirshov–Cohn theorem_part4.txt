Examples: 1. The set of self-adjoint real, complex, or quaternionic matrices with multiplication (xy+yx)/2(xy+yx)/2 form a special Jordan algebra. 2. The set of 3Ã—3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions, again with multiplication (xy+yx)/2,(xy+yx)/2, is a 27 dimensional, exceptional Jordan algebra (it is exceptional because the octonions are not associative). This was the first example of an Albert algebra. Its automorphism group is the exceptional Lie group F4. Since over the complex numbers this is the only simple exceptional Jordan algebra up to isomorphism,[5] it is often referred to as "the" exceptional Jordan algebra. Over the real numbers there are three isomorphism classes of simple exceptional Jordan algebras.[5] Derivations and structure
