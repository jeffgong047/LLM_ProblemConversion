theorem: The Malgrange preparation theorem can be restated as a theorem about modules over rings of smooth, real-valued germs. If X is a manifold, with p∈X, let C∞p(X) denote the ring of real-valued germs of smooth functions at p on X. Let Mp(X) denote the unique maximal ideal of C∞p(X), consisting of germs which vanish at p. Let A be a C∞p(X)-module, and let f:X → Y be a smooth function between manifolds. Let q = f(p). f induces a ring homomorphism f*:C∞q(Y) → C∞p(X) by composition on the right with f. Thus we can view A as a C∞q(Y)-module. Then the Malgrange preparation theorem says that if A is a finitely-generated C∞p(X)-module, then A is a finitely-generated C∞q(Y)-module if and only if A/Mq(Y)A is a finite-dimensional real vector space.
