theorem: Suppose that f(t,x) is a smooth complex function of t∈R and x∈Rn near the origin, and let k be the smallest integer such that f(0,0)=0,∂f∂t(0,0)=0,…,∂k−1f∂tk−1(0,0)=0,∂kf∂tk(0,0)≠0.(0,0)=0,(0,0)=0,…,∂^k-1f^k-1(0,0)=0,∂^kf^k(0,0)≠0. Then one form of the preparation theorem states that near the origin f can be written as the product of a smooth function c that is nonzero at the origin and a smooth function that as a function of t is a polynomial of degree k. In other words, f(t,x)=c(t,x)(tk+ak−1(x)tk−1+⋯+a0(x))(t,x)=c(t,x)(t^k+a_k-1(x)t^k-1+⋯+a_0(x)) where the functions c and a are smooth and c is nonzero at the origin. A second form of the theorem, occasionally called the Mather division theorem, is a sort of "division with remainder" theorem: it says that if f and k satisfy the conditions above and g is a smooth function near the origin, then we can write g=qf+r=qf+r where q and r are smooth, and as a function of t, r is a polynomial of degree less than k. This means that r(x)=∑0≤j<ktjrj(x)(x)=∑_0<kt^jr_j(x) for some smooth functions rj(x). The two forms of the theorem easily imply each other: the first form is the special case of the "division with remainder" form where g is tk, and the division with remainder form follows from the first form of the theorem as we may assume that f as a function of t is a polynomial of degree k. If the functions f and g are real, then the functions c, a, q, and r can also be taken to be real. In the case of the Weierstrass preparation theorem these functions are uniquely determined by f and g, but uniqueness no longer holds for the Malgrange preparation theorem.
