Characterizes differential k-forms which are invariant for all Hamiltonian vector fields The Lee Hwa Chung theorem is a theorem in symplectic topology. The statement is as follows. Let M be a symplectic manifold with symplectic form ω. Let αα be a differential k-form on M which is invariant for all Hamiltonian vector fields. Then: If k is odd, α=0.α=0. If k is even, α=c×ω∧k2α=c×ω^∧k/2, where c∈R.∈ℝ.
