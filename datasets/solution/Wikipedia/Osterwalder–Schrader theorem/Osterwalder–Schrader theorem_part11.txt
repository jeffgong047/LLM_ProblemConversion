History: At first, Osterwalder and Schrader claimed a stronger theorem that the axioms (E0)-(E4) by themselves imply the Wightman axioms,[2] however their proof contained an error which could not be corrected without adding extra assumptions. Two years later they published a new theorem, with the linear growth condition added as an assumption, and a correct proof.[4] The new proof is based on a complicated inductive argument (proposed also by Vladimir Glaser),[5] by which the region of analyticity of Schwinger functions is gradually extended towards the Minkowski space, and Wightman distributions are recovered as a limit. The linear growth condition (E0') is crucially used to show that the limit exists and is a tempered distribution. Osterwalder's and Schrader's paper also contains another theorem replacing (E0') by yet another assumption called (E0)ˇ(̌Ě0̌)̌.[4] This other theorem is rarely used, since (E0)ˇ(̌Ě0̌)̌ is hard to check in practice.[3] Other axioms for Schwinger
