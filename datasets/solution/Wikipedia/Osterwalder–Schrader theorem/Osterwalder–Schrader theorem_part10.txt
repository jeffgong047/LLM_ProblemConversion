condition: This condition, called (E0') in,[4] asserts that when the Schwinger function of order n is paired with an arbitrary Schwartz test function f which vanishes at coincident points, we have the following bound: |Sn(f)|≤σn|f|C⋅n,|S_n(f)|≤σ_n|f|_C, where C∈N∈ℕ is an integer constant, |f|C⋅n|f|_C is the Schwartz-space seminorm of order N=C⋅n=C, i.e. |f|N=sup|α|≤N,x∈Rd|(1+|x|)NDαf(x)|,|f|_N=sup_|α|,x∈ℝ^d|(1+|x|)^ND^αf(x)|, and σnσ_n a sequence of constants of factorial growth, i.e. σn≤A(n!)Bσ_n(n!)^B with some constants A,B,B. Linear growth condition is subtle as it has to be satisfied for all Schwinger functions simultaneously. It also has not been derived from the Wightman axioms, so that the system of OS axioms (E0)-(E4) plus the linear growth condition (E0') appears to be stronger than the Wightman axioms.
