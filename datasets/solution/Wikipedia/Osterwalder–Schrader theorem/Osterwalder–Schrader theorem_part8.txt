understanding: One way of (formally) constructing Schwinger functions which satisfy the above properties is through the Euclidean path integral. In particular, Euclidean path integrals (formally) satisfy reflection positivity. Let F be any polynomial functional of the field φ which only depends upon the value of φ(x) for those points x whose τ coordinates are nonnegative. Then ∫DϕF[ϕ(x)]F[ϕ(xθ)]∗e−S[ϕ]=∫Dϕ0∫ϕ+(τ=0)=ϕ0Dϕ+F[ϕ+]e−S+[ϕ+]∫ϕ−(τ=0)=ϕ0Dϕ−F[(ϕ−)θ]∗e−S−[ϕ−].∫𝒟[ϕ(x)]F[ϕ(x^θ)]^*e^-S[ϕ]=∫𝒟ϕ_0∫_ϕ_+(τ=0)=ϕ_0𝒟ϕ_+F[ϕ_+]e^-S_+[ϕ_+]∫_ϕ_-(τ=0)=ϕ_0𝒟ϕ_-F[(ϕ_-)^θ]^*e^-S_-[ϕ_-]. Since the action S is real and can be split into S+_+, which only depends on φ on the positive half-space (ϕ+ϕ_+), and S−_- which only depends upon φ on the negative half-space (ϕ−ϕ_-), and if S also happens to be invariant under the combined action of taking a reflection and complex conjugating all the fields, then the previous quantity has to be nonnegative.
