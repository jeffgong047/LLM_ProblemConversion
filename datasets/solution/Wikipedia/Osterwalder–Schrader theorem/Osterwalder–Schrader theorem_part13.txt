Jaffe: An alternative approach to axiomatization of Euclidean correlators is described by Glimm and Jaffe in their book.[6] In this approach one assumes that one is given a measure dμμ on the space of distributions ϕ∈D′(Rd)ϕ'(ℝ^d). One then considers a generating functional S(f)=∫eϕ(f)dμ,f∈D(Rd)(f)=^ϕ(f)dμ,(ℝ^d) which is assumed to satisfy properties OS0-OS4: (OS0) Analyticity. This asserts that z=(z1,…,zn)↦S(∑i=1nzifi)=(z_1,…,z_n)(∑_i=1^nz_if_i) is an entire-analytic function of z∈Rn∈ℝ^n for any collection of n compactly supported test functions fi∈D(Rd)_i(ℝ^d). Intuitively, this means that the measure dμμ decays faster than any exponential. (OS1) Regularity. This demands a growth bound for S(f)(f) in terms of f, such as|S(f)|≤exp⁡(C∫ddx|f(x)|)|S(f)|≤exp(C^dx|f(x)|). See [6] for the precise condition. (OS2) Euclidean invariance. This says that the functional S(f)(f) is invariant under Euclidean transformations f(x)↦f(Rx+b)(x)(Rx+b). (OS3) Reflection positivity. Take a finite sequence of test functions fi∈D(Rd)_i(ℝ^d) which are all supported in the upper half-space i.e. at x0>0^0>0. Denote by θfi(x)=fi(θx)_i(x)=f_i() where θθ is a reflection operation defined above. This axioms says that the matrix Mij=S(fi+θfj)_ij=S(f_i+_j) has to be positive semidefinite. (OS4) Ergodicity. The time translation semigroup acts ergodically on the measure space (D′(Rd),dμ)(D'(ℝ^d),dμ). See [6] for the precise condition. Relation to Osterwalder–Schrader
