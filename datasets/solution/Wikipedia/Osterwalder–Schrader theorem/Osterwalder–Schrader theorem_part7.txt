positivity: Positivity axioms (E2) asserts the following property called (Osterwalder–Schrader) reflection positivity. Pick any arbitrary coordinate τ and pick a test function fN with N points as its arguments. Assume fN has its support in the "time-ordered" subset of N points with 0 < τ1 < ... < τN. Choose one such fN for each positive N, with the f's being zero for all N larger than some integer M. Given a point x, let xθ^θ be the reflected point about the τ = 0 hyperplane. Then, ∑m,n∫ddx1⋯ddxmddy1⋯ddynSm+n(x1,…,xm,y1,…,yn)fm(x1θ,…,xmθ)∗fn(y1,…,yn)≥0∑_m,n^dx_1^dx_m d^dy_1^dy_nS_m+n(x_1,…,x_m,y_1,…,y_n)f_m(x_1^θ,…,x_m^θ)^*f_n(y_1,…,y_n)≥0 where * represents complex conjugation. Sometimes in theoretical physics literature reflection positivity is stated as the requirement that the Schwinger function of arbitrary even order should be non-negative if points are inserted symmetrically with respect to the τ=0τ=0 hyperplane: S2n(x1,…,xn,xnθ,…,x1θ)≥0_2n(x_1,…,x_n,x_n^θ,…,x_1^θ)≥0. This property indeed follows from the reflection positivity but it is weaker than full reflection positivity. Intuitive
