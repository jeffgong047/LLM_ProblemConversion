Symmetry: Symmetry axiom (E3) says that Schwinger functions are invariant under permutations of points: Sn(x1,…,xn)=Sn(xπ(1),…,xπ(n))_n(x_1,…,x_n)=S_n(x_π(1),…,x_π(n)), where ππ is an arbitrary permutation of 1,…,n{1,…,n}. Schwinger functions of fermionic fields are instead antisymmetric; for them this equation would have a ± sign equal to the signature of the permutation. Cluster
