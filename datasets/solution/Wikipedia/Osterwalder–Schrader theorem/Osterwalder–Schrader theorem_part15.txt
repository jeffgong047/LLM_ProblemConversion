axioms: These axioms were proposed by Edward Nelson.[7] See also their description in the book of Barry Simon.[8] Like in the above axioms by Glimm and Jaffe, one assumes that the field ϕ∈D′(Rd)ϕ'(ℝ^d) is a random distribution with a measure dμμ. This measure is sufficiently regular so that the field ϕϕ has regularity of a Sobolev space of negative derivative order. The crucial feature of these axioms is to consider the field restricted to a surface. One of the axioms is Markov property, which formalizes the intuitive notion that the state of the field inside a closed surface depends only on the state of the field on the surface. See
