axioms: Although the above axioms were named by Glimm and Jaffe (OS0)-(OS4) in honor of Osterwalder and Schrader, they are not equivalent to the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms. Given (OS0)-(OS4), one can define Schwinger functions of ϕϕ as moments of the measure dμμ, and show that these moments satisfy Osterwalder–Schrader axioms (E0)-(E4) and also the linear growth conditions (E0'). Then one can appeal to the Osterwalder–Schrader theorem to show that Wightman functions are tempered distributions. Alternatively, and much easier, one can derive Wightman axioms directly from (OS0)-(OS4).[6] Note however that the full quantum field theory will contain infinitely many other local operators apart from ϕϕ, such as ϕ2ϕ^2, ϕ4ϕ^4 and other composite operators built from ϕϕ and its derivatives. It's not easy to extract these Schwinger functions from the measure dμμ and show that they satisfy OS axioms, as it should be the case. To summarize, the axioms called (OS0)-(OS4) by Glimm and Jaffe are stronger than the OS axioms as far as the correlators of the field ϕϕ are concerned, but weaker than then the full set of OS axioms since they don't say much about correlators of composite operators.
