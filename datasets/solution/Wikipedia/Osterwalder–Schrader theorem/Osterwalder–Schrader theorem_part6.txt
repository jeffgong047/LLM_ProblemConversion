property: Cluster property (E4) says that Schwinger function Sp+q_p+q reduces to the product SpSq_pS_q if two groups of points are separated from each other by a large constant translation: limb→∞Sp+q(x1,…,xp,xp+1+b,…,xp+q+b)=Sp(x1,…,xp)Sq(xp+1,…,xp+q)lim_b→∞S_p+q(x_1,…,x_p,x_p+1+b,…,x_p+q+b)=S_p(x_1,…,x_p)S_q(x_p+1,…,x_p+q). The limit is understood in the sense of distributions. There is also a technical assumption that the two groups of points lie on two sides of the x0=0^0=0 hyperplane, while the vector b is parallel to it: x10,…,xp0>0,xp+10,…,xp+q0<0,b0=0._1^0,…,x_p^0>0,_p+1^0,…,x_p+q^0<0,^0=0.
