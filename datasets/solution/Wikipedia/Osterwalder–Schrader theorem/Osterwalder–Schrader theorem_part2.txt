axioms: Here we describe Osterwalder–Schrader (OS) axioms for a Euclidean quantum field theory of a Hermitian scalar field ϕ(x)ϕ(x), x∈Rd∈ℝ^d. Note that a typical quantum field theory will contain infinitely many local operators, including also composite operators, and their correlators should also satisfy OS axioms similar to the ones described below. The Schwinger functions of ϕϕ are denoted as Sn(x1,…,xn)≡⟨ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)…ϕ(xn)⟩,xk∈Rd._n(x_1,…,x_n)≡⟨ϕ(x_1)ϕ(x_2)…ϕ(x_n)⟩,_k∈ℝ^d. OS axioms from [2] are numbered (E0)-(E4) and have the following meaning: (E0) Temperedness (E1) Euclidean covariance (E2) Positivity (E3) Symmetry (E4) Cluster property
