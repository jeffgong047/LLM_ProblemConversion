covariance: Euclidean covariance axiom (E1) says that Schwinger functions transform covariantly under rotations and translations, namely: Sn(x1,…,xn)=Sn(Rx1+b,…,Rxn+b)_n(x_1,…,x_n)=S_n(Rx_1+b,…,Rx_n+b) for an arbitrary rotation matrix R∈SO(d)(d) and an arbitrary translation vector b∈Rd∈ℝ^d. OS axioms can be formulated for Schwinger functions of fields transforming in arbitrary representations of the rotation group.[2][3]
