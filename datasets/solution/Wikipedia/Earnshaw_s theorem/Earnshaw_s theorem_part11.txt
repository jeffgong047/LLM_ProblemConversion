lines: The case of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic dipole is considered first. The energy is given by U=−k|B|2=−k(Bx2+By2+Bz2).=-k|𝐁|^2=-k(B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2). Expanding and rearranging terms, ∇2|B|2=∇2(Bx2+By2+Bz2)=2(|∇Bx|2+|∇By|2+|∇Bz|2+Bx∇2Bx+By∇2By+Bz∇2Bz)∇^2|𝐁|^2 =∇^2(B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2) =2(|_x|^2+|_y|^2+|_z|^2+B_x∇^2B_x+B_y∇^2B_y+B_z∇^2B_z) but since the Laplacian of each individual component of the magnetic field is zero, ∇2|B|2=2(|∇Bx|2+|∇By|2+|∇Bz|2);∇^2|𝐁|^2=2(|_x|^2+|_y|^2+|_z|^2); and since the square of a magnitude is always positive, ∇2|B|2≥0.∇^2|𝐁|^2≥0. As discussed above, this means that the Laplacian of the energy of a paramagnetic material can never be positive (no stable levitation) and the Laplacian of the energy of a diamagnetic material can never be negative (no instability in all directions). Further, because the energy for a dipole of fixed magnitude aligned with the external field will be the square root of the energy above, the same analysis applies.
