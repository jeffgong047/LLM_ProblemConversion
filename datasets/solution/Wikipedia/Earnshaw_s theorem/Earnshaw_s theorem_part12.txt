field: It is proven here that the Laplacian of each individual component of a magnetic field is zero. This shows the need to invoke the properties of magnetic fields that the divergence of a magnetic field is always zero and the curl of a magnetic field is zero in free space. (That is, in the absence of current or a changing electric field.) See Maxwell's equations for a more detailed discussion of these properties of magnetic fields. Consider the Laplacian of the x component of the magnetic field ∇2Bx=∂2Bx∂x2+∂2Bx∂y2+∂2Bx∂z2=∂∂x∂Bx∂x+∂∂y∂Bx∂y+∂∂z∂Bx∂z∇^2B_x =∂^2B_x/^2+∂^2B_x/^2+∂^2B_x/^2 =∂/_x/+∂/_x/+∂/_x/ Because the curl of B is zero, ∂Bx∂y=∂By∂x,_x/=_y/, and ∂Bx∂z=∂Bz∂x,_x/=_z/, so we have ∇2Bx=∂∂x∂Bx∂x+∂∂y∂By∂x+∂∂z∂Bz∂x.∇^2B_x=∂/_x/+∂/_y/+∂/_z/. But since Bx is continuous, the order of differentiation doesn't matter giving ∇2Bx=∂∂x(∂Bx∂x+∂By∂y+∂Bz∂z)=∂∂x(∇⋅B).∇^2B_x=∂(_x+_y+_z)=∂(∇·𝐁). The divergence of B is zero, ∇⋅B=0,∇·𝐁=0, so ∇2Bx=∂∂x(∇⋅B)=0.∇^2B_x=∂(∇·𝐁)=0. The Laplacian of the y component of the magnetic field By field and the Laplacian of the z component of the magnetic field Bz can be calculated analogously. Alternatively, one can use the identity ∇2B=∇(∇⋅B)−∇×(∇×B),∇^2𝐁=∇(∇·𝐁)-∇×(∇×𝐁), where both terms in the parentheses vanish. See
