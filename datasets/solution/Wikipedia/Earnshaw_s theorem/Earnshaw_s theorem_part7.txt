Background: The proofs considered here are based on the following principles. The energy U of a magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment M in an external magnetic field B is given by U=−M⋅B=−(MxBx+MyBy+MzBz).=-𝐌·𝐁=-(M_xB_x+M_yB_y+M_zB_z). The dipole will only be stably levitated at points where the energy has a minimum. The energy can only have a minimum at points where the Laplacian of the energy is greater than zero. That is, where ∇2U=∂2U∂x2+∂2U∂y2+∂2U∂z2>0.∇^2U=∂^2U/^2+∂^2U/^2+∂^2U/^2>0. Finally, because both the divergence and the curl of a magnetic field are zero (in the absence of current or a changing electric field), the Laplacians of the individual components of a magnetic field are zero. That is, ∇2Bx=∇2By=∇2Bz=0.∇^2B_x=∇^2B_y=∇^2B_z=0. This is proven at the very end of this article as it is central to understanding the overall proof. Summary of
