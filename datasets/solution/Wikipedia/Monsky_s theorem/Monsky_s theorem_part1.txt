One can't dissect a square into an odd number of triangles of equal area In geometry, Monsky's theorem states that it is not possible to dissect a square into an odd number of triangles of equal area.[1] In other words, a square does not have an odd equidissection. The problem was posed by Fred Richman in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1965, and was proved by Paul Monsky in 1970.[2][3][4]
