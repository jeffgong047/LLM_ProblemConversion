Proof: Monsky's proof combines combinatorial and algebraic techniques, and in outline is as follows: A square can be divided into an even number of triangles of equal area (left), but into an odd number of only approximately equal area triangles (right). Take the square to be the unit square with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). If there is a dissection into n triangles of equal area then the area of each triangle is 1/n. Colour each point in the square with one of three colours, depending on the 2-adic valuation of its coordinates. Show that a straight line can contain points of only two colours. Use Sperner's lemma to show that every triangulation of the square into triangles meeting edge-to-edge must contain at least one triangle whose vertices have three different colours. Conclude from the straight-line property that a tricolored triangle must also exist in every dissection of the square into triangles, not necessarily meeting edge-to-edge. Use Cartesian geometry to show that the 2-adic valuation of the area of a triangle whose vertices have three different colours is greater than 1. So every dissection of the square into triangles must contain at least one triangle whose area has a 2-adic valuation greater than 1. If n is odd then the 2-adic valuation of 1/n is 1, so it is impossible to dissect the square into triangles all of which have area 1/n.[5] Optimal
