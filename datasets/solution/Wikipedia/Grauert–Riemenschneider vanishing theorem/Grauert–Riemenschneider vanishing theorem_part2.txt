conjecture: The Grauert–Riemenschneider conjecture is a conjecture related to the Grauert–Riemenschneider vanishing theorem: Grauert & Riemenschneider (1970a); Let M be an n-dimensional compact complex manifold. M is Moishezon if and only if there exists a smooth Hermitian line bundle L over M whose curvature form which is semi-positive everywhere and positive on an open dense set.[1] This conjecture was proved by Siu (1985) using the Riemann–Roch type theorem (Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem) and by Demailly (1985) using Morse theory.
