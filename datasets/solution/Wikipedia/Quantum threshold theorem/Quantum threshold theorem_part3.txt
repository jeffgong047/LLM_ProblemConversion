practice: Current estimates put the threshold for the surface code on the order of 1%,[8] though estimates range widely and are difficult to calculate due to the exponential difficulty of simulating large quantum systems.[citation needed][a] At a 0.1% probability of a depolarizing error, the surface code would require approximately 1,000-10,000 physical qubits per logical data qubit,[9] though more pathological error types could change this figure drastically.[further explanation needed] See
