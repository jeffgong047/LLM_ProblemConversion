Notes: ^ It is widely believed that it is exponentially difficult for classical computers to simulate quantum systems. This problem is known as the quantum many body problem. However, quantum computers can simulate many (though not all) Hamiltonians in polynomial time with bounded errors, which is one of the main appeals of quantum computing. This is applicable to chemical simulations, drug discovery, energy production, climate modeling and fertilizer production (e.g. FeMoco) as well. Because of this, quantum computers may be better than classical computers at aiding design of further quantum computers.
