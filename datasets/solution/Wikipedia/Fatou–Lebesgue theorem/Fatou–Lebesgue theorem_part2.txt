theorem: Let f1, f2, ... denote a sequence of real-valued measurable functions defined on a measure space (S,Σ,μ). If there exists a Lebesgue-integrable function g on S which dominates the sequence in absolute value, meaning that |fn| ≤ g for all natural numbers n, then all fn as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the fn are integrable and ∫Sliminfn→∞fndμ≤liminfn→∞∫Sfndμ≤limsupn→∞∫Sfndμ≤∫Slimsupn→∞fndμ.∫_Slim inf_n→∞f_n dμ≤lim inf_n→∞∫_Sf_n dμ≤lim sup_n→∞∫_Sf_n dμ≤∫_Slim sup_n→∞f_n dμ . Here the limit inferior and the limit superior of the fn are taken pointwise. The integral of the absolute value of these limiting functions is bounded above by the integral of g. Since the middle inequality (for sequences of real numbers) is always true, the directions of the other inequalities are easy to remember.
