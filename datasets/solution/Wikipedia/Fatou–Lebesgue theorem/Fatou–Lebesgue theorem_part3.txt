Proof: All fn as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the fn are measurable and dominated in absolute value by g, hence integrable. The first inequality follows by applying Fatou's lemma to the non-negative functions fn + g and using the linearity of the Lebesgue integral. The last inequality is the reverse Fatou lemma. Since g also dominates the limit superior of the |fn|, 0≤|∫Sliminfn→∞fndμ|≤∫S|liminfn→∞fn|dμ≤∫Slimsupn→∞|fn|dμ≤∫Sgdμ0≤|∫_Slim inf_n→∞f_n dμ|≤∫_S|lim inf_n→∞f_n| dμ≤∫_Slim sup_n→∞|f_n| dμ≤∫_Sg dμ by the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral. The same estimates hold for the limit superior of the fn.
