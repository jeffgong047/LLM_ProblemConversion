values: In one dimension, a simple case of the edge-of-the-wedge theorem can be stated as follows. Suppose that f is a continuous complex-valued function on the complex plane that is holomorphic on the upper half-plane, and on the lower half-plane. Then it is holomorphic everywhere. In this example, the two wedges are the upper half-plane and the lower half plane, and their common edge is the real axis. This result can be proved from Morera's theorem. Indeed, a function is holomorphic provided its integral round any contour vanishes; a contour which crosses the real axis can be broken up into contours in the upper and lower half-planes and the integral round these vanishes by hypothesis.[5][6] Distributional boundary values on a
