circle: The more general case is phrased in terms of distributions.[7][8] This is technically simplest in the case where the common boundary is the unit circle |z|=1|z|=1 in the complex plane. In that case holomorphic functions f, g in the regions r<|z|<1<|z|<1 and 1<|z|<R1<|z|<R have Laurent expansions f(z)=∑−∞∞anzn,g(z)=∑−∞∞bnzn(z)=∑_-∞^∞a_nz^n, g(z)=∑_-∞^∞b_nz^n absolutely convergent in the same regions and have distributional boundary values given by the formal Fourier series f(θ)=∑−∞∞aneinθ,g(θ)=∑−∞∞bneinθ.(θ)=∑_-∞^∞a_ne^inθ, g(θ)=∑_-∞^∞b_ne^inθ. Their distributional boundary values are equal if an=bn_n=b_n for all n. It is then elementary that the common Laurent series converges absolutely in the whole region r<|z|<R<|z|<R. Distributional boundary values on an
