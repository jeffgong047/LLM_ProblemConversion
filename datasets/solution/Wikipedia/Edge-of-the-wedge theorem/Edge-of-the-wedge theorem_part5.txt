interval: In general given an open interval I=(a,b)=(a,b) on the real axis and holomorphic functions f+,f−_+, _- defined in (a,b)×(0,R)(a,b)×(0,R) and (a,b)×(−R,0)(a,b)×(-R,0) satisfying |f±(x+iy)|<C|y|−N|f_±(x+iy)|<C|y|^-N for some non-negative integer N, the boundary values T±_± of f±_± can be defined as distributions on the real axis by the formulas[9][8] ⟨T±,φ⟩=limε↓0∫f(x±iε)φ(x)dx._±,φ⟩=lim_ε↓0(xε)φ(x) dx. Existence can be proved by noting that, under the hypothesis, f±(z)_±(z) is the (N+1)(N+1)-th complex derivative of a holomorphic function which extends to a continuous function on the boundary. If f is defined as f±_± above and below the real axis and F is the distribution defined on the rectangle (a,b)×(−R,R)(a,b)×(-R,R) by the formula ⟨F,φ⟩=∬f(x+iy)φ(x,y)dxdy,,φ⟩=(x+iy)φ(x,y) dx dy, then F equals f±_± off the real axis and the distribution Fz¯_z is induced by the distribution 12(T+−T−)12(T_+-T_-) on the real axis. In particular if the hypotheses of the edge-of-the-wedge theorem apply, i.e. T+=T−_+=T_-, then Fz¯=0._z=0. By elliptic regularity it then follows that the function F is holomorphic in (a,b)×(−R,R)(a,b)×(-R,R). In this case elliptic regularity can be deduced directly from the fact that (πz)−1()^-1 is known to provide a fundamental solution for the Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂/∂z¯∂/∂z.[10] Using the Cayley transform between the circle and the real line, this argument can be rephrased in a standard way in terms of Fourier series and Sobolev spaces on the circle. Indeed, let f and g be holomorphic functions defined exterior and interior to some arc on the unit circle such that locally they have radial limits in some Sobolev space, Then, letting D=z∂∂z,=z∂, the equations DkF=f,DkG=g^kF=f, D^kG=g can be solved locally in such a way that the radial limits of G and F tend locally to the same function in a higher Sobolev space. For k large enough, this convergence is uniform by the Sobolev embedding theorem. By the argument for continuous functions, F and G therefore patch to give a holomorphic function near the arc and hence so do f and g. The general
