case: A wedge is a product of a cone with some set. Let C be an open cone in the real vector space Rnℝ^n, with vertex at the origin. Let E be an open subset of Rnℝ^n, called the edge. Write W for the wedge E×iC in the complex vector space Cnℂ^n, and write W' for the opposite wedge E×−iC×-iC. Then the two wedges W and W' meet at the edge E, where we identify E with the product of E with the tip of the cone. Suppose that f is a continuous function on the union W∪E∪W′' that is holomorphic on both the wedges W and W' . Then the edge-of-the-wedge theorem says that f is also holomorphic on E (or more precisely, it can be extended to a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of E). The conditions for the theorem to be true can be weakened. It is not necessary to assume that f is defined on the whole of the wedges: it is enough to assume that it is defined near the edge. It is also not necessary to assume that f is defined or continuous on the edge: it is sufficient to assume that the functions defined on either of the wedges have the same distributional boundary values on the edge.
