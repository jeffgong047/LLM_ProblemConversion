Proof: This proof comes from an exercise in Fritz Carlson’s book “Geometri” (in Swedish, 1943).[1] Proof Given any a,b∈C,b∈ℂ with a≠0≠0, define g(z)=f(az+b)(z)=f(az+b), then g′(z)=af′(az+b)'(z)=af'(az+b). Thus, we have g−1(0)=(f−1(0)−b)/a^-1(0)=(f^-1(0)-b)/a and similarly for g′' and f′'. In other words, by a linear change of variables, we may perform arbitrary translation, rotation, and scaling on the roots of f and f′'. Thus, WLOG, we let the Steiner inellipse's focal points be on the real axis, at ±c, where c is the focal length. Let a,b,b be the long and short semiaxis lengths, so that c=a2−b2=√(a^2-b^2). Let the three roots of f be zj:=xj+yji_j:=x_j+y_ji for j=0,1,2=0,1,2. Horizontally stretch the complex plane so that the Steiner inellipse becomes a circle of radius b. This would transform the triangle into an equilateral triangle, with vertices ζj=baxj+yjiζ_j=b/ax_j+y_ji. By geometry of the equilateral triangle, ∑jζj=0∑_jζ_j=0, we have ∑jzj=0∑_jz_j=0, thus f(z)=z3+z∑jzjzj+1−z0z1z2(z)=z^3+z∑_jz_jz_j+1-z_0z_1z_2 by Vieta's formulas (for notational cleanness, we "loop back" the indices, that is, z3=z0_3=z_0.). Now it remains to show that 3c2+∑jzjzj+1=03c^2+∑_jz_jz_j+1=0, Since 0=(∑jzj)2=∑jzj2+2∑jzjzj+10=(∑_jz_j)^2=∑_jz_j^2+2∑_jz_jz_j+1, it remains to show ∑jzj2=6c2∑_jz_j^2=6c^2, that is, it remains to show ∑jxjyj=0;∑jxj2−yj2=6(a2−b2)∑_jx_jy_j=0; ∑_jx_j^2-y_j^2=6(a^2-b^2) By the geometry of the equilateral triangle, we have ∑jζj2=0∑_jζ_j^2=0, and |ζj|=2b|ζ_j|=2b for each j, which implies ∑j2baxjyj=0;∑jb2a2xj2−yj2=0;∑jb2a2xj2+yj2=12b2∑_j2b/ax_jy_j=0; ∑_jb^2/a^2x_j^2-y_j^2=0; ∑_jb^2/a^2x_j^2+y_j^2=12b^2 which yields the desired equalities.
