case: The statement of Kunihiko Kodaira's result is that if M is a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension n, L any holomorphic line bundle on M that is positive, and KM is the canonical line bundle, then Hq(M,KM⊗L)=0^q(M,K_M)=0 for q > 0. Here KM⊗L_M stands for the tensor product of line bundles. By means of Serre duality, one also obtains the vanishing of Hq(M,L⊗−1)^q(M,L^⊗-1) for q < n. There is a generalisation, the Kodaira–Nakano vanishing theorem, in which KM⊗L≅Ωn(L)_M≅Ω^n(L), where Ωn(L) denotes the sheaf of holomorphic (n,0)-forms on M with values on L, is replaced by Ωr(L), the sheaf of holomorphic (r,0)-forms with values on L. Then the cohomology group Hq(M, Ωr(L)) vanishes whenever q + r > n. The algebraic
