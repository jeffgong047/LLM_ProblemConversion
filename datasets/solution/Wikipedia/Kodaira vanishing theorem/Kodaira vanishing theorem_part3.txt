case: The Kodaira vanishing theorem can be formulated within the language of algebraic geometry without any reference to transcendental methods such as Kähler metrics. Positivity of the line bundle L translates into the corresponding invertible sheaf being ample (i.e., some tensor power gives a projective embedding). The algebraic Kodaira–Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem is the following statement: If k is a field of characteristic zero, X is a smooth and projective k-scheme of dimension d, and L is an ample invertible sheaf on X, then Hq(X,L⊗ΩX/kp)=0forp+q>d,and^q(X,L⊗Ω_X/k^p)=0forp+q>d,and Hq(X,L⊗−1⊗ΩX/kp)=0forp+q<d,^q(X,L^⊗-1⊗Ω_X/k^p)=0forp+q<d, where the Ωp denote the sheaves of relative (algebraic) differential forms (see Kähler differential). Raynaud (1978) showed that this result does not always hold over fields of characteristic p > 0, and in particular fails for Raynaud surfaces. Later Sommese (1986) give a counterexample for singular varieties with non-log canonical singularities,[1] and also,Lauritzen & Rao (1997) gave elementary counterexamples inspired by proper homogeneous spaces with non-reduced stabilizers. Until 1987 the only known proof in characteristic zero was however based on the complex analytic proof and the GAGA comparison theorems. However, in 1987 Pierre Deligne and Luc Illusie gave a purely algebraic proof of the vanishing theorem in (Deligne & Illusie 1987). Their proof is based on showing that the Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence for algebraic de Rham cohomology degenerates in degree 1. This is shown by lifting a corresponding more specific result from characteristic p > 0 — the positive-characteristic result does not hold without limitations but can be lifted to provide the full result.
