sketch: One possible proof outline is as follows. If E is finite, it suffices to take f(z)=∑a∈Epa(z)(z)=∑_ap_a(z). If E is not finite, consider the finite sum SF(z)=∑a∈Fpa(z)_F(z)=∑_ap_a(z) where F is a finite subset of E. While the SF(z)_F(z) may not converge as F approaches E, one may subtract well-chosen rational functions with poles outside of U (provided by Runge's theorem) without changing the principal parts of the SF(z)_F(z) and in such a way that convergence is guaranteed.
