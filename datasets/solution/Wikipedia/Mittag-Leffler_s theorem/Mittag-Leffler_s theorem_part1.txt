In complex analysis, Mittag-Leffler's theorem concerns the existence of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles. Conversely, it can be used to express any meromorphic function as a sum of partial fractions. It is sister to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which asserts existence of holomorphic functions with prescribed zeros. The theorem is named after the Swedish mathematician GÃ¶sta Mittag-Leffler who published versions of the theorem in 1876 and 1884.[1][2][3]
