Theorem: Let U be an open set in Cℂ and E⊂U be a subset whose limit points, if any, occur on the boundary of U. For each a in E, let pa(z)_a(z) be a polynomial in 1/(z−a)1/(z-a) without constant coefficient, i.e. of the form pa(z)=∑n=1Naca,n(z−a)n._a(z)=∑_n=1^N_ac_a,n/(z-a)^n. Then there exists a meromorphic function f on U whose poles are precisely the elements of E and such that for each such pole a∈E, the function f(z)−pa(z)(z)-p_a(z) has only a removable singularity at a; in particular, the principal part of f at a is pa(z)_a(z). Furthermore, any other meromorphic function g on U with these properties can be obtained as g=f+h=f+h, where h is an arbitrary holomorphic function on U. Proof
