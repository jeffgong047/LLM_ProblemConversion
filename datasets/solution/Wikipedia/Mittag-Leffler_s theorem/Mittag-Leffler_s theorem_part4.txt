Example: Suppose that we desire a meromorphic function with simple poles of residue 1 at all positive integers. With notation as above, letting pk(z)=1z−k_k(z)=1/z-k and E=Z+=ℤ^+, Mittag-Leffler's theorem asserts the existence of a meromorphic function f with principal part pk(z)_k(z) at z=k=k for each positive integer k. More constructively we can let f(z)=z∑k=1∞1k(z−k).(z)=z∑_k=1^∞1/k(z-k). This series converges normally on any compact subset of C∖Z+ℂ∖ℤ^+ (as can be shown using the M-test) to a meromorphic function with the desired properties. Pole expansions of meromorphic
