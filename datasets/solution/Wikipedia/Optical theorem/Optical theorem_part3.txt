Derivation: The theorem can be derived rather directly from a treatment of a scalar wave. If a plane wave is incident along positive z axis on an object, then the wave scattering amplitude a great distance away from the scatterer is approximately given by ψ(r)≈eikz+f(θ)eikrr.ψ(𝐫)^ikz+f(θ)e^ikr/r. All higher terms, when squared, vanish more quickly than 1/r21/r^2, and so are negligible a great distance away. For large values of z and for small angles, a Taylor expansion gives us r=x2+y2+z2≈z+x2+y22z.=√(x^2+y^2+z^2)+x^2+y^2/2z. We would now like to use the fact that the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude ψψ. Approximating 1/r1/r as 1/z1/z, we have |ψ|2≈|eikz+f(θ)zeikzeik(x2+y2)/2z|2=1+f(θ)zeik(x2+y2)/2z+f∗(θ)ze−ik(x2+y2)/2z+|f(θ)|2z2.|ψ|^2 ≈|e^ikz+f(θ)/ze^ikze^ik(x^2+y^2)/2z|^2 =1+f(θ)/ze^ik(x^2+y^2)/2z+f^*(θ)/ze^-ik(x^2+y^2)/2z+|f(θ)|^2/z^2. If we drop the 1/z21/z^2 term and use the fact that c+c∗=2Re⁡c+c^*=2Rec, we have |ψ|2≈1+2Re⁡[f(θ)zeik(x2+y2)/2z].|ψ|^2≈1+2Re[f(θ)/ze^ik(x^2+y^2)/2z]. Now suppose we integrate over a screen far away in the xy plane, which is small enough for the small-angle approximations to be appropriate, but large enough that we can integrate the intensity over −∞-∞ to ∞∞ in x and y with negligible error. In optics, this is equivalent to summing over many fringes of the diffraction pattern. By the method of stationary phase, we can approximate f(θ)=f(0)(θ)=f(0) in the below integral. We obtain ∫|ψ|2dxdy≈A+2Re⁡[f(0)z∫−∞∞eikx2/2zdx∫−∞∞eiky2/2zdy],∫|ψ|^2 dx dy+2Re[f(0)/z∫_-∞^∞e^ikx^2/2zdx∫_-∞^∞e^iky^2/2zdy], where A is the area of the surface integrated over. Although these are improper integrals, by suitable substitutions the exponentials can be transformed into complex Gaussians and the definite integrals evaluated resulting in: ∫|ψ|2da=A+2Re⁡[f(0)z2πizk]=A−4πkIm⁡[f(0)].∫|ψ|^2 da =A+2Re[f(0)/z 2/k] =A-4π/k Im[f(0)]. This is the probability of reaching the screen if none were scattered, lessened by an amount (4π/k)Im⁡[f(0)](4π/k)Im[f(0)], which is therefore the effective scattering cross section of the scatterer.
