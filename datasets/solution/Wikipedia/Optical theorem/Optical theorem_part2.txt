History: The optical theorem was originally developed independently by Wolfgang Sellmeier[3] and Lord Rayleigh in 1871.[4] Lord Rayleigh recognized the zero-angle scattering amplitude in terms of the index of refraction as n=1+2πNf(0)k2=1+2πNf(0)/k^2 (where N is the number density of scatterers), which he used in a study of the color and polarization of the sky. The equation was later extended to quantum scattering theory by several individuals, and came to be known as the Bohr–Peierls–Placzek relation after a 1939 paper. It was first referred to as the "optical theorem" in print in 1955 by Hans Bethe and Frederic de Hoffmann, after it had been known as a "well known theorem of optics" for some time.
