theorem: Suppose that M is a compact oriented manifold of dimension n=2r=2r. If we take ΛevenΛ^even to be the sum of the even exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, and ΛoddΛ^odd to be the sum of the odd powers, define D=d+d∗=d+d^*, considered as a map from ΛevenΛ^even to ΛoddΛ^odd. Then the analytical index of D is the Euler characteristic χ(M)χ(M) of the Hodge cohomology of M, and the topological index is the integral of the Euler class over the manifold. The index formula for this operator yields the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem. The concrete computation goes as follows: according to one variation of the splitting principle, if E is a real vector bundle of dimension n=2r=2r, in order to prove assertions involving characteristic classes, we may suppose that there are complex line bundles l1,…,lr_1, …, l_r such that E⊗C=l1⊕l1¯⊕⋯lr⊕lr¯⊗ℂ=l_1⊕l_1⊕_r⊕l_r. Therefore, we can consider the Chern roots xi(E⊗C)=c1(li)_i(E⊗ℂ)=c_1(l_i), xr+i(E⊗C)=c1(li¯)=−xi(E⊗C)_r+i(E⊗ℂ)=c_1(l_i)=-x_i(E⊗ℂ), i=1,…,r=1, …, r. Using Chern roots as above and the standard properties of the Euler class, we have that e(TM)=∏irxi(TM⊗C)(TM)=∏_i^rx_i(TM⊗ℂ).
