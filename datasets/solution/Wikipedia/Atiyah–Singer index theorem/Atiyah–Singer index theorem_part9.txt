theorem: Due to (Teleman 1983), (Teleman 1984): For any abstract elliptic operator (Atiyah 1970) on a closed, oriented, topological manifold, the analytical index equals the topological index. The proof of this result goes through specific considerations, including the extension of Hodge theory on combinatorial and Lipschitz manifolds (Teleman 1980), (Teleman 1983), the extension of Atiyah–Singer's signature operator to Lipschitz manifolds (Teleman 1983), Kasparov's K-homology (Kasparov 1972) and topological cobordism (Kirby & Siebenmann 1977). This result shows that the index theorem is not merely a differentiability statement, but rather a topological statement. Connes–Donaldson–Sullivan–Teleman index
