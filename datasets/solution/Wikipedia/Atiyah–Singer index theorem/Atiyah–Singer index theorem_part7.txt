Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch: The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem was one of the main motivations behind the index theorem because the index theorem is the counterpart of this theorem in the setting of real manifolds. Now, if there's a map f:X→Y:X of compact stably almost complex manifolds, then there is a commutative diagram[28]if Y=∗=* is a point, then we recover the statement above. Here K(X)(X) is the Grothendieck group of complex vector bundles. This commutative diagram is formally very similar to the GRR theorem because the cohomology groups on the right are replaced by the Chow ring of a smooth variety, and the Grothendieck group on the left is given by the Grothendieck group of algebraic vector bundles.
