theorem: The Hirzebruch signature theorem states that the signature of a compact oriented manifold X of dimension 4k is given by the L genus of the manifold. This follows from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem applied to the following signature operator. The bundles E and F are given by the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of the operator on the bundle of differential forms of X, that acts on k-forms as ik(k−1)^k(k-1) times the Hodge star operator. The operator D is the Hodge Laplacian D≡Δ:=(d+d∗)2≡Δ:=(𝐝+𝐝^*)^2 restricted to E, where d is the Cartan exterior derivative and d* is its adjoint. The analytic index of D is the signature of the manifold X, and its topological index is the L genus of X, so these are equal. Â genus and Rochlin's
