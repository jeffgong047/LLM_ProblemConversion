History: The index problem for elliptic differential operators was posed by Israel Gel'fand.[4] He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of topological invariants. Some of the motivating examples included the Riemann–Roch theorem and its generalization the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and the Hirzebruch signature theorem. Friedrich Hirzebruch and Armand Borel had proved the integrality of the Â genus of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the Dirac operator (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961). The Atiyah–Singer theorem was announced in 1963.[1] The proof sketched in this announcement was never published by them, though it appears in Palais's book.[5] It appears also in the "Séminaire Cartan-Schwartz 1963/64"[6] that was held in Paris simultaneously with the seminar led by Richard Palais at Princeton University. The last talk in Paris was by Atiyah on manifolds with boundary. Their first published proof[7] replaced the cobordism theory of the first proof with K-theory, and they used this to give proofs of various generalizations in another sequence of papers.[8] 1965: Sergey P. Novikov published his results on the topological invariance of the rational Pontryagin classes on smooth manifolds.[9] Robion Kirby and Laurent C. Siebenmann's results,[10] combined with René Thom's paper[11] proved the existence of rational Pontryagin classes on topological manifolds. The rational Pontryagin classes are essential ingredients of the index theorem on smooth and topological manifolds. 1969: Michael Atiyah defines abstract elliptic operators on arbitrary metric spaces. Abstract elliptic operators became protagonists in Kasparov's theory and Connes's noncommutative differential geometry.[12] 1971: Isadore Singer proposes a comprehensive program for future extensions of index theory.[13] 1972: Gennadi G. Kasparov publishes his work on the realization of K-homology by abstract elliptic operators.[14] 1973: Atiyah, Raoul Bott, and Vijay Patodi gave a new proof of the index theorem[15] using the heat equation, described in a paper by Melrose.[16] 1977: Dennis Sullivan establishes his theorem on the existence and uniqueness of Lipschitz and quasiconformal structures on topological manifolds of dimension different from 4.[17] 1983: Ezra Getzler[18] motivated by ideas of Edward Witten[19] and Luis Alvarez-Gaume, gave a short proof of the local index theorem for operators that are locally Dirac operators; this covers many of the useful cases. 1983: Nicolae Teleman proves that the analytical indices of signature operators with values in vector bundles are topological invariants.[20] 1984: Teleman establishes the index theorem on topological manifolds.[21] 1986: Alain Connes publishes his fundamental paper on noncommutative geometry.[22] 1989: Simon K. Donaldson and Sullivan study Yang–Mills theory on quasiconformal manifolds of dimension 4. They introduce the signature operator S defined on differential forms of degree two.[23] 1990: Connes and Henri Moscovici prove the local index formula in the context of non-commutative geometry.[24] 1994: Connes, Sullivan, and Teleman prove the index theorem for signature operators on quasiconformal manifolds.[25]
