Corollary: If X is a continuous process and W is Brownian motion under measure P then W t=Wt−[W,X]tW̃_t=W_t-[W,X]_t is Brownian motion under Q. The fact that W tW̃_t is continuous is trivial; by Girsanov's theorem it is a Q local martingale, and by computing [W ]t=[W]t=t[W̃]_t=[W]_t=t it follows by Levy's characterization of Brownian motion that this is a Q Brownian motion.
