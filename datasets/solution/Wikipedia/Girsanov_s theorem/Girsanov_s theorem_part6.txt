Comments: In many common applications, the process X is defined by Xt=∫0tYsdWs._t=∫_0^tY_s dW_s. For X of this form then a necessary and sufficient condition for X to be a martingale is Novikov's condition which requires that EP[exp⁡(12∫0TYs2ds)]<∞._P[exp(1/2∫_0^TY_s^2 ds)]<∞. The stochastic exponential E(X)ℰ(X) is the process Z which solves the stochastic differential equation Zt=1+∫0tZsdXs._t=1+∫_0^tZ_s dX_s. The measure Q constructed above is not equivalent to P on F∞ℱ_∞ as this would only be the case if the Radon–Nikodym derivative were a uniformly integrable martingale, which the exponential martingale described above is not. On the other hand as long as Novikov's condition is satisfied the measures are equivalent on FTℱ_T. Additionally, then combining this above observation in this case, we see that the process W t=Wt−∫0tYsdsW̃_t=W_t-∫_0^tY_sds for t∈[0,T]∈[0,T] is a Q Brownian motion. This was Igor Girsanov's original formulation of the above theorem. Application to
