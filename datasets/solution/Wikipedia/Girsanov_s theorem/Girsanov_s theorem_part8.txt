equations: Another application of this theorem, also given in the original paper of Igor Girsanov, is for stochastic differential equations. Specifically, let us consider the equation dXt=μ(t,Xt)dt+dWt,_t=μ(t,X_t)dt+dW_t, where Wt_t denotes a Brownian motion. Here μμ and σσ are fixed deterministic functions. We assume that this equation has a unique strong solution on [0,T][0,T]. In this case Girsanov's theorem may be used to compute functionals of Xt_t directly in terms a related functional for Brownian motion. More specifically, we have for any bounded functional ΦΦ on continuous functions C([0,T])([0,T]) that EΦ(X)=E[Φ(W)exp⁡(∫0Tμ(s,Ws)dWs−12∫0Tμ(s,Ws)2ds)].Φ(X)=E[Φ(W)exp(∫_0^Tμ(s,W_s)dW_s-1/2∫_0^Tμ(s,W_s)^2ds)]. This follows by applying Girsanov's theorem, and the above observation, to the martingale process Yt=∫0tμ(s,Ws)dWs._t=∫_0^tμ(s,W_s)dW_s. In particular, we note that with the notation above, the process W t=Wt−∫0tμ(s,Ws)dsW̃_t=W_t-∫_0^tμ(s,W_s)ds is a Q Brownian motion. Rewriting this in differential form as dWt=dW t+μ(t,Wt)dt,_t=dW̃_t+μ(t,W_t)dt, we see that the law of Wt_t under Q solves the equation defining Xt_t, as W tW̃_t is a Q Brownian motion. In particular, we see that the right-hand side may be written as EQ[Φ(X)]_Q[Φ(X)], where Q is the measure taken with respect to the process Y, so the result now is just the statement of Girsanov's theorem. A more general form of this application is that if both dXt=μ(Xt,t)dt+σ(Xt,t)dWt,_t=μ(X_t,t)dt+σ(X_t,t)dW_t, dYt=(μ(Yt,t)+ν(Yt,t))dt+σ(Yt,t)dWt,_t=(μ(Y_t,t)+ν(Y_t,t))dt+σ(Y_t,t)dW_t, admit unique strong solutions on [0,T][0,T], then for any bounded functional on C([0,T])([0,T]), we have that EΦ(X)=E[Φ(Y)exp⁡(−∫0Tν(Ys,s)σ(Ys,s)dWs−12∫0Tν(Ys,s)2σ(Ys,s)2ds)].Φ(X)=E[Φ(Y)exp(-∫_0^Tν(Y_s,s)/σ(Y_s,s)dW_s-1/2∫_0^Tν(Y_s,s)^2/σ(Y_s,s)^2ds)].
