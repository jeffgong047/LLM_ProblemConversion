theorem: We state the theorem first for the special case when the underlying stochastic process is a Wiener process. This special case is sufficient for risk-neutral pricing in the Black–Scholes model. Let Wt{W_t} be a Wiener process on the Wiener probability space Ω,F,P{Ω,ℱ,P}. Let Xt_t be a measurable process adapted to the natural filtration of the Wiener process FtW{ℱ_t^W}; we assume that the usual conditions have been satisfied. Given an adapted process Xt_t define Zt=E(X)t,_t=ℰ(X)_t, where E(X)ℰ(X) is the stochastic exponential of X with respect to W, i.e. E(X)t=exp⁡(Xt−12[X]t),ℰ(X)_t=exp(X_t-1/2[X]_t), and [X]t[X]_t denotes the quadratic variation of the process X. If Zt_t is a martingale then a probability measure Q can be defined on Ω,F{Ω,ℱ} such that Radon–Nikodym derivative dQdP|Ft=Zt=E(X)t.dQ/dP|_ℱ_t=Z_t=ℰ(X)_t Then for each t the measure Q restricted to the unaugmented sigma fields Ftoℱ_t^o is equivalent to P restricted to Fto.ℱ_t^o. Furthermore if Yt_t is a local martingale under P then the process Y t=Yt−[Y,X]tỸ_t=Y_t-[Y,X]_t is a Q local martingale on the filtered probability space Ω,F,Q,FtW{Ω,F,Q,{ℱ_t^W}}.
