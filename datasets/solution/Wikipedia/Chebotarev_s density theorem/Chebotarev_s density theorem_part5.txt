Statement: Let L be a finite Galois extension of a number field K with Galois group G. Let X be a subset of G that is stable under conjugation. The set of primes v of K that are unramified in L and whose associated Frobenius conjugacy class Fv is contained in X has density #X#G.#X/#G.[2] The statement is valid when the density refers to either the natural density or the analytic density of the set of primes.[3] Effective
