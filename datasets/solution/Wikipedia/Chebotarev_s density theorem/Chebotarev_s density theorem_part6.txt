Version: The Generalized Riemann hypothesis implies an effective version[4] of the Chebotarev density theorem: if L/K is a finite Galois extension with Galois group G, and C a union of conjugacy classes of G, the number of unramified primes of K of norm below x with Frobenius conjugacy class in C is |C||G|(li(x)+O(x(nlog⁡x+log⁡|Δ|))),|C|/|G|(li(x)+O(√(x)(n+log|Δ|))), where the constant implied in the big-O notation is absolute, n is the degree of L over Q, and Δ its discriminant. The effective form of Chebotarev's density theory becomes much weaker without GRH. Take L to be a finite Galois extension of Q with Galois group G and degree d. Take ρρ to be a nontrivial irreducible representation of G of degree n, and take f(ρ)𝔣(ρ) to be the Artin conductor of this representation. Suppose that, for ρ0ρ_0 a subrepresentation of ρ⊗ρρ⊗ρ or ρ⊗ρ¯ρ⊗ρ̅, L(ρ0,s)(ρ_0,s) is entire; that is, the Artin conjecture is satisfied for all ρ0ρ_0. Take χρχ_ρ to be the character associated to ρρ. Then there is an absolute positive c such that, for x≥2≥2, ∑p≤x,p∤f(ρ)χρ(Frp)log⁡p=rx+O(xββ+xexp⁡(−c(dn)−4log⁡x3log⁡f(ρ)+log⁡x)(dnlog⁡(xf(ρ))),∑_p,p|̸𝔣(ρ)χ_ρ(Fr_p)=rx+O(x^β/β+xexp(-c(dn)^-4/3log𝔣(ρ)+√())(dnlog(x𝔣(ρ))), where r is 1 if ρρ is trivial and is otherwise 0, and where ββ is an exceptional real zero of L(ρ,s)(ρ,s); if there is no such zero, the xβ/β^β/β term can be ignored. The implicit constant of this expression is absolute. [5] Infinite
