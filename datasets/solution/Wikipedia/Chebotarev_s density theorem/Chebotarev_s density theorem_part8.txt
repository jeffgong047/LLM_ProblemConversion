consequences: The Chebotarev density theorem reduces the problem of classifying Galois extensions of a number field to that of describing the splitting of primes in extensions. Specifically, it implies that as a Galois extension of K, L is uniquely determined by the set of primes of K that split completely in it.[6] A related corollary is that if almost all prime ideals of K split completely in L, then in fact L = K.[7] See
