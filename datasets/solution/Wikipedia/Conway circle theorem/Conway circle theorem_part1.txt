Geometrical construction based on extending the sides of a triangle A triangle's Conway circle with its six concentric points (solid black), the triangle's incircle (dashed gray), and the centre of both circles (white); solid and dashed line segments of the same colour are equal in length In plane geometry, the Conway circle theorem states that when the sides meeting at each vertex of a triangle are extended by the length of the opposite side, the six endpoints of the three resulting line segments lie on a circle whose centre is the incentre of the triangle. The circle on which these six points lie is called the Conway circle of the triangle.[1][2][3] The theorem and circle are named after mathematician John Horton Conway. The radius of the Conway circle is r2+s2√(r^2+s^2) where r and s are the inradius and semiperimeter of the triangle.[3] Conway's circle is a special case of a more general circle for a triangle that can be obtained as follows: Given any △ABC with an arbitrary point P on line AB. Construct BQ = BP, CR = CQ, AS = AR, BT = BS, CU = CT. Then AU = AP, and PQRSTU is cyclic.[4] See
