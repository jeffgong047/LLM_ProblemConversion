Proof: Proof of Apollonius's theorem The theorem can be proved as a special case of Stewart's theorem, or can be proved using vectors (see parallelogram law). The following is an independent proof using the law of cosines.[1] Let the triangle have sides a,b,c,b,c with a median d drawn to side a.. Let m be the length of the segments of a formed by the median, so m is half of a.. Let the angles formed between a and d be θθ and θ′,θ^', where θθ includes b and θ′θ^' includes c.. Then θ′θ^' is the supplement of θθ and cos⁡θ′=−cos⁡θ.cosθ^'=-cosθ. The law of cosines for θθ and θ′θ^' states that b2=m2+d2−2dmcos⁡θc2=m2+d2−2dmcos⁡θ′=m2+d2+2dmcos⁡θ.b^2 =m^2+d^2-2dmcosθ c^2 =m^2+d^2-2dmcosθ' =m^2+d^2+2dmcosθ. Add the first and third equations to obtain b2+c2=2(m2+d2)^2+c^2=2(m^2+d^2) as required. See
