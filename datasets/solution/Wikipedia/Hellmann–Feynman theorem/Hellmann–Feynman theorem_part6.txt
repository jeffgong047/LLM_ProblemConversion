values: An alternative approach for applying the Hellmann–Feynman theorem is to promote a fixed or discrete parameter which appears in a Hamiltonian to be a continuous variable solely for the mathematical purpose of taking a derivative. Possible parameters are physical constants or discrete quantum numbers. As an example, the radial Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like atom is H^l=−ℏ22μr2(ddr(r2ddr)−l(l+1))−Ze2r,Ĥ_l=-ħ^2/2^2(d/dr(r^2d/dr)-l(l+1))-Ze^2/r, which depends upon the discrete azimuthal quantum number l. Promoting l to be a continuous parameter allows for the derivative of the Hamiltonian to be taken: ∂H^l∂l=ℏ22μr2(2l+1).∂Ĥ_l/=ħ^2/2^2(2l+1). The Hellmann–Feynman theorem then allows for the determination of the expectation value of 1r21/r^2 for hydrogen-like atoms:[8] ⟨ψnl|1r2|ψnl⟩=2μℏ212l+1⟨ψnl|∂H^l∂l|ψnl⟩=2μℏ212l+1∂En∂l=2μℏ212l+1∂En∂n∂n∂l=2μℏ212l+1Z2μe4ℏ2n3=Z2μ2e4ℏ4n3(l+1/2).⟨ψ_nl|1/r^2|ψ_nl⟩ =2μ/ħ^21/2l+1⟨ψ_nl|∂Ĥ_l/|ψ_nl⟩ =2μ/ħ^21/2l+1_n/ =2μ/ħ^21/2l+1_n// =2μ/ħ^21/2l+1Z^2^4/ħ^2n^3 =Z^2μ^2e^4/ħ^4n^3(l+1/2). In order to compute the energy derivative, the way n depends on l has to be known. These quantum numbers are usually independent, but here the solutions must be varied so as to keep the number of nodes in the wavefunction fixed. The number of nodes is n−l+1-l+1, so ∂n/∂l=1/=1.
