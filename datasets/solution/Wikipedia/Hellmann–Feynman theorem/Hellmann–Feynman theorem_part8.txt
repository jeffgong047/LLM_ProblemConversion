wavefunctions: For a general time-dependent wavefunction satisfying the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the Hellmann–Feynman theorem is not valid. However, the following identity holds:[9][10] ⟨Ψλ(t)|∂Hλ∂λ|Ψλ(t)⟩=iℏ∂∂t⟨Ψλ(t)|∂Ψλ(t)∂λ⟩⟨Ψ_λ(t)|_λ/∂λ|Ψ_λ(t)⟩=iħ∂/⟨Ψ_λ(t)|∂Ψ_λ(t)/∂λ⟩ For iℏ∂Ψλ(t)∂t=HλΨλ(t)ħ∂Ψ_λ(t)/=H_λΨ_λ(t)
