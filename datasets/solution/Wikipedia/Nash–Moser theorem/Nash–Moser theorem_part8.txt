maps: Let F and G be graded Fréchet spaces. Let U be an open subset of F, meaning that for each f∈U there are n∈N∈ℕ and ε>0ε>0 such that ‖f−f1‖<εf-f_1<ε implies that f1_1 is also contained in U. A smooth map P:U→G:U is called a tame smooth map if for all k∈N∈ℕ the derivative DkP:U×F×⋯×F→G^kP:U×⋯ satisfies the following: there exist r and b such that n>b>b implies ‖DkP(f,h1,…,hk)‖n≤Cn(‖f‖n+r+‖h1‖n+r+⋯+‖hk‖n+r+1)D^kP(f,h_1,…,h_k)_n_n(f_n+r+h_1_n+r+⋯+h_k_n+r+1) for all (f,h1,…,hk)∈U×F×⋯×F(f,h_1,…,h_k)×⋯. The fundamental example says that, on a compact smooth manifold, a nonlinear partial differential operator (possibly between sections of vector bundles over the manifold) is a smooth tame map; in this case, r can be taken to be the order of the operator.
