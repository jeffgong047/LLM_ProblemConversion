History: The Nash–Moser theorem traces back to Nash (1956), who proved the theorem in the special case of the isometric embedding problem. It is clear from his paper that his method can be generalized. Moser (1966a, 1966b), for instance, showed that Nash's methods could be successfully applied to solve problems on periodic orbits in celestial mechanics in the KAM theory. However, it has proven quite difficult to find a suitable general formulation; there is, to date, no all-encompassing version; various versions due to Gromov, Hamilton, Hörmander, Saint-Raymond, Schwartz, and Sergeraert are given in the references below. That of Hamilton's, quoted below, is particularly widely cited. The problem of loss of
