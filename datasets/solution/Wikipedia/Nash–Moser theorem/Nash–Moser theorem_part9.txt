theorem: Let S denote the family of inverse mappings U×G→F.. Consider the special case that F and G are spaces of exponentially decreasing sequences in Banach spaces, i.e. F=Σ(B) and G=Σ(C). (It is not too difficult to see that this is sufficient to prove the general case.) For a positive number c, consider the ordinary differential equation in Σ(B) given by f′=cS(θt(f),θt(g∞−P(f))).'=cS(θ_t(f),θ_t(g_∞-P(f))). Hamilton shows that if P(0)=0(0)=0 and g∞_∞ is sufficiently small in Σ(C), then the solution of this differential equation with initial condition f(0)=0(0)=0 exists as a mapping [0,∞) → Σ(B), and that f(t) converges as t→∞ to a solution of P(f)=g∞.(f)=g_∞.
