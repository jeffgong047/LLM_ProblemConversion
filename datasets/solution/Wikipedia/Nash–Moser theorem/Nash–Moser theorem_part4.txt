derivatives: This will be introduced in the original setting of the Nash–Moser theorem, that of the isometric embedding problem. Let ΩΩ be an open subset of Rnℝ^n. Consider the map P:C1(Ω;RN)→C0(Ω;Symn×n(R)):C^1(Ω;ℝ^N)^0(Ω;Sym_n(ℝ)) given by P(f)ij=∑α=1N∂fα∂ui∂fα∂uj.(f)_ij=∑_α=1^N^α/^i^α/^j. In Nash's solution of the isometric embedding problem (as would be expected in the solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations) a major step is a statement of the schematic form "If f is such that P(f) is positive-definite, then for any matrix-valued function g which is close to P(f), there exists fg with P(fg) = g." Following standard practice, one would expect to apply the Banach space inverse function theorem. So, for instance, one might expect to restrict P to C5(Ω;ℝN) and, for an immersion f in this domain, to study the linearization C5(Ω;RN) → C4(Ω;Symn×n(R)) given by f ↦∑α=1N∂fα∂ui∂f β∂uj+∑α=1N∂f α∂ui∂fβ∂uj.f↦∑_α=1^N^α/^i∂f^β/^j+∑_α=1^N∂f^α/^i^β/^j. If one could show that this were invertible, with bounded inverse, then the Banach space inverse function theorem directly applies. However, there is a deep reason that such a formulation cannot work. The issue is that there is a second-order differential operator of P(f) which coincides with a second-order differential operator applied to f. To be precise: if f is an immersion then RP(f)=|H(f)|2−|h(f)|P(f)2,^P(f)=|H(f)|^2-|h(f)|_P(f)^2, where RP(f) is the scalar curvature of the Riemannian metric P(f), H(f) denotes the mean curvature of the immersion f, and h(f) denotes its second fundamental form; the above equation is the Gauss equation from surface theory. So, if P(f) is C4, then RP(f) is generally only C2. Then, according to the above equation, f can generally be only C4; if it were C5 then |H|2−|h|2 would have to be at least C3. The source of the problem can be quite succinctly phrased in the following way: the Gauss equation shows that there is a differential operator Q such that the order of the composition of Q with P is less than the sum of the orders of P and Q. In context, the upshot is that the inverse to the linearization of P, even if it exists as a map C∞(Ω;Symn×n(R)) → C∞(Ω;RN), cannot be bounded between appropriate Banach spaces, and hence the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be applied. By exactly the same reasoning, one cannot directly apply the Banach space implicit function theorem even if one uses the Hölder spaces, the Sobolev spaces, or any of the Ck spaces. In any of these settings, an inverse to the linearization of P will fail to be bounded. This is the problem of loss of derivatives. A very naive expectation is that, generally, if P is an order k differential operator, then if P(f) is in Cm then f must be in Cm+k. However, this is somewhat rare. In the case of uniformly elliptic differential operators, the famous Schauder estimates show that this naive expectation is borne out, with the caveat that one must replace the Ck spaces with the Hölder spaces Ck,α; this causes no extra difficulty whatsoever for the application of the Banach space implicit function theorem. However, the above analysis shows that this naive expectation is not borne out for the map which sends an immersion to its induced Riemannian metric; given that this map is of order 1, one does not gain the "expected" one derivative upon inverting the operator. The same failure is common in geometric problems, where the action of the diffeomorphism group is the root cause, and in problems of hyperbolic differential equations, where even in the very simplest problems one does not have the naively expected smoothness of a solution. All of these difficulties provide common contexts for applications of the Nash–Moser theorem. The schematic form of Nash's
