spaces: A graded Fréchet space consists of the following data: a vector space F a countable collection of seminorms ‖⋅‖n:F→R · _n:F→ℝ such that ‖f‖0≤‖f‖1≤‖f‖2≤⋯f_0≤f_1≤f_2≤⋯ for all f∈F.. One requires these to satisfy the following conditions: if f∈F is such that ‖f‖n=0f_n=0 for all n=0,1,2,…=0,1,2,… then f=0=0 if fj∈F_j is a sequence such that, for each n=0,1,2,…=0,1,2,… and every ε>0ε>0 there exists Nn,ε_n,ε such that j,k>Nn,ε,k>N_n,ε implies ‖fj−fk‖n<ε,f_j-f_k_n<ε, then there exists f∈F such that, for each n,, one has limj→∞‖fj−f‖n=0.lim_j→∞f_j-f_n=0. Such a graded Fréchet space is called a tame Fréchet space if it satisfies the following condition: there exists a Banach space B and linear maps L:F→Σ(B):F→Σ(B) and M:Σ(B)→F:Σ(B) such that M is a right inverse of L,, and such that: there exists r and b such that for each n>b>b there is a number Cn_n such that supk∈Nenk‖L(f)k‖B≤Cn‖f‖r+nsup_k∈ℕe^nkL(f)_k_B_nf_r+n for every f∈F,, and ‖M(xi)‖n≤Cnsupk∈Ne(r+n)k‖xk‖BM({x_i})_n_nsup_k∈ℕe^(r+n)kx_k_B for every xi∈Σ(B).{x_i}∈Σ(B). Here Σ(B)Σ(B) denotes the vector space of exponentially decreasing sequences in B,, that is, Σ(B)=mapsx:N→Bs.t.supk∈Nenk‖xk‖B<∞foralln∈N.Σ(B)={mapsx:ℕs.t.sup_k∈ℕe^nkx_k_B<∞foralln∈ℕ}. The laboriousness of the definition is justified by the primary examples of tamely graded Fréchet spaces: If M is a compact smooth manifold (with or without boundary) then C∞(M)^∞(M) is a tamely graded Fréchet space, when given any of the following graded structures: take ‖f‖nf_n to be the Cn^n-norm of f take ‖f‖nf_n to be the Cn,α^n,α-norm of f for fixed αα take ‖f‖nf_n to be the Wn,p^n,p-norm of f for fixed p If M is a compact smooth manifold-with-boundary then C0∞(M),_0^∞(M), the space of smooth functions whose derivatives all vanish on the boundary, is a tamely graded Fréchet space, with any of the above graded structures. If M is a compact smooth manifold and V→M is a smooth vector bundle, then the space of smooth sections is tame, with any of the above graded structures. To recognize the tame structure of these examples, one topologically embeds M in a Euclidean space, B is taken to be the space of L1^1 functions on this Euclidean space, and the map L is defined by dyadic restriction of the Fourier transform. The details are in pages 133-140 of Hamilton (1982). Presented directly as above, the meaning and naturality of the "tame" condition is rather obscure. The situation is clarified if one re-considers the basic examples given above, in which the relevant "exponentially decreasing" sequences in Banach spaces arise from restriction of a Fourier transform. Recall that smoothness of a function on Euclidean space is directly related to the rate of decay of its Fourier transform. "Tameness" is thus seen as a condition which allows an abstraction of the idea of a "smoothing operator" on a function space. Given a Banach space B and the corresponding space Σ(B)Σ(B) of exponentially decreasing sequences in B,, the precise analogue of a smoothing operator can be defined in the following way. Let s:R→R:ℝ→ℝ be a smooth function which vanishes on (−∞,0),(-∞,0), is identically equal to one on (1,∞),(1,∞), and takes values only in the interval [0,1].[0,1]. Then for each real number t define θt:Σ(B)→Σ(B)θ_t:Σ(B)→Σ(B) by (θtx)i=s(t−i)xi.(θ_tx)_i=s(t-i)x_i. If one accepts the schematic idea of the proof devised by Nash, and in particular his use of smoothing operators, the "tame" condition then becomes rather reasonable. Smooth tame
