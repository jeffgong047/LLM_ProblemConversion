theorem: See also: Differentiation in Fréchet spaces § Tame Fréchet spaces The following statement appears in Hamilton (1982): Let F and G be tame Fréchet spaces, let U⊆F be an open subset, and let P:U→G:U be a smooth tame map. Suppose that for each f∈U the linearization dPf:F→G_f:F is invertible, and the family of inverses, as a map U×G→F,, is smooth tame. Then P is locally invertible, and each local inverse P−1^-1 is a smooth tame map. Similarly, if each linearization is only injective, and a family of left inverses is smooth tame, then P is locally injective. And if each linearization is only surjective, and a family of right inverses is smooth tame, then P is locally surjective with a smooth tame right inverse. Tame Fréchet
