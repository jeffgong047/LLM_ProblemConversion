History: Iwasawa (1959) introduced the μ-invariant of a Zp-extension and observed that it was zero in all cases he calculated. Iwasawa & Sims (1966) used a computer to check that it vanishes for the cyclotomic Zp-extension of the rationals for all primes less than 4000. Iwasawa (1971) later conjectured that the μ-invariant vanishes for any Zp-extension, but shortly after Iwasawa (1973) discovered examples of non-cyclotomic extensions of number fields with non-vanishing μ-invariant showing that his original conjecture was wrong. He suggested, however, that the conjecture might still hold for cyclotomic Zp-extensions. Iwasawa (1958) showed that the vanishing of the μ-invariant for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of the rationals is equivalent to certain congruences between Bernoulli numbers, and Ferrero & Washington (1979) showed that the μ-invariant vanishes in these cases by proving that these congruences hold.
