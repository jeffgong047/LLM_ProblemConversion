Statement: For a number field K we let Km denote the extension by pm-power roots of unity, K^K̂ the union of the Km and A(p) the maximal unramified abelian p-extension of K^K̂. Let the Tate module Tp(K)=Gal(A(p)/K^)._p(K)=Gal(A^(p)/K̂) Then Tp(K) is a pro-p-group and so a Zp-module. Using class field theory one can describe Tp(K) as isomorphic to the inverse limit of the class groups Cm of the Km under norm.[1] Iwasawa exhibited Tp(K) as a module over the completion Zp[[T]] and this implies a formula for the exponent of p in the order of the class groups Cm of the form λm+μpm+κ.+^m+κ The Ferrero–Washington theorem states that μ is zero.[2]
