Iwasawa's μ-invariant is 0 for cyclotomic extensions of abelian algebraic number fields In algebraic number theory, the Ferrero–Washington theorem, proved first by Ferrero & Washington (1979) and later by Sinnott (1984), states that Iwasawa's μ-invariant vanishes for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of abelian algebraic number fields.
