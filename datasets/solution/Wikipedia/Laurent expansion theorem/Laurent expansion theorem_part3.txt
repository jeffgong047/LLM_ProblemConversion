series: e−1/x2 and Laurent approximations: see text for key. As the negative degree of the Laurent series rises, it approaches the correct function. e−1/x2 and its Laurent approximations with the negative degree rising. The neighborhood around the zero singularity can never be approximated. Laurent series with complex coefficients are an important tool in complex analysis, especially to investigate the behavior of functions near singularities. Consider for instance the function f(x)=e−1/x2(x)=e^-1/x^2 with f(0)=0(0)=0. As a real function, it is infinitely differentiable everywhere; as a complex function however it is not differentiable at x=0=0. By replacing x with −1/x2-1/x^2 in the power series for the exponential function, we obtain its Laurent series which converges and is equal to f(x)(x) for all complex numbers x except at the singularity x=0=0. The graph opposite shows e−1/x2^-1/x^2 in black and its Laurent approximations ∑n=0N(−1)nx−2nn!∑_n=0^N(-1)^n x^-2n! for N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 50. As N→∞→∞, the approximation becomes exact for all (complex) numbers x except at the singularity x=0=0. More generally, Laurent series can be used to express holomorphic functions defined on an annulus, much as power series are used to express holomorphic functions defined on a disc. Suppose ∑n=−∞∞an(z−c)n∑_n=-∞^∞a_n(z-c)^n is a given Laurent series with complex coefficients an_n and a complex center c. Then there exists a unique inner radius r and outer radius R such that: The Laurent series converges on the open annulus A=z:r<|z−c|<R={z:r<|z-c|<R}. To say that the Laurent series converges, we mean that both the positive degree power series and the negative degree power series converge. Furthermore, this convergence will be uniform on compact sets. Finally, the convergent series defines a holomorphic function f(z)(z) on the open annulus. Outside the annulus, the Laurent series diverges. That is, at each point of the exterior of A, the positive degree power series or the negative degree power series diverges. On the boundary of the annulus, one cannot make a general statement, except to say that there is at least one point on the inner boundary and one point on the outer boundary such that f(z)(z) cannot be holomorphically continued to those points. It is possible that r may be zero or R may be infinite; at the other extreme, it's not necessarily true that r is less than R. These radii can be computed as follows: r=limsupn→∞|a−n|1n,1R=limsupn→∞|an|1n.r =lim sup_n→∞|a_-n|^1/n, 1 =lim sup_n→∞|a_n|^1/n. We take R to be infinite when this latter lim sup is zero. Conversely, if we start with an annulus of the form A=z:r<|z−c|<R={z:r<|z-c|<R} and a holomorphic function f(z)(z) defined on A, then there always exists a unique Laurent series with center c which converges (at least) on A and represents the function f(z)(z). As an example, consider the following rational function, along with its partial fraction expansion: f(z)=1(z−1)(z−2i)=1+2i5(1z−1−1z−2i).(z)=1/(z-1)(z-2i)=1+2i/5(1/z-1-1/z-2i). This function has singularities at z=1=1 and z=2i=2i, where the denominator of the expression is zero and the expression is therefore undefined. A Taylor series about z=0=0 (which yields a power series) will only converge in a disc of radius 1, since it "hits" the singularity at 1. However, there are three possible Laurent expansions about 0, depending on the radius of z: One series is defined on the inner disc where |z| < 1; it is the same as the Taylor series, f(z)=1+2i5∑n=0∞(1(2i)n+1−1)zn.(z)=1+2i/5∑_n=0^∞(1/(2i)^n+1-1)z^n. This follows from the partial fraction form of the function, along with the formula for the sum of a geometric series, 1z−a=−1a∑n=0∞(za)n1/z-a=-1/a∑_n=0^∞(za)^n for |z|<|a||z|<|a|. The second series is defined on the middle annulus where 1<z<21<z<2 is caught between the two singularities: f(z)=1+2i5(∑n=1∞z−n+∑n=0∞1(2i)n+1zn).(z)=1+2i/5(∑_n=1^∞z^-n+∑_n=0^∞1/(2i)^n+1z^n). Here, we use the alternative form of the geometric series summation, 1z−a=1z∑n=0∞(az)n1/z-a=1/z∑_n=0^∞(a/z)^n for |z|>|a||z|>|a|. The third series is defined on the infinite outer annulus where 2<z<∞2<z<∞, (which is also the Laurent expansion at z=∞=∞) f(z)=1+2i5∑n=1∞(1−(2i)n−1)z−n.(z)=1+2i/5∑_n=1^∞(1-(2i)^n-1)z^-n. This series can be derived using geometric series as before, or by performing polynomial long division of 1 by (x−1)(x−2i)(x-1)(x-2i), not stopping with a remainder but continuing into x−n^-n terms; indeed, the "outer" Laurent series of a rational function is analogous to the decimal form of a fraction. (The "inner" Taylor series expansion can be obtained similarly, just reversing the term order in the division algorithm.) The case r=0=0; i.e., a holomorphic function f(z)(z) which may be undefined at a single point c, is especially important. The coefficient a−1_-1 of the Laurent expansion of such a function is called the residue of f(z)(z) at the singularity c; it plays a prominent role in the residue theorem. For an example of this, consider f(z)=ezz+e1/z.(z)=e^z+e^1/z. This function is holomorphic everywhere except at z=0=0. To determine the Laurent expansion about c=0=0, we use our knowledge of the Taylor series of the exponential function: f(z)=⋯+(13!)z−3+(12!)z−2+2z−1+2+(12!)z+(13!)z2+(14!)z3+⋯.(z)=⋯+(13!)z^-3+(12!)z^-2+2z^-1+2+(12!)z+(13!)z^2+(14!)z^3+⋯. We find that the residue is 2. One example for expanding about z=∞=∞: f(z)=1+z2−z=z(1+1z2−1)=z(12z2−18z4+116z6−⋯)=12z−18z3+116z5−⋯.(z)=√(1+z^2)-z=z(√(1+1/z^2)-1)=z(1/2z^2-1/8z^4+1/16z^6-⋯)=1/2z-1/8z^3+1/16z^5-⋯.
