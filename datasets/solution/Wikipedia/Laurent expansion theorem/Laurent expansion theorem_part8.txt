Z-transform – the special case where the Laurent series is taken about zero has much use in time-series analysis. Fourier series – the substitution z=eπiw=e^ transforms a Laurent series into a Fourier series, or conversely. This is used in the q-series expansion of the j-invariant. Padé approximant – Another technique used when a Taylor series is not viable.
