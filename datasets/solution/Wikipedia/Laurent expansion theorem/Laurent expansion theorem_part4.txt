Uniqueness: Suppose a function f(z)(z) holomorphic on the annulus r<|z−c|<R<|z-c|<R has two Laurent series: f(z)=∑n=−∞∞an(z−c)n=∑n=−∞∞bn(z−c)n.(z)=∑_n=-∞^∞a_n(z-c)^n=∑_n=-∞^∞b_n(z-c)^n. Multiply both sides by (z−c)−k−1(z-c)^-k-1, where k is an arbitrary integer, and integrate on a path γ inside the annulus, ∮γ∑n=−∞∞an(z−c)n−k−1dz=∮γ∑n=−∞∞bn(z−c)n−k−1dz.∮_γ ∑_n=-∞^∞a_n(z-c)^n-k-1 dz=∮_γ ∑_n=-∞^∞b_n(z-c)^n-k-1 dz. The series converges uniformly on r+ε≤|z−c|≤R−ε+ε≤|z-c|-ε, where ε is a positive number small enough for γ to be contained in the constricted closed annulus, so the integration and summation can be interchanged. Substituting the identity ∮γ(z−c)n−k−1dz=2πiδnk∮_γ (z-c)^n-k-1 dz=2δ_nk into the summation yields ak=bk._k=b_k. Hence the Laurent series is unique. Laurent
