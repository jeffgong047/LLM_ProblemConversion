Power series with negative powers This article is about doubly infinite power series. For power series with finitely many negative exponents, see Formal Laurent series. A Laurent series is defined with respect to a particular point c and a path of integration γ. The path of integration must lie in an annulus, indicated here by the red color, inside which f(z)(z) is holomorphic (analytic).

It may be used to express complex functions in cases where a Taylor series expansion cannot be applied. The Laurent series was named after and first published by Pierre Alphonse Laurent in 1843. Karl Weierstrass may have discovered it first in a paper written in 1841, but it was not published until after his death.[1]
