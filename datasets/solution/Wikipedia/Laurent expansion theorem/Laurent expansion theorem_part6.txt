part: The principal part of a Laurent series is the series of terms with negative degree, that is ∑k=−∞−1ak(z−c)k.∑_k=-∞^-1a_k(z-c)^k. If the principal part of f is a finite sum, then f has a pole at c of order equal to (negative) the degree of the highest term; on the other hand, if f has an essential singularity at c, the principal part is an infinite sum (meaning it has infinitely many non-zero terms). If the inner radius of convergence of the Laurent series for f is 0, then f has an essential singularity at c if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum, and has a pole otherwise. If the inner radius of convergence is positive, f may have infinitely many negative terms but still be regular at c, as in the example above, in which case it is represented by a different Laurent series in a disk about c. Laurent series with only finitely many negative terms are well-behaved—they are a power series divided by zk^k, and can be analyzed similarly—while Laurent series with infinitely many negative terms have complicated behavior on the inner circle of convergence.
