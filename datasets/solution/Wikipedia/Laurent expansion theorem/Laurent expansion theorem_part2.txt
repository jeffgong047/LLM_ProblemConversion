Definition: The Laurent series for a complex function f(z)(z) about a point c is given by f(z)=∑n=−∞∞an(z−c)n,(z)=∑_n=-∞^∞a_n(z-c)^n, where an_n and c are constants, with an_n defined by a contour integral that generalizes Cauchy's integral formula: an=12πi∮γf(z)(z−c)n+1dz._n=1/2∮_γf(z)/(z-c)^n+1 dz. The path of integration γγ is counterclockwise around a Jordan curve enclosing c and lying in an annulus A in which f(z)(z) is holomorphic (analytic). The expansion for f(z)(z) will then be valid anywhere inside the annulus. The annulus is shown in red in the figure on the right, along with an example of a suitable path of integration labeled γγ. If we take γγ to be a circle |z−c|=ϱ|z-c|=ϱ, where r<ϱ<R<ϱ<R, this just amounts to computing the complex Fourier coefficients of the restriction of f to γγ. The fact that these integrals are unchanged by a deformation of the contour γγ is an immediate consequence of Green's theorem. One may also obtain the Laurent series for a complex function f(z)(z) at z=∞=∞. However, this is the same as when R→∞→∞ (see the example below). In practice, the above integral formula may not offer the most practical method for computing the coefficients an_n for a given function f(z)(z); instead, one often pieces together the Laurent series by combining known Taylor expansions. Because the Laurent expansion of a function is unique whenever it exists, any expression of this form that equals the given function f(z)(z) in some annulus must actually be the Laurent expansion of f(z)(z).
