Example: The coefficient of xy2 in (x+y)3=(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)=xxx+xxy+xyx+xyy_+yxx+yxy_+yyx_+yyy=x3+3x2y+3xy2_+y3(x+y)^3 =(x+y)(x+y)(x+y) =xxx+xxy+xyx+xyy+yxx+yxy+yyx+yyy =x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+y^3 equals (32)=332=3 because there are three x,y strings of length 3 with exactly two ys, namely, xyy,yxy,yyx,, yxy, yyx, corresponding to the three 2-element subsets of {1, 2, 3}, namely, 2,3,1,3,1,2,{2,3}, {1,3}, {1,2}, where each subset specifies the positions of the y in a corresponding string.
