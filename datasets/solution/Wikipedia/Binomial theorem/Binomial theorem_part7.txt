Formulas: The coefficient of xn−kyk is given by the formula (nk)=n!k!(n−k)!,nk=n!/k! (n-k)!, which is defined in terms of the factorial function n!. Equivalently, this formula can be written (nk)=n(n−1)⋯(n−k+1)k(k−1)⋯1=∏ℓ=1kn−ℓ+1ℓ=∏ℓ=0k−1n−ℓk−ℓnk=n(n-1)⋯(n-k+1)/k(k-1)⋯1=∏_ℓ=1^kn-ℓ+1/ℓ=∏_ℓ=0^k-1n-ℓ/k-ℓ with k factors in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient (nk)nk is actually an integer. Combinatorial
