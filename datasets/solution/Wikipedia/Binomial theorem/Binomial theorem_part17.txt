theorem: Main article: Multinomial theorem The binomial theorem can be generalized to include powers of sums with more than two terms. The general version is (x1+x2+⋯+xm)n=∑k1+k2+⋯+km=n(nk1,k2,…,km)x1k1x2k2⋯xmkm,(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_m)^n=∑_k_1+k_2+⋯+k_m=nnk_1,k_2,…,k_mx_1^k_1x_2^k_2_m^k_m, where the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices k1 through km such that the sum of all ki is n. (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to n). The coefficients (nk1,⋯,km)nk_1,⋯,k_m are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula (nk1,k2,…,km)=n!k1!⋅k2!⋯km!.nk_1,k_2,…,k_m=n!/k_1!_2!_m!. Combinatorially, the multinomial coefficient (nk1,⋯,km)nk_1,⋯,k_m counts the number of different ways to partition an n-element set into disjoint subsets of sizes k1, ..., km. Multi-binomial
