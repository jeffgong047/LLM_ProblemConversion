case: Expanding (x + y)n yields the sum of the 2n products of the form e1e2 ... en where each ei is x or y. Rearranging factors shows that each product equals xn−kyk for some k between 0 and n. For a given k, the following are proved equal in succession: the number of copies of xn−kyk in the expansion the number of n-character x,y strings having y in exactly k positions the number of k-element subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} (nk),nk, either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining (nk)nk as n!k!(n−k)!.n!k!(n-k)!. This proves the binomial theorem. Inductive
