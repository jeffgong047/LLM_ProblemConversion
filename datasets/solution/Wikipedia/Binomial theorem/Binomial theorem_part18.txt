theorem: When working in more dimensions, it is often useful to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to (x1+y1)n1⋯(xd+yd)nd=∑k1=0n1⋯∑kd=0nd(n1k1)x1k1y1n1−k1…(ndkd)xdkdydnd−kd.(x_1+y_1)^n_1…(x_d+y_d)^n_d=∑_k_1=0^n_1…∑_k_d=0^n_dn_1k_1x_1^k_1y_1^n_1-k_1…n_dk_dx_d^k_dy_d^n_d-k_d. This may be written more concisely, by multi-index notation, as (x+y)α=∑ν≤α(αν)xνyα−ν.(x+y)^α=∑_ν≤αανx^νy^α-ν. General Leibniz
