proof: Induction yields another proof of the binomial theorem. When n = 0, both sides equal 1, since x0 = 1 and (00)=1.00=1. Now suppose that the equality holds for a given n; we will prove it for n + 1. For j, k ≥ 0, let [f(x, y)]j,k denote the coefficient of xjyk in the polynomial f(x, y). By the inductive hypothesis, (x + y)n is a polynomial in x and y such that [(x + y)n]j,k is (nk)nk if j + k = n, and 0 otherwise. The identity (x+y)n+1=x(x+y)n+y(x+y)n(x+y)^n+1=x(x+y)^n+y(x+y)^n shows that (x + y)n+1 is also a polynomial in x and y, and [(x+y)n+1]j,k=[(x+y)n]j−1,k+[(x+y)n]j,k−1,[(x+y)^n+1]_j,k=[(x+y)^n]_j-1,k+[(x+y)^n]_j,k-1, since if j + k = n + 1, then (j − 1) + k = n and j + (k − 1) = n. Now, the right hand side is (nk)+(nk−1)=(n+1k),nk+nk-1=n+1k, by Pascal's identity.[15] On the other hand, if j + k ≠ n + 1, then (j – 1) + k ≠ n and j + (k – 1) ≠ n, so we get 0 + 0 = 0. Thus (x+y)n+1=∑k=0n+1(n+1k)xn+1−kyk,(x+y)^n+1=∑_k=0^n+1n+1kx^n+1-ky^k, which is the inductive hypothesis with n + 1 substituted for n and so completes the inductive step.
