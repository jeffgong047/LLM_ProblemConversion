theorem: Main article: Binomial series Around 1665, Isaac Newton generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. (The same generalization also applies to complex exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an infinite series. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials. However, for an arbitrary number r, one can define (rk)=r(r−1)⋯(r−k+1)k!=(r)kk!,r=r(r-1)⋯(r-k+1)/k!=(r)_k/k!, where (⋅)k(·)_k is the Pochhammer symbol, here standing for a falling factorial. This agrees with the usual definitions when r is a nonnegative integer. Then, if x and y are real numbers with |x| > |y|,[Note 1] and r is any complex number, one has (x+y)r=∑k=0∞(rk)xr−kyk=xr+rxr−1y+r(r−1)2!xr−2y2+r(r−1)(r−2)3!xr−3y3+⋯.(x+y)^r =∑_k=0^∞rx^r-ky^k =x^r+rx^r-1y+r(r-1)/2!x^r-2y^2+r(r-1)(r-2)/3!x^r-3y^3+⋯. When r is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for k > r are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most r + 1 nonzero terms. For other values of r, the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms. For example, r = 1/2 gives the following series for the square root: 1+x=1+12x−18x2+116x3−5128x4+7256x5−⋯.√(1+x)=1+1/2x-1/8x^2+1/16x^3-5/128x^4+7/256x^5-⋯. Taking r = −1, the generalized binomial series gives the geometric series formula, valid for |x| < 1: (1+x)−1=11+x=1−x+x2−x3+x4−x5+⋯.(1+x)^-1=1/1+x=1-x+x^2-x^3+x^4-x^5+⋯. More generally, with r = −s, we have for |x| < 1:[16] 1(1+x)s=∑k=0∞(−sk)xk=∑k=0∞(s+k−1k)(−1)kxk.1/(1+x)^s=∑_k=0^∞-sx^k=∑_k=0^∞s+k-1(-1)^kx^k. So, for instance, when s = 1/2, 11+x=1−12x+38x2−516x3+35128x4−63256x5+⋯.1/√(1+x)=1-1/2x+3/8x^2-5/16x^3+35/128x^4-63/256x^5+⋯. Replacing x with -x yields: 1(1−x)s=∑k=0∞(s+k−1k)(−1)k(−x)k=∑k=0∞(s+k−1k)xk.1/(1-x)^s=∑_k=0^∞s+k-1(-1)^k(-x)^k=∑_k=0^∞s+k-1x^k. So, for instance, when s = 1/2, we have for |x| < 1: 11−x=1+12x+38x2+516x3+35128x4+63256x5+⋯.1/√(1-x)=1+1/2x+3/8x^2+5/16x^3+35/128x^4+63/256x^5+⋯. Further
