Statement: According to the theorem, it is possible to expand any nonnegative integer power of x + y into a sum of the form (x+y)n=(n0)xny0+(n1)xn−1y1+(n2)xn−2y2+⋯+(nn−1)x1yn−1+(nn)x0yn,(x+y)^n=n0x^ny^0+n1x^n-1y^1+n2x^n-2y^2+⋯+n-1x^1y^n-1+nx^0y^n, where n≥0≥0 is an integer and each (nk)nk is a positive integer known as a binomial coefficient. (When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term. Hence one often sees the right hand side written as (n0)xn+⋯n0x^n+⋯.) This formula is also referred to as the binomial formula or the binomial identity. Using summation notation, it can be written as (x+y)n=∑k=0n(nk)xn−kyk=∑k=0n(nk)xkyn−k.(x+y)^n=∑_k=0^nnx^n-ky^k=∑_k=0^nnx^ky^n-k. The final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of x and y in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical. A simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by substituting 1 for y, so that it involves only a single variable. In this form, the formula reads (1+x)n=(n0)x0+(n1)x1+(n2)x2+⋯+(nn−1)xn−1+(nn)xn,(1+x)^n=n0x^0+n1x^1+n2x^2+⋯+nn-1x^n-1+nx^n, or equivalently (1+x)n=∑k=0n(nk)xk,(1+x)^n=∑_k=0^nnx^k, or more explicitly[13] (1+x)n=1+nx+n(n−1)2!x2+n(n−1)(n−2)3!x3+⋯+nxn−1+xn.(1+x)^n=1+nx+n(n-1)/2!x^2+n(n-1)(n-2)/3!x^3+⋯+nx^n-1+x^n.
