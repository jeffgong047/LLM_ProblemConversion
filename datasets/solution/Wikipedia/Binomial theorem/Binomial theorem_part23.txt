Probability: The binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials Xtt∈S{X_t}_t with probability of success p∈[0,1]∈[0,1] all not happening is P(⋂t∈SXtC)=(1−p)|S|=∑n=0|S|(|S|n)(−p)n.(⋂_tX_t^C)=(1-p)^|S|=∑_n=0^|S||S|(-p)^n. An upper bound for this quantity is e−p|S|.^-p|S|.[21] In abstract
