culture: The binomial theorem is mentioned in the Major-General's Song in the comic opera The Pirates of Penzance. Professor Moriarty is described by Sherlock Holmes as having written a treatise on the binomial theorem. The Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, using the heteronym √Ålvaro de Campos, wrote that "Newton's Binomial is as beautiful as the Venus de Milo. The truth is that few people notice it."[23] In the 2014 film The Imitation Game, Alan Turing makes reference to Isaac Newton's work on the binomial theorem during his first meeting with Commander Denniston at Bletchley Park.
