algebra: The binomial theorem is valid more generally for two elements x and y in a ring, or even a semiring, provided that xy = yx. For example, it holds for two n Ã— n matrices, provided that those matrices commute; this is useful in computing powers of a matrix.[22] The binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the polynomial sequence {1, x, x2, x3, ...} is of binomial type.
