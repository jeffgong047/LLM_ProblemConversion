explanation: Visualisation of binomial expansion up to the 4th power For positive values of a and b, the binomial theorem with n = 2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side a + b can be cut into a square of side a, a square of side b, and two rectangles with sides a and b. With n = 3, the theorem states that a cube of side a + b can be cut into a cube of side a, a cube of side b, three a × a × b rectangular boxes, and three a × b × b rectangular boxes. In calculus, this picture also gives a geometric proof of the derivative (xn)′=nxn−1:(x^n)'=nx^n-1:[14] if one sets a=x=x and b=Δx,=, interpreting b as an infinitesimal change in a, then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube, (x+Δx)n,(x+)^n, where the coefficient of the linear term (in Δx) is nxn−1,^n-1, the area of the n faces, each of dimension n − 1: (x+Δx)n=xn+nxn−1Δx+(n2)xn−2(Δx)2+⋯.(x+)^n=x^n+nx^n-1+n2x^n-2()^2+⋯. Substituting this into the definition of the derivative via a difference quotient and taking limits means that the higher order terms, (Δx)2()^2 and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula (xn)′=nxn−1,(x^n)'=nx^n-1, interpreted as "the infinitesimal rate of change in volume of an n-cube as side length varies is the area of n of its (n − 1)-dimensional faces". If one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains Cavalieri's quadrature formula, the integral ∫xn−1dx=1nxn^n-1 dx=1nx^n – see proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula for details.[14] Binomial
