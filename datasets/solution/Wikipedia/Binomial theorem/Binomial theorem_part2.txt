History: Special cases of the binomial theorem were known since at least the 4th century BC when Greek mathematician Euclid mentioned the special case of the binomial theorem for exponent 2.[1] Greek mathematican Diophantus cubed various binomials, including n−1-1.[1] Indian mathematican Aryabhata's method for finding cube roots, from around 510 CE, suggests that he knew the binomial formula for exponent 3.[1] Binomial coefficients, as combinatorial quantities expressing the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n without replacement, were of interest to ancient Indian mathematicians. The earliest known reference to this combinatorial problem is the Chandaḥśāstra by the Indian lyricist Pingala (c. 200 BC), which contains a method for its solution.[2]: 230 The commentator Halayudha from the 10th century AD explains this method.[2][page needed] By the 6th century AD, the Indian mathematicians probably knew how to express this as a quotient n!(n−k)!k!n!/(n-k)!k!,[3] and a clear statement of this rule can be found in the 12th century text Lilavati by Bhaskara.[3] The first formulation of the binomial theorem and the table of binomial coefficients, to our knowledge, can be found in a work by Al-Karaji, quoted by Al-Samaw'al in his "al-Bahir".[4][5][6] Al-Karaji described the triangular pattern of the binomial coefficients[7] and also provided a mathematical proof of both the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, using an early form of mathematical induction.[7] The Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam was probably familiar with the formula to higher orders, although many of his mathematical works are lost.[1] The binomial expansions of small degrees were known in the 13th century mathematical works of Yang Hui[8] and also Chu Shih-Chieh.[1] Yang Hui attributes the method to a much earlier 11th century text of Jia Xian, although those writings are now also lost.[2]: 142 In 1544, Michael Stifel introduced the term "binomial coefficient" and showed how to use them to express (1+a)n(1+a)^n in terms of (1+a)n−1(1+a)^n-1, via "Pascal's triangle".[9] Blaise Pascal studied the eponymous triangle comprehensively in his Traité du triangle arithmétique.[10] However, the pattern of numbers was already known to the European mathematicians of the late Renaissance, including Stifel, Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, and Simon Stevin.[9] Isaac Newton is generally credited with discovering the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent, in 1665.[9][11] It was discovered independently in 1670 by James Gregory.[12]
