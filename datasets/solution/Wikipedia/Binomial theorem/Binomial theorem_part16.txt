generalizations: The generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where x and y are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |x| > |y|[Note 1] and define the powers of x + y and x using a holomorphic branch of log defined on an open disk of radius |x| centered at x. The generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements x and y of a Banach algebra as long as xy = yx, and x is invertible, and ‖y/x‖ < 1. A version of the binomial theorem is valid for the following Pochhammer symbol-like family of polynomials: for a given real constant c, define x(0)=1^(0)=1 and x(n)=∏k=1n[x+(k−1)c]^(n)=∏_k=1^n[x+(k-1)c] for n>0.>0. Then[17] (a+b)(n)=∑k=0n(nk)a(n−k)b(k).(a+b)^(n)=∑_k=0^nnka^(n-k)b^(k). The case c = 0 recovers the usual binomial theorem. More generally, a sequence pnn=0∞{p_n}_n=0^∞ of polynomials is said to be of binomial type if deg⁡pn=n_n=n for all n, p0(0)=1_0(0)=1, and pn(x+y)=∑k=0n(nk)pk(x)pn−k(y)_n(x+y)=∑_k=0^nnkp_k(x)p_n-k(y) for all x, y, and n. An operator Q on the space of polynomials is said to be the basis operator of the sequence pnn=0∞{p_n}_n=0^∞ if Qp0=0_0=0 and Qpn=npn−1_n=np_n-1 for all n⩾1⩾1. A sequence pnn=0∞{p_n}_n=0^∞ is binomial if and only if its basis operator is a Delta operator.[18] Writing Ea^a for the shift by a operator, the Delta operators corresponding to the above "Pochhammer" families of polynomials are the backward difference I−E−c-E^-c for c>0>0, the ordinary derivative for c=0=0, and the forward difference E−c−I^-c-I for c<0<0.
