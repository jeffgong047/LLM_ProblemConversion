e: The number e is often defined by the formula e=limn→∞(1+1n)n.=lim_n→∞(1+1/n)^n. Applying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual infinite series for e. In particular: (1+1n)n=1+(n1)1n+(n2)1n2+(n3)1n3+⋯+(nn)1nn.(1+1/n)^n=1+n11/n+n21/n^2+n31/n^3+⋯+n1/n^n. The kth term of this sum is (nk)1nk=1k!⋅n(n−1)(n−2)⋯(n−k+1)nkn1/n^k=1/k!·n(n-1)(n-2)⋯(n-k+1)/n^k As n → ∞, the rational expression on the right approaches 1, and therefore limn→∞(nk)1nk=1k!.lim_n→∞n1/n^k=1/k!. This indicates that e can be written as a series: e=∑k=0∞1k!=10!+11!+12!+13!+⋯.=∑_k=0^∞1/k!=1/0!+1/1!+1/2!+1/3!+⋯. Indeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an increasing function of n, it follows from the monotone convergence theorem for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to e.
