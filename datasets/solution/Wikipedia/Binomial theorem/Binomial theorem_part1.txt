Each entry is the sum of the two above it. In elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial (x + y)n into a sum involving terms of the form axbyc, where the exponents b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c = n, and the coefficient a of each term is a specific positive integer depending on n and b. For example, for n = 4, (x+y)4=x4+4x3y+6x2y2+4xy3+y4.(x+y)^4=x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4. The coefficient a in the term of axbyc is known as the binomial coefficient (nb)nb or (nc)nc (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying n and b can be arranged to form Pascal's triangle. These numbers also occur in combinatorics, where (nb)nb gives the number of different combinations of b elements that can be chosen from an n-element set. Therefore (nb)nb is often pronounced as "n choose b".
