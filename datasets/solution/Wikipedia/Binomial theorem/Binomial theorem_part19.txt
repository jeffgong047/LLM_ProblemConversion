rule: Main article: General Leibniz rule The general Leibniz rule gives the nth derivative of a product of two functions in a form similar to that of the binomial theorem:[19] (fg)(n)(x)=∑k=0n(nk)f(n−k)(x)g(k)(x).(fg)^(n)(x)=∑_k=0^nnkf^(n-k)(x)g^(k)(x). Here, the superscript (n) indicates the nth derivative of a function. If one sets f(x) = eax and g(x) = ebx, and then cancels the common factor of e(a + b)x from both sides of the result, the ordinary binomial theorem is recovered.[20]
