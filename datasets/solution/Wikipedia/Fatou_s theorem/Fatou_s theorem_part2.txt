theorem: If we have a holomorphic function f defined on the open unit disk D=z:|z|<1𝔻={z:|z|<1}, it is reasonable to ask under what conditions we can extend this function to the boundary of the unit disk. To do this, we can look at what the function looks like on each circle inside the disk centered at 0, each with some radius r. This defines a new function: fr:S1→Cfr(eiθ)=f(reiθ)f_r:S^1→ℂ f_r(e^iθ)=f(re^iθ) where S1:=eiθ:θ∈[0,2π]=z∈C:|z|=1,^1:={e^iθ:θ∈[0,2π]}={z∈ℂ:|z|=1}, is the unit circle. Then it would be expected that the values of the extension of f onto the circle should be the limit of these functions, and so the question reduces to determining when fr_r converges, and in what sense, as r→1→1, and how well defined is this limit. In particular, if the Lp^p norms of these fr_r are well behaved, we have an answer: Theorem. Let f:D→C:𝔻→ℂ be a holomorphic function such that sup0<r<1‖fr‖Lp(S1)<∞,sup_0<r<1f_r_L^p(S^1)<∞, where fr_r are defined as above. Then fr_r converges to some function f1∈Lp(S1)_1^p(S^1) pointwise almost everywhere and in Lp^p norm. That is, |fr(eiθ)−f1(eiθ)|→0foralmosteveryθ∈[0,2π]‖fr−f1‖Lp(S1)→0|f_r(e^iθ)-f_1(e^iθ)| →0 foralmosteveryθ∈[0,2π] f_r-f_1_L^p(S^1) →0 Now, notice that this pointwise limit is a radial limit. That is, the limit being taken is along a straight line from the center of the disk to the boundary of the circle, and the statement above hence says that f(reiθ)→f1(eiθ)foralmosteveryθ.(re^iθ)_1(e^iθ) foralmosteveryθ. The natural question is, with this boundary function defined, will we converge pointwise to this function by taking a limit in any other way? That is, suppose instead of following a straight line to the boundary, we follow an arbitrary curve γ:[0,1)→Dγ:[0,1)→𝔻 converging to some point eiθ^iθ on the boundary. Will f converge to f1(eiθ)_1(e^iθ)? (Note that the above theorem is just the special case of γ(t)=teiθγ(t)=te^iθ). It turns out that the curve γγ needs to be non-tangential, meaning that the curve does not approach its target on the boundary in a way that makes it tangent to the boundary of the circle. In other words, the range of γγ must be contained in a wedge emanating from the limit point. We summarize as follows: Definition. Let γ:[0,1)→Dγ:[0,1)→𝔻 be a continuous path such that limt→1γ(t)=eiθ∈S1lim_t→1γ(t)=e^iθ^1. Define Γα=z:arg⁡z∈[π−α,π+α]Γα(θ)=D∩eiθ(Γα+1)Γ_α ={z:∈[π-α,π+α]} Γ_α(θ) =𝔻^iθ(Γ_α+1) That is, Γα(θ)Γ_α(θ) is the wedge inside the disk with angle 2α2α whose axis passes between eiθ^iθ and zero. We say that γγ converges non-tangentially to eiθ^iθ, or that it is a non-tangential limit, if there exists 0<α<π20<α<π2 such that γγ is contained in Γα(θ)Γ_α(θ) and limt→1γ(t)=eiθlim_t→1γ(t)=e^iθ. Fatou's Theorem. Let f∈Hp(D).^p(𝔻). Then for almost all θ∈[0,2π],θ∈[0,2π], limt→1f(γ(t))=f1(eiθ)lim_t→1f(γ(t))=f_1(e^iθ) for every non-tangential limit γγ converging to eiθ,^iθ, where f1_1 is defined as above.
