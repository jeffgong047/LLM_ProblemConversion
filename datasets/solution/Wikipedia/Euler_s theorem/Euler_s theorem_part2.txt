Proofs: 1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups:[3] The residue classes modulo n that are coprime to n form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n for details). The order of that group is φ(n). Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case φ(n). If a is any number coprime to n then a is in one of these residue classes, and its powers a, a2, ... , ak modulo n form a subgroup of the group of residue classes, with ak ≡ 1 (mod n). Lagrange's theorem says k must divide φ(n), i.e. there is an integer M such that kM = φ(n). This then implies, aφ(n)=akM=(ak)M≡1M=1(modn).^φ(n)=a^kM=(a^k)^M≡1^M=1n. 2. There is also a direct proof:[4][5] Let R = {x1, x2, ... , xφ(n)} be a reduced residue system (mod n) and let a be any integer coprime to n. The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by a permutes the xi: in other words if axj ≡ axk (mod n) then j = k. (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n.[6]) That is, the sets R and aR = {ax1, ax2, ... , axφ(n)}, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod n), are identical (as sets—they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in R is congruent (mod n) to the product of all the numbers in aR: ∏i=1φ(n)xi≡∏i=1φ(n)axi=aφ(n)∏i=1φ(n)xi(modn),∏_i=1^φ(n)x_i≡∏_i=1^φ(n)ax_i=a^φ(n)∏_i=1^φ(n)x_in, and using the cancellation law to cancel each xi gives Euler's theorem: aφ(n)≡1(modn).^φ(n)≡1n.
