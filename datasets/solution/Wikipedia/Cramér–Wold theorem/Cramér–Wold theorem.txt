In mathematics, the Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on Rkℝ^k is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.
Let

Xn=(Xn1,…,Xnk)X_n=(X_n1,…,X_nk)
and

X=(X1,…,Xk) X=(X_1,…,X_k)
be random vectors of dimension k. Then XnX_n converges in distribution to XX if and only if:

∑i=1ktiXni→n→∞D∑i=1ktiXi.∑_i=1^kt_iX_niDn→∞→∑_i=1^kt_iX_i.
for each (t1,…,tk)∈Rk(t_1,…,t_k)∈ℝ^k, that is, if every fixed linear combination of the coordinates of XnX_n converges in distribution to the correspondent linear combination of coordinates of XX.[1]
If XnX_n takes values in R+kℝ_+^k, then the statement is also true with (t1,…,tk)∈R+k(t_1,…,t_k)∈ℝ_+^k.[2]
