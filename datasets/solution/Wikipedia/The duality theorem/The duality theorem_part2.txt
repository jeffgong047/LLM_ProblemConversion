dualities: Probably the most general duality that is classically referred to as "Stone duality" is the duality between the category Sob of sober spaces with continuous functions and the category SFrm of spatial frames with appropriate frame homomorphisms. The dual category of SFrm is the category of spatial locales denoted by SLoc. The categorical equivalence of Sob and SLoc is the basis for the mathematical area of pointless topology, which is devoted to the study of Loc—the category of all locales, of which SLoc is a full subcategory. The involved constructions are characteristic for this kind of duality, and are detailed below. Now one can easily obtain a number of other dualities by restricting to certain special classes of sober spaces: The category CohSp of coherent sober spaces (and coherent maps) is equivalent to the category CohLoc of coherent (or spectral) locales (and coherent maps), on the assumption of the Boolean prime ideal theorem (in fact, this statement is equivalent to that assumption). The significance of this result stems from the fact that CohLoc in turn is dual to the category DLat01 of bounded distributive lattices. Hence, DLat01 is dual to CohSp—one obtains Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices. When restricting further to coherent sober spaces that are Hausdorff, one obtains the category Stone of so-called Stone spaces. On the side of DLat01, the restriction yields the subcategory Bool of Boolean algebras. Thus one obtains Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras. Stone's representation for distributive lattices can be extended via an equivalence of coherent spaces and Priestley spaces (ordered topological spaces, that are compact and totally order-disconnected). One obtains a representation of distributive lattices via ordered topologies: Priestley's representation theorem for distributive lattices. Many other Stone-type dualities could be added to these basic dualities. Duality of sober spaces and spatial
