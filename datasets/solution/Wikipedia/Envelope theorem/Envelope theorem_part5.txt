theory: Theorem 1 implies Hotelling's lemma at any differentiability point of the profit function, and Theorem 2 implies the producer surplus formula. Formally, let π(p)π(p) denote the indirect profit function of a price-taking firm with production set X⊆RL⊆ℝ^L facing prices p∈RL∈ℝ^L, and let x∗(p)^∗(p) denote the firm's supply function, i.e., π(p)=maxx∈Xp⋅x=p⋅x∗(p).π(p)=max_xp=p^∗(p). Let t=pi=p_i (the price of good i) and fix the other goods' prices at p−i∈RL−1_-i∈ℝ^L-1. Applying Theorem 1 to f(x,t)=txi+p−i⋅x−i(x,t)=tx_i+p_-i_-i yields ∂π(p)∂pi=xi∗(p)∂π(p)/_i=x_i^∗(p) (the firm's optimal supply of good i). Applying Theorem 2 (whose assumptions are verified when pi_i is restricted to a bounded interval) yields π(t,p−i)−π(0,p−i)=∫0pixi∗(s,p−i)ds,π(t,p_-i)-π(0,p_-i)=∫_0^p_ix_i^∗(s,p_-i)ds, i.e. the producer surplus π(t,p−i)−π(0,p−i)π(t,p_-i)-π(0,p_-i) can be obtained by integrating under the firm's supply curve for good i.
