spaces: For a multidimensional parameter space T⊆RK⊆ℝ^K, Theorem 1 can be applied to partial and directional derivatives of the value function.[citation needed] If both the objective function f and the value function V are (totally) differentiable in t, Theorem 1 implies the envelope formula for their gradients:[citation needed] ∇V(t)=∇tf(x,t)(t)=∇_tf(x,t) for each x∈X∗(t)^∗(t). While total differentiability of the value function may not be easy to ensure, Theorem 2 can be still applied along any smooth path connecting two parameter values t0_0 and t.[citation needed] Namely, suppose that functions f(x,⋅)(x,·) are differentiable for all x∈X with |∇tf(x,t)|≤B|∇_tf(x,t)| for all x∈X,, t∈T. A smooth path from t0_0 to t is described by a differentiable mapping γ:[0,1]→Tγ:[0,1] with a bounded derivative, such that γ(0)=t0γ(0)=t_0 and γ(1)=tγ(1)=t.[citation needed] Theorem 2 implies that for any such smooth path, the change of the value function can be expressed as the path integral of the partial gradient ∇tf(x∗(t),t)∇_tf(x^∗(t),t) of the objective function along the path:[citation needed] V(t)−V(t0)=∫γ∇tf(x∗(s),s)⋅ds.(t)-V(t_0)=∫_γ∇_tf(x^∗(s),s). In particular, for t=t0=t_0, this establishes that cyclic path integrals along any smooth path γγ must be zero:[citation needed] ∫∇tf(x∗(s),s)⋅ds=0.∫∇_tf(x^∗(s),s)=0. This "integrability condition" plays an important role in mechanism design with multidimensional types, constraining what kind of choice rules x∗^∗ can be sustained by mechanism-induced menus X⊆X¯⊆X̅.[citation needed] In application to producer theory, with x∈X⊆RL⊆ℝ^L being the firm's production vector and t∈RL∈ℝ^L being the price vector, f(x,t)=t⋅x(x,t)=t, and the integrability condition says that any rationalizable supply function x∗^∗ must satisfy ∫x∗(s)⋅ds=0.^∗(s)=0. When x∗^∗ is continuously differentiable, this integrability condition is equivalent to the symmetry of the substitution matrix (∂xi∗(t)/∂tj)i,j=1L(_i^∗(t)/_j)_i,j=1^L. (In consumer theory, the same argument applied to the expenditure minimization problem yields symmetry of the Slutsky matrix.) Applications to parameterized
