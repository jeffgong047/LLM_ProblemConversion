constraints: Suppose now that the feasible set X(t)(t) depends on the parameter, i.e., V(t)=supx∈X(t)f(x,t)(t)=sup_x(t)f(x,t) X∗(t)=x∈X(t):f(x,t)=V(t),^∗(t)={x(t):f(x,t)=V(t)}, where X(t)=x∈X:g(x,t)≥0(t)={x:g(x,t)≥0} for some g:X×[0,1]→RK.:X×[0,1]→ℝ^K. Suppose that X is a convex set, f and g are concave in x, and there exists x^∈Xx̂ such that g(x^,t)>0(x̂,t)>0 for all t∈[0,1]∈[0,1]. Under these assumptions, it is well known that the above constrained optimization program can be represented as a saddle-point problem for the Lagrangian L(x,λ,t)=f(x,t)+λ⋅g(x,t)(x,λ,t)=f(x,t)+λ(x,t), where λ∈R+Kλ∈ℝ_+^K is the vector of Lagrange multipliers chosen by the adversary to minimize the Lagrangian.[20][page needed][21][page needed] This allows the application of Milgrom and Segal's (2002, Theorem 4) envelope theorem for saddle-point problems,[5] under the additional assumptions that X is a compact set in a normed linear space, f and g are continuous in x, and ft_t and gt_t are continuous in (x,t)(x,t). In particular, letting (x∗(t),λ∗(t))(x^∗(t),λ^∗(t)) denote the Lagrangian's saddle point for parameter value t, the theorem implies that V is absolutely continuous and satisfies V(t)=V(0)+∫0tLt(x∗(s),λ∗(s),s)ds.(t)=V(0)+∫_0^tL_t(x^∗(s),λ^∗(s),s)ds. For the special case in which f(x,t)(x,t) is independent of t, K=1=1, and g(x,t)=h(x)+t(x,t)=h(x)+t, the formula implies that V′(t)=Lt(x∗(t),λ∗(t),t)=λ∗(t)^'(t)=L_t(x^∗(t),λ^∗(t),t)=λ^∗(t) for a.e. t. That is, the Lagrange multiplier λ∗(t)λ^∗(t) on the constraint is its "shadow price" in the optimization program.[21][page needed] Other
