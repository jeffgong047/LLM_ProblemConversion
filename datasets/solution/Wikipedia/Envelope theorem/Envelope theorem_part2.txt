Statement: Let f(x,α)(x,α) and gj(x,α),j=1,2,…,m_j(x,α),j=1,2,…,m be real-valued continuously differentiable functions on Rn+lℝ^n+l, where x∈Rn∈ℝ^n are choice variables and α∈Rlα∈ℝ^l are parameters, and consider the problem of choosing x, for a given αα, so as to: maxxf(x,α)max_xf(x,α) subject to gj(x,α)≥0,j=1,2,…,m_j(x,α)≥0,j=1,2,…,m and x≥0≥0. The Lagrangian expression of this problem is given by L(x,λ,α)=f(x,α)+λ⋅g(x,α)ℒ(x,λ,α)=f(x,α)+λ(x,α) where λ∈Rmλ∈ℝ^m are the Lagrange multipliers. Now let x∗(α)^∗(α) and λ∗(α)λ^∗(α) together be the solution that maximizes the objective function f subject to the constraints (and hence are saddle points of the Lagrangian), L∗(α)≡f(x∗(α),α)+λ∗(α)⋅g(x∗(α),α),ℒ^∗(α)(x^∗(α),α)+λ^∗(α)(x^∗(α),α), and define the value function V(α)≡f(x∗(α),α).(α)(x^∗(α),α). Then we have the following theorem.[3][4] Theorem: Assume that V and Lℒ are continuously differentiable. Then ∂V(α)∂αk=∂L∗(α)∂αk=∂L(x∗(α),λ∗(α),α)∂αk,k=1,2,…,l(α)/∂α_k=∂ℒ^∗(α)/∂α_k=∂ℒ(x^∗(α),λ^∗(α),α)/∂α_k,k=1,2,…,l where ∂L/∂αk=∂f/∂αk+λ⋅∂g/∂αk∂ℒ/∂α_k=/∂α_k+λ·/∂α_k. For arbitrary choice
