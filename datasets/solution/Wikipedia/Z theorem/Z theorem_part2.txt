Details: The original paper Glauberman (1966) gave several criteria for an element to lie outside Z*(G). Its theorem 4 states: For an element t in T, it is necessary and sufficient for t to lie outside Z*(G) that there is some g in G and abelian subgroup U of T satisfying the following properties: g normalizes both U and the centralizer CT(U), that is g is contained in N = NG(U) ∩ NG(CT(U)) t is contained in U and tg ≠ gt U is generated by the N-conjugates of t the exponent of U is equal to the order of t Moreover g may be chosen to have prime power order if t is in the center of T, and g may be chosen in T otherwise. A simple corollary is that an element t in T is not in Z*(G) if and only if there is some s ≠ t such that s and t commute and s and t are G-conjugate. A generalization to odd primes was recorded in Guralnick & Robinson (1993): if t is an element of prime order p and the commutator [t, g] has order coprime to p for all g, then t is central modulo the p′-core. This was also generalized to odd primes and to compact Lie groups in Mislin & Thévenaz (1991), which also contains several useful results in the finite case. Henke & Semeraro (2015) have also studied an extension of the Z* theorem to pairs of groups (G, H) with H a normal subgroup of G. Works
