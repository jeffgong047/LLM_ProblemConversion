In mathematics, George Glauberman's Z* theorem is stated as follows: Z* theorem: Let G be a finite group, with O(G) being its maximal normal subgroup of odd order. If T is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G containing an involution not conjugate in G to any other element of T, then the involution lies in Z*(G), which is the inverse image in G of the center of G/O(G). This generalizes the Brauer–Suzuki theorem (and the proof uses the Brauer–Suzuki theorem to deal with some small cases).
