plane: A particularly useful statement proved using the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle bounds holomorphic functions on a sector of the complex plane if it is bounded on its boundary. This statement can be used to give a complex analytic proof of the Hardy's uncertainty principle, which states that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay faster than exponentially.[3] Proposition. Let F be a function that is holomorphic in a sector S=z|α<arg⁡z<β={z | α<<β} of central angle β−α=π/λβ-α=π/λ, and continuous on its boundary. If |F(z)|≤1|F(z)|≤1 (1) for z∈∂S∈, and |F(z)|≤eC|z|ρ|F(z)|^C|z|^ρ (2) for all z∈S, where ρ∈[0,λ)ρ∈[0,λ) and C>0>0, then |F(z)|≤1|F(z)|≤1 holds also for all z∈S.
