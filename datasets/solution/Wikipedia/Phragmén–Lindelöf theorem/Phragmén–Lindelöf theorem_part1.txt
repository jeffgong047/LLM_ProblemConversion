In complex analysis, the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle (or method), first formulated by Lars Edvard Phragmén (1863–1937) and Ernst Leonard Lindelöf (1870–1946) in 1908, is a technique which employs an auxiliary, parameterized function to prove the boundedness of a holomorphic function f (i.e, |f(z)|<M(z∈Ω)|f(z)|<M (z∈Ω)) on an unbounded domain ΩΩ when an additional (usually mild) condition constraining the growth of |f||f| on ΩΩ is given. It is a generalization of the maximum modulus principle, which is only applicable to bounded domains.
