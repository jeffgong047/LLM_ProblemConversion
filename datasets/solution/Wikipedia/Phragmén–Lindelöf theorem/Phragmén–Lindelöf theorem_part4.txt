application: To continue the example above, we can impose a growth condition on a holomorphic function f that prevents it from "blowing up" and allows the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle to be applied. To this end, we now include the condition that |f(z)|<exp⁡(Aexp⁡(c⋅|ℜ(z)|))|f(z)|<exp(Aexp(c·|(z)|)) for some real constants c<1<1 and A<∞<∞, for all z∈S. It can then be shown that |f(z)|≤1|f(z)|≤1 for all z∈∂S∈ implies that |f(z)|≤1|f(z)|≤1 in fact holds for all z∈S. Thus, we have the following proposition: Proposition. Let S=z:ℑ(z)∈(−π2,π2),S¯=z:ℑ(z)∈[−π2,π2].={z:(z)∈(-π/2,π/2)}, S={z:(z)∈[-π/2,π/2]}. Let f be holomorphic on S and continuous on S¯S, and suppose there exist real constants c<1,A<∞<1,<∞ such that |f(z)|<exp⁡(Aexp⁡(c⋅|ℜ(z)|))|f(z)|<exp(Aexp(c·|(z)|)) for all z∈S and |f(z)|≤1|f(z)|≤1 for all z∈S¯∖S=∂S∈S=. Then |f(z)|≤1|f(z)|≤1 for all z∈S. Note that this conclusion fails when c=1=1, precisely as the motivating counterexample in the previous section demonstrates. The proof of this statement employs a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument:[2] Proof: (Sketch) We fix b∈(c,1)∈(c,1) and define for each ϵ>0ϵ>0 the auxiliary function hϵ_ϵ by hϵ(z)=e−ϵ(ebz+e−bz)_ϵ(z)=e^-ϵ(e^bz+e^-bz). Moreover, for a given a>0>0, we define Sa_a to be the open rectangle in the complex plane enclosed within the vertices a±iπ/2,−a±iπ/2{aπ/2,-aπ/2}. Now, fix ϵ>0ϵ>0 and consider the function fhϵ_ϵ. It can be shown that |f(z)hϵ(z)|→0|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|→0 as |ℜ(z)|→∞|(z)|→∞. This allows us to find an x0_0 such that |f(z)hϵ(z)|≤1|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|≤1 whenever z∈S¯∈S and |ℜ(z)|≥x0|(z)|_0. Because Sx0_x_0 is a bounded region, and |f(z)hϵ(z)|≤1|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|≤1 for all z∈∂Sx0∈_x_0, the maximum modulus principle implies that |f(z)hϵ(z)|≤1|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|≤1 for all z∈Sx0¯∈S_x_0. Since |f(z)hϵ(z)|≤1|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|≤1 whenever z∈S and |ℜ(z)|>x0|(z)|>x_0, |f(z)hϵ(z)|≤1|f(z)h_ϵ(z)|≤1 in fact holds for all z∈S. Finally, because fhϵ→f_ϵ as ϵ→0ϵ→0, we conclude that |f(z)|≤1|f(z)|≤1 for all z∈S. Q.E.D. Phragmén–Lindelöf principle for a sector in the complex
