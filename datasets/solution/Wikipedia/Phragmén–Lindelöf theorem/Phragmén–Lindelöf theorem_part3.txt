technique: Suppose we are given a holomorphic function f and an unbounded region S, and we want to show that |f|≤M|f| on S. In a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument, we introduce a certain multiplicative factor hϵ_ϵ satisfying limϵ→0hϵ=1lim_ϵ→0h_ϵ=1 to "subdue" the growth of f. In particular, hϵ_ϵ is chosen such that (i): fhϵ_ϵ is holomorphic for all ϵ>0ϵ>0 and |fhϵ|≤M|fh_ϵ| on the boundary ∂Sbdd_bdd of an appropriate bounded subregion Sbdd⊂S_bdd; and (ii): the asymptotic behavior of fhϵ_ϵ allows us to establish that |fhϵ|≤M|fh_ϵ| for z∈S∖Sbdd¯∖S_bdd (i.e., the unbounded part of S outside the closure of the bounded subregion). This allows us to apply the maximum modulus principle to first conclude that |fhϵ|≤M|fh_ϵ| on Sbdd¯S_bdd and then extend the conclusion to all z∈S. Finally, we let ϵ→0ϵ→0 so that f(z)hϵ(z)→f(z)(z)h_ϵ(z)(z) for every z∈S in order to conclude that |f|≤M|f| on S. In the literature of complex analysis, there are many examples of the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle applied to unbounded regions of differing types, and also a version of this principle may be applied in a similar fashion to subharmonic and superharmonic functions.
