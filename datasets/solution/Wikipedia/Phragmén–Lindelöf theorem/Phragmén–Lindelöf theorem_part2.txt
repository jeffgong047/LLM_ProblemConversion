Background: In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the modulus (absolute value) of a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a bounded region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region. More precisely, if a non-constant function f:C→C:ℂ→ℂ is holomorphic in a bounded region[1] ΩΩ and continuous on its closure Ω¯=Ω∪∂ΩΩ=Ω∪∂Ω, then |f(z0)|<supz∈∂Ω|f(z)||f(z_0)|<sup_z∈∂Ω|f(z)| for all z0∈Ω_0∈Ω. This is known as the maximum modulus principle. (In fact, since Ω¯Ω is compact and |f||f| is continuous, there actually exists some w0∈∂Ω_0∈∂Ω such that |f(w0)|=supz∈Ω|f(z)||f(w_0)|=sup_z∈Ω|f(z)|.) The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary. However, the maximum modulus principle cannot be applied to an unbounded region of the complex plane. As a concrete example, let us examine the behavior of the holomorphic function f(z)=exp⁡(exp⁡(z))(z)=exp(exp(z)) in the unbounded strip S=z:ℑ(z)∈(−π2,π2)={z:(z)∈(-π/2,π/2)}. Although |f(x±πi/2)|=1|f(x±/2)|=1, so that |f||f| is bounded on boundary ∂S, |f||f| grows rapidly without bound when |z|→∞|z|→∞ along the positive real axis. The difficulty here stems from the extremely fast growth of |f||f| along the positive real axis. If the growth rate of |f||f| is guaranteed to not be "too fast," as specified by an appropriate growth condition, the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle can be applied to show that boundedness of f on the region's boundary implies that f is in fact bounded in the whole region, effectively extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions.
