Mathematic group theory For the counting result sometimes called "Burnside's theorem", see Burnside's lemma. William Burnside. In mathematics, Burnside's theorem in group theory states that if G is a finite group of order paqb^aq^b where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are non-negative integers, then G is solvable. Hence each non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes.
