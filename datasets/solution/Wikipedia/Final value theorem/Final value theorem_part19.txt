holds: For example, for a system described by transfer function H(s)=6s+2,(s)=6/s+2, the impulse response converges to limt→∞h(t)=lims→06ss+2=0.lim_t→∞h(t)=lim_s→06s/s+2=0. That is, the system returns to zero after being disturbed by a short impulse. However, the Laplace transform of the unit step response is G(s)=1s6s+2(s)=1/s6/s+2 and so the step response converges to limt→∞g(t)=lims→0ss6s+2=62=3lim_t→∞g(t)=lim_s→0s/s6/s+2=6/2=3 So a zero-state system will follow an exponential rise to a final value of 3.
