derivative: Suppose that all of the following conditions are satisfied: f:(0,∞)→C:(0,∞)→ℂ is continuously differentiable and both f and f′' have a Laplace transform f′' is absolutely integrable - that is, ∫0∞|f′(τ)|dτ∫_0^∞|f'(τ)| dτ is finite limt→∞f(t)lim_t→∞f(t) exists and is finite Then lims→0+sF(s)=limt→∞f(t)lim_s→0^+sF(s)=lim_t→∞f(t).[8] Remark The proof uses the dominated convergence theorem.[8] Final Value Theorem for the mean of a
