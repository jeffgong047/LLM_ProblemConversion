(January 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mathematical analysis, the final value theorem (FVT) is one of several similar theorems used to relate frequency domain expressions to the time domain behavior as time approaches infinity.[1][2][3][4] Mathematically, if f(t)(t) in continuous time has (unilateral) Laplace transform F(s)(s), then a final value theorem establishes conditions under which limt→∞f(t)=lims→0sF(s)lim_t→∞f(t)=lim_s → 0sF(s) Likewise, if f[k][k] in discrete time has (unilateral) Z-transform F(z)(z), then a final value theorem establishes conditions under which limk→∞f[k]=limz→1(z−1)F(z)lim_k→∞f[k]=lim_z→1(z-1)F(z) An Abelian final value theorem makes assumptions about the time-domain behavior of f(t)(t) (or f[k][k]) to calculate lims→0sF(s)lim_s → 0sF(s). Conversely, a Tauberian final value theorem makes assumptions about the frequency-domain behaviour of F(s)(s) to calculate limt→∞f(t)lim_t→∞f(t) (or limk→∞f[k]lim_k→∞f[k]) (see Abelian and Tauberian theorems for integral transforms).
