functions: Suppose that f:[0,∞)→R:[0,∞)→ℝ is continuous and absolutely integrable in [0,∞)[0,∞). Suppose further that f is asymptotically equal to a finite sum of periodic functions fas_as, that is |f(t)−fas(t)|<ϕ(t)|f(t)-f_as(t)|<ϕ(t) where ϕ(t)ϕ(t) is absolutely integrable in [0,∞)[0,∞) and vanishes at infinity. Then lims→0sF(s)=limt→∞1t∫0tf(x)dxlim_s→0sF(s)=lim_t→∞1/t∫_0^tf(x) dx.[10] Final Value Theorem for a function that diverges to
