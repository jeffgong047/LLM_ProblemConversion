Theorem: Suppose that f:(0,∞)→C:(0,∞)→ℂ is bounded and measurable and limt→∞f(t)=α∈Clim_t→∞f(t)=α∈ℂ. Then F(s)(s) exists for all s>0>0 and lims→0+sF(s)=αlim_s → 0^+sF(s)=α.[7] Elementary proof[7] Suppose for convenience that |f(t)|≤1|f(t)|≤1 on (0,∞)(0,∞), and let α=limt→∞f(t)α=lim_t→∞f(t). Let ϵ>0ϵ>0, and choose A so that |f(t)−α|<ϵ|f(t)-α|<ϵ for all t>A>A. Since s∫0∞e−stdt=1∫_0^∞e^-st dt=1, for every s>0>0 we have sF(s)−α=s∫0∞(f(t)−α)e−stdt;(s)-α=s∫_0^∞(f(t)-α)e^-st dt; hence |sF(s)−α|≤s∫0A|f(t)−α|e−stdt+s∫A∞|f(t)−α|e−stdt≤2s∫0Ae−stdt+ϵs∫A∞e−stdt=I+II.|sF(s)-α|∫_0^A|f(t)-α|e^-st dt+s∫_A^∞|f(t)-α|e^-st dt≤2s∫_0^Ae^-st dt+∫_A^∞e^-st dt=I+II. Now for every s>0>0 we have II<ϵs∫0∞e−stdt=ϵ<∫_0^∞e^-st dt=ϵ. On the other hand, since A<∞<∞ is fixed it is clear that lims→0I=0lim_s→0I=0, and so |sF(s)−α|<ϵ|sF(s)-α|<ϵ if s>0>0 is small enough.
