Applications: Final value theorems for obtaining lims→0sF(s)lim_s → 0sF(s) have applications in probability and statistics to calculate the moments of a random variable. Let R(x)(x) be cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable X and let ρ(s)ρ(s) be the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of R(x)(x). Then the n-th moment of X can be calculated as E[Xn]=(−1)ndnρ(s)dsn|s=0[X^n]=(-1)^n.d^nρ(s)/ds^n|_s=0 The strategy is to write dnρ(s)dsn=F(G1(s),G2(s),…,Gk(s),…)d^nρ(s)/ds^n=ℱ(G_1(s),G_2(s),…,G_k(s),…) where F(…)ℱ(…) is continuous and for each k, Gk(s)=sFk(s)_k(s)=sF_k(s) for a function Fk(s)_k(s). For each k, put fk(t)_k(t) as the inverse Laplace transform of Fk(s)_k(s), obtain limt→∞fk(t)lim_t→∞f_k(t), and apply a final value theorem to deduce lims→0Gk(s)=lims→0sFk(s)=limt→∞fk(t)lim_s → 0G_k(s)=lim_s → 0sF_k(s)=lim_t→∞f_k(t). Then dnρ(s)dsn|s=0=F(lims→0G1(s),lims→0G2(s),…,lims→0Gk(s),…).d^nρ(s)/ds^n|_s=0=ℱ(lim_s → 0G_1(s),lim_s → 0G_2(s),…,lim_s → 0G_k(s),…) and hence E[Xn][X^n] is obtained.
