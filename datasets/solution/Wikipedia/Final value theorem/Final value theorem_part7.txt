Theorem: Suppose that every pole of F(s)(s) is either in the open left half-plane or at the origin. Then one of the following occurs: sF(s)→L∈R(s)∈ℝ as s↓0↓0, and limt→∞f(t)=Llim_t→∞f(t)=L. sF(s)→+∞∈R(s)→+∞∈ℝ as s↓0↓0, and f(t)→+∞(t)→+∞ as t→∞→∞. sF(s)→−∞∈R(s)→-∞∈ℝ as s↓0↓0, and f(t)→−∞(t)→-∞ as t→∞→∞. In particular, if s=0=0 is a multiple pole of F(s)(s) then case 2 or 3 applies (f(t)→+∞(t)→+∞ or f(t)→−∞(t)→-∞).[5] Generalized Final Value
