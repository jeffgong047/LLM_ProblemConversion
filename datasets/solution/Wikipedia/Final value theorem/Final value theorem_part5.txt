derivative: Suppose that f(t)(t) and f′(t)'(t) both have Laplace transforms that exist for all s>0>0. If limt→∞f(t)lim_t→∞f(t) exists and lims→0sF(s)lim_s → 0sF(s) exists then limt→∞f(t)=lims→0sF(s)lim_t→∞f(t)=lim_s → 0sF(s).[3]: Theorem 2.36 [4]: 20 [6] Remark Both limits must exist for the theorem to hold. For example, if f(t)=sin⁡(t)(t)=sin(t) then limt→∞f(t)lim_t→∞f(t) does not exist, but lims→0sF(s)=lims→0ss2+1=0lim_s → 0sF(s)=lim_s → 0s/s^2+1=0.[3]: Example 2.37 [4]: 20 Improved Tauberian converse Final Value
