systems: The sampled-data system of the above continuous-time LTI system at the aperiodic sampling times ti,i=1,2,..._i,i=1,2,... is the discrete-time system x(ti+1)=Φ(hi)x(ti)+Γ(hi)u(ti)𝐱(t_i+1)=Φ(h_i)𝐱(t_i)+Γ(h_i)𝐮(t_i) y(ti)=Cx(ti)𝐲(t_i)=𝐂𝐱(t_i) where hi=ti+1−ti_i=t_i+1-t_i and Φ(hi)=eAhiΦ(h_i)=e^𝐀h_i, Γ(hi)=∫0hieAsdsΓ(h_i)=∫_0^h_ie^𝐀s ds The final value of this system in response to a step input u(t)𝐮(t) with amplitude R is the same as the final value of its original continuous-time system.
