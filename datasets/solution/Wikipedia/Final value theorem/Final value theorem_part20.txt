hold: For a system described by the transfer function H(s)=9s2+9,(s)=9/s^2+9, the final value theorem appears to predict the final value of the impulse response to be 0 and the final value of the step response to be 1. However, neither time-domain limit exists, and so the final value theorem predictions are not valid. In fact, both the impulse response and step response oscillate, and (in this special case) the final value theorem describes the average values around which the responses oscillate. There are two checks performed in Control theory which confirm valid results for the Final Value Theorem: All non-zero roots of the denominator of H(s)(s) must have negative real parts. H(s)(s) must not have more than one pole at the origin. Rule 1 was not satisfied in this example, in that the roots of the denominator are 0+j30+j3 and 0âˆ’j30-j3. Final value theorems for the Z
