counter-example: The field of rational numbers K=Q=ℚ is 2-special since it contains η2=0η_2=0, but neither i, η3=2η_3=√(2) nor iη3=−2η_3=√(-2). The special set is S0=2_0={2}. Thus, the special case in the Grunwald–Wang theorem occurs when n is divisible by 8, and S contains 2. This explains Wang's counter-example and shows that it is minimal. It is also seen that an element in Qℚ is an nth power if it is a p-adic nth power for all p. The field K=Q(7)=ℚ(√(7)) is 2-special as well, but with S0=∅_0=∅. This explains the other counter-example above.[1] See
