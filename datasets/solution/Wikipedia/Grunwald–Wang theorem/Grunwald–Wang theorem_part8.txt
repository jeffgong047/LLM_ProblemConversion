theorem: Consider a number field K and a natural number n. Let S be a finite (possibly empty) set of primes of K and put K(n,S):=x∈K∣x∈Kpnforallp∉S.(n,S):={x_𝔭^n}𝔭}. The Grunwald–Wang theorem says that K(n,S)=Kn(n,S)=K^n unless we are in the special case which occurs when the following two conditions both hold: K is s-special with an s such that 2s+12^s+1 divides n. S contains the special set S0_0 consisting of those (necessarily 2-adic) primes p𝔭 such that Kp_𝔭 is s-special. In the special case the failure of the Hasse principle is finite of order 2: the kernel of K×/K×n→∏p∉SKp×/Kp×n^×/K^→∏_𝔭K_𝔭^×/K_𝔭^ is Z/2Z, generated by the element ηns+1. Explanation of Wang's
