locally: The element 16 in the rationals is an 8th power at all places except 2, but is not an 8th power in the 2-adic numbers. It is clear that 16 is not a 2-adic 8th power, and hence not a rational 8th power, since the 2-adic valuation of 16 is 4 which is not divisible by 8. Generally, 16 is an 8th power in a field K if and only if the polynomial X8−16^8-16 has a root in K. Write X8−16=(X4−4)(X4+4)=(X2−2)(X2+2)(X2−2X+2)(X2+2X+2).^8-16=(X^4-4)(X^4+4)=(X^2-2)(X^2+2)(X^2-2X+2)(X^2+2X+2). Thus, 16 is an 8th power in K if and only if 2, −2 or −1 is a square in K. Let p be any odd prime. It follows from the multiplicativity of the Legendre symbol that 2, −2 or −1 is a square modulo p. Hence, by Hensel's lemma, 2, −2 or −1 is a square in Qpℚ_p. An element that is an nth power everywhere locally but not
