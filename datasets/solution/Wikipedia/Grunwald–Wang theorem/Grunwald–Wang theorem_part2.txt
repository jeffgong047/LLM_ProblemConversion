History: Some days later I was with Artin in his office when Wang appeared. He said he had a counterexample to a lemma which had been used in the proof. An hour or two later, he produced a counterexample to the theorem itself... Of course he [Artin] was astonished, as were all of us students, that a famous theorem with two published proofs, one of which we had all heard in the seminar without our noticing anything, could be wrong. John Tate, quoted by Peter Roquette (2005, p.30) Grunwald (1933), a student of Helmut Hasse, gave an incorrect proof of the erroneous statement that an element in a number field is an nth power if it is an nth power locally almost everywhere. George Whaples (1942) gave another incorrect proof of this incorrect statement. However Wang (1948) discovered the following counter-example: 16 is a p-adic 8th power for all odd primes p, but is not a rational or 2-adic 8th power. In his doctoral thesis Wang (1950) written under Emil Artin, Wang gave and proved the correct formulation of Grunwald's assertion, by describing the rare cases when it fails. This result is what is now known as the Grunwaldâ€“Wang theorem. The history of Wang's counterexample is discussed by Peter Roquette (2005, section 5.3) Wang's
