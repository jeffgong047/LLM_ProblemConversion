counter-example: Wang's counterexample has the following interesting consequence showing that one cannot always find a cyclic Galois extension of a given degree of a number field in which finitely many given prime places split in a specified way: There exists no cyclic degree 8 extension K/Q/ℚ in which the prime 2 is totally inert (i.e., such that K2/Q2_2/ℚ_2 is unramified of degree 8).
