statement: Theorem: A quantum circuit using only the following elements can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer: Preparation of qubits in computational basis states, Clifford gates (Hadamard gates, controlled NOT gates, phase gate S ), and Measurements in the computational basis. The Gottesmanâ€“Knill theorem shows that even some highly entangled states can be simulated efficiently. Several important types of quantum algorithms use only Clifford gates, most importantly the standard algorithms for entanglement distillation and for quantum error correction. From a practical point of view, stabilizer circuits have been simulated in O(n log n) time using the graph state formalism. See
