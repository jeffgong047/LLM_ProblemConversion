In mathematics and probability theory, Skorokhod's embedding theorem is either or both of two theorems that allow one to regard any suitable collection of random variables as a Wiener process (Brownian motion) evaluated at a collection of stopping times. Both results are named for the Ukrainian mathematician A. V. Skorokhod.

Skorokhod's first embedding theorem[edit]
Let X be a real-valued random variable with expected value 0 and finite variance; let W denote a canonical real-valued Wiener process. Then there is a stopping time (with respect to the natural filtration of W), τ, such that Wτ has the same distribution as X,

E⁡[τ]=E⁡[X2]E[τ]=E[X^2]
and

E⁡[τ2]≤4E⁡[X4].E[τ^2]≤4E[X^4].
Skorokhod's second embedding theorem[edit]
Let X1, X2, ... be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with expected value 0 and finite variance, and let

Sn=X1+⋯+Xn._n=X_1+⋯+X_n.
Then there is a sequence of stopping times τ1 ≤  τ2 ≤ ... such that the Wτn_τ_n have the same joint distributions as the partial sums Sn and τ1, τ2 − τ1, τ3 − τ2, ... are independent and identically distributed random variables satisfying

E⁡[τn−τn−1]=E⁡[X12]E[τ_n-τ_n-1]=E[X_1^2]
and

E⁡[(τn−τn−1)2]≤4E⁡[X14].E[(τ_n-τ_n-1)^2]≤4E[X_1^4].
