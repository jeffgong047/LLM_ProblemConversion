theorem: Let X be a real-valued random variable with expected value 0 and finite variance; let W denote a canonical real-valued Wiener process. Then there is a stopping time (with respect to the natural filtration of W), τ, such that Wτ has the same distribution as X, E⁡[τ]=E⁡[X2]E[τ]=E[X^2] and E⁡[τ2]≤4E⁡[X4].E[τ^2]≤4E[X^4].
