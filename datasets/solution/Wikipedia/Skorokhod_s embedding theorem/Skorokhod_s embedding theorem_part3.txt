theorem: Let X1, X2, ... be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with expected value 0 and finite variance, and let Sn=X1+⋯+Xn._n=X_1+⋯+X_n. Then there is a sequence of stopping times τ1 ≤ τ2 ≤ ... such that the Wτn_τ_n have the same joint distributions as the partial sums Sn and τ1, τ2 − τ1, τ3 − τ2, ... are independent and identically distributed random variables satisfying E⁡[τn−τn−1]=E⁡[X12]E[τ_n-τ_n-1]=E[X_1^2] and E⁡[(τn−τn−1)2]≤4E⁡[X14].E[(τ_n-τ_n-1)^2]≤4E[X_1^4].
