Theorem in topology In mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center. Formally: if f:Sn→Rn:S^n→ℝ^n is continuous then there exists an x∈Sn^n such that: f(−x)=f(x)(-x)=f(x). The case n=1=1 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously in space, which is, however, not always the case.[1] The case n=2=2 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures, assuming that both parameters vary continuously in space. Since temperature, pressure or other such physical variables do not necessarily vary continuously, the predictions of the theorem are unlikely to be true in some necessary sense (as following from a mathematical necessity).[1] The Borsuk–Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions. Recall that Sn^n is the n-sphere and Bn^n is the n-ball: If g:Sn→Rn:S^n→ℝ^n is a continuous odd function, then there exists an x∈Sn^n such that: g(x)=0(x)=0. If g:Bn→Rn:B^n→ℝ^n is a continuous function which is odd on Sn−1^n-1 (the boundary of Bn^n), then there exists an x∈Bn^n such that: g(x)=0(x)=0.
