case: The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT). Let g be the odd real-valued continuous function on a circle defined by g(x)=f(x)−f(−x)(x)=f(x)-f(-x). Pick an arbitrary x. If g(x)=0(x)=0 then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, g(x)>0.(x)>0. But g(−x)<0.(-x)<0. Hence, by the IVT, there is a point y between x and −x-x at which g(y)=0(y)=0. General
