proof: Assume that h:Sn→Sn−1:S^n^n-1 is an odd continuous function with n>2>2 (the case n=1=1 is treated above, the case n=2=2 can be handled using basic covering theory). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced continuous function h′:RPn→RPn−1':ℝℙ^n→ℝℙ^n-1 between real projective spaces, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the Hurewicz theorem, the induced ring homomorphism on cohomology with F2𝔽_2 coefficients [where F2𝔽_2 denotes the field with two elements], F2[a]/an+1=H∗(RPn;F2)←H∗(RPn−1;F2)=F2[b]/bn,𝔽_2[a]/a^n+1=H^*(ℝℙ^n;𝔽_2)^*(ℝℙ^n-1;𝔽_2)=𝔽_2[b]/b^n, sends b to a. But then we get that bn=0^n=0 is sent to an≠0^n≠0, a contradiction.[3] One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map Sn−1→Sn−1^n-1^n-1 has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.
