proof: The Borsuk–Ulam theorem can be proved from Tucker's lemma.[2][4][5] Let g:Sn→Rn:S^n→ℝ^n be a continuous odd function. Because g is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Therefore, for every ϵ>0ϵ>0, there is a δ>0δ>0 such that, for every two points of Sn_n which are within δδ of each other, their images under g are within ϵϵ of each other. Define a triangulation of Sn_n with edges of length at most δδ. Label each vertex v of the triangulation with a label l(v)∈±1,±2,…,±n(v)∈±1,±2,…, in the following way: The absolute value of the label is the index of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of g: |l(v)|=arg⁡maxk(|g(v)k|)|l(v)|=max_k(|g(v)_k|). The sign of the label is the sign of g, so that: l(v)=sgn⁡(g(v))|l(v)|(v)=sgn(g(v))|l(v)|. Because g is odd, the labeling is also odd: l(−v)=−l(v)(-v)=-l(v). Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices u,v,v with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are l(u)=1,l(v)=−1(u)=1,l(v)=-1. By the definition of l, this means that in both g(u)(u) and g(v)(v), coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in g(u)(u) this coordinate is positive while in g(v)(v) it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between g(u)(u) and g(v)(v) is at most ϵϵ, so in particular |g(u)1−g(v)1|=|g(u)1|+|g(v)1|≤ϵ|g(u)_1-g(v)_1|=|g(u)_1|+|g(v)_1|≤ϵ (since g(u)1(u)_1 and g(v)1(v)_1 have opposite signs) and so |g(u)1|≤ϵ|g(u)_1|≤ϵ. But since the largest coordinate of g(u)(u) is coordinate #1, this means that |g(u)k|≤ϵ|g(u)_k|≤ϵ for each 1≤k≤n1. So |g(u)|≤cnϵ|g(u)|_nϵ, where cn_n is some constant depending on n and the norm |⋅||·| which you have chosen. The above is true for every ϵ>0ϵ>0; since Sn_n is compact there must hence be a point u in which |g(u)|=0|g(u)|=0.
