Generalizations: In the original theorem, the domain of the function f is the unit n-sphere (the boundary of the unit n-ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of f is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of Rnℝ^n containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if x is in the subset then -x is also in the subset).[7] Consider the function A which maps a point to its antipodal point: A(x)=−x.(x)=-x. Note that A(A(x))=x.(A(x))=x. The original theorem claims that there is a point x in which f(A(x))=f(x).(A(x))=f(x). In general, this is true also for every function A for which A(A(x))=x.(A(x))=x.[8] However, in general this is not true for other functions A.[9] See
