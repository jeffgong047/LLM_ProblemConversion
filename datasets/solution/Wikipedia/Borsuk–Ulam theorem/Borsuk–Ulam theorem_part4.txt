functions: A function g is called odd (aka antipodal or antipode-preserving) if for every x: g(−x)=−g(x)(-x)=-g(x). The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space has a zero. PROOF: If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, g(−x)=g(x)(-x)=g(x) iff g(x)=0(x)=0. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero. For every continuous function f, the following function is continuous and odd: g(x)=f(x)−f(−x)(x)=f(x)-f(-x). If every odd continuous function has a zero, then g has a zero, and therefore, f(x)=f(−x)(x)=f(-x). Hence the theorem is correct. With
