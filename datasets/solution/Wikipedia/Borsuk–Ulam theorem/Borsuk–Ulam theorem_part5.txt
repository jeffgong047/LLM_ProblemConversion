retractions: Define a retraction as a function h:Sn→Sn−1.:S^n^n-1. The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction. Proof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from Sn^n must include 0 in its range. However, 0∉Sn−10^n-1 so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is Sn−1^n-1. Conversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function g:Sn→Rn:S^n→ℝ^n with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function h:Sn→Sn−1:S^n^n-1 by: h(x)=g(x)|g(x)|(x)=g(x)/|g(x)| since g has no zeroes, h is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.
