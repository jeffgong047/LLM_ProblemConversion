example: Whilst the Coase Theorem remains largely theoretical, there are some real life examples of Coasean bargaining. One Coasean example was the negotiations that took place between waterworks and farmers in Denmark. Danish waterworks were attempting to establish “voluntary cultivation agreements with Danish farmers”.[7] Some main takeaways from this application of the Coase Theorem were that, the farmers tried to receive over compensation by exploiting their information advantage, which in turn may have resulted in waterworks terminating negotiations. Additionally, as asymmetric information is included in transaction costs, by exploiting their information advantage, the farmers prolonged negotiations. Thus demonstrating that the Coase theorem is very sensitive to its assumption of low transaction costs.
