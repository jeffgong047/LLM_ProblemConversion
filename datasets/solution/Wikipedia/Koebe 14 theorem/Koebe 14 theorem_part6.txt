theorem: The Koebe distortion theorem gives a series of bounds for a univalent function and its derivative. It is a direct consequence of Bieberbach's inequality for the second coefficient and the Koebe quarter theorem.[1] Let f(z)(z) be a univalent function on |z|<1|z|<1 normalized so that f(0)=0(0)=0 and f′(0)=1'(0)=1 and let r=|z|=|z|. Then r(1+r)2≤|f(z)|≤r(1−r)2r(1+r)^2≤|f(z)|≤r(1-r)^2 1−r(1+r)3≤|f′(z)|≤1+r(1−r)31-r(1+r)^3≤|f^'(z)|≤1+r(1-r)^3 1−r1+r≤|zf′(z)f(z)|≤1+r1−r1-r1+r≤|zf^'(z)(z)|≤1+r1-r with equality if and only if f is a Koebe function f(z)=z(1−eiθz)2.(z)=z(1-e^iθz)^2.
