function: The Koebe function is defined by f(z)=z(1−z)2=∑n=1∞nzn(z)=z/(1-z)^2=∑_n=1^∞nz^n Application of the theorem to this function shows that the constant 1/41/4 in the theorem cannot be improved, as the image domain f(D)(𝐃) does not contain the point z=−1/4=-1/4 and so cannot contain any disk centred at 00 with radius larger than 1/41/4. The rotated Koebe function is fα(z)=z(1−αz)2=∑n=1∞nαn−1zn_α(z)=z/(1-)^2=∑_n=1^∞nα^n-1z^n with αα a complex number of absolute value 11. The Koebe function and its rotations are schlicht: that is, univalent (analytic and one-to-one) and satisfying f(0)=0(0)=0 and f′(0)=1'(0)=1. Bieberbach's coefficient inequality for univalent
