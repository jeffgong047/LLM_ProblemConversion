functions: Let g(z)=z+a2z2+a3z3+⋯(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+⋯ be univalent in |z|<1|z|<1. Then |a2|≤2.|a_2|≤2. This follows by applying Gronwall's area theorem to the odd univalent function g(z−2)−1/2=z−12a2z−1+⋯.(z^-2)^-1/2=z-12a_2z^-1+⋯. Equality holds if and only if g is a rotated Koebe function. This result was proved by Ludwig Bieberbach in 1916 and provided the basis for his celebrated conjecture that |an|≤n|a_n|, proved in 1985 by Louis de Branges. Proof of quarter
