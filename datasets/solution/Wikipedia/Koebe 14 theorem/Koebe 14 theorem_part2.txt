theorem: Main article: Area_theorem_(conformal_mapping) Suppose that g(z)=z+b1z−1+b2z−2+⋯(z)=z+b_1z^-1+b_2z^-2+⋯ is univalent in |z|>1|z|>1. Then ∑n=1∞n|bn|2≤1.∑_n=1^∞n|b_n|^2≤1. In fact, if r>1>1, the complement of the image of the disk |z|>r|z|>r is a bounded domain X(r)(r). Its area is given by ∫X(r)dxdy=12i∫∂X(r)z¯dz=12i∫|z|=rg¯dg=πr2−π∑n=1∞n|bn|2r−2n.∫_X(r)dx dy=12i∫_(r)z dz=12i∫_|z|=rg dg=^2-π∑_n=1^∞n|b_n|^2r^-2n. Since the area is positive, the result follows by letting r decrease to 11. The above proof shows equality holds if and only if the complement of the image of g has zero area, i.e. Lebesgue measure zero. This result was proved in 1914 by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Grönwall. Koebe
