theorem: Applying an affine map, it can be assumed that f(0)=0,f′(0)=1,(0)=0, f^'(0)=1, so that f(z)=z+a2z2+⋯.(z)=z+a_2z^2+⋯. If w is not in f(D)(𝐃), then h(z)=wf(z)w−f(z)=z+(a2+w−1)z2+⋯(z)=wf(z)-f(z)=z+(a_2+w^-1)z^2+⋯ is univalent in |z|<1|z|<1. Applying the coefficient inequality to f and h gives |w|−1≤|a2|+|a2+w−1|≤4,|w|^-1≤|a_2|+|a_2+w^-1|≤4, so that |w|≥14.|w|≥14. Koebe distortion
