statements: This theorem is equivalent to Urysohn's lemma (which is also equivalent to the normality of the space) and is widely applicable, since all metric spaces and all compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. It can be generalized by replacing Rℝ with RJℝ^J for some indexing set J,, any retract of RJ,ℝ^J, or any normal absolute retract whatsoever.
