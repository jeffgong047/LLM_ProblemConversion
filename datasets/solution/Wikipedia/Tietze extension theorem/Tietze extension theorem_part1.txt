Continuous maps on a closed subset of a normal space can be extended In topology, the Tietze extension theorem (also known as the Tietze–Urysohn–Brouwer extension theorem or Urysohn-Brouwer lemma[1]) states that continuous functions on a closed subset of a normal topological space can be extended to the entire space, preserving boundedness if necessary.
