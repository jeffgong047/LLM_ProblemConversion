Variations: If X is a metric space, A a non-empty subset of X and f:A→R:A→ℝ is a Lipschitz continuous function with Lipschitz constant K,, then f can be extended to a Lipschitz continuous function F:X→R:X→ℝ with same constant K.. This theorem is also valid for Hölder continuous functions, that is, if f:A→R:A→ℝ is Hölder continuous function with constant less than or equal to 1,1, then f can be extended to a Hölder continuous function F:X→R:X→ℝ with the same constant.[4] Another variant (in fact, generalization) of Tietze's theorem is due to H.Tong and Z. Ercan:[5] Let A be a closed subset of a normal topological space X.. If f:X→R:X→ℝ is an upper semicontinuous function, g:X→R:X→ℝ a lower semicontinuous function, and h:A→R:A→ℝ a continuous function such that f(x)≤g(x)(x)(x) for each x∈X and f(a)≤h(a)≤g(a)(a)(a)(a) for each a∈A, then there is a continuous extension H:X→R:X→ℝ of h such that f(x)≤H(x)≤g(x)(x)(x)(x) for each x∈X.. This theorem is also valid with some additional hypothesis if Rℝ is replaced by a general locally solid Riesz space.[5] See
