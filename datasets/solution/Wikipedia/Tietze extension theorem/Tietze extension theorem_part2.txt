statement: If X is a normal space and f:A→R:A→ℝ is a continuous map from a closed subset A of X into the real numbers Rℝ carrying the standard topology, then there exists a continuous extension of f to X;; that is, there exists a map F:X→R:X→ℝ continuous on all of X with F(a)=f(a)(a)=f(a) for all a∈A.. Moreover, F may be chosen such that sup|f(a)|:a∈A=sup|F(x)|:x∈X,sup{|f(a)|:a} = sup{|F(x)|:x}, that is, if f is bounded then F may be chosen to be bounded (with the same bound as f).
