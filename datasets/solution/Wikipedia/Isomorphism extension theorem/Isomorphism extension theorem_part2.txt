theorem: The theorem states that given any field F, an algebraic extension field E of F and an isomorphism ϕϕ mapping F onto a field F′' then ϕϕ can be extended to an isomorphism ττ mapping E onto an algebraic extension E′' of F′' (a subfield of the algebraic closure of F′'). The proof of the isomorphism extension theorem depends on Zorn's lemma.
