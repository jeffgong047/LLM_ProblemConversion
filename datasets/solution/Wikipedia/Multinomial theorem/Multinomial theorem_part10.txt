Asymptotics: By Stirling's approximation, or equivalently the log-gamma function's asymptotic expansion, log⁡(knn,n,⋯,n)=knlog⁡(k)+12(log⁡(k)−(k−1)log⁡(2πn))−k2−112kn+k4−1360k3n3−k6−11260k5n5+O(1n6)logknn,n,⋯,n=knlog(k)+1/2(log(k)-(k-1)log(2))-k^2-1/12kn+k^4-1/360k^3n^3-k^6-1/1260k^5n^5+O(1/n^6)so for example,(2nn)∼22nnπ2nn∼2^2n/√(nπ)
