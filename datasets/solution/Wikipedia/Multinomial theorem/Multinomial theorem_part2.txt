Theorem: For any positive integer m and any non-negative integer n, the multinomial formula describes how a sum with m terms expands when raised to an arbitrary power n: (x1+x2+⋯+xm)n=∑k1+k2+⋯+km=n;k1,k2,⋯,km≥0(nk1,k2,…,km)∏t=1mxtkt,(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_m)^n=∑_k_1+k_2+⋯+k_m=n;_̨1,k_2,⋯,k_m≥0n_1,k_2,…,k_m∏_t=1^mx_t^k_t , where (nk1,k2,…,km)=n!k1!k2!⋯km!n_1,k_2,…,k_m=n!/k_1! k_2!_m! is a multinomial coefficient. The sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative integer indices k1 through km such that the sum of all ki is n. That is, for each term in the expansion, the exponents of the xi must add up to n. Also, as with the binomial theorem, quantities of the form x0 that appear are taken to equal 1 (even when x equals zero). In the case m = 2, this statement reduces to that of the binomial theorem.
