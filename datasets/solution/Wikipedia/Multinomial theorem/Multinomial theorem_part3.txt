Example: The third power of the trinomial a + b + c is given by (a+b+c)3=a3+b3+c3+3a2b+3a2c+3b2a+3b2c+3c2a+3c2b+6abc.(a+b+c)^3=a^3+b^3+c^3+3a^2b+3a^2c+3b^2a+3b^2c+3c^2a+3c^2b+6abc. This can be computed by hand using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, but it can also be done (perhaps more easily) with the multinomial theorem. It is possible to "read off" the multinomial coefficients from the terms by using the multinomial coefficient formula. For example: a2b0c1^2b^0c^1 has the coefficient (32,0,1)=3!2!⋅0!⋅1!=62⋅1⋅1=3.32,0,1=3!/2!·0!·1!=6/2·1·1=3. a1b1c1^1b^1c^1 has the coefficient (31,1,1)=3!1!⋅1!⋅1!=61⋅1⋅1=6.31,1,1=3!/1!·1!·1!=6/1·1·1=6.
