words: Multinomial coefficient as a product of binomial coefficients, counting the permutations of the letters of MISSISSIPPI. The multinomial coefficient (nk1,…,km)nk_1,…,k_m is also the number of distinct ways to permute a multiset of n elements, where ki is the multiplicity of each of the ith element. For example, the number of distinct permutations of the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI, which has 1 M, 4 Is, 4 Ss, and 2 Ps, is (111,4,4,2)=11!1!4!4!2!=34650.111,4,4,2=11!/1! 4! 4! 2!=34650.
