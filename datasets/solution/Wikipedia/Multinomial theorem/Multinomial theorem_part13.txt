distribution: In statistical mechanics and combinatorics, if one has a number distribution of labels, then the multinomial coefficients naturally arise from the binomial coefficients. Given a number distribution {ni} on a set of N total items, ni represents the number of items to be given the label i. (In statistical mechanics i is the label of the energy state.) The number of arrangements is found by Choosing n1 of the total N to be labeled 1. This can be done (Nn1)Nn_1 ways. From the remaining N − n1 items choose n2 to label 2. This can be done (N−n1n2)N-n_1n_2 ways. From the remaining N − n1 − n2 items choose n3 to label 3. Again, this can be done (N−n1−n2n3)N-n_1-n_2n_3 ways. Multiplying the number of choices at each step results in: (Nn1)(N−n1n2)(N−n1−n2n3)⋯=N!(N−n1)!n1!⋅(N−n1)!(N−n1−n2)!n2!⋅(N−n1−n2)!(N−n1−n2−n3)!n3!⋯.N_1N-n_1_2N-n_1-n_2_3⋯=N!/(N-n_1)!n_1!·(N-n_1)!/(N-n_1-n_2)!n_2!·(N-n_1-n_2)!/(N-n_1-n_2-n_3)!n_3!⋯. Cancellation results in the formula given above. Number of unique permutations of
