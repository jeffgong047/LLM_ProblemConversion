In mathematics, Fuglede's theorem is a result in operator theory, named after Bent Fuglede.


The result[edit]
Theorem (Fuglede) Let T and N be bounded operators on a complex Hilbert space with N being normal. If TN = NT, then TN* = N*T, where N* denotes the adjoint of N.
Normality of N is necessary, as is seen by taking T=N. When T is self-adjoint, the claim is trivial regardless of whether N is normal:
TN∗=(NT)∗=(TN)∗=N∗T.^*=(NT)^*=(TN)^*=N^*T.
Tentative Proof: If the underlying Hilbert space is finite-dimensional, the spectral theorem says that N is of the form
N=∑iλiPi=∑_iλ_iP_i
where Pi are pairwise orthogonal projections. One expects that TN = NT if and only if TPi = PiT.
Indeed, it can be proved to be true by elementary arguments (e.g. it can be shown that all Pi are representable as polynomials of N and for this reason, if T commutes with N, it has to commute with Pi...).
Therefore T must also commute with
N∗=∑iλ¯iPi.^*=∑_iλ̅_iP_i.
In general, when the Hilbert space is not finite-dimensional, the normal operator N gives rise to a projection-valued measure P on its spectrum, σ(N), which assigns a projection PΩ to each Borel subset of σ(N). N can be expressed as
N=∫σ(N)λdP(λ).=∫_σ(N)(λ).
Differently from the finite dimensional case, it is by no means obvious that TN = NT implies TPΩ = PΩT. Thus, it is not so obvious that T also commutes with any simple function of the form
ρ=∑iλ¯PΩi.ρ=∑_iλ̅P_Ω_i.
Indeed, following the construction of the spectral decomposition for a bounded, normal, not self-adjoint, operator T, one sees that to verify that T commutes with PΩi_Ω_i, the most straightforward way is to assume that T commutes with both N and N*, giving rise to a vicious circle!
That is the relevance of Fuglede's theorem: The latter hypothesis is not really necessary.

Putnam's generalization[edit]
The following contains Fuglede's result as a special case. The proof by Rosenblum pictured below is just that presented by Fuglede for his theorem when assuming N=M.
Theorem (Calvin Richard Putnam)[1] Let T, M, N be linear operators on a complex Hilbert space, and suppose that M and N are normal, T is bounded and MT = TN.
Then M*T = TN*.
First proof (Marvin Rosenblum):
By induction, the hypothesis implies that MkT = TNk for all k.
Thus for any λ in Cℂ,
eλ¯MT=Teλ¯N.^λ̅MT=Te^λ̅N.
Consider the function
F(λ)=eλM∗Te−λN∗.(λ)=e^^*Te^-^*.
This is equal to
eλM∗[e−λ¯MTeλ¯N]e−λN∗=U(λ)TV(λ)−1,^^*[e^-λ̅MTe^λ̅N]e^-^*=U(λ)TV(λ)^-1,
where U(λ)=eλM∗−λ¯M(λ)=e^^*-λ̅M because M is normal, and similarly V(λ)=eλN∗−λ¯N(λ)=e^^*-λ̅N. However we have
U(λ)∗=eλ¯M−λM∗=U(λ)−1(λ)^*=e^λ̅M-^*=U(λ)^-1
so U is unitary, and hence has norm 1 for all λ; the same is true for V(λ), so
‖F(λ)‖≤‖T‖∀λ.F(λ)≤T
forallλ.
So F is a bounded analytic vector-valued function, and is thus constant, and equal to F(0) = T. Considering the first-order terms in the expansion for small λ, we must have M*T = TN*.
The original paper of Fuglede appeared in 1950; it was extended to the form given above by Putnam in 1951.[1] The short proof given above was first published by Rosenblum in 1958; it is very elegant, but is less general than the original proof which also considered the case of unbounded operators. Another simple proof of Putnam's theorem is as follows:
Second proof: Consider the matrices
T′=[00T0]andN′=[N00M].'=[ 0 0; T 0 ]  and'=[ N 0; 0 M ].
The operator N'  is normal and, by assumption, T' N' = N' T' . By Fuglede's theorem, one has
T′(N′)∗=(N′)∗T′.'(N')^*=(N')^*T'.
Comparing entries then gives the desired result.
From Putnam's generalization, one can deduce the following:
Corollary If two normal operators M and N are similar, then they are unitarily equivalent.
Proof: Suppose MS = SN where S is a bounded invertible operator. Putnam's result implies M*S = SN*, i.e.
S−1M∗S=N∗.^-1M^*S=N^*.
Take the adjoint of the above equation and we have
S∗M(S−1)∗=N.^*M(S^-1)^*=N.
So
S∗M(S−1)∗=S−1MS⇒SS∗M(SS∗)−1=M.^*M(S^-1)^*=S^-1MS  ⇒^*M(SS^*)^-1=M.
Let S*=VR, with V a unitary (since S is invertible) and R the positive square root of SS*. As R is a limit of polynomials on SS*, the above implies that R commutes with M. It is also invertible. Then
N=S∗M(S∗)−1=VRMR−1V∗=VMV∗.=S^*M(S^*)^-1=VRMR^-1V^*=VMV^*.
Corollary If M and N are normal operators, and MN = NM, then MN is also normal.
Proof: The argument invokes only Fuglede's theorem. One can directly compute
(MN)(MN)∗=MN(NM)∗=MNM∗N∗.(MN)(MN)^*=MN(NM)^*=MNM^*N^*.
By Fuglede, the above becomes
=MM∗NN∗=M∗MN∗N.=MM^*NN^*=M^*MN^*N.
But M and N are normal, so
=M∗N∗MN=(MN)∗MN.=M^*N^*MN=(MN)^*MN.

C*-algebras[edit]
The theorem can be rephrased as a statement about elements of C*-algebras.
Theorem (Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum) Let x, y be two normal elements of a C*-algebra A and z such that xz = zy. Then it follows that x* z = z y*.
