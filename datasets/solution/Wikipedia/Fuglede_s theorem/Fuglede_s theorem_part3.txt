generalization: The following contains Fuglede's result as a special case. The proof by Rosenblum pictured below is just that presented by Fuglede for his theorem when assuming N=M. Theorem (Calvin Richard Putnam)[1] Let T, M, N be linear operators on a complex Hilbert space, and suppose that M and N are normal, T is bounded and MT = TN. Then M*T = TN*. First proof (Marvin Rosenblum): By induction, the hypothesis implies that MkT = TNk for all k. Thus for any λ in Cℂ, eλ¯MT=Teλ¯N.^λ̅MT=Te^λ̅N. Consider the function F(λ)=eλM∗Te−λN∗.(λ)=e^^*Te^-^*. This is equal to eλM∗[e−λ¯MTeλ¯N]e−λN∗=U(λ)TV(λ)−1,^^*[e^-λ̅MTe^λ̅N]e^-^*=U(λ)TV(λ)^-1, where U(λ)=eλM∗−λ¯M(λ)=e^^*-λ̅M because M is normal, and similarly V(λ)=eλN∗−λ¯N(λ)=e^^*-λ̅N. However we have U(λ)∗=eλ¯M−λM∗=U(λ)−1(λ)^*=e^λ̅M-^*=U(λ)^-1 so U is unitary, and hence has norm 1 for all λ; the same is true for V(λ), so ‖F(λ)‖≤‖T‖∀λ.F(λ)≤T forallλ. So F is a bounded analytic vector-valued function, and is thus constant, and equal to F(0) = T. Considering the first-order terms in the expansion for small λ, we must have M*T = TN*. The original paper of Fuglede appeared in 1950; it was extended to the form given above by Putnam in 1951.[1] The short proof given above was first published by Rosenblum in 1958; it is very elegant, but is less general than the original proof which also considered the case of unbounded operators. Another simple proof of Putnam's theorem is as follows: Second proof: Consider the matrices T′=[00T0]andN′=[N00M].'=[ 0 0; T 0 ] and'=[ N 0; 0 M ]. The operator N' is normal and, by assumption, T' N' = N' T' . By Fuglede's theorem, one has T′(N′)∗=(N′)∗T′.'(N')^*=(N')^*T'. Comparing entries then gives the desired result. From Putnam's generalization, one can deduce the following: Corollary If two normal operators M and N are similar, then they are unitarily equivalent. Proof: Suppose MS = SN where S is a bounded invertible operator. Putnam's result implies M*S = SN*, i.e. S−1M∗S=N∗.^-1M^*S=N^*. Take the adjoint of the above equation and we have S∗M(S−1)∗=N.^*M(S^-1)^*=N. So S∗M(S−1)∗=S−1MS⇒SS∗M(SS∗)−1=M.^*M(S^-1)^*=S^-1MS ⇒^*M(SS^*)^-1=M. Let S*=VR, with V a unitary (since S is invertible) and R the positive square root of SS*. As R is a limit of polynomials on SS*, the above implies that R commutes with M. It is also invertible. Then N=S∗M(S∗)−1=VRMR−1V∗=VMV∗.=S^*M(S^*)^-1=VRMR^-1V^*=VMV^*. Corollary If M and N are normal operators, and MN = NM, then MN is also normal. Proof: The argument invokes only Fuglede's theorem. One can directly compute (MN)(MN)∗=MN(NM)∗=MNM∗N∗.(MN)(MN)^*=MN(NM)^*=MNM^*N^*. By Fuglede, the above becomes =MM∗NN∗=M∗MN∗N.=MM^*NN^*=M^*MN^*N. But M and N are normal, so =M∗N∗MN=(MN)∗MN.=M^*N^*MN=(MN)^*MN.
