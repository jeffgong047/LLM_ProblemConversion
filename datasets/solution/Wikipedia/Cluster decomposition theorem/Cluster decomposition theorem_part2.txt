Formulation: The S-matrix Sβα_βα describes the amplitude for a process with an initial state αα evolving into a final state ββ. If the initial and final states consist of two clusters, with α1α_1 and β1β_1 close to each other but far from the pair α2α_2 and β2β_2, then the cluster decomposition property requires the S-matrix to factorize Sβα→Sβ1α1Sβ2α2_βα_β_1α_1S_β_2α_2 as the distance between the two clusters increases. The physical interpretation of this is that any two spatially well separated experiments α1→β1α_1→β_1 and α2→β2α_2→β_2 cannot influence each other.[3] This condition is fundamental to the ability to doing physics without having to know the state of the entire universe. By expanding the S-matrix into a sum of a product of connected S-matrix elements Sβαc_βα^c, which at the perturbative level are equivalent to connected Feynman diagrams, the cluster decomposition property can be restated as demanding that connected S-matrix elements must vanish whenever some of its clusters of particles are far apart from each other. This position space formulation can also be reformulated in terms of the momentum space S-matrix S βαcS̃_βα^c.[4] Since its Fourier transformation gives the position space connected S-matrix, this only depends on position through the exponential terms. Therefore, performing a uniform translation in a direction aa on a subset of particles will effectively change the momentum space S-matrix as S βαc→xi→xi+aeia⋅(∑ipi)S βαc.S̃_βα^ce^ia·(∑_ip_i)S̃_βα^c. By translational invariance, a translation of all particles cannot change the S-matrix, therefore S βαS̃_βα must be proportional to a momentum conserving delta function δ(Σp)δ(Σp) to ensure that the translation exponential factor vanishes. If there is an additional delta function of only a subset of momenta corresponding to some cluster of particles, then this cluster can be moved arbitrarily far through a translation without changing the S-matrix, which would violate cluster decomposition. This means that in momentum space the property requires that the S-matrix only has a single delta function. Cluster decomposition can also be formulated in terms of correlation functions, where for any two operators O1(x)𝒪_1(x) and O2(x)𝒪_2(x) localized to some region, the vacuum expectation values factorize as the two operators become distantly separated lim|x|→∞⟨O1(x)O2(0)⟩→⟨O1⟩⟨O2⟩.lim_|x|→∞⟨𝒪_1(x)𝒪_2(0)⟩→⟨𝒪_1⟩⟨𝒪_2⟩. This formulation allows for the property to be applied to theories that lack an S-matrix such as conformal field theories. It is in terms of these Wightman functions that the property is usually formulated in axiomatic quantum field theory.[5] In some formulations, such as Euclidean constructive field theory, it is explicitly introduced as an axiom.[6]
