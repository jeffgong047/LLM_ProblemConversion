Statement: The statement of Jacobson–Morozov relies on the following preliminary notions: an sl2-triple in a semi-simple Lie algebra g𝔤 (throughout in this article, over a field of characteristic zero) is a homomorphism of Lie algebras sl2→g𝔰𝔩_2→𝔤. Equivalently, it is a triple e,f,h,f,h of elements in g𝔤 satisfying the relations [h,e]=2e,[h,f]=−2f,[e,f]=h.[h,e]=2e, [h,f]=-2f, [e,f]=h. An element x∈g∈𝔤 is called nilpotent, if the endomorphism [x,−]:g→g[x,-]:𝔤→𝔤 (known as the adjoint representation) is a nilpotent endomorphism. It is an elementary fact that for any sl2-triple (e,f,h)(e,f,h), e must be nilpotent. The Jacobson–Morozov theorem states that, conversely, any nilpotent non-zero element e∈g∈𝔤 can be extended to an sl2-triple.[1][2] For g=sln𝔤=𝔰𝔩_n, the sl2-triples obtained in this way are made explicit in Chriss & Ginzburg (1997, p. 184). The theorem can also be stated for linear algebraic groups (again over a field k of characteristic zero): any morphism (of algebraic groups) from the additive group Ga_a to a reductive group H factors through the embedding Ga→SL2,x↦(1x01)._a_2,x↦([ 1 x; 0 1 ]). Furthermore, any two such factorizations SL2→H_2 are conjugate by a k-point of H.
