Generalization: A far-reaching generalization of the theorem as formulated above can be stated as follows: the inclusion of pro-reductive groups into all linear algebraic groups, where morphisms G→H in both categories are taken up to conjugation by elements in H(k)(k), admits a left adjoint, the so-called pro-reductive envelope. This left adjoint sends the additive group Ga_a to SL2_2 (which happens to be semi-simple, as opposed to pro-reductive), thereby recovering the above form of Jacobson–Morozov. This generalized Jacobson–Morozov theorem was proven by André & Kahn (2002, Theorem 19.3.1) by appealing to methods related to Tannakian categories and by O'Sullivan (2010) by more geometric methods.
