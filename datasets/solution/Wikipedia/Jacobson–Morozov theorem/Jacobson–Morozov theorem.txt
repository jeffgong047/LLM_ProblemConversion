In mathematics, the Jacobson–Morozov theorem is the assertion that nilpotent elements in a semi-simple Lie algebra can be extended to sl2-triples. The theorem is named after Jacobson 1951, Morozov 1942.

Statement[edit]
The statement of Jacobson–Morozov relies on the following preliminary notions: an sl2-triple in a semi-simple Lie algebra g𝔤 (throughout in this article, over a field of characteristic zero) is a homomorphism of Lie algebras sl2→g𝔰𝔩_2→𝔤. Equivalently, it is a triple e,f,h,f,h of elements in g𝔤 satisfying the relations 

[h,e]=2e,[h,f]=−2f,[e,f]=h.[h,e]=2e,  [h,f]=-2f,  [e,f]=h.
An element x∈g∈𝔤 is called nilpotent, if the endomorphism [x,−]:g→g[x,-]:𝔤→𝔤 (known as the adjoint representation) is a nilpotent endomorphism. It is an elementary fact that for any sl2-triple (e,f,h)(e,f,h), e must be nilpotent. The Jacobson–Morozov theorem states that, conversely, any nilpotent non-zero element e∈g∈𝔤 can be extended to an sl2-triple.[1][2] For g=sln𝔤=𝔰𝔩_n, the sl2-triples obtained in this way are made explicit in Chriss & Ginzburg (1997, p. 184).
The theorem can also be stated for linear algebraic groups (again over a field k of characteristic zero): any morphism (of algebraic groups) from the additive group Ga_a to a reductive group H factors through the embedding 

Ga→SL2,x↦(1x01)._a_2,x↦([ 1 x; 0 1 ]).
Furthermore, any two such factorizations

SL2→H_2
are conjugate by a k-point of H.

Generalization[edit]
A far-reaching generalization of the theorem as formulated above can be stated as follows: the inclusion of pro-reductive groups into all linear algebraic groups, where morphisms G→H in both categories are taken up to conjugation by elements in H(k)(k), admits a left adjoint, the so-called pro-reductive envelope. This left adjoint sends the additive group Ga_a to SL2_2 (which happens to be semi-simple, as opposed to pro-reductive), thereby recovering the above form of Jacobson–Morozov.
This generalized Jacobson–Morozov theorem was proven by André & Kahn (2002, Theorem 19.3.1) by appealing to methods related to Tannakian categories and by O'Sullivan (2010) by more geometric methods.
