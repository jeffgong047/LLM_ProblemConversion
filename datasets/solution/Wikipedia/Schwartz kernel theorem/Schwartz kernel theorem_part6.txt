spaces: Much of the theory of nuclear spaces was developed by Alexander Grothendieck while investigating the Schwartz kernel theorem and published in Grothendieck 1955. We have the following generalization of the theorem. Schwartz kernel theorem:[1] Suppose that X is nuclear, Y is locally convex, and v is a continuous bilinear form on X×Y. Then v originates from a space of the form XA′′⊗^ϵYB′′_A^'^'⊗_ϵY_B^'^' where A′^' and B′^' are suitable equicontinuous subsets of X′^' and Y′^'. Equivalently, v is of the form, v(x,y)=∑i=1∞λi⟨x,xi′⟩⟨y,yi′⟩(x,y)=∑_i=1^∞λ_i,x_i^'⟩,y_i^'⟩ for all (x,y)∈X×Y(x,y) where (λi)∈l1(λ_i)^1 and each of x1′,x2′,…{x_1^',x_2^',…} and y1′,y2′,…{y_1^',y_2^',…} are equicontinuous. Furthermore, these sequences can be taken to be null sequences (i.e. converging to 0) in XA′′_A^'^' and YB′′_B^'^', respectively. See
