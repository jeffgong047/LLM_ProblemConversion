theorem: Let X and Y be open sets in Rnℝ^n. Every distribution k∈D′(X×Y)∈𝒟'(X) defines a continuous linear map K:D(Y)→D′(X)𝒟(Y)→𝒟'(X) such that ⟨k,u⊗v⟩=⟨Kv,u⟩,u⟩=,u⟩ (1) for every u∈D(X),v∈D(Y)∈𝒟(X),v∈𝒟(Y). Conversely, for every such continuous linear map K there exists one and only one distribution k∈D′(X×Y)∈𝒟'(X) such that (1) holds. The distribution k is the kernel of the map K.
