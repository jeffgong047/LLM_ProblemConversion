proofs: The theorem is named after German mathematician Paul Kirchberger, a student of David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen who proved it in his 1902 dissertation,[4] and published it in 1903 in Mathematische Annalen,[5] as an auxiliary theorem used in his analysis of Chebyshev approximation. A report of Hilbert on the dissertation states that some of Kirchberger's auxiliary theorems in this part of his dissertation were known to Hermann Minkowski but unpublished; it is not clear whether this statement applies to the result now known as Kirchberger's theorem.[6] Since Kirchberger's work, other proofs of Kirchberger's theorem have been published, including simple proofs based on Helly's theorem on intersections of convex sets,[7] based on Carathéodory's theorem on membership in convex hulls,[2] or based on principles related to Radon's theorem on intersections of convex hulls.[3] However, Helly's theorem, Carathéodory's theorem, and Radon's theorem all postdate Kirchberger's theorem.
