results: A strengthened version of Kirchberger's theorem fixes one of the given points, and only considers subsets of d+2+2 points that include the fixed point. If the red and blue points in each of these subsets are linearly separable, then all the red points and all the blue points are linearly separable.[1] The theorem also holds if the red points and blue points form compact sets that are not necessarily finite.[3] By using stereographic projection, Kirchberger's theorem can be used to prove a similar result for circular or spherical separability: if every five points of finitely many red and blue points in the plane can have their red and blue points separated by a circle, or every d+3+3 points in higher dimensions can have their red and blue points separated by a hypersphere, then all the red and blue points can be separated in the same way.[8] See
