On convergent subsequences of functions that are locally of bounded total variation
In mathematics, Helly's selection theorem (also called the Helly selection principle) states that a uniformly bounded sequence of monotone real functions admits a convergent subsequence.
In other words, it is a sequential compactness theorem for the space of uniformly bounded monotone functions.
It is named for the Austrian mathematician Eduard Helly.
A more general version of the theorem asserts compactness of the space BVloc of functions locally of bounded total variation that are uniformly bounded at a point.
The theorem has applications throughout mathematical analysis. In probability theory, the result implies compactness of a tight family of measures.


Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let (fn)n ∈ N be a sequence of increasing functions mapping the real line R into itself,
and suppose that it is uniformly bounded: there are a,b ∈ R such that a ≤ fn ≤ b for every n  ∈  N.
Then the sequence (fn)n ∈ N admits a pointwise convergent subsequence.

Generalisation to BVloc[edit]
Let U be an open subset of the real line and let fn : U → R, n ∈ N, be a sequence of functions. Suppose that

(fn) has uniformly bounded total variation on any W that is compactly embedded in U. That is, for all sets W ⊆ U with compact closure W̄ ⊆ U,
supn∈N(‖fn‖L1(W)+‖dfndt‖L1(W))<+∞,sup_n∈𝐍(f_n_L^1(W)+df_n/dt_L^1(W))<+∞,
where the derivative is taken in the sense of tempered distributions;
and (fn) is uniformly bounded at a point. That is, for some t ∈ U, { fn(t) | n ∈ N } ⊆ R is a bounded set.
Then there exists a subsequence fnk, k ∈ N, of fn and a function f : U → R, locally of bounded variation, such that

fnk converges to f pointwise;
and fnk converges to f locally in L1 (see locally integrable function), i.e., for all W compactly embedded in U,
limk→∞∫W|fnk(x)−f(x)|dx=0;lim_k→∞∫_W|f_n_k(x)-f(x)| dx=0;
and, for W compactly embedded in U,
‖dfdt‖L1(W)≤liminfk→∞‖dfnkdt‖L1(W).df/dt_L^1(W)≤lim inf_k→∞df_n_k/dt_L^1(W).
Further generalizations[edit]
There are many generalizations and refinements of Helly's theorem.  The following theorem, for BV functions taking values in Banach spaces, is due to Barbu and Precupanu:
Let X be a reflexive, separable Hilbert space and let E be a closed, convex subset of X.  Let Δ : X → [0, +∞) be positive-definite and homogeneous of degree one.  Suppose that zn is a uniformly bounded sequence in BV([0, T]; X) with zn(t) ∈ E for all n ∈ N and t ∈ [0, T].  Then there exists a subsequence znk and functions δ, z ∈ BV([0, T]; X) such that

for all t ∈ [0, T],
∫[0,t)Δ(dznk)→δ(t);∫_[0,t)Δ(dz_n_k)→δ(t);
and, for all t ∈ [0, T],
znk(t)⇀z(t)∈E;_n_k(t)(t);
and, for all 0 ≤ s < t ≤ T,
∫[s,t)Δ(dz)≤δ(t)−δ(s).∫_[s,t)Δ(dz)≤δ(t)-δ(s).
