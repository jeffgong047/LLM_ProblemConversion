generalizations: There are many generalizations and refinements of Helly's theorem. The following theorem, for BV functions taking values in Banach spaces, is due to Barbu and Precupanu: Let X be a reflexive, separable Hilbert space and let E be a closed, convex subset of X. Let Δ : X → [0, +∞) be positive-definite and homogeneous of degree one. Suppose that zn is a uniformly bounded sequence in BV([0, T]; X) with zn(t) ∈ E for all n ∈ N and t ∈ [0, T]. Then there exists a subsequence znk and functions δ, z ∈ BV([0, T]; X) such that for all t ∈ [0, T], ∫[0,t)Δ(dznk)→δ(t);∫_[0,t)Δ(dz_n_k)→δ(t); and, for all t ∈ [0, T], znk(t)⇀z(t)∈E;_n_k(t)(t); and, for all 0 ≤ s < t ≤ T, ∫[s,t)Δ(dz)≤δ(t)−δ(s).∫_[s,t)Δ(dz)≤δ(t)-δ(s).
