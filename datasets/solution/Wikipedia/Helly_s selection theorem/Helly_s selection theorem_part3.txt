BVloc: Let U be an open subset of the real line and let fn : U → R, n ∈ N, be a sequence of functions. Suppose that (fn) has uniformly bounded total variation on any W that is compactly embedded in U. That is, for all sets W ⊆ U with compact closure W̄ ⊆ U, supn∈N(‖fn‖L1(W)+‖dfndt‖L1(W))<+∞,sup_n∈𝐍(f_n_L^1(W)+df_n/dt_L^1(W))<+∞, where the derivative is taken in the sense of tempered distributions; and (fn) is uniformly bounded at a point. That is, for some t ∈ U, { fn(t) | n ∈ N } ⊆ R is a bounded set. Then there exists a subsequence fnk, k ∈ N, of fn and a function f : U → R, locally of bounded variation, such that fnk converges to f pointwise; and fnk converges to f locally in L1 (see locally integrable function), i.e., for all W compactly embedded in U, limk→∞∫W|fnk(x)−f(x)|dx=0;lim_k→∞∫_W|f_n_k(x)-f(x)| dx=0; and, for W compactly embedded in U, ‖dfdt‖L1(W)≤liminfk→∞‖dfnkdt‖L1(W).df/dt_L^1(W)≤lim inf_k→∞df_n_k/dt_L^1(W).
