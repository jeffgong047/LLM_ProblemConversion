measures: One can generalize the empirical distribution function by replacing the set (−∞,x](-∞,x] by an arbitrary set C from a class of sets C𝒞 to obtain an empirical measure indexed by sets C∈C.∈𝒞. Pn(C)=1n∑i=1nIC(Xi),C∈C_n(C)=1/n∑_i=1^nI_C(X_i),C∈𝒞 Where IC(x)_C(x) is the indicator function of each set C. Further generalization is the map induced by Pn_n on measurable real-valued functions f, which is given by f↦Pnf=∫SfdPn=1n∑i=1nf(Xi),f∈F._nf=∫_Sf dP_n=1/n∑_i=1^nf(X_i),f∈ℱ. Then it becomes an important property of these classes whether the strong law of large numbers holds uniformly on Fℱ or C𝒞. Glivenko–Cantelli
