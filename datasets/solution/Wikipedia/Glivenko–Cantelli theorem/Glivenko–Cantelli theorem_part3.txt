Proof: For simplicity, consider a case of continuous random variable X. Fix −∞=x0<x1<⋯<xm−1<xm=∞-∞=x_0<x_1<⋯<x_m-1<x_m=∞ such that F(xj)−F(xj−1)=1m(x_j)-F(x_j-1)=1/m for j=1,…,m=1,…,m. Now for all x∈R∈ℝ there exists j∈1,…,m∈{1,…,m} such that x∈[xj−1,xj]∈[x_j-1,x_j]. Note that Fn(x)−F(x)≤Fn(xj)−F(xj−1)=Fn(xj)−F(xj)+1m,Fn(x)−F(x)≥Fn(xj−1)−F(xj)=Fn(xj−1)−F(xj−1)−1m.F_n(x)-F(x) _n(x_j)-F(x_j-1)=F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)+1/m, F_n(x)-F(x) _n(x_j-1)-F(x_j)=F_n(x_j-1)-F(x_j-1)-1/m. Therefore, ‖Fn−F‖∞=supx∈R|Fn(x)−F(x)|≤maxj∈1,…,m|Fn(xj)−F(xj)|+1m.F_n-F_∞=sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-F(x)|≤max_j∈{1,…,m}|F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)|+1/m. Since maxj∈1,…,m|Fn(xj)−F(xj)|→0a.s.max_j∈{1,…,m}|F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)|→0a.s. by strong law of large numbers, we can guarantee that for any positive εε and any integer m such that 1/m<ε1/m<ε, we can find N such that for all n≥N, we have maxj∈1,…,m|Fn(xj)−F(xj)|≤ε−1/ma.s.max_j∈{1,…,m}|F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)|≤ε-1/ma.s.. Combined with the above result, this further implies that ‖Fn−F‖∞≤εa.s.F_n-F_∞≤εa.s., which is the definition of almost sure convergence. Empirical
