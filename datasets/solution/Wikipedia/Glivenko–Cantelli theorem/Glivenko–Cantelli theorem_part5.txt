class: Consider a set S{𝒮} with a sigma algebra of Borel subsets A and a probability measure P. mathbbP . For a class of subsets, C⊂C:CismeasurablesubsetofS𝒞⊂{C:Cismeasurablesubsetof𝒮} and a class of functions F⊂f:S→R,fismeasurableℱ⊂{f:𝒮→ℝ,f{} define random variables ‖Pn−P‖C=supC∈C|Pn(C)−P(C)|P_n-P_𝒞=sup_C∈𝒞|ℙ_n(C)-ℙ(C)| ‖Pn−P‖F=supf∈F|Pnf−Pf|P_n-P_ℱ=sup_f∈ℱ|ℙ_nf-ℙf| where Pn(C) mathbbP_n(C)} is the empirical measure, Pnf mathbbP_nf} is the corresponding map, and E⁡f=∫SfdP=Pf, operatorname𝔼f=∫_𝒮f mathrmdℙ=ℙf assuming that it exists. Definitions A class C{𝒞} is called a Glivenko–Cantelli class (or GC class) with respect to a probability measure P if any of the following equivalent statements is true. 1. ‖Pn−P‖C→0{ℙ_n-ℙ_𝒞→0} almost surely as n→∞.→∞ . 2. ‖Pn−P‖C→0{ℙ_n-ℙ_𝒞→0} in probability as n→∞.→∞ . 3. E⁡‖Pn−P‖C→0, operatorname𝔼ℙ_n-ℙ_𝒞→0 as n→∞→∞} (convergence in mean). The Glivenko–Cantelli classes of functions are defined similarly. A class is called a universal Glivenko–Cantelli class if it is a GC class with respect to any probability measure Pℙ on (S,A) . A class is called uniformly Glivenko–Cantelli if the convergence occurs uniformly over all probability measures Pℙ on (S,A) : supP∈P(S,A)E⁡‖Pn−P‖C→0;sup_ℙ∈ℙ(S,A)𝔼ℙ_n-ℙ_𝒞→0 supP∈P(S,A)E⁡‖Pn−P‖F→0.sup_ℙ∈ℙ(S,A)𝔼ℙ_n-ℙ_ℱ→0 . Theorem (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1968)[6] A class of sets C{𝒞} is uniformly GC if and only if it is a Vapnik–Chervonenkis class.
