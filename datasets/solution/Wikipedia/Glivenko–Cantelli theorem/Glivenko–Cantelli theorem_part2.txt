Statement: Assume that X1,X2,…_1,X_2,… are independent and identically distributed random variables in Rℝ with common cumulative distribution function F(x)(x). The empirical distribution function for X1,…,Xn_1,…,X_n is defined by Fn(x)=1n∑i=1nI[Xi,∞)(x)=1n|i∣Xi≤x,1≤i≤n|_n(x)=1n∑_i=1^nI_[X_i,∞)(x)=1n{|{ı midX_i,}| where IC_C is the indicator function of the set C. . For every (fixed) x, Fn(x)_n(x)} is a sequence of random variables which converge to F(x)(x) almost surely by the strong law of large numbers. Glivenko and Cantelli strengthened this result by proving uniform convergence of Fn_n} to F. . Theorem ‖Fn−F‖∞=supx∈R|Fn(x)−F(x)|⟶0F_n-F_∞=sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-F(x)|⟶0 almost surely.[3](p 265) This theorem originates with Valery Glivenko[4] and Francesco Cantelli,[5] in 1933. Remarks If Xn_n} is a stationary ergodic process, then Fn(x)_n(x) converges almost surely to F(x)=E⁡[1X1≤x].(x)=𝔼[1_X_1] . The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem gives a stronger mode of convergence than this in the iid case. An even stronger uniform convergence result for the empirical distribution function is available in the form of an extended type of law of the iterated logarithm.[3](p 268) See asymptotic properties of the empirical distribution function for this and related results.
