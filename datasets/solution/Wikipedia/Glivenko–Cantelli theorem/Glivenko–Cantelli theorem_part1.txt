Theory of probability The left diagram illustrates Glivenko–Cantelli theorem for uniform distributions. The right diagram illustrates the Donsker–Skorokhod–Kolmogorov theorem The same diagram for normal distributions In the theory of probability, the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem (sometimes referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Statistics), named after Valery Ivanovich Glivenko and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, determines the asymptotic behaviour of the empirical distribution function as the number of independent and identically distributed observations grows.[1] The uniform convergence of more general empirical measures becomes an important property of the Glivenko–Cantelli classes of functions or sets.[2] The Glivenko–Cantelli classes arise in Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, with applications to machine learning. Applications can be found in econometrics making use of M-estimators.
