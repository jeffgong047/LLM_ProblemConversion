Examples: Let S=R=ℝ and C=(−∞,t]:t∈R𝒞={(-∞,t]:t∈ℝ}. The classical Glivenko–Cantelli theorem implies that this class is a universal GC class. Furthermore, by Kolmogorov's theorem, supP∈P(S,A)‖Pn−P‖C∼n−1/2sup_P∈𝒫(S,A)P_n-P_𝒞^-1/2, that is C𝒞 is uniformly Glivenko–Cantelli class. Let P be a nonatomic probability measure on S and C𝒞 be a class of all finite subsets in S. Because An=X1,…,Xn∈C_n={X_1,…,X_n}∈𝒞, P(An)=0(A_n)=0, Pn(An)=1_n(A_n)=1, we have that ‖Pn−P‖C=1P_n-P_𝒞=1 and so C𝒞 is not a GC class with respect to P. See
