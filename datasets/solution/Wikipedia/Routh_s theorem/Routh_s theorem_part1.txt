Area ratio of one triangle and the triangle formed by the intersections of three cevians Routh's theorem In geometry, Routh's theorem determines the ratio of areas between a given triangle and a triangle formed by the pairwise intersections of three cevians. The theorem states that if in triangle ABC points D, E, and F lie on segments BC, CA, and AB, then writing CDBD=xCDBD=x, AECE=yAECE=y, and BFAF=zBFAF=z, the signed area of the triangle formed by the cevians AD, BE, and CF is SABC(xyzâˆ’1)2(xy+y+1)(yz+z+1)(zx+x+1),_ABC(xyz-1)^2/(xy+y+1)(yz+z+1)(zx+x+1), where SABC_ABC is the area of the triangle ABC. This theorem was given by Edward John Routh on page 82 of his Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples in 1896. The particular case x=y=z=2=y=z=2 has become popularized as the one-seventh area triangle. The x=y=z=1=y=z=1 case implies that the three medians are concurrent (through the centroid).
