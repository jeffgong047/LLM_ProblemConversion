Proof: Routh's theorem Suppose that the area of triangle ABC is 1. For triangle ABD and line FRC using Menelaus's theorem, We could obtain: AFFB×BCCD×DRRA=1AF/FB×BC/CD×DR/RA=1 Then DRRA=BFFA×DCCB=zxx+1DR/RA=BF/FA×DC/CB=zx/x+1 So the area of triangle ARC is: SARC=ARADSADC=ARAD×DCBCSABC=xzx+x+1_ARC=AR/ADS_ADC=AR/AD×DC/BCS_ABC=x/zx+x+1 Similarly, we could know: SBPA=yxy+y+1_BPA=y/xy+y+1 and SCQB=zyz+z+1_CQB=z/yz+z+1 Thus the area of triangle PQR is: SPQR=SABC−SARC−SBPA−SCQB=1−xzx+x+1−yxy+y+1−zyz+z+1=(xyz−1)2(xz+x+1)(yx+y+1)(zy+z+1).S_PQR =S_ABC-S_ARC-S_BPA-S_CQB =1-x/zx+x+1-y/xy+y+1-z/yz+z+1 =(xyz-1)^2/(xz+x+1)(yx+y+1)(zy+z+1).
