axis: The integral ∫−∞∞eitxx2+1dx∫_-∞^∞e^itx/x^2+1 dx The contour C. arises in probability theory when calculating the characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution. It resists the techniques of elementary calculus but can be evaluated by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals. Suppose t > 0 and define the contour C that goes along the real line from −a to a and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from a to −a. Take a to be greater than 1, so that the imaginary unit i is enclosed within the curve. Now consider the contour integral ∫Cf(z)dz=∫Ceitzz2+1dz.∫_Cf(z) dz=∫_Ce^itz/z^2+1 dz. Since eitz is an entire function (having no singularities at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator z2 + 1 is zero. Since z2 + 1 = (z + i)(z − i), that happens only where z = i or z = −i. Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. Because f(z) is eitzz2+1=eitz2i(1z−i−1z+i)=eitz2i(z−i)−eitz2i(z+i),e^itz/z^2+1 =e^itz/2i(1/z-i-1/z+i) =e^itz/2i(z-i)-e^itz/2i(z+i), the residue of f(z) at z = i is Resz=i⁡f(z)=e−t2i.Res_z=if(z)=e^-t/2i. According to the residue theorem, then, we have ∫Cf(z)dz=2πi⋅Resz=i⁡f(z)=2πie−t2i=πe−t.∫_Cf(z) dz=2·Res_z=if(z)=2e^-t/2i=^-t. The contour C may be split into a straight part and a curved arc, so that ∫straightf(z)dz+∫arcf(z)dz=πe−t∫_straightf(z) dz+∫_arcf(z) dz=^-t and thus ∫−aaf(z)dz=πe−t−∫arcf(z)dz.∫_-a^af(z) dz=^-t-∫_arcf(z) dz. Using some estimations, we have |∫arceitzz2+1dz|≤πa⋅suparc|eitzz2+1|≤πa⋅suparc1|z2+1|≤πaa2−1,|∫_arce^itz/z^2+1 dz|≤·sup_arc|e^itz/z^2+1|≤·sup_arc1/|z^2+1|≤/a^2-1, and lima→∞πaa2−1=0.lim_a→∞/a^2-1=0. The estimate on the numerator follows since t > 0, and for complex numbers z along the arc (which lies in the upper half-plane), the argument φ of z lies between 0 and π. So, |eitz|=|eit|z|(cos⁡φ+isin⁡φ)|=|e−t|z|sin⁡φ+it|z|cos⁡φ|=e−t|z|sin⁡φ≤1.|e^itz|=|e^it|z|(cosφ+isinφ)|=|e^-t|z|sinφ+it|z|cosφ|=e^-t|z|sinφ≤1. Therefore, ∫−∞∞eitzz2+1dz=πe−t.∫_-∞^∞e^itz/z^2+1 dz=^-t. If t < 0 then a similar argument with an arc C′ that winds around −i rather than i shows that The contour C′. ∫−∞∞eitzz2+1dz=πet,∫_-∞^∞e^itz/z^2+1 dz=^t, and finally we have ∫−∞∞eitzz2+1dz=πe−|t|.∫_-∞^∞e^itz/z^2+1 dz=^-|t|. (If t = 0 then the integral yields immediately to elementary calculus methods and its value is π.) Evaluating zeta
