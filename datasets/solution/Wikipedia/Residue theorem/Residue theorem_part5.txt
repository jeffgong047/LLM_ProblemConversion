functions: The fact that π cot(πz) has simple poles with residue 1 at each integer can be used to compute the sum ∑n=−∞∞f(n).∑_n=-∞^∞f(n). Consider, for example, f(z) = z−2. Let ΓN be the rectangle that is the boundary of [−N − 1/2, N + 1/2]2 with positive orientation, with an integer N. By the residue formula, 12πi∫ΓNf(z)πcot⁡(πz)dz=Resz=0+∑n=−Nn≠0Nn−2.1/2∫_Γ_Nf(z)π() dz=Res_z=0+∑_n=-N≠0^Nn^-2. The left-hand side goes to zero as N → ∞ since |cot⁡(πz)||()| is uniformly bounded on the contour, thanks to using x=±(12+N)=±(1/2+N) on the left and right side of the contour, and so the integrand has order O(N−2)(N^-2) over the entire contour. On the other hand,[2] z2cot⁡(z2)=1−B2z22!+⋯z/2(z/2)=1-B_2z^2/2!+⋯ where the Bernoulli number B2=16._2=1/6. (In fact, z/2 cot(z/2) = iz/1 − e−iz − iz/2.) Thus, the residue Resz=0 is −π2/3. We conclude: ∑n=1∞1n2=π26∑_n=1^∞1/n^2=π^2/6 which is a proof of the Basel problem. The same argument works for all f(x)=x−2n(x)=x^-2n where n is a positive integer, giving usζ(2n)=(−1)n+1B2n(2π)2n2(2n)!.ζ(2n)=(-1)^n+1B_2n(2π)^2n/2(2n)!.The trick does not work when f(x)=x−2n−1(x)=x^-2n-1, since in this case, the residue at zero vanishes, and we obtain the useless identity 0+ζ(2n+1)−ζ(2n+1)=00+ζ(2n+1)-ζ(2n+1)=0.
