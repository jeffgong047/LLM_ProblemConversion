Statement: The statement is as follows: Illustration of the setting Let U be a simply connected open subset of the complex plane containing a finite list of points a1,…,an,_1,…,a_n, U0=U∖a1,…,an,_0=U∖{a_1,…,a_n}, and a function f holomorphic on U0._0. Letting γγ be a closed rectifiable curve in U0,_0, and denoting the residue of f at each point ak_k by Res⁡(f,ak)Res(f,a_k) and the winding number of γγ around ak_k by I⁡(γ,ak),I(γ,a_k), the line integral of f around γγ is equal to 2πi2 times the sum of residues, each counted as many times as γγ winds around the respective point: ∮γf(z)dz=2πi∑k=1nI⁡(γ,ak)Res⁡(f,ak).∮_γf(z) dz=2∑_k=1^nI(γ,a_k)Res(f,a_k). If γγ is a positively oriented simple closed curve, I⁡(γ,ak)I(γ,a_k) is 11 if ak_k is in the interior of γγ and 00 if not, therefore ∮γf(z)dz=2πi∑Res⁡(f,ak)∮_γf(z) dz=2∑Res(f,a_k) with the sum over those ak_k inside γ.γ.[1] The relationship of the residue theorem to Stokes' theorem is given by the Jordan curve theorem. The general plane curve γ must first be reduced to a set of simple closed curves γi{γ_i} whose total is equivalent to γγ for integration purposes; this reduces the problem to finding the integral of fdz dz along a Jordan curve γiγ_i with interior V.. The requirement that f be holomorphic on U0=U∖ak_0=U∖{a_k} is equivalent to the statement that the exterior derivative d(fdz)=0(f dz)=0 on U0._0. Thus if two planar regions V and W of U enclose the same subset aj{a_j} of ak,{a_k}, the regions V∖W and W∖V lie entirely in U0,_0, hence ∫V∖Wd(fdz)−∫W∖Vd(fdz)∫_Vd(f dz)-∫_Wd(f dz) is well-defined and equal to zero. Consequently, the contour integral of fdz dz along γj=∂Vγ_j= is equal to the sum of a set of integrals along paths γj,γ_j, each enclosing an arbitrarily small region around a single aj_j — the residues of f (up to the conventional factor 2πi2 at aj.{a_j}. Summing over γj,{γ_j}, we recover the final expression of the contour integral in terms of the winding numbers I⁡(γ,ak).{I(γ,a_k). In order to evaluate real integrals, the residue theorem is used in the following manner: the integrand is extended to the complex plane and its residues are computed (which is usually easy), and a part of the real axis is extended to a closed curve by attaching a half-circle in the upper or lower half-plane, forming a semicircle. The integral over this curve can then be computed using the residue theorem. Often, the half-circle part of the integral will tend towards zero as the radius of the half-circle grows, leaving only the real-axis part of the integral, the one we were originally interested in.
