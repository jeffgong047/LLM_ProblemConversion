Observations: The theorem is included as one of Clifford Pickover's 250 milestones in the history of mathematics.[1] Some peculiarities of the theorem include that the area formula Ï€pq is independent of both the shape and the size of the original curve, and that the area formula is the same as for that of the area of an ellipse with semi-axes p and q. The theorem's author was a president of Caius College, Cambridge.
