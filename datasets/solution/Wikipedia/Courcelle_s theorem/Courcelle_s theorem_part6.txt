congruences: Another direction for extending Courcelle's theorem concerns logical formulas that include predicates for counting the size of the test. In this context, it is not possible to perform arbitrary arithmetic operations on set sizes, nor even to test whether two sets have the same size. However, MSO1 and MSO2 can be extended to logics called CMSO1 and CMSO2, that include for every two constants q and r a predicate cardq,r‚Å°(S)card_q,r(S) which tests whether the cardinality of set S is congruent to r modulo q. Courcelle's theorem can be extended to these logics.[4] Decision versus
