Proof: Visual proof of Viviani's theorem 1. Nearest distances from point P to sides of equilateral triangle ABC are shown. 2. Lines DE, FG, and HI parallel to AB, BC and CA, respectively, and passing through P define similar triangles PHE, PFI and PDG. 3. As these triangles are equilateral, their altitudes can be rotated to be vertical. 4. As PGCH is a parallelogram, triangle PHE can be slid up to show that the altitudes sum to that of triangle ABC. This proof depends on the readily-proved proposition that the area of a triangle is half its base times its height—that is, half the product of one side with the altitude from that side.[2] Let ABC be an equilateral triangle whose height is h and whose side is a. Let P be any point inside the triangle, and u, s, t the distances of P from the sides. Draw a line from P to each of A, B, and C, forming three triangles PAB, PBC, and PCA. Now, the areas of these triangles are u⋅a2u/2, s⋅a2s/2, and t⋅a2t/2. They exactly fill the enclosing triangle, so the sum of these areas is equal to the area of the enclosing triangle. So we can write: u⋅a2+s⋅a2+t⋅a2=h⋅a2u/2+s/2+t/2=h/2 and thus u+s+t=h+s+t=h Q.E.D.
