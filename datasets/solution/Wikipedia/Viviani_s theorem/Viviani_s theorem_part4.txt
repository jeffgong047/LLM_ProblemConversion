Applications: Flammability diagram for methane Further information: Ternary plot Viviani's theorem means that lines parallel to the sides of an equilateral triangle give coordinates for making ternary plots, such as flammability diagrams. More generally, they allow one to give coordinates on a regular simplex in the same way.
