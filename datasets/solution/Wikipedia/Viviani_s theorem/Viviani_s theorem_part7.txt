polygon: If a polygon is regular (both equiangular and equilateral), the sum of the distances to the sides from an interior point is independent of the location of the point. Specifically, it equals n times the apothem, where n is the number of sides and the apothem is the distance from the center to a side.[3][4] However, the converse does not hold; the non-square parallelogram is a counterexample.[3] Equiangular
