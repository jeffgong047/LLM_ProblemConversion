In algebraic geometry, the Ramanujam vanishing theorem is an extension of the Kodaira vanishing theorem due to Ramanujam (1972), that in particular gives conditions for the vanishing of first cohomology groups of coherent sheaves on a surface. The Kawamataâ€“Viehweg vanishing theorem generalizes it. See
