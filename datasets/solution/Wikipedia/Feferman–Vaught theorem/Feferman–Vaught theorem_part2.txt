structures: Consider a first-order logic signature L. The definition of product structures takes a family of L-structures Ai𝐀_i for i∈I for some index set I and defines the product structure A=∏i∈IAi𝐀=∏_i𝐀_i, which is also an L-structure, with all functions and relations defined pointwise. The definition generalizes direct product in universal algebra to relational first-order structures, which contain not only function symbols but also relation symbols. If r(a1,…,ap)(a_1,…,a_p) is a relation symbol with p arguments in L and a1,…,an∈Πi∈IAi_1,…,a_n∈Π_i𝐀_i are elements of the cartesian product, we define the interpretation of r in A𝐀 by A⊨r(a1,…,ap)⟺∀i∈I,Ai⊨r(a1(i),…,ap(i))𝐀(a_1,…,a_p), mathbfA_i(a_1(i),…,a_p(i)) When r is a functional relation, this definition reduces to the definition of direct product in universal algebra.
