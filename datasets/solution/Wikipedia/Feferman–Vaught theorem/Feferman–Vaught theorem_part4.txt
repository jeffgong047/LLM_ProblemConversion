idea: Formula ϕ∗ϕ^* can be constructed following the structure of the starting formula ϕ∗ϕ^*. When ϕϕ is quantifier free then, by definition of direct product above it follows A⊨ϕ(a¯)⟺∀i∈I.Ai⊨ϕ(a¯(i))⟺i∣Ai⊨ϕ(a¯(i))=I⟺||ϕ(a¯)||=I[ 𝐀ϕ(a̅) .; mathbfA_iϕ(a̅(i)); {i|𝐀_iϕ(a̅(i))}=I; ||ϕ(a̅)||=I ] Consequently, we can take ϕ∗(U,X1)ϕ^*(U,X_1) to be the equality U=X1=X_1 in the language of boolean algebra of sets (equivalently, the field of sets). Extending the condition to quantified formulas can be viewed as a form of quantifier elimination, where quantification over product elements a¯a̅ in ϕϕ is reduced to quantification over subsets of I.
