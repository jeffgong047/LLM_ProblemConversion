products: It is often of interest to consider substructure of the direct product structure. If the restriction that defines product elements that belong to the substructure can be expressed as a condition on the sets of index elements, then the results can be generalized. An example is the substructure of product elements that are constant at all but finitely many indices. Assume that the language L contains a constant symbol c and consider the substructure containing only those product elements a for which the set i∣Ai⊨a(i)≠c{i|A_i(i)} is finite. The theorem then reduces the truth value in such substructure to a formula ϕ∗ϕ^* in the boolean algebra of sets, where certain sets are restricted to be finite. One way to define generalized products is to consider those substructures where the sets ||ϕ(a)||||ϕ(a)|| belong to some boolean algebra B of sets X⊆I of indices (a subset of the powerset set algebra 2I2^I), and where the product substructure admits gluing.[6] Here admitting gluing refers to the following closure condition: if a,b,b are two product elements and X∈B is the element of the boolean algebra, then so is the element c defined by "gluing" a and b according to X: c(i)=a(i),ifi∈Xb(i),ifi∈(I∖X)(i)={[ a(i), i; b(i), i∈(I) ].
