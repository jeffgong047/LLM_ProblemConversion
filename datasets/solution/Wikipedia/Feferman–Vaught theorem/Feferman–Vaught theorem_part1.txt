Theorem about products in model theory Fefermanâ€“Vaught theorem[1] in model theory is a theorem by Solomon Feferman and Robert Lawson Vaught that shows how to reduce, in an algorithmic way, the first-order theory of a product of first-order structures to the first-order theory of elements of the structure. The theorem is considered as one of the standard results in model theory.[2][3][4] The theorem extends the previous result of Andrzej Mostowski on direct products of theories.[5] It generalizes (to formulas with arbitrary quantifiers) the property in universal algebra that equalities (identities) carry over to direct products of algebraic structures (which is a consequence of one direction of Birkhoff's theorem).
