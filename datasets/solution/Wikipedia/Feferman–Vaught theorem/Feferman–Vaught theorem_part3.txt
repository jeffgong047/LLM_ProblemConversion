products: For a first-order logic formula ϕ(x¯)ϕ(x̅) in signature L with free variables, and for an interpretation a¯a̅ of the variables x¯x̅, we define the set of indices i for which ϕ(a¯)ϕ(a̅) holds in Ai𝐀_i ||ϕ(a¯)||=i∣Ai⊨ϕ(a¯(i))||ϕ(a̅)||={i|𝐀_iϕ(a̅(i))} Given a first-order formula with free variables ϕ(x¯)ϕ(x̅), there is an algorithm to compute its equivalent game normal form, which is a finite disjunction ⋁i=0k−1θ(x¯)⋁_i=0^k-1θ(x̅) of mutually contradictory formulas. The Feferman-Vaught theorem gives an algorithm that takes a first-order formula ϕ(x¯)ϕ(x̅) and constructs a formula ϕ∗ϕ^* that reduces the condition that ϕ(a¯)ϕ(a̅) holds in the product to the condition that ϕ∗ϕ^* holds in the interpretation of k+1+1 sets of indices: I,||θ0(a¯)||,…,||θk−1(a¯)||,||θ_0(a̅)||,…,||θ_k-1(a̅)|| Formula ϕ∗ϕ^* is thus a formula with k+1+1 free set variables, for example, in the first-order theory of Boolean algebra of sets.
