characteristic: The Lefschetz number of the identity map on a finite CW complex can be easily computed by realizing that each f∗_∗ can be thought of as an identity matrix, and so each trace term is simply the dimension of the appropriate homology group. Thus the Lefschetz number of the identity map is equal to the alternating sum of the Betti numbers of the space, which in turn is equal to the Euler characteristic χ(X)χ(X). Thus we have Λid=χ(X).Λ_id=χ(X).} Relation to the Brouwer fixed-point
