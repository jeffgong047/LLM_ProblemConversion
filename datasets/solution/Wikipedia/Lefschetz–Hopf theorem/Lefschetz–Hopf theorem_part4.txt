theorem: A stronger form of the theorem, also known as the Lefschetz–Hopf theorem, states that, if f has only finitely many fixed points, then ∑x∈Fix(f)i(f,x)=Λf,∑_x∈Fix(f)i(f,x)=Λ_f, where Fix(f)Fix(f) is the set of fixed points of f, and i(f,x)(f,x) denotes the index of the fixed point x.[1] From this theorem one deduces the Poincaré–Hopf theorem for vector fields.
