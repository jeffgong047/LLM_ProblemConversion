Frobenius: Let X be a variety defined over the finite field k with q elements and let X¯X̅ be the base change of X to the algebraic closure of k. The Frobenius endomorphism of X¯X̅ (often the geometric Frobenius, or just the Frobenius), denoted by Fq_q, maps a point with coordinates x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n to the point with coordinates x1q,…,xnq_1^q,…,x_n^q. Thus the fixed points of Fq_q are exactly the points of X with coordinates in k; the set of such points is denoted by X(k)(k). The Lefschetz trace formula holds in this context, and reads: #X(k)=∑i(−1)itr(Fq∗|Hci(X¯,Qℓ)).#X(k)=∑_i(-1)^itr(F_q^*|H_c^i(X̅,ℚ_ℓ)). This formula involves the trace of the Frobenius on the étale cohomology, with compact supports, of X¯X̅ with values in the field of ℓℓ-adic numbers, where ℓℓ is a prime coprime to q. If X is smooth and equidimensional, this formula can be rewritten in terms of the arithmetic Frobenius ΦqΦ_q, which acts as the inverse of Fq_q on cohomology: #X(k)=qdim⁡X∑i(−1)itr((Φq−1)∗|Hi(X¯,Qℓ)).#X(k)=q^∑_i(-1)^itr((Φ_q^-1)^*|H^i(X̅,ℚ_ℓ)). This formula involves usual cohomology, rather than cohomology with compact supports. The Lefschetz trace formula can also be generalized to algebraic stacks over finite fields. See
