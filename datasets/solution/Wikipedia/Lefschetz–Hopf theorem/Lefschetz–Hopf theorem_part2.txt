statement: For a formal statement of the theorem, let f:X→X be a continuous map from a compact triangulable space X to itself. Define the Lefschetz number ΛfΛ_f of f by Λf:=∑k≥0(−1)ktr(f∗|Hk(X,Q)),Λ_f:=∑_k≥0(-1)^ktr(f_*|H_k(X,ℚ)), the alternating (finite) sum of the matrix traces of the linear maps induced by f on Hk(X,Q)_k(X,ℚ), the singular homology groups of X with rational coefficients. A simple version of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem states: if Λf≠0Λ_f≠0 then f has at least one fixed point, i.e., there exists at least one x in X such that f(x)=x(x)=x. In fact, since the Lefschetz number has been defined at the homology level, the conclusion can be extended to say that any map homotopic to f has a fixed point as well. Note however that the converse is not true in general: ΛfΛ_f may be zero even if f has fixed points, as is the case for the identity map on odd-dimensional spheres. Sketch of a
