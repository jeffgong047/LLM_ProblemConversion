proof: Given r>1,>1 , let s=r/(r−1)=r/(r-1). We must show that every positive integer lies in one and only one of the two sequences Brℬ_r and Bsℬ_s. We shall do so by considering the ordinal positions occupied by all the fractions j/r/r and k/s/s when they are jointly listed in nondecreasing order for positive integers j and k. To see that no two of the numbers can occupy the same position (as a single number), suppose to the contrary that j/r=k/s/r=k/s for some j and k. Then r/s/s = j/k/k, a rational number, but also, r/s=r(1−1/r)=r−1,/s=r(1-1/r)=r-1, not a rational number. Therefore, no two of the numbers occupy the same position. For any j/r/r, there are j positive integers i such that i/r≤j/r/r/r and ⌊js/r⌋/r⌋ positive integers k such that k/s≤j/r/s/r, so that the position of j/r/r in the list is j+⌊js/r⌋+/r⌋. The equation 1/r+1/s=11/r+1/s=1 implies j+⌊js/r⌋=j+⌊j(s−1)⌋=⌊js⌋.+/r⌋=j+(s-1)⌋=⌋. Likewise, the position of k/s/s in the list is ⌊kr⌋⌋. Conclusion: every positive integer (that is, every position in the list) is of the form ⌊nr⌋⌋ or of the form ⌊ns⌋⌋, but not both. The converse statement is also true: if p and q are two real numbers such that every positive integer occurs precisely once in the above list, then p and q are irrational and the sum of their reciprocals is 1.
