Examples: When r is the golden ratio r=(1+5)/2≈1.618=(1+√(5))/2≈1.618, the complementary Beatty sequence is generated by s=r+1=(3+5)/2≈2.618=r+1=(3+√(5))/2≈2.618. In this case, the sequence (⌊nr⌋)(⌋), known as the lower Wythoff sequence, is 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, ... (sequence A000201 in the OEIS), and the complementary sequence (⌊ns⌋)(⌋), the upper Wythoff sequence, is 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 47, ... (sequence A001950 in the OEIS). These sequences define the optimal strategy for Wythoff's game, and are used in the definition of the Wythoff array. As another example, for the square root of 2, r=2≈1.414=√(2)≈1.414, s=2+2≈3.414=2+√(2)≈3.414. In this case, the sequences are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, ... (sequence A001951 in the OEIS), and 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37, 40, 44, 47, 51, 54, 58, ... (sequence A001952 in the OEIS). For r=π≈3.142=π≈3.142 and s=π/(π−1)≈1.467=π/(π-1)≈1.467, the sequences are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 47, 50, 53, ... (sequence A022844 in the OEIS), and 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, ... (sequence A054386 in the OEIS). Any number in the first sequence is absent in the second, and vice versa.
