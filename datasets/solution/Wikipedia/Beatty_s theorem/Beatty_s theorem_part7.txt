proof: Collisions: Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that j=⌊k⋅r⌋=⌊m⋅s⌋.=⌊k⌋=⌊m⋯⌋ . This is equivalent to the inequalities j≤k⋅r<j+1andj≤m⋅s<j+1.<j+1andj⋯<j+1. For non-zero j, the irrationality of r and s is incompatible with equality, so j<k⋅r<j+1andj<m⋅s<j+1,<k<j+1andj<m⋯<j+1, which leads to jr<k<j+1randjs<m<j+1s.j<k<j+1andj<m<j+1. Adding these together and using the hypothesis, we get j<k+m<j+1<k+m<j+1 which is impossible (one cannot have an integer between two adjacent integers). Thus the supposition must be false. Anti-collisions: Suppose that, contrary to the theorem, there are integers j > 0 and k and m such that k⋅r<jandj+1≤(k+1)⋅randm⋅s<jandj+1≤(m+1)⋅s.<jandj+1≤(k+1)andm⋯<jandj+1≤(m+1)⋯ . Since j + 1 is non-zero and r and s are irrational, we can exclude equality, so k⋅r<jandj+1<(k+1)⋅randm⋅s<jandj+1<(m+1)⋅s.<jandj+1<(k+1)andm⋯<jandj+1<(m+1)⋯. Then we get k<jrandj+1r<k+1andm<jsandj+1s<m+1<jandj+1<k+1andm<jandj+1<m+1 Adding corresponding inequalities, we get k+m<jandj+1<k+m+2+m<jandj+1<k+m+2 k+m<j<k+m+1+m<j<k+m+1 which is also impossible. Thus the supposition is false.
