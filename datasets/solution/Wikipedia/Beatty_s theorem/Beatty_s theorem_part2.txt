Definition: Any irrational number r that is greater than one generates the Beatty sequence Br=⌊r⌋,⌊2r⌋,⌊3r⌋,…ℬ_r={⌋,⌊2r⌋,⌊3r⌋,…} The two irrational numbers r and s=r/(r−1)=r/(r-1) naturally satisfy the equation 1/r+1/s=11/r+1/s=1. The two Beatty sequences Brℬ_r and Bsℬ_s that they generate form a pair of complementary Beatty sequences. Here, "complementary" means that every positive integer belongs to exactly one of these two sequences.
