Generalizations: If slightly modified, the Rayleigh's theorem can be generalized to positive real numbers (not necessarily irrational) and negative integers as well: if positive real numbers r and s satisfy 1/r+1/s=11/r+1/s=1, the sequences (⌊mr⌋)m∈Z(⌋)_m∈ℤ and (⌈ns⌉−1)n∈Z(⌉-1)_n∈ℤ form a partition of integers. For example, the white and black keys of a piano keyboard are distributed as such sequences for r=12/7=12/7 and s=12/5=12/5. The Lambek–Moser theorem generalizes the Rayleigh theorem and shows that more general pairs of sequences defined from an integer function and its inverse have the same property of partitioning the integers. Uspensky's theorem states that, if α1,…,αnα_1,…,α_n are positive real numbers such that (⌊kαi⌋)k,i≥1(α_i⌋)_k,i≥1 contains all positive integers exactly once, then n≤2.≤2. That is, there is no equivalent of Rayleigh's theorem for three or more Beatty sequences.[4][5]
