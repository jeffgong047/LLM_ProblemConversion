Introduction: Consider the differential equation y′(t)=f(t,y(t))'(t)=f(t,y(t)) with initial condition y(t0)=y0,(t_0)=y_0, where the function ƒ is defined on a rectangular domain of the form R=(t,y)∈R×Rn:|t−t0|≤a,|y−y0|≤b.={(t,y)∈𝐑×𝐑^n : |t-t_0|,|y-y_0|}. Peano's existence theorem states that if ƒ is continuous, then the differential equation has at least one solution in a neighbourhood of the initial condition.[1] However, it is also possible to consider differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side, like the equation y′(t)=H(t),y(0)=0,'(t)=H(t),(0)=0, where H denotes the Heaviside function defined by H(t)=0,ift≤0;1,ift>0.(t)=0, ift≤0; 1, ift>0. It makes sense to consider the ramp function y(t)=∫0tH(s)ds=0,ift≤0;t,ift>0(t)=∫_0^tH(s) ds=0, ift≤0; t, ift>0 as a solution of the differential equation. Strictly speaking though, it does not satisfy the differential equation at t=0=0, because the function is not differentiable there. This suggests that the idea of a solution be extended to allow for solutions that are not everywhere differentiable, thus motivating the following definition. A function y is called a solution in the extended sense of the differential equation y′=f(t,y)'=f(t,y) with initial condition y(t0)=y0(t_0)=y_0 if y is absolutely continuous, y satisfies the differential equation almost everywhere and y satisfies the initial condition.[2] The absolute continuity of y implies that its derivative exists almost everywhere.[3] Statement of the
