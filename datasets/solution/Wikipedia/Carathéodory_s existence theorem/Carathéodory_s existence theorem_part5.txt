Example: Consider a linear initial value problem of the form y′(t)=A(t)y(t)+b(t),y(t0)=y0.'(t)=A(t)y(t)+b(t),(t_0)=y_0. Here, the components of the matrix-valued mapping A:R→Rn×n𝐑→𝐑^n and of the inhomogeneity b:R→Rn𝐑→𝐑^n are assumed to be integrable on every finite interval. Then, the right hand side of the differential equation satisfies the Carathéodory conditions and there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem.[7] See
