In mathematics, Carathéodory's existence theorem says that an ordinary differential equation has a solution under relatively mild conditions. It is a generalization of Peano's existence theorem. Peano's theorem requires that the right-hand side of the differential equation be continuous, while Carathéodory's theorem shows existence of solutions (in a more general sense) for some discontinuous equations. The theorem is named after Constantin Carathéodory.


Introduction[edit]
Consider the differential equation

y′(t)=f(t,y(t))'(t)=f(t,y(t))
with initial condition

y(t0)=y0,(t_0)=y_0,
where the function ƒ is defined on a rectangular domain of the form

R=(t,y)∈R×Rn:|t−t0|≤a,|y−y0|≤b.={(t,y)∈𝐑×𝐑^n : |t-t_0|,|y-y_0|}.
Peano's existence theorem states that if ƒ is continuous, then the differential equation has at least one solution in a neighbourhood of the initial condition.[1]
However, it is also possible to consider differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side, like the equation

y′(t)=H(t),y(0)=0,'(t)=H(t),(0)=0,
where H denotes the Heaviside function defined by

H(t)=0,ift≤0;1,ift>0.(t)=0,   ift≤0;
1,   ift>0.
It makes sense to consider the ramp function

y(t)=∫0tH(s)ds=0,ift≤0;t,ift>0(t)=∫_0^tH(s) ds=0,   ift≤0;
t,   ift>0
as a solution of the differential equation. Strictly speaking though, it does not satisfy the differential equation at t=0=0, because the function is not differentiable there. This suggests that the idea of a solution be extended to allow for solutions that are not everywhere differentiable, thus motivating the following definition.
A function y is called a solution in the extended sense of the differential equation y′=f(t,y)'=f(t,y) with initial condition y(t0)=y0(t_0)=y_0 if y is absolutely continuous, y satisfies the differential equation almost everywhere and y satisfies the initial condition.[2] The absolute continuity of y implies that its derivative exists almost everywhere.[3]

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Consider the differential equation

y′(t)=f(t,y(t)),y(t0)=y0,'(t)=f(t,y(t)),(t_0)=y_0,
with f defined on the rectangular domain R=(t,y)||t−t0|≤a,|y−y0|≤b={(t,y) | |t-t_0|,|y-y_0|}. If the function f satisfies the following three conditions:

f(t,y)(t,y) is continuous in y for each fixed t,
f(t,y)(t,y) is measurable in t  for each fixed y,
there is a Lebesgue-integrable function m:[t0−a,t0+a]→[0,∞):[t_0-a,t_0+a]→[0,∞) such that |f(t,y)|≤m(t)|f(t,y)|(t) for all (t,y)∈R(t,y),
then the differential equation has a solution in the extended sense in a neighborhood of the initial condition.[4]
A mapping f:R→Rn→𝐑^n is said to satisfy the Carathéodory conditions on R if it fulfills the condition of the theorem.[5]

Uniqueness of a solution[edit]
Assume that the mapping f satisfies the Carathéodory conditions on R and there is a Lebesgue-integrable function k:[t0−a,t0+a]→[0,∞):[t_0-a,t_0+a]→[0,∞), such that 

|f(t,y1)−f(t,y2)|≤k(t)|y1−y2|,|f(t,y_1)-f(t,y_2)|(t)|y_1-y_2|,
for all (t,y1)∈R,(t,y2)∈R.(t,y_1),(t,y_2). Then, there exists a unique solution y(t)=y(t,t0,y0)(t)=y(t,t_0,y_0)
to the initial value problem

y′(t)=f(t,y(t)),y(t0)=y0.'(t)=f(t,y(t)),(t_0)=y_0.
Moreover, if the mapping f is defined on the whole space R×Rn𝐑×𝐑^n
and if for any initial condition (t0,y0)∈R×Rn(t_0,y_0)∈𝐑×𝐑^n, there exists a compact rectangular domain R(t0,y0)⊂R×Rn_(t_0,y_0)⊂𝐑×𝐑^n such  that the mapping f satisfies all conditions from above on R(t0,y0)_(t_0,y_0). Then, the domain E⊂R2+n⊂𝐑^2+n of definition of the function y(t,t0,y0)(t,t_0,y_0) is open and y(t,t0,y0)(t,t_0,y_0) is continuous on E.[6]

Example[edit]
Consider a linear initial value problem of the form

y′(t)=A(t)y(t)+b(t),y(t0)=y0.'(t)=A(t)y(t)+b(t),(t_0)=y_0.
Here, the components of the matrix-valued mapping A:R→Rn×n𝐑→𝐑^n and of the inhomogeneity b:R→Rn𝐑→𝐑^n are assumed to be integrable on every finite interval. Then, the right hand side of the differential equation satisfies the Carathéodory conditions and there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem.[7]
