theorem: Consider the differential equation y′(t)=f(t,y(t)),y(t0)=y0,'(t)=f(t,y(t)),(t_0)=y_0, with f defined on the rectangular domain R=(t,y)||t−t0|≤a,|y−y0|≤b={(t,y) | |t-t_0|,|y-y_0|}. If the function f satisfies the following three conditions: f(t,y)(t,y) is continuous in y for each fixed t, f(t,y)(t,y) is measurable in t for each fixed y, there is a Lebesgue-integrable function m:[t0−a,t0+a]→[0,∞):[t_0-a,t_0+a]→[0,∞) such that |f(t,y)|≤m(t)|f(t,y)|(t) for all (t,y)∈R(t,y), then the differential equation has a solution in the extended sense in a neighborhood of the initial condition.[4] A mapping f:R→Rn→𝐑^n is said to satisfy the Carathéodory conditions on R if it fulfills the condition of the theorem.[5] Uniqueness of a
