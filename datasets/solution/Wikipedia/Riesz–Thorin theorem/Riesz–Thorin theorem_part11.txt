operators: Main article: Young's convolution inequality Let f be a fixed integrable function and let T be the operator of convolution with f , i.e., for each function g we have Tg = f ∗ g. It is well known that T is bounded from L1 to L1 and it is trivial that it is bounded from L∞ to L∞ (both bounds are by || f ||1). Therefore the Riesz–Thorin theorem gives ‖f∗g‖p≤‖f‖1‖g‖p.f*g_p≤f_1g_p. We take this inequality and switch the role of the operator and the operand, or in other words, we think of S as the operator of convolution with g, and get that S is bounded from L1 to Lp. Further, since g is in Lp we get, in view of Hölder's inequality, that S is bounded from Lq to L∞, where again 1/p + 1/q = 1. So interpolating we get ‖f∗g‖s≤‖f‖r‖g‖pf*g_s≤f_rg_p where the connection between p, r and s is 1r+1p=1+1s.1/r+1/p=1+1/s. The Hilbert
