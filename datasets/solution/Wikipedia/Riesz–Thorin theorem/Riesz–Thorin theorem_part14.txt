theorem: B. Mityagin extended the Riesz–Thorin theorem; this extension is formulated here in the special case of spaces of sequences with unconditional bases (cf. below). Assume: ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ1,‖A‖ℓ∞→ℓ∞≤M.A_ℓ_1→ℓ_1,A_ℓ_∞→ℓ_∞. Then ‖A‖X→X≤MA_X for any unconditional Banach space of sequences X, that is, for any (xi)∈X(x_i) and any (εi)∈−1,1∞(ε_i)∈{-1,1}^∞, ‖(εixi)‖X=‖(xi)‖X(ε_ix_i)_X=(x_i)_X. The proof is based on the Krein–Milman theorem. See
