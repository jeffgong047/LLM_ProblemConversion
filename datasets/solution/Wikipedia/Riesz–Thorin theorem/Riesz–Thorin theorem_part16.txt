Notes: ^ Stein and Weiss (1971) and Grafakos (2010) use operators on simple functions, and Muscalu and Schlag (2013) uses operators on generic dense subsets of the intersection Lp0 ∩ Lp1. In contrast, Duoanddikoetxea (2001), Tao (2010), and Stein and Shakarchi (2011) use the sumset formulation, which we adopt in this section. ^ Riesz (1927). The proof makes use of convexity results in the theory of bilinear forms. For this reason, many classical references such as Stein and Weiss (1971) refer to the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem as the Riesz convexity theorem. ^ Thorin (1948) ^ Bernard, Calista. "Interpolation theorems and applications" (PDF). ^ Stein (1956). As Charles Fefferman points out in his essay in Fefferman, Fefferman, Wainger (1995), the proof of Stein interpolation theorem is essentially that of the Riesz–Thorin theorem with the letter z added to the operator. To compensate for this, a stronger version of the Hadamard three-lines theorem, due to Isidore Isaac Hirschman, Jr., is used to establish the desired bounds. See Stein and Weiss (1971) for a detailed proof, and a blog post of Tao for a high-level exposition of the theorem. ^ Fefferman and Stein (1972) ^ Elias Stein is quoted for saying that interesting operators in harmonic analysis are rarely bounded on L1 and L∞.
