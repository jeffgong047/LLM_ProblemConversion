inequality: Main article: Hausdorff–Young inequality It has been shown in the first section that the Fourier transform Fℱ maps L1(Rd) boundedly into L∞(Rd) and L2(Rd) into itself. A similar argument shows that the Fourier series operator, which transforms periodic functions f : T → C into functions f^:Z→Cf̂:𝐙→𝐂 whose values are the Fourier coefficients f^(n)=12π∫−ππf(x)e−inxdx,f̂(n)=1/2π∫_-π^πf(x)e^-inx dx, maps L1(T) boundedly into ℓ∞(Z) and L2(T) into ℓ2(Z). The Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem now implies the following: ‖Ff‖Lq(Rd)≤‖f‖Lp(Rd)‖f^‖ℓq(Z)≤‖f‖Lp(T)ℱf_L^q(𝐑^d) ≤f_L^p(𝐑^d) f̂_ℓ^q(𝐙) ≤f_L^p(𝐓) where 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 and 1/p + 1/q = 1. This is the Hausdorff–Young inequality. The Hausdorff–Young inequality can also be established for the Fourier transform on locally compact Abelian groups. The norm estimate of 1 is not optimal.
