transform: Main article: Hilbert transform The Hilbert transform of f : R → C is given by Hf(x)=1πp.v.∫−∞∞f(x−t)tdt=(1πp.v.1t∗f)(x),ℋf(x)=1/π p.v.∫_-∞^∞f(x-t)/t dt=(1/π p.v.1/t)(x), where p.v. indicates the Cauchy principal value of the integral. The Hilbert transform is a Fourier multiplier operator with a particularly simple multiplier: Hf^(ξ)=−isgn⁡(ξ)f^(ξ).ℋf(ξ)=-i sgn(ξ)f̂(ξ). It follows from the Plancherel theorem that the Hilbert transform maps L2(R) boundedly into itself. Nevertheless, the Hilbert transform is not bounded on L1(R) or L∞(R), and so we cannot use the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem directly. To see why we do not have these endpoint bounds, it suffices to compute the Hilbert transform of the simple functions 1(−1,1)(x) and 1(0,1)(x) − 1(0,1)(−x). We can show, however, that (Hf)2=f2+2H(fHf)(ℋf)^2=f^2+2ℋ(fℋf) for all Schwartz functions f : R → C, and this identity can be used in conjunction with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to show that the Hilbert transform maps L2n(Rd) boundedly into itself for all n ≥ 2. Interpolation now establishes the bound ‖Hf‖p≤Ap‖f‖pℋf_p_pf_p for all 2 ≤ p < ∞, and the self-adjointness of the Hilbert transform can be used to carry over these bounds to the 1 < p ≤ 2 case.
