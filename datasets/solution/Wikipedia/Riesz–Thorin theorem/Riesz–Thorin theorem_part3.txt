theorem: There are several ways to state the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem;[1] to be consistent with the notations in the previous section, we shall use the sumset formulation. Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem — Let (Ω1, Σ1, μ1) and (Ω2, Σ2, μ2) be σ-finite measure spaces. Suppose 1 ≤ p0 , q0 , p1 , q1 ≤ ∞, and let T : Lp0(μ1) + Lp1(μ1) → Lq0(μ2) + Lq1(μ2) be a linear operator that boundedly maps Lp0(μ1) into Lq0(μ2) and Lp1(μ1) into Lq1(μ2). For 0 < θ < 1, let pθ, qθ be defined as above. Then T boundedly maps Lpθ(μ1) into Lqθ(μ2) and satisfies the operator norm estimate ‖T‖Lpθ→Lqθ≤‖T‖Lp0→Lq01−θ‖T‖Lp1→Lq1θ.T_L^p_θ^q_θ≤T_L^p_0^q_0^1-θT_L^p_1^q_1^θ. (2) In other words, if T is simultaneously of type (p0, q0) and of type (p1, q1), then T is of type (pθ, qθ) for all 0 < θ < 1. In this manner, the interpolation theorem lends itself to a pictorial description. Indeed, the Riesz diagram of T is the collection of all points (1/p, 1/q) in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] such that T is of type (p, q). The interpolation theorem states that the Riesz diagram of T is a convex set: given two points in the Riesz diagram, the line segment that connects them will also be in the diagram. The interpolation theorem was originally stated and proved by Marcel Riesz in 1927.[2] The 1927 paper establishes the theorem only for the lower triangle of the Riesz diagram, viz., with the restriction that p0 ≤ q0 and p1 ≤ q1. Olof Thorin extended the interpolation theorem to the entire square, removing the lower-triangle restriction. The proof of Thorin was originally published in 1938 and was subsequently expanded upon in his 1948 thesis.[3]
