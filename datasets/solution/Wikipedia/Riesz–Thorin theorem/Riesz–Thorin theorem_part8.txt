operators: The proof outline presented in the above section readily generalizes to the case in which the operator T is allowed to vary analytically. In fact, an analogous proof can be carried out to establish a bound on the entire function φ(z)=∫(Tzfz)gzdμ2,φ(z)=∫(T_zf_z)g_z dμ_2, from which we obtain the following theorem of Elias Stein, published in his 1956 thesis:[5] Stein interpolation theorem — Let (Ω1, Σ1, μ1) and (Ω2, Σ2, μ2) be σ-finite measure spaces. Suppose 1 ≤ p0 , p1 ≤ ∞, 1 ≤ q0 , q1 ≤ ∞, and define: S = {z ∈ C : 0 < Re(z) < 1}, S = {z ∈ C : 0 ≤ Re(z) ≤ 1}. We take a collection of linear operators {Tz : z ∈ S} on the space of simple functions in L1(μ1) into the space of all μ2-measurable functions on Ω2. We assume the following further properties on this collection of linear operators: The mapping z↦∫(Tzf)gdμ2↦∫(T_zf)g dμ_2 is continuous on S and holomorphic on S for all simple functions f and g. For some constant k < π, the operators satisfy the uniform bound: supz∈Se−k|Im(z)|log⁡|∫(Tzf)gdμ2|<∞sup_ze^-k|Im(z)|log|∫(T_zf)g dμ_2|<∞ Tz maps Lp0(μ1) boundedly to Lq0(μ2) whenever Re(z) = 0. Tz maps Lp1(μ1) boundedly to Lq1(μ2) whenever Re(z) = 1. The operator norms satisfy the uniform bound supRe(z)=0,1e−k|Im(z)|log⁡‖Tz‖<∞sup_Re(z)=0,1e^-k|Im(z)|logT_z<∞ for some constant k < π. Then, for each 0 < θ < 1, the operator Tθ maps Lpθ(μ1) boundedly into Lqθ(μ2). The theory of real Hardy spaces and the space of bounded mean oscillations permits us to wield the Stein interpolation theorem argument in dealing with operators on the Hardy space H1(Rd) and the space BMO of bounded mean oscillations; this is a result of Charles Fefferman and Elias Stein.[6]
