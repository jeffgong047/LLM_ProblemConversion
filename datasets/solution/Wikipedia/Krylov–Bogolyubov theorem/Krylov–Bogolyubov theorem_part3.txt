map: Theorem (Krylov–Bogolyubov). Let (X, T) be a compact, metrizable topological space and F : X → X a continuous map. Then F admits an invariant Borel probability measure. That is, if Borel(X) denotes the Borel σ-algebra generated by the collection T of open subsets of X, then there exists a probability measure μ : Borel(X) → [0, 1] such that for any subset A ∈ Borel(X), μ(F−1(A))=μ(A).μ(F^-1(A))=μ(A). In terms of the push forward, this states that F∗(μ)=μ._*(μ)=μ. Invariant measures for a Markov
