process: Let X be a Polish space and let Pt,t≥0,_t,t≥0, be the transition probabilities for a time-homogeneous Markov semigroup on X, i.e. Pr[Xt∈A|X0=x]=Pt(x,A).[X_t|X_0=x]=P_t(x,A). Theorem (Krylov–Bogolyubov). If there exists a point x∈X for which the family of probability measures { Pt(x, ·) | t > 0 } is uniformly tight and the semigroup (Pt) satisfies the Feller property, then there exists at least one invariant measure for (Pt), i.e. a probability measure μ on X such that (Pt)∗(μ)=μforallt>0.(P_t)_∗(μ)=μt>0.
