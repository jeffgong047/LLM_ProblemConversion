formulation: Since every pair of points can be connected by at most one line, there can be at most n(n − 1)/2 lines which can connect at k or more points, since k ≥ 2. This bound will prove the theorem when k is small (e.g. if k ≤ C for some absolute constant C). Thus, we need only consider the case when k is large, say k ≥ C. Suppose that there are m lines that each contain at least k points. These lines generate at least mk incidences, and so by the first formulation of the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, we have mk=O(n2/3m2/3+n+m),=O(n^2/3m^2/3+n+m), and so at least one of the statements mk=O(n2/3m2/3),mk=O(n)=O(n^2/3m^2/3),mk=O(n), or mk=O(m)=O(m) is true. The third possibility is ruled out since k was assumed to be large, so we are left with the first two. But in either of these two cases, some elementary algebra will give the bound m=O(n2/k3+n/k)=O(n^2/k^3+n/k) as desired.
