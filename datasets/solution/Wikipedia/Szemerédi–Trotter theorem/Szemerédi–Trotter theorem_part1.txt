Bound on the number of incidences between points and lines in the plane The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem is a mathematical result in the field of Discrete geometry. It asserts that given n points and m lines in the Euclidean plane, the number of incidences (i.e., the number of point-line pairs, such that the point lies on the line) is O(n2/3m2/3+n+m).(n^2/3m^2/3+n+m). This bound cannot be improved, except in terms of the implicit constants. As for the implicit constants, it was shown by János Pach, Radoš Radoičić, Gábor Tardos, and Géza Tóth[1] that the upper bound 2.5n2/3m2/3+n+m2.5n^2/3m^2/3+n+m holds. Since then better constants are known due to better crossing lemma constants; the current best is 2.44.[2] On the other hand, Pach and Tóth showed that the statement does not hold true if one replaces the coefficient 2.5 with 0.42.[3] An equivalent formulation of the theorem is the following. Given n points and an integer k ≥ 2, the number of lines which pass through at least k of the points is O(n2k3+nk).(n^2/k^3+n/k). The original proof of Endre Szemerédi and William T. Trotter was somewhat complicated, using a combinatorial technique known as cell decomposition.[4][5] Later, László Székely discovered a much simpler proof using the crossing number inequality for graphs.[6] (See below.) The Szemerédi–Trotter theorem has a number of consequences, including Beck's theorem in incidence geometry and the Erdős-Szemerédi sum-product problem in additive combinatorics. Proof of the first
