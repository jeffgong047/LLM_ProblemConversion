bounds: Let F𝔽 be a field of characteristic p≠2≠2. Stevens and de Zeeuw[16] show that the number of incidences between n points and m lines in F2𝔽^2 is O(m11/15n11/15)(m^11/15n^11/15) under the condition m−2n13≤p15^-2n^13^15 in positive characteristic. (In a field of characteristic zero, this condition is not necessary.) This bound is better than the trivial incidence estimate when m7/8<n<m8/7^7/8<n<m^8/7. If the point set is a Cartesian Product, then they show an improved incidence bound: let P=A×B⊆F2𝒫=A⊆𝔽^2 be a finite set of points with |A|≤|B||A|≤|B| and let Lℒ be a set of lines in the plane. Suppose that |A||B|2≤|L|3|A||B|^2≤|ℒ|^3 and in positive characteristic that |A||L|≤p2|A||ℒ|^2. Then the number of incidences between P𝒫 and Lℒ is O(|A|3/4|B|1/2|L|3/4+|L|).(|A|^3/4|B|^1/2|ℒ|^3/4+|ℒ|). This bound is optimal. Note that by point-line duality in the plane, this incidence bound can be rephrased for an arbitrary point set and a set of lines having a Cartesian product structure. In both the reals and arbitrary fields, Rudnev and Shkredov[17] show an incidence bound for when both the point set and the line set has a Cartesian product structure. This is sometimes better than the above bounds.
