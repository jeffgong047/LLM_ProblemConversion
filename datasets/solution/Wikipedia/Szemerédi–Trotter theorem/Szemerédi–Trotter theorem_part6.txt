C2ℂ^2: Many proofs of the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem over Rℝ rely in a crucial way on the topology of Euclidean space, so do not extend easily to other fields. e.g. the original proof of Szemerédi and Trotter; the polynomial partitioning proof and the crossing number proof do not extend to the complex plane. Tóth successfully generalized the original proof of Szemerédi and Trotter to the complex plane C2ℂ^2 by introducing additional ideas.[11] This result was also obtained independently and through a different method by Zahl.[12] The implicit constant in the bound is not the same in the complex numbers: in Tóth's proof the constant can be taken to be 106010^60; the constant is not explicit in Zahl's proof. When the point set is a Cartesian product, Solymosi and Tardos show that the Szemerédi-Trotter bound holds using a much simpler argument.[13] In finite
