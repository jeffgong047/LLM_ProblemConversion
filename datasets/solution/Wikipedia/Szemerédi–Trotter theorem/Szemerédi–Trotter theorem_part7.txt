fields: Let F𝔽 be a field. A Szemerédi-Trotter bound is impossible in general due to the following example, stated here in Fp𝔽_p: let P=Fp×Fp𝒫=𝔽_p×𝔽_p be the set of all p2^2 points and let Lℒ be the set of all p2^2 lines in the plane. Since each line contains p points, there are p3^3 incidences. On the other hand, a Szemerédi-Trotter bound would give O((p2)2/3(p2)2/3+p2)=O(p8/3)((p^2)^2/3(p^2)^2/3+p^2)=O(p^8/3) incidences. This example shows that the trivial, combinatorial incidence bound is tight. Bourgain, Katz and Tao[14] show that if this example is excluded, then an incidence bound that is an improvement on the trivial bound can be attained. Incidence bounds over finite fields are of two types: (i) when at least one of the set of points or lines is `large' in terms of the characteristic of the field; (ii) both the set of points and the set of lines are `small' in terms of the characteristic.
