Rdℝ^d: One generalization of this result to arbitrary dimension, Rdℝ^d, was found by Agarwal and Aronov.[8] Given a set of n points, S, and the set of m hyperplanes, H, which are each spanned by S, the number of incidences between S and H is bounded above by O(m2/3nd/3+nd−1).(m^2/3n^d/3+n^d-1). Equivalently, the number of hyperplanes in H containing k or more points is bounded above by O(ndk3+nd−1k).(n^d/k^3+n^d-1/k). A construction due to Edelsbrunner shows this bound to be asymptotically optimal.[9] József Solymosi and Terence Tao obtained near sharp upper bounds for the number of incidences between points and algebraic varieties in higher dimensions, when the points and varieties satisfy "certain pseudo-line type axioms". Their proof uses the Polynomial Ham Sandwich Theorem.[10] In
