Optimality: Except for its constant, the Szemerédi–Trotter incidence bound cannot be improved. To see this, consider for any positive integer N∈N∈ℕ a set of points on the integer lattice P=(a,b)∈Z2:1≤a≤N;1≤b≤2N2,={(a,b)∈ℤ^2 ;1≤2N^2}, and a set of lines L=(x,mx+b):m,b∈Z;1≤m≤N;1≤b≤N2.={(x,mx+b) ,b∈ℤ;1;1^2}. Clearly, |P|=2N3|P|=2N^3 and |L|=N3|L|=N^3. Since each line is incident to N points (i.e., once for each x∈1,⋯,N∈{1,⋯,N}), the number of incidences is N4^4 which matches the upper bound.[7] Generalization to
