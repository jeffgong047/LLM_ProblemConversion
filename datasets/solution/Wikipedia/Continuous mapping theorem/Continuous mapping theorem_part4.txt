distribution: We will need a particular statement from the portmanteau theorem: that convergence in distribution Xn→dX_nX is equivalent to Ef(Xn)→Ef(X)𝔼f(X_n)→𝔼f(X) for every bounded continuous functional f. So it suffices to prove that Ef(g(Xn))→Ef(g(X))𝔼f(g(X_n))→𝔼f(g(X)) for every bounded continuous functional f. Note that F=f∘g=f is itself a bounded continuous functional. And so the claim follows from the statement above. Convergence in
