Statement: Let {Xn}, X be random elements defined on a metric space S. Suppose a function g: S→S′ (where S′ is another metric space) has the set of discontinuity points Dg such that Pr[X ∈ Dg] = 0. Then[4][5] Xn→dX⇒g(Xn)→dg(X);Xn→pX⇒g(Xn)→pg(X);Xn→a.s.X⇒g(Xn)→a.s.g(X).X_n{ ⇒(X_n){(X); X_n{ ⇒(X_n){(X); X_n{ ⇒(X_n){(X). where the superscripts, "d", "p", and "a.s." denote convergence in distribution, convergence in probability, and almost sure convergence respectively.
