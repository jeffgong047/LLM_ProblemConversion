convergence: By definition of the continuity of the function g(·), limn→∞Xn(ω)=X(ω)⇒limn→∞g(Xn(ω))=g(X(ω))lim_n→∞X_n(ω)=X(ω) ⇒ lim_n→∞g(X_n(ω))=g(X(ω)) at each point X(ω) where g(·) is continuous. Therefore, Pr(limn→∞g(Xn)=g(X))≥Pr(limn→∞g(Xn)=g(X),X∉Dg)≥Pr(limn→∞Xn=X,X∉Dg)=1,(lim_n→∞g(X_n)=g(X)) ≥(lim_n→∞g(X_n)=g(X),_g) ≥(lim_n→∞X_n=X,_g)=1, because the intersection of two almost sure events is almost sure. By definition, we conclude that g(Xn) converges to g(X) almost surely. See
