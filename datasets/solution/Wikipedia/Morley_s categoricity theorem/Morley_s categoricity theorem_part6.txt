Notes: ^ Some authors define a theory to be categorical if all of its models are isomorphic. This definition makes the inconsistent theory categorical, since it has no models and therefore vacuously meets the criterion. ^ Monk 1976, p. 349. ^ Mummert, Carl (2014-09-16). "Difference between completeness and categoricity". ^ Marker (2002) p. 42
