Properties: Every categorical theory is complete.[2] However, the converse does not hold.[3] Any theory T categorical in some infinite cardinal κ is very close to being complete. More precisely, the Łoś–Vaught test states that if a satisfiable theory has no finite models and is categorical in some infinite cardinal κ at least equal to the cardinality of its language, then the theory is complete. The reason is that all infinite models are first-order equivalent to some model of cardinal κ by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and so are all equivalent as the theory is categorical in κ. Therefore, the theory is complete as all models are equivalent. The assumption that the theory have no finite models is necessary.[4] See
