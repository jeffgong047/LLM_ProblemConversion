Discussion: To prove this result, we will start by proving a simpler one. Replacing A and C with the identity matrix I, we obtain another identity which is a bit simpler: (I+UV)−1=I−U(I+VU)−1V.(I+UV)^-1=I-U(I+VU)^-1V. To recover the original equation from this reduced identity, set U=A−1X=A^-1X and V=CY=CY. This identity itself can be viewed as the combination of two simpler identities. We obtain the first identity from I=(I+P)−1(I+P)=(I+P)−1+(I+P)−1P=(I+P)^-1(I+P)=(I+P)^-1+(I+P)^-1P, thus, (I+P)−1=I−(I+P)−1P(I+P)^-1=I-(I+P)^-1P, and similarly (I+P)−1=I−P(I+P)−1.(I+P)^-1=I-P(I+P)^-1. The second identity is the so-called push-through identity[7] (I+UV)−1U=U(I+VU)−1(I+UV)^-1U=U(I+VU)^-1 that we obtain from U(I+VU)=(I+UV)U(I+VU)=(I+UV)U after multiplying by (I+VU)−1(I+VU)^-1 on the right and by (I+UV)−1(I+UV)^-1 on the left. Putting all together, (I+UV)−1=I−UV(I+UV)−1=I−U(I+VU)−1V.(I+UV)^-1=I-UV(I+UV)^-1=I-U(I+VU)^-1V. where the first and second equality come from the first and second identity, respectively. Special
