sum: If n = k and U = V = In is the identity matrix, then (A+B)−1=A−1−A−1(B−1+A−1)−1A−1=A−1−A−1(AB−1+I)−1.(A+B)^-1 =A^-1-A^-1(B^-1+A^-1)^-1A^-1 =A^-1-A^-1(AB^-1+I)^-1. Continuing with the merging of the terms of the far right-hand side of the above equation results in Hua's identity (A+B)−1=A−1−(A+AB−1A)−1.(A+B)^-1=A^-1-(A+AB^-1A)^-1. Another useful form of the same identity is (A−B)−1=A−1+A−1B(A−B)−1,(A-B)^-1=A^-1+A^-1B(A-B)^-1, which, unlike those above, is valid even if B is singular, and has a recursive structure that yields (A−B)−1=∑k=0∞(A−1B)kA−1(A-B)^-1=∑_k=0^∞(A^-1B)^kA^-1 if the spectral radius of A−1B^-1B is less than one. That is, if the above sum converges then it is equal to (A−B)−1(A-B)^-1. This form can be used in perturbative expansions where B is a perturbation of A.
