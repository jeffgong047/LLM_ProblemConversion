theorem: If k is any divisor of h (where h is the number of digits of the period of the decimal expansion of a/p (where p is again a prime)), then Midy's theorem can be generalised as follows. The extended Midy's theorem[2] states that if the repeating portion of the decimal expansion of a/p is divided into k-digit numbers, then their sum is a multiple of 10k − 1. For example, 119=0.052631578947368421¯1/19=0.052631578947368421 has a period of 18. Dividing the repeating portion into 6-digit numbers and summing them gives 052631+578947+368421=999999.052631+578947+368421=999999. Similarly, dividing the repeating portion into 3-digit numbers and summing them gives 052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3×999.052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3×999. Midy's theorem in other
