On decimal expansions of fractions with prime denominator and even repeat period
In mathematics, Midy's theorem, named after French mathematician E. Midy,[1] is a statement about the decimal expansion of fractions a/p where p is a prime and a/p has a repeating decimal expansion with an even period (sequence A028416 in the OEIS). If the period of the decimal representation of a/p is 2n, so that

ap=0.a1a2a3…anan+1…a2n¯a/p=0.a_1a_2a_3_na_n+1_2n
then the digits in the second half of the repeating decimal period are the 9s complement of the corresponding digits in its first half. In other words,

ai+ai+n=9_i+a_i+n=9
a1…an+an+1…a2n=10n−1._1_n+a_n+1_2n=10^n-1.
For example,

113=0.076923¯and076+923=999.1/13=0.076923and076+923=999.
117=0.0588235294117647¯and05882352+94117647=99999999.1/17=0.0588235294117647and05882352+94117647=99999999.

Extended Midy's theorem[edit]
If k is any divisor of h (where h is the number of digits of the period of the decimal expansion of a/p (where p is again a prime)), then Midy's theorem can be generalised as follows. The extended Midy's theorem[2] states that if the repeating portion of the decimal expansion of a/p is divided into k-digit numbers, then their sum is a multiple of 10k − 1.
For example,   

119=0.052631578947368421¯1/19=0.052631578947368421
has a period of 18. Dividing the repeating portion into 6-digit numbers and summing them gives   

052631+578947+368421=999999.052631+578947+368421=999999.
Similarly, dividing the repeating portion into 3-digit numbers and summing them gives   

052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3×999.052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3×999.
Midy's theorem in other bases[edit]
Midy's theorem and its extension do not depend on special properties of the decimal expansion, but work equally well in any base b, provided we replace 10k − 1 with bk − 1 and carry out addition in base b.
For example, in octal

119=0.032745¯80328+7458=7778038+278+458=778.   1/19=0.032745_8
   032_8+745_8=777_8
   03_8+27_8+45_8=77_8.
In duodecimal (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)

119=0.076E45¯1207612+E4512=EEE120712+6E12+4512=EE12   1/19=0.076ℰ45_12
   076_12+ℰ45_12=ℰℰℰ_12
   07_12+6ℰ_12+45_12=ℰℰ_12
Proof of Midy's theorem[edit]
Short proofs of Midy's theorem can be given using results from group theory. However, it is also possible to prove Midy's theorem using elementary algebra and modular arithmetic:
Let p be a prime and a/p be a fraction between 0 and 1. Suppose the expansion of a/p in base b has a period of ℓ, so

ap=[0.a1a2…aℓ¯]b⇒apbℓ=[a1a2…aℓ.a1a2…aℓ¯]b⇒apbℓ=N+[0.a1a2…aℓ¯]b=N+ap⇒ap=Nbℓ−1   a/p=[0.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b
   ⇒a/pb^ℓ=[a_1a_2_ℓ.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b
   ⇒a/pb^ℓ=N+[0.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b=N+a/p
   ⇒a/p=N/b^ℓ-1
where N is the integer whose expansion in base b is the string a1a2...aℓ.
Note that b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p because (b ℓ − 1)a/p is an integer. Also bn−1 is not a multiple of p for any value of n less than ℓ, because otherwise the repeating period of a/p in base b would be less than ℓ.
Now suppose that ℓ = hk. Then b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of bk − 1. (To see this, substitute x for bk; then bℓ = xh and x − 1 is a factor of xh − 1. ) Say b ℓ − 1 = m(bk − 1), so

ap=Nm(bk−1).a/p=N/m(b^k-1).
But b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p; bk − 1 is not a multiple of p (because k is less than ℓ ); and p is a prime; so m must be a multiple of p and

amp=Nbk−1am/p=N/b^k-1
is an integer. In other words,

N≡0(modbk−1).≡0b^k-1.
Now split the string a1a2...aℓ into h equal parts of length k, and let these represent the integers N0...Nh − 1 in base b, so that

Nh−1=[a1…ak]bNh−2=[ak+1…a2k]b⋮N0=[al−k+1…al]bN_h-1   =[a_1_k]_b
N_h-2   =[a_k+1_2k]_b
   
⋮
N_0   =[a_l-k+1_l]_b
To prove Midy's extended theorem in base b we must show that the sum of the h integers Ni is a multiple of bk − 1.
Since bk is congruent to 1 modulo bk − 1, any power of bk will also be congruent to 1 modulo bk − 1. So

N=∑i=0h−1Nibik=∑i=0h−1Ni(bk)i=∑_i=0^h-1N_ib^ik=∑_i=0^h-1N_i(b^k)^i
⇒N≡∑i=0h−1Ni(modbk−1)≡∑_i=0^h-1N_ib^k-1
⇒∑i=0h−1Ni≡0(modbk−1)⇒∑_i=0^h-1N_i≡0b^k-1
which proves Midy's extended theorem in base b.
To prove the original Midy's theorem, take the special case where h = 2. Note that N0 and N1 are both represented by strings of k digits in base b so both satisfy

0≤Ni≤bk−1.0_i^k-1.
N0 and N1 cannot both equal 0 (otherwise a/p = 0) and cannot both equal bk − 1 (otherwise a/p = 1), so

0<N0+N1<2(bk−1)0<N_0+N_1<2(b^k-1)
and since N0 + N1 is a multiple of bk − 1, it follows that

N0+N1=bk−1._0+N_1=b^k-1.
Corollary[edit]
From the above,

ampam/p is an integer
Thus m≡0(modp)≡0p
And thus for k=ℓ2=ℓ/2

bℓ/2+1≡0(modp)^ℓ/2+1≡0p
For k=ℓ3=ℓ/3 and is an integer

b2ℓ/3+bℓ/3+1≡0(modp)^2ℓ/3+b^ℓ/3+1≡0p
and so on.
