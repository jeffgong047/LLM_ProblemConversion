On decimal expansions of fractions with prime denominator and even repeat period In mathematics, Midy's theorem, named after French mathematician E. Midy,[1] is a statement about the decimal expansion of fractions a/p where p is a prime and a/p has a repeating decimal expansion with an even period (sequence A028416 in the OEIS). If the period of the decimal representation of a/p is 2n, so that ap=0.a1a2a3…anan+1…a2n¯a/p=0.a_1a_2a_3_na_n+1_2n then the digits in the second half of the repeating decimal period are the 9s complement of the corresponding digits in its first half. In other words, ai+ai+n=9_i+a_i+n=9 a1…an+an+1…a2n=10n−1._1_n+a_n+1_2n=10^n-1. For example, 113=0.076923¯and076+923=999.1/13=0.076923and076+923=999. 117=0.0588235294117647¯and05882352+94117647=99999999.1/17=0.0588235294117647and05882352+94117647=99999999. Extended Midy's
