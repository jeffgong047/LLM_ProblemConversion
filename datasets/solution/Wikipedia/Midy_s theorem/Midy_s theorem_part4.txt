theorem: Short proofs of Midy's theorem can be given using results from group theory. However, it is also possible to prove Midy's theorem using elementary algebra and modular arithmetic: Let p be a prime and a/p be a fraction between 0 and 1. Suppose the expansion of a/p in base b has a period of ℓ, so ap=[0.a1a2…aℓ¯]b⇒apbℓ=[a1a2…aℓ.a1a2…aℓ¯]b⇒apbℓ=N+[0.a1a2…aℓ¯]b=N+ap⇒ap=Nbℓ−1 a/p=[0.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b ⇒a/pb^ℓ=[a_1a_2_ℓ.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b ⇒a/pb^ℓ=N+[0.a_1a_2_ℓ]_b=N+a/p ⇒a/p=N/b^ℓ-1 where N is the integer whose expansion in base b is the string a1a2...aℓ. Note that b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p because (b ℓ − 1)a/p is an integer. Also bn−1 is not a multiple of p for any value of n less than ℓ, because otherwise the repeating period of a/p in base b would be less than ℓ. Now suppose that ℓ = hk. Then b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of bk − 1. (To see this, substitute x for bk; then bℓ = xh and x − 1 is a factor of xh − 1. ) Say b ℓ − 1 = m(bk − 1), so ap=Nm(bk−1).a/p=N/m(b^k-1). But b ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p; bk − 1 is not a multiple of p (because k is less than ℓ ); and p is a prime; so m must be a multiple of p and amp=Nbk−1am/p=N/b^k-1 is an integer. In other words, N≡0(modbk−1).≡0b^k-1. Now split the string a1a2...aℓ into h equal parts of length k, and let these represent the integers N0...Nh − 1 in base b, so that Nh−1=[a1…ak]bNh−2=[ak+1…a2k]b⋮N0=[al−k+1…al]bN_h-1 =[a_1_k]_b N_h-2 =[a_k+1_2k]_b ⋮ N_0 =[a_l-k+1_l]_b To prove Midy's extended theorem in base b we must show that the sum of the h integers Ni is a multiple of bk − 1. Since bk is congruent to 1 modulo bk − 1, any power of bk will also be congruent to 1 modulo bk − 1. So N=∑i=0h−1Nibik=∑i=0h−1Ni(bk)i=∑_i=0^h-1N_ib^ik=∑_i=0^h-1N_i(b^k)^i ⇒N≡∑i=0h−1Ni(modbk−1)≡∑_i=0^h-1N_ib^k-1 ⇒∑i=0h−1Ni≡0(modbk−1)⇒∑_i=0^h-1N_i≡0b^k-1 which proves Midy's extended theorem in base b. To prove the original Midy's theorem, take the special case where h = 2. Note that N0 and N1 are both represented by strings of k digits in base b so both satisfy 0≤Ni≤bk−1.0_i^k-1. N0 and N1 cannot both equal 0 (otherwise a/p = 0) and cannot both equal bk − 1 (otherwise a/p = 1), so 0<N0+N1<2(bk−1)0<N_0+N_1<2(b^k-1) and since N0 + N1 is a multiple of bk − 1, it follows that N0+N1=bk−1._0+N_1=b^k-1.
