bases: Midy's theorem and its extension do not depend on special properties of the decimal expansion, but work equally well in any base b, provided we replace 10k − 1 with bk − 1 and carry out addition in base b. For example, in octal 119=0.032745¯80328+7458=7778038+278+458=778. 1/19=0.032745_8 032_8+745_8=777_8 03_8+27_8+45_8=77_8. In duodecimal (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively) 119=0.076E45¯1207612+E4512=EEE120712+6E12+4512=EE12 1/19=0.076ℰ45_12 076_12+ℰ45_12=ℰℰℰ_12 07_12+6ℰ_12+45_12=ℰℰ_12 Proof of Midy's
