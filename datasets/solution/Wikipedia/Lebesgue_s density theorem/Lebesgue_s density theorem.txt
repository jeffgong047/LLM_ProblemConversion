In mathematics, Lebesgue's density theorem states that for any Lebesgue measurable set A⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n, the "density" of A is 0 or 1 at almost every point in Rnℝ^n. Additionally, the "density" of A is 1 at almost every point in A.   Intuitively, this means that the "edge" of A, the set of points in A whose "neighborhood" is partially in A and partially outside of A, is negligible.
Let μ be the Lebesgue measure on  the Euclidean space Rn and A be a Lebesgue measurable subset of Rn. Define the approximate density of A in a ε-neighborhood of a point x  in Rn as

dε(x)=μ(A∩Bε(x))μ(Bε(x))_ε(x)=μ(A_ε(x))/μ(B_ε(x))
where Bε denotes the closed ball of radius ε centered at x.
Lebesgue's density theorem asserts that for almost every point x of A the density

d(x)=limε→0dε(x)(x)=lim_ε→0d_ε(x)
exists and is equal to 0 or 1.
In other words, for every measurable set A, the density of A is 0 or 1 almost everywhere in Rn.[1] However, if μ(A) > 0 and  μ(Rn \ A) > 0, then there are always points of  Rn where the density is neither 0 nor 1.
For example, given a square in the plane, the density at every point inside the square is 1, on the edges is 1/2, and at the corners is 1/4.  The set of points in the plane at which the density is neither 0 nor 1 is non-empty (the square boundary), but it is negligible.
The Lebesgue density theorem is a particular case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem.
Thus, this theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on Rn instead of Lebesgue measure, see Discussion.
