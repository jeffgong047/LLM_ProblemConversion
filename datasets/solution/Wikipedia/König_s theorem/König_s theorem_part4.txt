choice: One way of stating the axiom of choice is "an arbitrary Cartesian product of non-empty sets is non-empty". Let Bi be a non-empty set for each i in I. Let Ai = {} for each i in I. Thus by König's theorem, we have: If ∀i∈I(<Bi)({}<B_i), then <∏i∈IBi{}<∏_iB_i. That is, the Cartesian product of the given non-empty sets Bi has a larger cardinality than the sum of empty sets. Thus it is non-empty, which is just what the axiom of choice states. Since the axiom of choice follows from König's theorem, we will use the axiom of choice freely and implicitly when discussing consequences of the theorem. König's theorem and
