Details: The precise statement of the result: if I is a set, Ai and Bi are sets for every i in I, and Ai<Bi_i<B_i for every i in I, then ∑i∈IAi<∏i∈IBi,∑_iA_i<∏_iB_i, where < means strictly less than in cardinality, i.e. there is an injective function from Ai to Bi, but not one going the other way. The union involved need not be disjoint (a non-disjoint union can't be any bigger than the disjoint version, also assuming the axiom of choice). In this formulation, König's theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.[1] (Of course, König's theorem is trivial if the cardinal numbers mi and ni are finite and the index set I is finite. If I is empty, then the left sum is the empty sum and therefore 0, while the right product is the empty product and therefore 1). König's theorem is remarkable because of the strict inequality in the conclusion. There are many easy rules for the arithmetic of infinite sums and products of cardinals in which one can only conclude a weak inequality ≤, for example: if mi<ni_i<n_i for all i in I, then one can only conclude ∑i∈Imi≤∑i∈Ini,∑_im_i≤∑_in_i, since, for example, setting mi=1_i=1 and ni=2_i=2, where the index set I is the natural numbers, yields the sum ℵ0ℵ_0 for both sides, and we have an equality.
