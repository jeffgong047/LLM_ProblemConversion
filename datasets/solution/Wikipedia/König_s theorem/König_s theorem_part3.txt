theorem: If κκ is a cardinal, then κ<2κκ<2^κ. If we take mi = 1, and ni = 2 for each i in κ, then the left side of the above inequality is just κ, while the right side is 2κ, the cardinality of functions from κ to {0, 1}, that is, the cardinality of the power set of κ. Thus, König's theorem gives us an alternate proof of Cantor's theorem. (Historically of course Cantor's theorem was proved much earlier.) Axiom of
