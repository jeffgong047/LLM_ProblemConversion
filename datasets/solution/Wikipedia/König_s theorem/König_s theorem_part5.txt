cofinality: König's theorem has also important consequences for cofinality of cardinal numbers. If κ≥ℵ0κ≥ℵ_0, then κ<κcf⁡(κ)κ<κ^cf(κ). Choose a strictly increasing cf(κ)-sequence of ordinals approaching κ. Each of them is less than κ, so their sum, which is κ, is less than the product of cf(κ) copies of κ. According to Easton's theorem, the next consequence of König's theorem is the only nontrivial constraint on the continuum function for regular cardinals. If κ≥ℵ0κ≥ℵ_0 and λ≥2λ≥2, then κ<cf⁡(λκ)κ<cf(λ^κ). Let μ=λκμ=λ^κ. Suppose that, contrary to this corollary, κ≥cf⁡(μ)κ≥cf(μ). Then using the previous corollary, μ<μcf⁡(μ)≤μκ=(λκ)κ=λκ⋅κ=λκ=μμ<μ^cf(μ)≤μ^κ=(λ^κ)^κ=λ^κ·κ=λ^κ=μ, a contradiction. A proof of König's
