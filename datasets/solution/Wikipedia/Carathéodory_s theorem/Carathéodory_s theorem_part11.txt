measure: Given an outer measure μ on a set X, define ν : 2X→[0,∞] by ν(A)=infμ(B):μ-measurablesubsetsB⊂XwithB⊃A.ν(A)=inf{μ(B):μ-measurablesubsetsBwithB}. Then ν is a regular outer measure on X which assigns the same measure as μ to all μ-measurable subsets of X. Every μ-measurable subset is also ν-measurable, and every ν-measurable subset of finite ν-measure is also μ-measurable. So the measure space associated to ν may have a larger σ-algebra than the measure space associated to μ. The restrictions of ν and μ to the smaller σ-algebra are identical. The elements of the larger σ-algebra which are not contained in the smaller σ-algebra have infinite ν-measure and finite μ-measure. From this perspective, ν may be regarded as an extension of μ.
