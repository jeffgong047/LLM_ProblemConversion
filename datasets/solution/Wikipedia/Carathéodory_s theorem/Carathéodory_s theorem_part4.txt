measure: It is straightforward to use the above definition of μμ-measurability to see that if A⊆X is μμ-measurable then its complement X∖A⊆X is also μμ-measurable. The following condition is known as the "countable additivity of μμ on measurable subsets." if A1,A2,…_1,A_2,… are μμ-measurable pairwise-disjoint (Ai∩Aj=∅_i_j=∅ for i≠j) subsets of X, then one has μ(⋃j=1∞Aj)=∑j=1∞μ(Aj).μ(⋃_j=1^∞A_j)=∑_j=1^∞μ(A_j). Proof of countable additivity. One automatically has the conclusion in the form "≤ ≤ " from the definition of outer measure. So it is only necessary to prove the "≥ ≥ " inequality. One has μ(⋃j=1∞Aj)≥μ(⋃j=1NAj)μ(⋃_j=1^∞A_j)≥μ(⋃_j=1^NA_j) for any positive number N,, due to the second condition in the "alternative definition" of outer measure given above. Suppose (inductively) that μ(⋃j=1N−1Aj)=∑j=1N−1μ(Aj)μ(⋃_j=1^N-1A_j)=∑_j=1^N-1μ(A_j) Applying the above definition of μμ-measurability with A=A1∪⋯∪AN=A_1∪⋯_N and with E=AN,=A_N, one has μ(⋃j=1NAj)=μ((⋃j=1NAj)∩AN)+μ((⋃j=1NAj)∖AN)=μ(AN)+μ(⋃j=1N−1Aj)μ(⋃_j=1^NA_j) =μ((⋃_j=1^NA_j)_N)+μ((⋃_j=1^NA_j)_N) =μ(A_N)+μ(⋃_j=1^N-1A_j) which closes the induction. Going back to the first line of the proof, one then has μ(⋃j=1∞Aj)≥∑j=1Nμ(Aj)μ(⋃_j=1^∞A_j)≥∑_j=1^Nμ(A_j) for any positive integer N.. One can then send N to infinity to get the required "≥ ≥ " inequality. A similar proof shows that: if A1,A2,…_1,A_2,… are μμ-measurable subsets of X,, then the union ⋃i=1∞Ai⋃_i=1^∞A_i and intersection ⋂i=1∞Ai⋂_i=1^∞A_i are also μμ-measurable. The properties given here can be summarized by the following terminology: Given any outer measure μμ on a set X,, the collection of all μμ-measurable subsets of X is a σ-algebra. The restriction of μμ to this σσ-algebra is a measure. One thus has a measure space structure on X,, arising naturally from the specification of an outer measure on X.. This measure space has the additional property of completeness, which is contained in the following statement: Every subset A⊆X such that μ(A)=0μ(A)=0 is μμ-measurable. This is easy to prove by using the second property in the "alternative definition" of outer measure. Restriction and pushforward of an outer
