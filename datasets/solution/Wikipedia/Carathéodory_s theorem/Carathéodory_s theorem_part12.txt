topology: Suppose (X, d) is a metric space and φ an outer measure on X. If φ has the property that φ(E∪F)=φ(E)+φ(F)φ(E)=φ(E)+φ(F) whenever d(E,F)=infd(x,y):x∈E,y∈F>0,(E,F)=inf{d(x,y):x,y}>0, then φ is called a metric outer measure. Theorem. If φ is a metric outer measure on X, then every Borel subset of X is φ-measurable. (The Borel sets of X are the elements of the smallest σ-algebra generated by the open sets.) Construction of outer
