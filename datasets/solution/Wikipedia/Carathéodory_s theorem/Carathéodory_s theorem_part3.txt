measure: Let X be a set with an outer measure μ.μ. One says that a subset E of X is μμ-measurable (sometimes called Carathéodory-measurable relative to μμ, after the mathematician Carathéodory) if and only if μ(A)=μ(A∩E)+μ(A∖E)μ(A)=μ(A)+μ(A) for every subset A of X.. Informally, this says that a μμ-measurable subset is one which may be used as a building block, breaking any other subset apart into pieces (namely, the piece which is inside of the measurable set together with the piece which is outside of the measurable set). In terms of the motivation for measure theory, one would expect that area, for example, should be an outer measure on the plane. One might then expect that every subset of the plane would be deemed "measurable," following the expected principle that area⁡(A∪B)=area⁡(A)+area⁡(B)area(A)=area(A)+area(B) whenever A and B are disjoint subsets of the plane. However, the formal logical development of the theory shows that the situation is more complicated. A formal implication of the axiom of choice is that for any definition of area as an outer measure which includes as a special case the standard formula for the area of a rectangle, there must be subsets of the plane which fail to be measurable. In particular, the above "expected principle" is false, provided that one accepts the axiom of choice. The measure space associated to an outer
