measure: Given a set X, an outer measure μ on X is said to be regular if any subset A⊆X can be approximated 'from the outside' by μ-measurable sets. Formally, this is requiring either of the following equivalent conditions: μ(A)=infμ(B)∣A⊆B,Bisμ-measurableμ(A)=inf{μ(B),Bisμ-measurable} There exists a μ-measurable subset B of X which contains A and such that μ(B)=μ(A)μ(B)=μ(A). It is automatic that the second condition implies the first; the first implies the second by taking the countable intersection of Bi_i with μ(Bi)→μ(A)μ(B_i)→μ(A) This article is missing information about This differs from the definition given in Regular measure, where we further demand the B be open. The relationship between the two definitions is unclear (different conventions?). See also Encyclopedia of Math (Outer measure) which further adds the concept of Borel regular measures. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (August 2023) The regular outer measure associated to an outer
