I: Let X be a set, C a family of subsets of X which contains the empty set and p a non-negative extended real valued function on C which vanishes on the empty set. Theorem. Suppose the family C and the function p are as above and define φ(E)=inf∑i=0∞p(Ai)|E⊆⋃i=0∞Ai,∀i∈N,Ai∈C.φ(E)=inf{∑_i=0^∞p(A_i) | E⊆⋃_i=0^∞A_i,∈ℕ,A_i}. That is, the infimum extends over all sequences {Ai} of elements of C which cover E, with the convention that the infimum is infinite if no such sequence exists. Then φ is an outer measure on X.
