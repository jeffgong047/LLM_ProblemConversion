restriction: If a subset A of X is μ-measurable, then it is also μB-measurable for any subset B of X. Given a map f : X→Y and a subset A of Y, if f −1(A) is μ-measurable then A is f# μ-measurable. More generally, f −1(A) is μ-measurable if and only if A is f# (μB)-measurable for every subset B of X. Regular outer
