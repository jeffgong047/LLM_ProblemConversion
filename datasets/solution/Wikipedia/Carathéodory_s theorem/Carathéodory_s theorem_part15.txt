II: The second technique is more suitable for constructing outer measures on metric spaces, since it yields metric outer measures. Suppose (X, d) is a metric space. As above C is a family of subsets of X which contains the empty set and p a non-negative extended real valued function on C which vanishes on the empty set. For each δ > 0, let Cδ=A∈C:diam⁡(A)≤δ_δ={A:diam(A)≤δ} and φδ(E)=inf∑i=0∞p(Ai)|E⊆⋃i=0∞Ai,∀i∈N,Ai∈Cδ.φ_δ(E)=inf{∑_i=0^∞p(A_i) | E⊆⋃_i=0^∞A_i,∈ℕ,A_i_δ}. Obviously, φδ ≥ φδ' when δ ≤ δ' since the infimum is taken over a smaller class as δ decreases. Thus limδ→0φδ(E)=φ0(E)∈[0,∞]lim_δ→0φ_δ(E)=φ_0(E)∈[0,∞] exists (possibly infinite). Theorem. φ0 is a metric outer measure on X. This is the construction used in the definition of Hausdorff measures for a metric space. See
