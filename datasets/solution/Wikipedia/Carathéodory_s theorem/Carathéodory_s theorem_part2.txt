measures: Given a set X,, let 2X2^X denote the collection of all subsets of X,, including the empty set ∅.∅. An outer measure on X is a set function μ:2X→[0,∞]μ:2^X→[0,∞] such that null empty set: μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0 countably subadditive: for arbitrary subsets A,B1,B2,…,B_1,B_2,… of X,,ifA⊆⋃j=1∞Bjthenμ(A)≤∑j=1∞μ(Bj).ifA⊆⋃_j=1^∞B_jthenμ(A)≤∑_j=1^∞μ(B_j). Note that there is no subtlety about infinite summation in this definition. Since the summands are all assumed to be nonnegative, the sequence of partial sums could only diverge by increasing without bound. So the infinite sum appearing in the definition will always be a well-defined element of [0,∞].[0,∞]. If, instead, an outer measure were allowed to take negative values, its definition would have to be modified to take into account the possibility of non-convergent infinite sums. An alternative and equivalent definition.[3] Some textbooks, such as Halmos (1950), instead define an outer measure on X to be a function μ:2X→[0,∞]μ:2^X→[0,∞] such that null empty set: μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0 monotone: if A and B are subsets of X with A⊆B,, then μ(A)≤μ(B)μ(A)≤μ(B) for arbitrary subsets B1,B2,…_1,B_2,… of X,,μ(⋃j=1∞Bj)≤∑j=1∞μ(Bj).μ(⋃_j=1^∞B_j)≤∑_j=1^∞μ(B_j). Proof of equivalence. Suppose that μμ is an outer measure in sense originally given above. If A and B are subsets of X with A⊆B,, then by appealing to the definition with B1=B_1=B and Bj=∅_j=∅ for all j≥2,≥2, one finds that μ(A)≤μ(B).μ(A)≤μ(B). The third condition in the alternative definition is immediate from the trivial observation that ∪jBj⊆∪jBj.∪_jB_j⊆∪_jB_j. Suppose instead that μμ is an outer measure in the alternative definition. Let A,B1,B2,…,B_1,B_2,… be arbitrary subsets of X,, and suppose that A⊆⋃j=1∞Bj.⊆⋃_j=1^∞B_j. One then has μ(A)≤μ(⋃j=1∞Bj)≤∑j=1∞μ(Bj),μ(A)≤μ(⋃_j=1^∞B_j)≤∑_j=1^∞μ(B_j), with the first inequality following from the second condition in the alternative definition, and the second inequality following from the third condition in the alternative definition. So μμ is an outer measure in the sense of the original definition. Measurability of sets relative to an outer
