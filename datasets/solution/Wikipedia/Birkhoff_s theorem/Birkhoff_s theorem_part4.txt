Generalizations: Birkhoff's theorem can be generalized: any spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat solution of the Einstein/Maxwell field equations, without ΛΛ, must be static, so the exterior geometry of a spherically symmetric charged star must be given by the Reissner–Nordström electrovacuum. Note that in the Einstein-Maxwell theory, there exist spherically symmetric but not asymptotically flat solutions, such as the Bertotti-Robinson universe. See
