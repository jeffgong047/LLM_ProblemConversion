sets: One can regard Rice's theorem as asserting the impossibility of effectively deciding for any recursively enumerable set whether it has a certain nontrivial property.[2] In this section, we give an analogue of Rice's theorem for recursive sets, instead of recursively enumerable sets.[3] Roughly speaking, the analogue says that if one can effectively determine for every recursive set whether it has a certain property, then only finitely many integers determine whether a recursive set has the property. This result is analogous to the original theorem of Rice, because both results assert that a property is "decidable" only if one can determine whether a set has that property by examining for at most finitely many i (for no i, for the original theorem), if i belongs to the set. Let W be a class (called a simple game and thought of as a property) of recursive sets. If S is a recursive set, then for some e, computable function ϕeϕ_e is the characteristic function of S. We call e a characteristic index for S. (There are infinitely many such e.) Let's say the class W is computable if there is an algorithm (computable function) that decides for any nonnegative integer e (not necessarily a characteristic index), if e is a characteristic index for a recursive set belonging to W, then the algorithm gives "yes"; if e is a characteristic index for a recursive set not belonging to W, then the algorithm gives "no". A set S⊆N⊆ℕ extends a string ττ of 0's and 1's if for every k<|τ|<|τ| (the length of ττ), the kth element of ττ is 1 if k∈S; and is 0 otherwise. For example, S=1,3,4,7,…={1,3,4,7,…} extends the string 0101100101011001. A string ττ is winning determining if every recursive set extending ττ belongs to W. A string ττ is losing determining if no recursive set extending ττ belongs to W. We can now state the following analogue of Rice's theorem:[4][5] A class W of recursive sets is computable if and only if there are a recursively enumerable set T0_0 of losing determining strings and a recursively enumerable set T1_1 of winning determining strings such that every recursive set extends a string in T0∪T1_0_1. This result has been applied to foundational problems in computational social choice (more broadly, algorithmic game theory). For instance, Kumabe and Mihara[5][6] apply this result to an investigation of the Nakamura numbers for simple games in cooperative game theory and social choice theory. See
