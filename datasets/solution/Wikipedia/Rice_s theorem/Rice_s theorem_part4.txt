Examples: According to Rice's theorem, if there is at least one partial computable function in a particular class C of partial computable functions and another partial computable function not in C then the problem of deciding whether a particular program computes a function in C is undecidable. For example, Rice's theorem shows that each of the following sets of partial computable functions is undecidable (that is, the set is not recursive, or not computable): The class of partial computable functions that return 0 for every input, and its complement. The class of partial computable functions that return 0 for at least one input, and its complement. The class of partial computable functions that are constant, and its complement. The class of partial computable functions that are identical to a given partial computable function, and its complement. The class of partial computable functions that diverge (i.e., undefined) for some input, and its complement. The class of indices for computable functions that are total.[1] The class of indices for recursively enumerable sets that are cofinite. The class of indices for recursively enumerable sets that are recursive. Proof by Kleene's recursion
