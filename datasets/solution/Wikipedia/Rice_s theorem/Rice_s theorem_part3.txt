statement: Let Nℕ denote the natural numbers, and let P(1)𝐏^(1) denote the class of unary (partial) computable functions. Let ϕ:N→P(1)ϕℕ→𝐏^(1) be an admissible numbering of the computable functions. Denote by ϕe:=ϕ(e)ϕ_e:=ϕ(e) the eth (partial) computable function. We identify each property that a computable function may have with the subset of P(1)𝐏^(1) consisting of the functions with that property. Thus, given a set F⊆P(1)⊆𝐏^(1), a computable function ϕeϕ_e has property F if and only if ϕe∈Fϕ_e. For each property F⊆P(1)⊆𝐏^(1) there is an associated membership decision problem DF_F of determining, given e, whether ϕe∈Fϕ_e. Rice's theorem states that the decision problem DF_F is decidable (also called recursive or computable) if and only if F=∅=∅ or F=P(1)=𝐏^(1).
