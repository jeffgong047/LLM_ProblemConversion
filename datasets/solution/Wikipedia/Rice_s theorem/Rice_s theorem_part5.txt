theorem: A corollary to Kleene's recursion theorem states that for every Gödel numbering ϕ:N→P(1)ϕℕ→𝐏^(1) of the computable functions and every computable function Q(x,y)(x,y), there is an index e such that ϕe(y)ϕ_e(y) returns Q(e,y)(e,y). (In the following, we say that f(x)(x) "returns" g(x)(x) if either f(x)=g(x)(x)=g(x), or both f(x)(x) and g(x)(x) are undefined.) Intuitively, ϕeϕ_e is a quine, a function that returns its own source code (Gödel number), except that rather than returning it directly, ϕeϕ_e passes its Gödel number to Q and returns the result. Assume for contradiction that F is a set of computable functions such that ∅≠F≠P(1)∅≠𝐏^(1). Then there are computable functions f∈F and g∉F. Suppose that the set of indices x such that ϕx∈Fϕ_x is decidable; then, there exists a function Q(x,y)(x,y) that returns g(y)(y) if ϕx∈Fϕ_x, and f(y)(y) otherwise. By the corollary to the recursion theorem, there is an index e such that ϕe(y)ϕ_e(y) returns Q(e,y)(e,y). But then, if ϕe∈Fϕ_e, then ϕeϕ_e is the same function as g, and therefore ϕe∉Fϕ_e; and if ϕe∉Fϕ_e, then ϕeϕ_e is f, and therefore ϕe∈Fϕ_e. In both cases, we have a contradiction.
