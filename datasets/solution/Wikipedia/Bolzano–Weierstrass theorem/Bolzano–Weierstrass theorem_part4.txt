proof: There is also an alternative proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem using nested intervals. We start with a bounded sequence (xn)(x_n): Because (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ is bounded, this sequence has a lower bound s and an upper bound S. We take I1=[s,S]_1=[s,S] as the first interval for the sequence of nested intervals. Then we split I1_1 at the mid into two equally sized subintervals. Because each sequence has infinitely many members, there must be (at least) one of these subintervals that contains infinitely many members of (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ. We take this subinterval as the second interval I2_2 of the sequence of nested intervals. Then we split I2_2 again at the mid into two equally sized subintervals. Again, one of these subintervals contains infinitely many members of (xn)n∈N(x_n)_n∈ℕ. We take this subinterval as the third subinterval I3_3 of the sequence of nested intervals. We continue this process infinitely many times. Thus we get a sequence of nested intervals. Because we halve the length of an interval at each step, the limit of the interval's length is zero. Also, by the nested intervals theorem, which states that if each In_n is a closed and bounded interval, say In=[an,bn]_n=[a_n, b_n] with an≤bn_n_n then under the assumption of nesting, the intersection of the In_n is not empty. Thus there is a number x that is in each interval In_n. Now we show, that x is an accumulation point of (xn)(x_n). Take a neighbourhood U of x. Because the length of the intervals converges to zero, there is an interval IN_N that is a subset of U. Because IN_N contains by construction infinitely many members of (xn)(x_n) and IN⊆U_N, also U contains infinitely many members of (xn)(x_n). This proves that x is an accumulation point of (xn)(x_n). Thus, there is a subsequence of (xn)(x_n) that converges to x. Sequential compactness in Euclidean
