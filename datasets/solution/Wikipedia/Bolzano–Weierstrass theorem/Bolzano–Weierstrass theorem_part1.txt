Bounded sequence in finite-dimensional Euclidean space has a convergent subsequence In mathematics, specifically in real analysis, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, named after Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass, is a fundamental result about convergence in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space Rnℝ^n. The theorem states that each infinite bounded sequence in Rnℝ^n has a convergent subsequence.[1] An equivalent formulation is that a subset of Rnℝ^n is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.[2] The theorem is sometimes called the sequential compactness theorem.[3] History and
