spaces: Definition: A set A⊆Rn⊆ℝ^n is sequentially compact if every sequence xn{x_n} in A has a convergent subsequence converging to an element of A. Theorem: A⊆Rn⊆ℝ^n is sequentially compact if and only if A is closed and bounded. Proof: (sequential compactness implies closed and bounded) Suppose A is a subset of Rnℝ^n with the property that every sequence in A has a subsequence converging to an element of A. Then A must be bounded, since otherwise the following unbounded sequence xn∈A{x_n} can be constructed. For every n∈N∈ℕ, define xn_n to be any arbitrary point such that ||xn||≥n||x_n||. Then, every subsequence of xn{x_n} is unbounded and therefore not convergent. Moreover, A must be closed, since any limit point of A, which has a sequence of points in A converging to itself, must also lie in A. Proof: (closed and bounded implies sequential compactness) Since A is bounded, any sequence xn∈A{x_n} is also bounded. From the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, xn{x_n} contains a subsequence converging to some point x∈Rn∈ℝ^n. Since x is a limit point of A and A is a closed set, x must be an element of A. Thus the subsets A of Rnℝ^n for which every sequence in A has a subsequence converging to an element of A – i.e., the subsets that are sequentially compact in the subspace topology – are precisely the closed and bounded subsets. This form of the theorem makes especially clear the analogy to the Heine–Borel theorem, which asserts that a subset of Rnℝ^n is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. In fact, general topology tells us that a metrizable space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact, so that the Bolzano–Weierstrass and Heine–Borel theorems are essentially the same.
