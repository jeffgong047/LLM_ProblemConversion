Proof: First we prove the theorem for R1ℝ^1 (set of all real numbers), in which case the ordering on R1ℝ^1 can be put to good use. Indeed, we have the following result: Lemma: Every infinite sequence (xn)(x_n) in R1ℝ^1 has a monotone subsequence (a subsequence that is either non-decreasing or non-increasing). Proof[4]: Let us call a positive integer-valued index n of a sequence a "peak" of the sequence when xm≤xn_m_n for every m>n>n. Suppose first that the sequence has infinitely many peaks, which means there is a subsequence with the following indices n1<n2<n3<⋯<nj<…_1<n_2<n_3<…<n_j<… and the following terms xn1≥xn2≥xn3≥⋯≥xnj≥…_n_1_n_2_n_3≥…_n_j≥…. So, the infinite sequence (xn)(x_n) in R1ℝ^1 has a monotone (non-increasing) subsequence, which is (xnj)(x_n_j). But suppose now that there are only finitely many peaks, let N be the final peak if one exists (let N=0=0 otherwise) and let the first index of a new subsequence (xnj)(x_n_j) be set to n1=N+1_1=N+1. Then n1_1 is not a peak, since n1_1 comes after the final peak, which implies the existence of n2_2 with n1<n2_1<n_2 and xn1≤xn2_n_1_n_2. Again, n2_2 comes after the final peak, hence there is an n3_3 where n2<n3_2<n_3 with xn2≤xn3_n_2_n_3. Repeating this process leads to an infinite non-decreasing subsequence xn1≤xn2≤xn3≤…_n_1_n_2_n_3≤…, thereby proving that every infinite sequence (xn)(x_n) in R1ℝ^1 has a monotone subsequence. Now suppose one has a bounded sequence in R1ℝ^1; by the lemma proven above there exists a monotone subsequence, likewise also bounded. It follows from the monotone convergence theorem that this subsequence converges. Finally, the general case (Rnℝ^n), can be reduced to the case of R1ℝ^1 as follows: given a bounded sequence in Rnℝ^n, the sequence of first coordinates is a bounded real sequence, hence it has a convergent subsequence. One can then extract a sub-subsequence on which the second coordinates converge, and so on, until in the end we have passed from the original sequence to a subsequence n times—which is still a subsequence of the original sequence—on which each coordinate sequence converges, hence the subsequence itself is convergent.
