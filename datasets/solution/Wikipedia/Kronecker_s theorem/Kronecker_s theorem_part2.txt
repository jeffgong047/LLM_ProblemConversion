Statement: Kronecker's theorem is a result in diophantine approximations applying to several real numbers xi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, that generalises Dirichlet's approximation theorem to multiple variables. The classical Kronecker approximation theorem is formulated as follows. Given real n-tuples αi=(αi1,⋯,αin)∈Rn,i=1,⋯,mα_i=(α_i1,⋯,α_in)∈ℝ^n,i=1,⋯,m and β=(β1,⋯,βn)∈Rnβ=(β_1,⋯,β_n)∈ℝ^n , the condition: ∀ϵ>0∃qi,pj∈Z:|∑i=1mqiαij−pj−βj|<ϵ,1≤j≤n∀ϵ>0 _i,p_j∈ℤ:|∑_i=1^mq_iα_ij-p_j-β_j|<ϵ,1 holds if and only if for any r1,…,rn∈Z,i=1,…,m_1,…,r_n∈ℤ,ı=1,…,m with ∑j=1nαijrj∈Z,i=1,…,m,∑_j=1^nα_ijr_j∈ℤ, i=1,…,m the number ∑j=1nβjrj∑_j=1^nβ_jr_j is also an integer. In plainer language the first condition states that the tuple β=(β1,…,βn)β=(β_1,…,β_n) can be approximated arbitrarily well by linear combinations of the αiα_is (with integer coefficients) and integer vectors. For the case of a m=1=1 and n=1=1, Kronecker's Approximation Theorem can be stated as follows.[1] For any α,β,ϵ∈Rα,β,ϵ∈ℝ with αα irrational and ϵ>0ϵ>0 there exist integers p and q with q>0>0, such that |αq−p−β|<ϵ.|-p-β|<ϵ.
