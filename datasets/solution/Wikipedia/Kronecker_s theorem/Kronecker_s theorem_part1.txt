For the theorem about the real analytic Eisenstein series, see Kronecker limit formula. For the theorem about roots of polynomials, see field extension. In mathematics, Kronecker's theorem is a theorem about diophantine approximation, introduced by Leopold Kronecker (1884). Kronecker's approximation theorem had been firstly proved by L. Kronecker in the end of the 19th century. It has been now revealed to relate to the idea of n-torus and Mahler measure since the later half of the 20th century. In terms of physical systems, it has the consequence that planets in circular orbits moving uniformly around a star will, over time, assume all alignments, unless there is an exact dependency between their orbital periods.
