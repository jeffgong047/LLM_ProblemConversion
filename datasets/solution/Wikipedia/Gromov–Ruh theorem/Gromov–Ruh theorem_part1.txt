In mathematics, a smooth compact manifold M is called almost flat if for any ε>0ε>0 there is a Riemannian metric gε_ε on M such that diam(M,gε)≤1(M,g_ε)≤1 and gε_ε is εε-flat, i.e. for the sectional curvature of Kgε_g_ε we have |Kgϵ|<ε|K_g_ϵ|<ε. Given n, there is a positive number εn>0ε_n>0 such that if an n-dimensional manifold admits an εnε_n-flat metric with diameter ≤1≤1 then it is almost flat. On the other hand, one can fix the bound of sectional curvature and get the diameter going to zero, so the almost-flat manifold is a special case of a collapsing manifold, which is collapsing along all directions. According to the Gromov–Ruh theorem, M is almost flat if and only if it is infranil. In particular, it is a finite factor of a nilmanifold, which is the total space of a principal torus bundle over a principal torus bundle over a torus.
