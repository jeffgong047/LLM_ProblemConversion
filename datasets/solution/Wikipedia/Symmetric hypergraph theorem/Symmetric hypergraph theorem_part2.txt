Statement: A group G acting on a set S is called transitive if given any two elements x and y in S, there exists an element f of G such that f(x)=y(x)=y. A graph (or hypergraph) is called symmetric if its automorphism group is transitive. Theorem. Let H=(S,E)=(S,E) be a symmetric hypergraph. Let m=|S|=|S|, and let χ(H)χ(H) denote the chromatic number of H, and let α(H)α(H) denote the independence number of H. Then χ(H)≤1+ln⁡m−ln⁡(1−α(H)/m)χ(H)≤1+lnm/-ln(1-α(H)/m)
