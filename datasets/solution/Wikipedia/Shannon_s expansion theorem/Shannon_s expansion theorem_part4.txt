cofactors: Linear properties of cofactors: For a Boolean function F which is made up of two Boolean functions G and H the following are true: If F=H′=H' then Fx=Hx′_x=H'_x If F=G⋅H=G then Fx=Gx⋅Hx_x=G_x_x If F=G+H=G+H then Fx=Gx+Hx_x=G_x+H_x If F=G⊕H=G then Fx=Gx⊕Hx_x=G_x_x Characteristics of unate functions: If F is a unate function and... If F is positive unate then F=x⋅Fx+Fx′=x_x+F_x' If F is negative unate then F=Fx+x′⋅Fx′=F_x+x'_x' Operations with
