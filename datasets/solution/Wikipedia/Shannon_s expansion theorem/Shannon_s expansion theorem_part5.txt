cofactors: Boolean difference: The Boolean difference or Boolean derivative of the function F with respect to the literal x is defined as: ∂F∂x=Fx⊕Fx′/=F_x_x' Universal quantification: The universal quantification of F is defined as: ∀xF=Fx⋅Fx′=F_x_x' Existential quantification: The existential quantification of F is defined as: ∃xF=Fx+Fx′=F_x+F_x'
