Boole's expansion theorem, often referred to as the Shannon expansion or decomposition, is the identity: F=x⋅Fx+x′⋅Fx′=x_x+x'_x', where F is any Boolean function, x is a variable, x′' is the complement of x, and Fx_xand Fx′_x' are F with the argument x set equal to 11 and to 00 respectively. The terms Fx_x and Fx′_x' are sometimes called the positive and negative Shannon cofactors, respectively, of F with respect to x. These are functions, computed by restrict operator, restrict⁡(F,x,0)restrict(F,x,0) and restrict⁡(F,x,1)restrict(F,x,1) (see valuation (logic) and partial application). It has been called the "fundamental theorem of Boolean algebra".[1] Besides its theoretical importance, it paved the way for binary decision diagrams (BDDs), satisfiability solvers, and many other techniques relevant to computer engineering and formal verification of digital circuits. In such engineering contexts (especially in BDDs), the expansion is interpreted as a if-then-else, with the variable x being the condition and the cofactors being the branches (Fx_x when x is true and respectively Fx′_x' when x is false).[2] Statement of the
