statement: The following alternative statement is given in Theorem 1.12 of Michael Artin (1969). Let R be a field or an excellent discrete valuation ring, let A be the henselization at a prime ideal of an R-algebra of finite type, let m be a proper ideal of A, let A^Â be the m-adic completion of A, and let F:(A-algebras)→(sets),(A-algebras)→(sets), be a functor sending filtered colimits to filtered colimits (Artin calls such a functor locally of finite presentation). Then for any integer c and any ξ¯∈F(A^)ξ(Â), there is a ξ∈F(A)ξ(A) such that ξ¯≡ξmodmcξ≡ξm^c. See
