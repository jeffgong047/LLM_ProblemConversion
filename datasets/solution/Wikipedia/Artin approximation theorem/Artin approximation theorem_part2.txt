theorem: Let x=x1,…,xn𝐱=x_1,…,x_n denote a collection of n indeterminates, k[[x]][[𝐱]] the ring of formal power series with indeterminates x𝐱 over a field k, and y=y1,…,yn𝐲=y_1,…,y_n a different set of indeterminates. Let f(x,y)=0(𝐱,𝐲)=0 be a system of polynomial equations in k[x,y][𝐱,𝐲], and c a positive integer. Then given a formal power series solution y^(x)∈k[[x]]𝐲̂(𝐱)[[𝐱]], there is an algebraic solution y(x)𝐲(𝐱) consisting of algebraic functions (more precisely, algebraic power series) such that y^(x)≡y(x)mod(x)c.𝐲̂(𝐱)≡𝐲(𝐱)(𝐱)^c.
