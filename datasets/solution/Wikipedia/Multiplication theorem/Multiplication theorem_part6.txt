function: The periodic zeta function[2] is sometimes defined as F(s;q)=∑m=1∞e2πimqms=Lis⁡(e2πiq)(s;q)=∑_m=1^∞e^2/m^s=Li_s(e^2) where Lis(z) is the polylogarithm. It obeys the duplication formula 21−sF(s;q)=F(s,q2)+F(s,q+12).2^1-sF(s;q)=F(s,q/2)+F(s,q+1/2). As such, it is an eigenvector of the Bernoulli operator with eigenvalue 21−s. The multiplication theorem is k1−sF(s;kq)=∑n=0k−1F(s,q+nk).^1-sF(s;kq)=∑_n=0^k-1F(s,q+n/k). The periodic zeta function occurs in the reflection formula for the Hurwitz zeta function, which is why the relation that it obeys, and the Hurwitz zeta relation, differ by the interchange of s → 1−s. The Bernoulli polynomials may be obtained as a limiting case of the periodic zeta function, taking s to be an integer, and thus the multiplication theorem there can be derived from the above. Similarly, substituting q = log z leads to the multiplication theorem for the polylogarithm.
