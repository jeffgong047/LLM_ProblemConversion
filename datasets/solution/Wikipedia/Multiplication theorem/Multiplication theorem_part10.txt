map: The Bernoulli map is a certain simple model of a dissipative dynamical system, describing the effect of a shift operator on an infinite string of coin-flips (the Cantor set). The Bernoulli map is a one-sided version of the closely related Baker's map. The Bernoulli map generalizes to a k-adic version, which acts on infinite strings of k symbols: this is the Bernoulli scheme. The transfer operator Lkℒ_k corresponding to the shift operator on the Bernoulli scheme is given by [Lkf](x)=1k∑n=0k−1f(x+nk)[ℒ_kf](x)=1/k∑_n=0^k-1f(x+n/k) Perhaps not surprisingly, the eigenvectors of this operator are given by the Bernoulli polynomials. That is, one has that LkBm=1kmBmℒ_kB_m=1/k^mB_m It is the fact that the eigenvalues k−m<1^-m<1 that marks this as a dissipative system: for a non-dissipative measure-preserving dynamical system, the eigenvalues of the transfer operator lie on the unit circle. One may construct a function obeying the multiplication theorem from any totally multiplicative function. Let f(n)(n) be totally multiplicative; that is, f(mn)=f(m)f(n)(mn)=f(m)f(n) for any integers m, n. Define its Fourier series as g(x)=∑n=1∞f(n)exp⁡(2πinx)(x)=∑_n=1^∞f(n)exp(2) Assuming that the sum converges, so that g(x) exists, one then has that it obeys the multiplication theorem; that is, that 1k∑n=0k−1g(x+nk)=f(k)g(x)1/k∑_n=0^k-1g(x+n/k)=f(k)g(x) That is, g(x) is an eigenfunction of Bernoulli transfer operator, with eigenvalue f(k). The multiplication theorem for the Bernoulli polynomials then follows as a special case of the multiplicative function f(n)=n−s(n)=n^-s. The Dirichlet characters are fully multiplicative, and thus can be readily used to obtain additional identities of this form. Characteristic
