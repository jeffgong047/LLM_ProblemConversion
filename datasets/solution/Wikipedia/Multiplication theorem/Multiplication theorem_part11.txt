zero: The multiplication theorem over a field of characteristic zero does not close after a finite number of terms, but requires an infinite series to be expressed. Examples include that for the Bessel function Jν(z)_ν(z): λ−νJν(λz)=∑n=0∞1n!((1−λ2)z2)nJν+n(z),λ^-νJ_ν()=∑_n=0^∞1/n!((1-λ^2)z/2)^nJ_ν+n(z), where λλ and νν may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers. Such characteristic-zero identities follow generally from one of many possible identities on the hypergeometric series.
