numbers: The polygamma function is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function, and thus, the multiplication theorem becomes additive, instead of multiplicative: kmψ(m−1)(kz)=∑n=0k−1ψ(m−1)(z+nk)^mψ^(m-1)(kz)=∑_n=0^k-1ψ^(m-1)(z+n/k) for m>1>1, and, for m=1=1, one has the digamma function: k[ψ(kz)−log⁡(k)]=∑n=0k−1ψ(z+nk).[ψ(kz)-log(k)]=∑_n=0^k-1ψ(z+n/k). The polygamma identities can be used to obtain a multiplication theorem for harmonic numbers. Hurwitz zeta
