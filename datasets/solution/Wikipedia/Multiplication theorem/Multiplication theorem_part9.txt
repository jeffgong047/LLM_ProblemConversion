polynomials: For the Bernoulli polynomials, the multiplication theorems were given by Joseph Ludwig Raabe in 1851: k1−mBm(kx)=∑n=0k−1Bm(x+nk)^1-mB_m(kx)=∑_n=0^k-1B_m(x+n/k) and for the Euler polynomials, k−mEm(kx)=∑n=0k−1(−1)nEm(x+nk)fork=1,3,…^-mE_m(kx)=∑_n=0^k-1(-1)^nE_m(x+n/k) k=1,3,… and k−mEm(kx)=−2m+1∑n=0k−1(−1)nBm+1(x+nk)fork=2,4,….^-mE_m(kx)=-2/m+1∑_n=0^k-1(-1)^nB_m+1(x+n/k) k=2,4,…. The Bernoulli polynomials may be obtained as a special case of the Hurwitz zeta function, and thus the identities follow from there. Bernoulli
