Overtaking: Some authors claim that the limit-of-means criterion is unrealistic, because it implies that utilities in any finite time-span contribute 0 to the total utility. However, if the utilities in any finite time-span contribute a positive value, and the value is undiscounted, then it is impossible to attribute a finite numeric utility to an infinite outcome sequence. A possible solution to this problem is that, instead of defining a numeric utility for each infinite outcome sequence, we just define the preference relation between two infinite sequences. We say that agent i (strictly) prefers the sequence of outcomes yt_t over the sequence xt_t, if:[6][7]: 139 [8] liminfT→∞∑t=0T(ui(yt)−ui(xt))>0lim inf_T→∞∑_t=0^T(u_i(y_t)-u_i(x_t))>0 For example, consider the sequences ui(x)=(0,0,0,0,…)_i(x)=(0,0,0,0,…) and ui(y)=(−1,2,0,0,…)_i(y)=(-1,2,0,0,…). According to the limit-of-means criterion, they provide the same utility to player i, but according to the overtaking criterion, y is better than x for player i. See overtaking criterion for more information. The folk theorems with the overtaking criterion are slightly weaker than with the limit-of-means criterion. Only outcomes that are strictly individually rational, can be attained in Nash equilibrium. This is because, if an agent deviates, he gains in the short run, and this gain can be wiped out only if the punishment gives the deviator strictly less utility than the agreement path. The following folk theorems are known for the overtaking criterion: Strict stationary equilibria:[6] A Nash equilibrium is called strict if each player strictly prefers the infinite sequence of outcomes attained in equilibrium, over any other sequence he can deviate to. A Nash equilibrium is called stationary if the outcome is the same in each time-period. An outcome is attainable in strict-stationary-equilibrium if-and-only-if for every player the outcome is strictly better than the player's minimax outcome.[11] Strict stationary subgame-perfect equilibria:[6] An outcome is attainable in strict-stationary-subgame-perfect-equilibrium, if for every player the outcome is strictly better than the player's minimax outcome (note that this is not an "if-and-only-if" result). To achieve subgame-perfect equilibrium with the overtaking criterion, it is required to punish not only the player that deviates from the agreement path, but also every player that does not cooperate in punishing the deviant.[7]: 149–150 The "stationary equilibrium" concept can be generalized to a "periodic equilibrium", in which a finite number of outcomes is repeated periodically, and the payoff in a period is the arithmetic mean of the payoffs in the outcomes. That mean payoff should be strictly above the minimax payoff.[6] Strict stationary coalition equilibria:[8] With the overtaking criterion, if an outcome is attainable in coalition-Nash-equilibrium, then it is Pareto efficient and weakly-coalition-individually-rational. On the other hand, if it is Pareto efficient and strongly-coalition-individually-rational[12] it can be attained in strict-stationary-coalition-equilibrium. Infinitely-repeated games with
