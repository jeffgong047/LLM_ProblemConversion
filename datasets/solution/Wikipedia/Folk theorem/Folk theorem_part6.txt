discounting: Assume that the payoff of a player in an infinitely repeated game is given by the average discounted criterion with discount factor 0 < δ < 1: Ui=(1−δ)∑t≥0δtui(xt),_i=(1-δ)∑_t≥0δ^tu_i(x_t), The discount factor indicates how patient the players are. The factor (1−δ)(1-δ) is introduced so that the payoff remain bounded when δ→1δ→1. The folk theorem in this case requires that the payoff profile in the repeated game strictly dominates the minmax payoff profile (i.e., each player receives strictly more than the minmax payoff). Let a be a strategy profile of the stage game with payoff profile u which strictly dominates the minmax payoff profile. One can define a Nash equilibrium of the game with u as resulting payoff profile as follows: 1. All players start by playing a and continue to play a if no deviation occurs. 2. If any one player, say player i, deviated, play the strategy profile m which minmaxes i forever after. 3. Ignore multilateral deviations. If player i gets ε more than his minmax payoff each stage by following 1, then the potential loss from punishment is 11−δε.1/1-δε. If δ is close to 1, this outweighs any finite one-stage gain, making the strategy a Nash equilibrium. An alternative statement of this folk theorem[4] allows the equilibrium payoff profile u to be any individually rational feasible payoff profile; it only requires there exist an individually rational feasible payoff profile that strictly dominates the minmax payoff profile. Then, the folk theorem guarantees that it is possible to approach u in equilibrium to any desired precision (for every ε there exists a Nash equilibrium where the payoff profile is a distance ε away from u).
