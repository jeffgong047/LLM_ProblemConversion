Notes: ^ In mathematics, the term folk theorem refers generally to any theorem that is believed and discussed, but has not been published. Roger Myerson has recommended the more descriptive term "general feasibility theorem" for the game theory theorems discussed here. See Myerson, Roger B.

Here, to prevent ambiguity, the term "coalition equilibrium" is used instead. ^ a b For every nonempty coalition B, there is a strategy of the other players (N∖B) such that for any strategy played by B, the payoff when B plays cB^B is not [strictly better for all members of B]. ^ In the 1979 paper, Rubinstein claims that an outcome is attainable in strict-stationary-equilibrium if-and-only-if for every player, the outcome is EITHER strictly better than the player's minimax outcome OR the outcome is weakly better than any other outcome the player can unilaterally deviate to. It is not clear how the second option is attainable in a strict equilibrium. In the 1994 book, this claim does not appear. ^ a b for every nonempty coalition B, there is a strategy of the other players (N∖B) such that for any strategy played by B, the payoff is strictly worse for at least one member of B. ^ a b Fisher, Franklin M.
