theorems: The following table compares various folk theorems in several aspects: Horizon – whether the stage game is repeated finitely or infinitely many times. Utilities – how the utility of a player in the repeated game is determined from the player's utilities in the stage game iterations. Conditions on G (the stage game) – whether there are any technical conditions that should hold in the one-shot game in order for the theorem to work. Conditions on x (the target payoff vector of the repeated game) – whether the theorem works for any individually rational and feasible payoff vector, or only on a subset of these vectors. Equilibrium type – if all conditions are met, what kind of equilibrium is guaranteed by the theorem – Nash or Subgame-perfect? Punishment type – what kind of punishment strategy is used to deter players from deviating?

None For all ε>0ε>0 there is T0∈N_0∈ℕ such that, if T≥T0_0, for every x there is equilibrium with payoff εε-close to x. Nash Aumann& Shapley[5] Infinite Limit of means None None Payoff exactly x. Nash Grim Aumann& Shapley[5] and Rubinstein[8][16] Infinite Limit of means None None Payoff exactly x. Subgame-perfect Limited-time punishment.[7]: 146–149 Rubinstein[6] Infinite Overtaking None Strictly above minimax. Single outcome or a periodic sequence. Subgame-perfect Punishing non-punishers.[7]: 149–150 Rubinstein[8] Infinite Limit of means None Pareto-efficient and weakly-coalition-individually-rational[10] None Coalition-subgame-perfect Rubinstein[8] Infinite Overtaking None Pareto-efficient and strongly-coalition-individually-rational[12] None Coalition-Nash Fudenberg& Maskin[17] Infinite Sum with discount δδ Correlated mixed strategies are allowed. Strictly above minimax. When δδ is sufficiently near 1, there is an equilibrium with payoff exactly x. Nash Grim Fudenberg& Maskin[17] Infinite Sum with discount δδ Only pure strategies are allowed. Strictly above minimax. For all ε>0ε>0 there is δ0<1δ_0<1 such that, if δ≥δ0δ≥δ_0, for every x there is an equilibrium with payoff εε-close to x. Nash Grim punishment. Friedman (1971, 1977) Infinite Sum with discount δδ Correlated mixed strategies are allowed. Strictly above a Nash-equilibrium in G. When δδ is sufficiently near 1, there is equilibrium with payoff exactly x. Subgame-perfect Grim punishment using the Nash-equilibrium. Fudenberg& Maskin[17] Infinite Sum with discount δδ Two players Strictly above minimax. For all x there is δ0<1δ_0<1 such that, if δ≥δ0δ≥δ_0, there is equilibrium with payoff exactly x. Subgame-perfect Limited-time punishment. Fudenberg& Maskin[17] Infinite Sum with discount δδ The IR feasible space is full-dimensional.[18] Strictly above minimax. For all x there is δ0<1δ_0<1 such that, if δ≥δ0δ≥δ_0, there is equilibrium with payoff exactly x. Subgame-perfect Rewarding the punishers.[7]: 150–153
