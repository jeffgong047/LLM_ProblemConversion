discounting: In the undiscounted model, the players are patient. They don't differentiate between utilities in different time periods. Hence, their utility in the repeated game is represented by the sum of utilities in the basic games. When the game is infinite, a common model for the utility in the infinitely-repeated game is the limit inferior of mean utility: If the game results in a path of outcomes xt_t, where xt_t denotes the collective choices of the players at iteration t (t=0,1,2,...), player i's utility is defined as Ui=liminfT→∞1T∑t=0Tui(xt),_i=lim inf_T→∞1/T∑_t=0^Tu_i(x_t), where ui_i is the basic-game utility function of player i. An infinitely-repeated game without discounting is often called a "supergame". The folk theorem in this case is very simple and contains no pre-conditions: every individually rational and feasible payoff profile in the basic game is a Nash equilibrium payoff profile in the repeated game. The proof employs what is called a grim[5] or grim trigger[6] strategy. All players start by playing the prescribed action and continue to do so until someone deviates. If player i deviates, all other players switch to picking the action which minmaxes player i forever after. The one-stage gain from deviation contributes 0 to the total utility of player i. The utility of a deviating player cannot be higher than his minmax payoff. Hence all players stay on the intended path and this is indeed a Nash equilibrium. Subgame
