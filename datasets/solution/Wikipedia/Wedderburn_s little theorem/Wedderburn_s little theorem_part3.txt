field: The theorem is essentially equivalent to saying that the Brauer group of a finite field is trivial. In fact, this characterization immediately yields a proof of the theorem as follows: let k be a finite field. Since the Herbrand quotient vanishes by finiteness, Br‚Å°(k)=H2(kal/k)Br(k)=H^2(k^al/k) coincides with H1(kal/k)^1(k^al/k), which in turn vanishes by Hilbert 90.
