Proof: Let A be a finite domain. For each nonzero x in A, the two maps a↦ax,a↦xa:A→A,a:A are injective by the cancellation property, and thus, surjective by counting. It follows from the elementary group theory[5] that the nonzero elements of A form a group under multiplication. Thus, A is a skew-field. To prove that every finite skew-field is a field, we use strong induction on the size of the skew-field. Thus, let A be a skew-field, and assume that all skew-fields that are proper subsets of A are fields. Since the center Z(A)(A) of A is a field, A is a vector space over Z(A)(A) with finite dimension n. Our objective is then to show n=1=1. If q is the order of Z(A)(A), then A has order qnq^n. Note that because Z(A)(A) contains the distinct elements 00 and 11, q>1>1. For each x in A that is not in the center, the centralizer ZxZ_x of x is clearly a skew-field and thus a field, by the induction hypothesis, and because ZxZ_x can be viewed as a vector space over Z(A)(A) and A can be viewed as a vector space over ZxZ_x, we have that ZxZ_x has order qdq^d where d divides n and is less than n. Viewing Z(A)∗Z(A)^*, A∗^*, and the Zx∗Z_x^* as groups under multiplication, we can write the class equation qn−1=q−1+∑qn−1qd−1^n-1=q-1+∑q^n-1^d-1 where the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes not contained within Z(A)∗Z(A)^*, and the d are defined so that for each conjugacy class, the order of Zx∗Z_x^* for any x in the class is qd−1q^d-1. qn−1q^n-1 and qd−1^d-1 both admit polynomial factorization in terms of cyclotomic polynomials Φf(q).Φ_f(q). In the polynomial identities xn−1=∏m|nΦm(x)^n-1=∏_m|nΦ_m(x) and xd−1=∏m|dΦm(x)^d-1=∏_m|dΦ_m(x), we set x=q=q. Because each d is a proper divisor of n, Φn(q)Φ_n(q) divides both qn−1q^n-1 and each qn−1qd−1q^n-1^d-1, so by the above class equation Φn(q)Φ_n(q) must divide q−1-1, and therefore |Φn(q)|≤q−1.|Φ_n(q)|≦-1. To see that this forces n to be 11, we will show |Φn(q)|>q−1|Φ_n(q)|>q-1 for n>1>1 using factorization over the complex numbers. In the polynomial identity Φn(x)=∏(x−ζ),Φ_n(x)=∏(x-ζ), where ζζ runs over the primitive n-th roots of unity, set x to be q and then take absolute values |Φn(q)|=∏|q−ζ|.|Φ_n(q)|=∏|q-ζ|. For n>1>1, we see that for each primitive n-th root of unity ζζ, |q−ζ|>|q−1||q-ζ|>|q-1| because of the location of q, 11, and ζζ in the complex plane. Thus |Φn(q)|>q−1.|Φ_n(q)|>q-1.
