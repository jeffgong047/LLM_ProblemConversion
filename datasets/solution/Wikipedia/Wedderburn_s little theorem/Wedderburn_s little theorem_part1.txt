Result in algebra In mathematics, Wedderburn's little theorem states that every finite division ring is a field. In other words, for finite rings, there is no distinction between domains, division rings and fields. The Artinâ€“Zorn theorem generalizes the theorem to alternative rings: every finite alternative division ring is a field.[1]
