trees: Consider[10] the set Bℬ of unlabelled binary trees. An element of Bℬ is either a leaf of size zero, or a root node with two subtrees. Denote by Bn_n the number of binary trees on n nodes. Removing the root splits a binary tree into two trees of smaller size. This yields the functional equation on the generating function B(z)=∑n=0∞Bnzn:(z)=∑_n=0^∞B_nz^n: B(z)=1+zB(z)2.(z)=1+zB(z)^2. Letting C(z)=B(z)−1(z)=B(z)-1, one has thus C(z)=z(C(z)+1)2.(z)=z(C(z)+1)^2. Applying the theorem with ϕ(w)=(w+1)2ϕ(w)=(w+1)^2 yields Bn=[zn]C(z)=1n[wn−1](w+1)2n=1n(2nn−1)=1n+1(2nn)._n=[z^n]C(z)=1/n[w^n-1](w+1)^2n=1/n2nn-1=1/n+12nn. This shows that Bn_n is the nth Catalan number. Asymptotic approximation of
