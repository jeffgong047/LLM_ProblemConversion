Example: For instance, the algebraic equation of degree p xp−x+z=0^p-x+z=0 can be solved for x by means of the Lagrange inversion formula for the function f(x) = x − xp, resulting in a formal series solution x=∑k=0∞(pkk)z(p−1)k+1(p−1)k+1.=∑_k=0^∞pkkz^(p-1)k+1/(p-1)k+1. By convergence tests, this series is in fact convergent for |z|≤(p−1)p−p/(p−1),|z|≤(p-1)p^-p/(p-1), which is also the largest disk in which a local inverse to f can be defined. Sketch of the
