Statement: Suppose z is defined as a function of w by an equation of the form z=f(w)=f(w) where f is analytic at a point a and f′(a)≠0.'(a)≠0. Then it is possible to invert or solve the equation for w, expressing it in the form w=g(z)=g(z) given by a power series[1] g(z)=a+∑n=1∞gn(z−f(a))nn!,(z)=a+∑_n=1^∞g_n(z-f(a))^n/n!, where gn=limw→adn−1dwn−1[(w−af(w)−f(a))n]._n=lim_wd^n-1/dw^n-1[(w-a/f(w)-f(a))^n]. The theorem further states that this series has a non-zero radius of convergence, i.e., g(z)(z) represents an analytic function of z in a neighbourhood of z=f(a).=f(a). This is also called reversion of series. If the assertions about analyticity are omitted, the formula is also valid for formal power series and can be generalized in various ways: It can be formulated for functions of several variables; it can be extended to provide a ready formula for F(g(z)) for any analytic function F; and it can be generalized to the case f′(a)=0,'(a)=0, where the inverse g is a multivalued function. The theorem was proved by Lagrange[2] and generalized by Hans Heinrich Bürmann,[3][4][5] both in the late 18th century. There is a straightforward derivation using complex analysis and contour integration;[6] the complex formal power series version is a consequence of knowing the formula for polynomials, so the theory of analytic functions may be applied. Actually, the machinery from analytic function theory enters only in a formal way in this proof, in that what is really needed is some property of the formal residue, and a more direct formal proof is available. If f is a formal power series, then the above formula does not give the coefficients of the compositional inverse series g directly in terms for the coefficients of the series f. If one can express the functions f and g in formal power series as f(w)=∑k=0∞fkwkk!andg(z)=∑k=0∞gkzkk!(w)=∑_k=0^∞f_kw^k/k! and(z)=∑_k=0^∞g_kz^k/k! with f0 = 0 and f1 ≠ 0, then an explicit form of inverse coefficients can be given in term of Bell polynomials:[7] gn=1f1n∑k=1n−1(−1)kn(k)Bn−1,k(f^1,f^2,…,f^n−k),n≥2,_n=1/f_1^n∑_k=1^n-1(-1)^kn^(k)B_n-1,k(f̂_1,f̂_2,…,f̂_n-k),≥2, where f^k=fk+1(k+1)f1,g1=1f1,andn(k)=n(n+1)⋯(n+k−1)f̂_k =f_k+1/(k+1)f_1, g_1 =1/f_1,and n^(k) =n(n+1)⋯(n+k-1) is the rising factorial. When f1 = 1, the last formula can be interpreted in terms of the faces of associahedra [8] gn=∑FfaceofKn(−1)n−dim⁡FfF,n≥2,_n=∑_FfaceofK_n(-1)^n-f_F,≥2, where fF=fi1⋯fim_F=f_i_1_i_m for each face F=Ki1×⋯×Kim=K_i_1×⋯_i_m of the associahedron Kn._n.
