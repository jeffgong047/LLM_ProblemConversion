function: Main article: Lambert W function The Lambert W function is the function W(z)(z) that is implicitly defined by the equation W(z)eW(z)=z.(z)e^W(z)=z. We may use the theorem to compute the Taylor series of W(z)(z) at z=0.=0. We take f(w)=wew(w)=we^w and a=0.=0. Recognizing that dndxneαx=αneαx,d^n/dx^ne^=α^ne^, this gives W(z)=∑n=1∞[limw→0dn−1dwn−1e−nw]znn!=∑n=1∞(−n)n−1znn!=z−z2+32z3−83z4+O(z5).W(z) =∑_n=1^∞[lim_w→0d^n-1/dw^n-1e^-nw]z^n/n! =∑_n=1^∞(-n)^n-1z^n/n! =z-z^2+3/2z^3-8/3z^4+O(z^5). The radius of convergence of this series is e−1^-1 (giving the principal branch of the Lambert function). A series that converges for |ln(z)−1|<4+π2|ln(z)-1|<4+π^2 (approximately 2.58…⋅10−6<z<2.869…⋅1062.58…·10^-6<z<2.869…·10^6) can also be derived by series inversion. The function f(z)=W(ez)−1(z)=W(e^z)-1 satisfies the equation 1+f(z)+ln⁡(1+f(z))=z.1+f(z)+ln(1+f(z))=z. Then z+ln⁡(1+z)+ln(1+z) can be expanded into a power series and inverted.[9] This gives a series for f(z+1)=W(ez+1)−1:(z+1)=W(e^z+1)-1: W(e1+z)=1+z2+z216−z3192−z43072+13z561440−O(z6).(e^1+z)=1+z/2+z^2/16-z^3/192-z^4/3072+13z^5/61440-O(z^6). W(x)(x) can be computed by substituting ln⁡x−1-1 for z in the above series. For example, substituting −1 for z gives the value of W(1)≈0.567143.(1)≈0.567143. Binary
