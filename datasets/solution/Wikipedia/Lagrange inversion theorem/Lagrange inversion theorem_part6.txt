formula: There is a special case of Lagrange inversion theorem that is used in combinatorics and applies when f(w)=w/ϕ(w)(w)=w/ϕ(w) for some analytic ϕ(w)ϕ(w) with ϕ(0)≠0.ϕ(0)≠0. Take a=0=0 to obtain f(a)=f(0)=0.(a)=f(0)=0. Then for the inverse g(z)(z) (satisfying f(g(z))≡z(g(z))), we have g(z)=∑n=1∞[limw→0dn−1dwn−1((ww/ϕ(w))n)]znn!=∑n=1∞1n[1(n−1)!limw→0dn−1dwn−1(ϕ(w)n)]zn,g(z) =∑_n=1^∞[lim_w→0d^n-1/dw^n-1((w/w/ϕ(w))^n)]z^n/n! =∑_n=1^∞1/n[1/(n-1)!lim_w→0d^n-1/dw^n-1(ϕ(w)^n)]z^n, which can be written alternatively as [zn]g(z)=1n[wn−1]ϕ(w)n,[z^n]g(z)=1/n[w^n-1]ϕ(w)^n, where [wr][w^r] is an operator which extracts the coefficient of wr^r in the Taylor series of a function of w. A generalization of the formula is known as the Lagrange–Bürmann formula: [zn]H(g(z))=1n[wn−1](H′(w)ϕ(w)n)[z^n]H(g(z))=1/n[w^n-1](H'(w)ϕ(w)^n) where H is an arbitrary analytic function. Sometimes, the derivative H′(w) can be quite complicated. A simpler version of the formula replaces H′(w) with H(w)(1 − φ′(w)/φ(w)) to get [zn]H(g(z))=[wn]H(w)ϕ(w)n−1(ϕ(w)−wϕ′(w)),[z^n]H(g(z))=[w^n]H(w)ϕ(w)^n-1(ϕ(w)-wϕ'(w)), which involves φ′(w) instead of H′(w).
