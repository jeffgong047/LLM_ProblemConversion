multigraphs: Kirchhoff's theorem holds for multigraphs as well; the matrix Q is modified as follows: The entry qi,j equals âˆ’m, where m is the number of edges between i and j; when counting the degree of a vertex, all loops are excluded. Cayley's formula for a complete multigraph is mn-1(nn-1-(n-1)nn-2) by same methods produced above, since a simple graph is a multigraph with m = 1. Explicit enumeration of spanning
