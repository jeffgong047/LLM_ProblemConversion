formula: Main article: Cayley's formula Cayley's formula follows from Kirchhoff's theorem as a special case, since every vector with 1 in one place, −1 in another place, and 0 elsewhere is an eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph, with the corresponding eigenvalue being n. These vectors together span a space of dimension n − 1, so there are no other non-zero eigenvalues. Alternatively, note that as Cayley's formula counts the number of distinct labeled trees of a complete graph Kn we need to compute any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of Kn. The Laplacian matrix in this case is [n−1−1⋯−1−1n−1⋯−1⋮⋮⋱⋮−1−1⋯n−1].[ n-1 -1 ⋯ -1; -1 n-1 ⋯ -1; ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮; -1 -1 ⋯ n-1; ]. Any cofactor of the above matrix is nn−2, which is Cayley's formula.
