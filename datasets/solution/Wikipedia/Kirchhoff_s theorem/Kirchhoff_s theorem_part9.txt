multigraphs: Kirchhoff's theorem can be modified to count the number of oriented spanning trees in directed multigraphs. The matrix Q is constructed as follows: The entry qi,j for distinct i and j equals âˆ’m, where m is the number of edges from i to j; The entry qi,i equals the indegree of i minus the number of loops at i. The number of oriented spanning trees rooted at a vertex i is the determinant of the matrix gotten by removing the ith row and column of Q Counting spanning k-component
