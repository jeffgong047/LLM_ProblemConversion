theorem: The Matrix-Tree Theorem can be used to compute the number of labeled spanning trees of this graph. First, construct the Laplacian matrix Q for the example diamond graph G (see image on the right): Q=[2−1−10−13−1−1−1−13−10−1−12].=[[ 2 -1 -1 0; -1 3 -1 -1; -1 -1 3 -1; 0 -1 -1 2 ]]. Next, construct a matrix Q* by deleting any row and any column from Q. For example, deleting row 1 and column 1 yields Q∗=[3−1−1−13−1−1−12].^∗=[[ 3 -1 -1; -1 3 -1; -1 -1 2 ]]. Finally, take the determinant of Q* to obtain t(G), which is 8 for the diamond graph. (Notice t(G) is the (1,1)-cofactor of Q in this example.) Proof
