set: Beck & Zaslavsky (2002) combined the Erdös and Meshalkin theorems by adapting Meshalkin's proof of his generalized LYM inequality. They showed that the largest size of a family of p-compositions such that the sets in the i-th position of the p-tuples, ignoring duplications, are r-chain-free, for every i=1,2,…,p−1=1,2,…,p-1 (but not necessarily for i = p), is not greater than the sum of the rp−1^p-1 largest p-multinomial coefficients.
