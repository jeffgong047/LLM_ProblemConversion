analog: In the finite projective geometry PG(d, Fq) of dimension d over a finite field of order q, let L(p,Fq)ℒ(p,F_q) be the family of all subspaces. When partially ordered by set inclusion, this family is a lattice. Rota & Harper (1971) proved that the largest size of an antichain in L(p,Fq)ℒ(p,F_q) is the largest Gaussian coefficient [d+1k];[ d+1; k ]; this is the projective-geometry analog, or q-analog, of Sperner's theorem. They further proved that the largest size of an r-chain-free family in L(p,Fq)ℒ(p,F_q) is the sum of the r largest Gaussian coefficients. Their proof is by a projective analog of the LYM inequality. No long chains in p-compositions of a projective
