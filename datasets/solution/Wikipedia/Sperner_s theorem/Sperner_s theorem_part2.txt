Statement: A family of sets in which none of the sets is a strict subset of another is called a Sperner family, or an antichain of sets, or a clutter. For example, the family of k-element subsets of an n-element set is a Sperner family. No set in this family can contain any of the others, because a containing set has to be strictly bigger than the set it contains, and in this family all sets have equal size. The value of k that makes this example have as many sets as possible is n/2 if n is even, or either of the nearest integers to n/2 if n is odd. For this choice, the number of sets in the family is (n⌊n/2⌋)n/2⌋. Sperner's theorem states that these examples are the largest possible Sperner families over an n-element set. Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family S whose union has a total of n elements, |S|≤(n⌊n/2⌋),|S|≤n/2⌋, and equality holds if and only if S consists of all subsets of an n-element set that have size ⌊n/2⌋/2⌋ or all that have size ⌈n/2⌉/2⌉.
