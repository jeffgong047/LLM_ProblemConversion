chains: A chain is a subfamily S0,S1,…,Sr⊆P(E){S_0,S_1,…,S_r}⊆𝒫(E) that is totally ordered, i.e., S0⊂S1⊂⋯⊂Sr_0_1⊂…_r (possibly after renumbering). The chain has r + 1 members and length r. An r-chain-free family (also called an r-family) is a family of subsets of E that contains no chain of length r. Erdős (1945) proved that the largest size of an r-chain-free family is the sum of the r largest binomial coefficients (ni)ni. The case r = 1 is Sperner's theorem. p-compositions of a
