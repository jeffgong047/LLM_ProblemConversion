Proof: There are many proofs of Sperner's theorem, each leading to different generalizations (see Anderson (1987)). The following proof is due to Lubell (1966). Let sk denote the number of k-sets in S. For all 0 ≤ k ≤ n, (n⌊n/2⌋)≥(nk)n⌊n/2⌋≥n and, thus, sk(n⌊n/2⌋)≤sk(nk).s_kn⌊n/2⌋≤s_kn. Since S is an antichain, we can sum over the above inequality from k = 0 to n and then apply the LYM inequality to obtain ∑k=0nsk(n⌊n/2⌋)≤∑k=0nsk(nk)≤1,∑_k=0^ns_kn⌊n/2⌋≤∑_k=0^ns_kn≤1, which means |S|=∑k=0nsk≤(n⌊n/2⌋).|S|=∑_k=0^ns_k≤n⌊n/2⌋. This completes the proof of part 1. To have equality, all the inequalities in the preceding proof must be equalities. Since (n⌊n/2⌋)=(nk)n⌊n/2⌋=n if and only if k=⌊n/2⌋=⌊n/2⌋ or ⌈n/2⌉,⌈n/2⌉, we conclude that equality implies that S consists only of sets of sizes ⌊n/2⌋⌊n/2⌋ or ⌈n/2⌉.⌈n/2⌉. For even n that concludes the proof of part 2. For odd n there is more work to do, which we omit here because it is complicated. See Anderson (1987), pp. 3–4.
