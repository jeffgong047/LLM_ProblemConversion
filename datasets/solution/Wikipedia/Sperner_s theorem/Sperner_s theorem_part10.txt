space: Beck & Zaslavsky (2003) obtained a Meshalkin-like generalization of the Rota–Harper theorem. In PG(d, Fq), a Meshalkin sequence of length p is a sequence (A1,…,Ap)(A_1,…,A_p) of projective subspaces such that no proper subspace of PG(d, Fq) contains them all and their dimensions sum to d−p+1-p+1. The theorem is that a family of Meshalkin sequences of length p in PG(d, Fq), such that the subspaces appearing in position i of the sequences contain no chain of length r for each i=1,2,…,p−1,=1,2,…,p-1, is not more than the sum of the largest rp−1^p-1 of the quantities [d+1n1n2…np]qs2(n1,…,np),[ d+1; n_1_2; dots_p ]q^s_2(n_1,…,n_p), where [d+1n1n2…np][ d+1; n_1_2; dots_p ] (in which we assume that d+1=n1+⋯+np+1=n_1+⋯+n_p) denotes the p-Gaussian coefficient [d+1n1][d+1−n1n2]⋯[d+1−(n1+⋯+np−1)np][ d+1; n_1 ][ d+1-n_1; n_2 ]⋯[ d+1-(n_1+⋯+n_p-1); n_p ] and s2(n1,…,np):=n1n2+n1n3+n2n3+n1n4+⋯+np−1np,_2(n_1,…,n_p):=n_1n_2+n_1n_3+n_2n_3+n_1n_4+⋯+n_p-1n_p, the second elementary symmetric function of the numbers n1,n2,…,np._1,n_2,…,n_p.
