set: In the set P(E)pùí´(E)^p of p-tuples of subsets of E, we say a p-tuple (S1,‚Ä¶,Sp)(S_1,‚Ä¶,S_p) is ‚â§ another one, (T1,‚Ä¶,Tp),(T_1,‚Ä¶,T_p), if Si‚äÜTi_i_i for each i = 1,2,...,p. We call (S1,‚Ä¶,Sp)(S_1,‚Ä¶,S_p) a p-composition of E if the sets S1,‚Ä¶,Sp_1,‚Ä¶,S_p form a partition of E. Meshalkin (1963) proved that the maximum size of an antichain of p-compositions is the largest p-multinomial coefficient (nn1n2‚Ä¶np),nn_1_2 dots_p, that is, the coefficient in which all ni are as nearly equal as possible (i.e., they differ by at most 1). Meshalkin proved this by proving a generalized LYM inequality. The case p = 2 is Sperner's theorem, because then S2=E‚àñS1_2=E_1 and the assumptions reduce to the sets S1_1 being a Sperner family. No long chains in p-compositions of a
