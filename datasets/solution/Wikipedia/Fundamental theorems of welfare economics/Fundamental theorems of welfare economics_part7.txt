(1908): Barone, an associate of Pareto, proved an optimality property of perfect competition,[21] namely that – assuming exogenous prices – it maximises the monetary value of the return from productive activity, this being the sum of the values of leisure, savings, and goods for consumption, all taken in the desired proportions.[22] He makes no argument that the prices chosen by the market are themselves optimal. His paper wasn't translated into English until 1935. It received an approving summary from Samuelson[23] but seems not to have influenced the development of the welfare theorems as they now stand.
