theorem: The second theorem formally states that, under the assumptions that every production set Yj_j is convex and every preference relation ≥i≥_i is convex and locally nonsatiated, any desired Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers.[38] Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibria with transfers. The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium. Let us define a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers as an allocation (x∗,y∗)(x^*,y^*), a price vector p, and a vector of wealth levels w (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with Σiwi=p⋅ω+Σjp⋅yj∗Σ_iw_i=p·ω+Σ_jp_j^* (where ωω is the aggregate endowment of goods and yj∗_j^* is the production of firm j) such that: i. p⋅yj≤p⋅yj∗_j_j^* for all yj∈Yj_j_j (firms maximize profit by producing yj∗_j^*) ii. For all i, if xi>ixi∗_i>_ix_i^* then p⋅xi≥wi_i_i (if xi_i is strictly preferred to xi∗_i^* then it cannot cost less than xi∗_i^*) iii. Σixi∗=ω+Σjyj∗Σ_ix_i^*=ω+Σ_jy_j^* (budget constraint satisfied) The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement (ii). The inequality is weak here (p⋅xi≥wi_i_i) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium.[38] Define Vi_i to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to xi∗_i^* by consumer i, and let V be the sum of all Vi_i. Vi_i is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation ≥i≥_i. V is convex because every Vi_i is convex. Similarly Y+ω+{ω}, the union of all production sets Yi_i plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every Yi_i is convex. We also know that the intersection of V and Y+ω+{ω} must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to (x∗,y∗)(x^*,y^*) by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of (x∗,y∗)(x^*,y^*). These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the separating hyperplane theorem. This theorem states that there exists a price vector p≠0≠0 and a number r such that p⋅z≥r for every z∈V and p⋅z≤r for every z∈Y+ω+{ω}. In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets. Next we argue that if xi≥ixi∗_i≥_ix_i^* for all i then p⋅(Σixi)≥r·(Σ_ix_i). This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle xi′'_i arbitrarily close to xi_i that is strictly preferred to xi∗_i^* and hence part of Vi_i, so p⋅(Σixi′)≥r·(Σ_ix'_i). Taking the limit as xi′→xi'_i_i does not change the weak inequality, so p⋅(Σixi)≥r·(Σ_ix_i) as well. In other words, xi_i is in the closure of V. Using this relation we see that for xi∗_i^* itself p⋅(Σixi∗)≥r·(Σ_ix_i^*). We also know that Σixi∗∈Y+ωΣ_ix_i^*+{ω}, so p⋅(Σixi∗)≤r·(Σ_ix_i^*) as well. Combining these we find that p⋅(Σixi∗)=r·(Σ_ix_i^*)=r. We can use this equation to show that (x∗,y∗,p)(x^*,y^*,p) fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Because p⋅(Σixi∗)=r·(Σ_ix_i^*)=r and Σixi∗=ω+Σjyj∗Σ_ix_i^*=ω+Σ_jy_j^* we know that for any firm j: p⋅(ω+yj+Σhyh∗)≤r=p⋅(ω+yj∗+Σhyh∗)·(ω+y_j+Σ_hy_h^*)=p·(ω+y_j^*+Σ_hy_h^*) for h≠j which implies p⋅yj≤p⋅yj∗_j_j^*. Similarly we know: p⋅(xi+Σkxk∗)≥r=p⋅(xi∗+Σkxk∗)·(x_i+Σ_kx_k^*)=p·(x_i^*+Σ_kx_k^*) for k≠i which implies p⋅xi≥p⋅xi∗_i_i^*. These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels wi=p⋅xi∗_i=p_i^* for all i. We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement "if xi>ixi∗_i>_ix_i^* then p⋅xi≥wi_i_i" imples "if xi>ixi∗_i>_ix_i^* then p⋅xi>wi_i>w_i". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set Xi_i is convex and the preference relation ≥i≥_i is continuous. Then, if there exists a consumption vector xi′'_i such that xi′∈Xi'_i_i and p⋅xi′<wi'_i<w_i, a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium. To see why, assume to the contrary xi>ixi∗_i>_ix_i^* and p⋅xi=wi_i=w_i, and xi_i exists. Then by the convexity of Xi_i we have a bundle xi″=αxi+(1−α)xi′∈Xi”_i=_i+(1-α)x'_i_i with p⋅xi″<wi”_i<w_i. By the continuity of ≥i≥_i for αα close to 1 we have αxi+(1−α)xi′>ixi∗_i+(1-α)x'_i>_ix_i^*. This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to xi∗_i^* and costs less than wi_i. Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a "cheaper" consumption bundle xi′'_i. One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels wi_i to be strictly positive for all consumers i.[38] See
