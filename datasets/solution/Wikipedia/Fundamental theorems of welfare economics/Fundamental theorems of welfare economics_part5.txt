(1881): Edgeworth took a step towards the first fundamental theorem in his 'Mathematical Psychics', looking at a pure exchange economy with no production. He included imperfect competition in his analysis.[7] His definition of equilibrium is almost the same as Pareto's later definition of optimality: it is a point such that... in whatever direction we take an infinitely small step, P and Î  [the utilities of buyer and seller] do not increase together, but that, while one increases, the other decreases.[8] Instead of concluding that equilibrium was Pareto optimal, Edgeworth concluded that the equilibrium maximizes the sum of utilities of the parties, which is a special case of Pareto efficiency: It seems to follow on general dynamical principles applied to this special case that equilibrium is attained when the total pleasure-energy of the contractors is a maximum relative, or subject, to conditions...[9] Vilfredo Pareto
