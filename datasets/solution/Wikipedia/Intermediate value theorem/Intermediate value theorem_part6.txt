A: The theorem may be proven as a consequence of the completeness property of the real numbers as follows:[3] We shall prove the first case, f(a)<u<f(b)(a)<u<f(b). The second case is similar. Let S be the set of all x∈[a,b]∈[a,b] such that f(x)<u(x)<u. Then S is non-empty since a is an element of S. Since S is non-empty and bounded above by b, by completeness, the supremum c=supS= exists. That is, c is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to every member of S. Note that, due to the continuity of f at a, we can keep f(x)(x) within any ε>0ε>0 of f(a)(a) by keeping x sufficiently close to a. Since f(a)<u(a)<u is a strict inequality, consider the implication when εε is the distance between u and f(a)(a). No x sufficiently close to a can then make f(x)(x) greater than or equal to u, which means there are values greater than a in S. A more detailed proof goes like this: Choose ε=u−f(a)>0ε=u-f(a)>0. Then ∃δ>0∃δ>0 such that ∀x∈[a,b]∈[a,b], |x−a|<δ⟹|f(x)−f(a)|<u−f(a)⟹f(x)<u.|x-a|<δ|f(x)-f(a)|<u-f(a)(x)<u.Consider the interval [a,min(a+δ,b))=I1[a,min(a+δ,b))=I_1. Notice that I1⊆[a,b]_1⊆[a,b] and every x∈I1_1 satisfies the condition |x−a|<δ|x-a|<δ. Therefore for every x∈I1_1 we have f(x)<u(x)<u. Hence c cannot be a. Likewise, due to the continuity of f at b, we can keep f(x)(x) within any ε>0ε>0 of f(b)(b) by keeping x sufficiently close to b. Since u<f(b)<f(b) is a strict inequality, consider the similar implication when εε is the distance between u and f(b)(b). Every x sufficiently close to b must then make f(x)(x) greater than u, which means there are values smaller than b that are upper bounds of S. A more detailed proof goes like this: Choose ε=f(b)−u>0ε=f(b)-u>0. Then ∃δ>0∃δ>0 such that ∀x∈[a,b]∈[a,b], |x−b|<δ⟹|f(x)−f(b)|<f(b)−u⟹f(x)>u.|x-b|<δ|f(x)-f(b)|<f(b)-u(x)>u.Consider the interval (max(a,b−δ),b]=I2(max(a,b-δ),b]=I_2. Notice that I2⊆[a,b]_2⊆[a,b] and every x∈I2_2 satisfies the condition |x−b|<δ|x-b|<δ. Therefore for every x∈I2_2 we have f(x)>u(x)>u. Hence c cannot be b. With c≠a and c≠b, it must be the case c∈(a,b)∈(a,b). Now we claim that f(c)=u(c)=u. Fix some ε>0ε>0. Since f is continuous at c, ∃δ1>0∃δ_1>0 such that ∀x∈[a,b]∈[a,b], |x−c|<δ1⟹|f(x)−f(c)|<ε|x-c|<δ_1|f(x)-f(c)|<ε. Since c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) and (a,b)(a,b) is open, ∃δ2>0∃δ_2>0 such that (c−δ2,c+δ2)⊆(a,b)(c-δ_2,c+δ_2)⊆(a,b). Set δ=min(δ1,δ2)δ=min(δ_1,δ_2). Then we have f(x)−ε<f(c)<f(x)+ε(x)-ε<f(c)<f(x)+ε for all x∈(c−δ,c+δ)∈(c-δ,c+δ). By the properties of the supremum, there exists some a∗∈(c−δ,c]^*∈(c-δ,c] that is contained in S, and so f(c)<f(a∗)+ε<u+ε.(c)<f(a^*)+ε<u+ε. Picking a∗∗∈(c,c+δ)^**∈(c,c+δ), we know that a∗∗∉S^** because c is the supremum of S. This means that f(c)>f(a∗∗)−ε≥u−ε.(c)>f(a^**)-ε-ε. Both inequalities u−ε<f(c)<u+ε-ε<f(c)<u+ε are valid for all ε>0ε>0, from which we deduce f(c)=u(c)=u as the only possible value, as stated. Proof version
