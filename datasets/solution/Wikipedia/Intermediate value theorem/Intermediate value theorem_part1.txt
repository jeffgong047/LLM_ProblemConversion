Continuous function on an interval takes on every value between its values at the ends Intermediate value theorem: Let f be a continuous function defined on [a,b][a,b] and let s be a number with f(a)<s<f(b)(a)<s<f(b). Then there exists some x between a and b such that f(x)=s(x)=s. In mathematical analysis, the intermediate value theorem states that if f is a continuous function whose domain contains the interval [a, b], then it takes on any given value between f(a)(a) and f(b)(b) at some point within the interval. This has two important corollaries: If a continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval (Bolzano's theorem).[1] [2] The image of a continuous function over an interval is itself an interval.
