spaces: The intermediate value theorem is closely linked to the topological notion of connectedness and follows from the basic properties of connected sets in metric spaces and connected subsets of R in particular: If X and Y are metric spaces, f:X→Y is a continuous map, and E⊂X is a connected subset, then f(E)(E) is connected. (*) A subset E⊂R⊂ℝ is connected if and only if it satisfies the following property: x,y∈E,x<r<y⟹r∈E,y,<r<y. (**) In fact, connectedness is a topological property and (*) generalizes to topological spaces: If X and Y are topological spaces, f:X→Y is a continuous map, and X is a connected space, then f(X)(X) is connected. The preservation of connectedness under continuous maps can be thought of as a generalization of the intermediate value theorem, a property of real valued functions of a real variable, to continuous functions in general spaces. Recall the first version of the intermediate value theorem, stated previously: Intermediate value theorem (Version I) — Consider a closed interval I=[a,b]=[a,b] in the real numbers Rℝ and a continuous function f:I→R→ℝ. Then, if u is a real number such that min(f(a),f(b))<u<max(f(a),f(b))min(f(a),f(b))<u<max(f(a),f(b)), there exists c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) such that f(c)=u(c)=u. The intermediate value theorem is an immediate consequence of these two properties of connectedness:[14] Proof By (**), I=[a,b]=[a,b] is a connected set. It follows from (*) that the image, f(I)(I), is also connected. For convenience, assume that f(a)<f(b)(a)<f(b). Then once more invoking (**), f(a)<u<f(b)(a)<u<f(b) implies that u∈f(I)inf(I), or f(c)=u(c)=u for some c∈I. Since u≠f(a),f(b)(a),f(b), c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) must actually hold, and the desired conclusion follows. The same argument applies if f(b)<f(a)(b)<f(a), so we are done. Q.E.D. The intermediate value theorem generalizes in a natural way: Suppose that X is a connected topological space and (Y, <) is a totally ordered set equipped with the order topology, and let f : X → Y be a continuous map. If a and b are two points in X and u is a point in Y lying between f(a) and f(b) with respect to <, then there exists c in X such that f(c) = u. The original theorem is recovered by noting that R is connected and that its natural topology is the order topology. The Brouwer fixed-point theorem is a related theorem that, in one dimension, gives a special case of the intermediate value theorem. In constructive
