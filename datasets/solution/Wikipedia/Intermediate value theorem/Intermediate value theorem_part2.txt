Motivation: The intermediate value theorem This captures an intuitive property of continuous functions over the real numbers: given f continuous on [1,2][1,2] with the known values f(1)=3(1)=3 and f(2)=5(2)=5, then the graph of y=f(x)=f(x) must pass through the horizontal line y=4=4 while x moves from 11 to 22. It represents the idea that the graph of a continuous function on a closed interval can be drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper.
