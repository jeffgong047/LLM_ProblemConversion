mathematics: In constructive mathematics, the intermediate value theorem is not true. Instead, one has to weaken the conclusion: Let a and b be real numbers and f:[a,b]→R:[a,b] be a pointwise continuous function from the closed interval [a,b][a,b] to the real line, and suppose that f(a)<0(a)<0 and 0<f(b)0<f(b). Then for every positive number ε>0ε>0 there exists a point x in the unit interval such that |f(x)|<ε(x)|<ε.[15] Practical
