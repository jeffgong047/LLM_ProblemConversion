Statement: Diagram of Stewart's theorem Let a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Let d be the length of a cevian to the side of length a. If the cevian divides the side of length a into two segments of length m and n, with m adjacent to c and n adjacent to b, then Stewart's theorem states that b2m+c2n=a(d2+mn).^2m+c^2n=a(d^2+mn). A common mnemonic used by students to memorize this equation (after rearranging the terms) is: man+dadAmanandhisdad=bmb+cncputabombinthesink.Amanandhisdadman=putabombinthesink.bmb The theorem may be written more symmetrically using signed lengths of segments. That is, take the length AB to be positive or negative according to whether A is to the left or right of B in some fixed orientation of the line. In this formulation, the theorem states that if A, B, C are collinear points, and P is any point, then (PA¯2⋅BC¯)+(PB¯2⋅CA¯)+(PC¯2⋅AB¯)+(AB¯⋅BC¯⋅CA¯)=0.(PA^2·BC)+(PB^2·CA)+(PC^2·AB)+(AB·BC·CA)=0.[2] In the special case that the cevian is the median (that is, it divides the opposite side into two segments of equal length), the result is known as Apollonius' theorem.
