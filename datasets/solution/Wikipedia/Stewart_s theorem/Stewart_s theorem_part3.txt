Proof: The theorem can be proved as an application of the law of cosines.[3] Let θ be the angle between m and d and θ' the angle between n and d. Then θ' is the supplement of θ, and so cos θ' = −cos θ. Applying the law of cosines in the two small triangles using angles θ and θ' produces c2=m2+d2−2dmcos⁡θ,b2=n2+d2−2dncos⁡θ′=n2+d2+2dncos⁡θ.c^2 =m^2+d^2-2dmcosθ, b^2 =n^2+d^2-2dncosθ' =n^2+d^2+2dncosθ. Multiplying the first equation by n and the third equation by m and adding them eliminates cos θ. One obtains b2m+c2n=nm2+n2m+(m+n)d2=(m+n)(mn+d2)=a(mn+d2),b^2m+c^2n =nm^2+n^2m+(m+n)d^2 =(m+n)(mn+d^2) =a(mn+d^2), which is the required equation. Alternatively, the theorem can be proved by drawing a perpendicular from the vertex of the triangle to the base and using the Pythagorean theorem to write the distances b, c, d in terms of the altitude. The left and right hand sides of the equation then reduce algebraically to the same expression.[2]
