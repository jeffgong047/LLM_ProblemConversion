Generalizations: Broer (2007) gave an extension of the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem to positive characteristic. There has been much work on the question of when a reductive algebraic group acting on a vector space has a polynomial ring of invariants. In the case when the algebraic group is simple all cases when the invariant ring is polynomial have been classified by Schwarz (1978) In general, the ring of invariants of a finite group acting linearly on a complex vector space is Cohen-Macaulay, so it is a finite rank free module over a polynomial subring.
