theorem: Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K and let G be a finite subgroup of the general linear group GL(V). An element s of GL(V) is called a pseudoreflection if it fixes a codimension 1 subspace of V and is not the identity transformation I, or equivalently, if the kernel Ker (s − I) has codimension one in V. Assume that the order of G is relatively prime to the characteristic of K (the so-called non-modular case). Then the following properties are equivalent:[1] (A) The group G is generated by pseudoreflections. (B) The algebra of invariants K[V]G is a (free) polynomial algebra. (B′) The algebra of invariants K[V]G is a regular ring. (C) The algebra K[V] is a free module over K[V]G. (C′) The algebra K[V] is a projective module over K[V]G. In the case when the field K is the field C of complex numbers, the first condition is usually stated as "G is a complex reflection group". Shephard and Todd derived a full classification of such groups.
