M3: In 1965, Novikov proved the compact leaf theorem for any M3: Theorem: Let M3 be a closed 3-manifold with a smooth codimension-one foliation F. Suppose any of the following conditions is satisfied: the fundamental group π1(M3)π_1(M^3) is finite, the second homotopy group π2(M3)≠0π_2(M^3)≠0, there exists a leaf L∈F such that the map π1(L)→π1(M3)π_1(L)→π_1(M^3) induced by inclusion has a non-trivial kernel. Then F has a compact leaf of genus g ≤ 1. In terms of covering spaces: A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf.
