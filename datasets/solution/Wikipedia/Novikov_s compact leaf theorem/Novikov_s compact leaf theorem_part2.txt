S3: Theorem: A smooth codimension-one foliation of the 3-sphere S3 has a compact leaf. The leaf is a torus T2 bounding a solid torus with the Reeb foliation. The theorem was proved by Sergei Novikov in 1964. Earlier Charles Ehresmann had conjectured that every smooth codimension-one foliation on S3 had a compact leaf, which was known to be true for all known examples; in particular, the Reeb foliation has a compact leaf that is T2. Novikov's compact leaf theorem for any
