symmetry: The theorem does not apply to a theory of massless particles, with these allowing for conformal symmetry as an additional spacetime dependent symmetry.[10] In particular, the algebra of this group is the conformal algebra, which consists of the Poincar√© algebra together with the commutation relations for the dilaton generator and the special conformal transformations generator.
