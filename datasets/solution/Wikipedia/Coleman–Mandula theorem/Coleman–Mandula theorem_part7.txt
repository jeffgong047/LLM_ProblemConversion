dimensions: In a one or two dimensional theory the only possible scattering is forwards and backwards scattering so analyticity of the scattering angles is no longer possible and the theorem no longer holds. Spacetime dependent internal symmetries are then possible, such as in the massive Thirring model which can admit an infinite tower of conserved charges of ever higher tensorial rank.[12] Quantum
