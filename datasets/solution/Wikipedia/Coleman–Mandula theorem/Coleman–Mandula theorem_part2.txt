History: In the early 1960s, the global SU(3)SU(3) symmetry associated with the eightfold way was shown to successfully describe the hadron spectrum for hadrons of the same spin. This led to efforts to expand the global SU(3)SU(3) symmetry to a larger SU(6)SU(6) symmetry mixing both flavour and spin, an idea similar to that previously considered in nuclear physics by Eugene Wigner in 1937 for an SU(4)SU(4) symmetry.[2] This non-relativistic SU(6)SU(6) model united vector and pseudoscalar mesons of different spin into a 35-dimensional multiplet and it also united the two baryon decuplets into a 56-dimensional multiplet.[3] While this was reasonably successful in describing various aspects of the hadron spectrum, from the perspective of quantum chromodynamics this success is merely a consequence of the flavour and spin independence of the force between quarks. There were many attempts to generalize this non-relativistic SU(6)SU(6) model into a fully relativistic one, but these all failed. At the time it was also an open question whether there existed a symmetry for which particles of different masses could belong to the same multiplet. Such a symmetry could then account for the mass splitting found in mesons and baryons.[4] It was only later understood that this is instead a consequence of the breakdown of the SU(3)SU(3) internal symmetry. These two motivations led to a series of no-go theorems to show that spacetime symmetries and internal symmetries could not be combined in any but a trivial way.[5] The first notable theorem was proved by William McGlinn in 1964,[6] with a subsequent generalization by Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh in 1965.[7] These efforts culminated with the most general theorem by Sidney Coleman and Jeffrey Mandula in 1967. Little notice was given to this theorem in subsequent years. As a result, the theorem played no role in the early development of supersymmetry, which instead emerged in the early 1970s from the study of dual resonance models, which are the precursor to string theory, rather than from any attempts to overcome the no-go theorem.[8] Similarly, the Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem, a supersymmetric generalization of the Coleman–Mandula theorem, was proved in 1975 after the study of supersymmetry was already underway.[9]
