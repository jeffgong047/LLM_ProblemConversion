Supersymmetry: The Coleman–Mandula theorem assumes that the only symmetry algebras are Lie algebras, but the theorem can be generalized by instead considering Lie superalgebras. Doing this allows for additional anticommutating generators known as supercharges which transform as spinors under Lorentz transformations. This extension gives rise to the super-Poincaré algebra, with the associated symmetry known as supersymmetry. The Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem is the generalization of the Coleman–Mandula theorem to Lie superalgebras, with it stating that supersymmetry is the only new spacetime dependent symmetry that is allowed. For a theory with massless particles, the theorem is again evaded by conformal symmetry which can be present in addition to supersymmetry giving a superconformal algebra. Low
