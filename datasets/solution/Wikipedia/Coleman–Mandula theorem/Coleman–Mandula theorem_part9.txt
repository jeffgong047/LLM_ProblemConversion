limitations: For other spacetime symmetries besides the Poincar√© group, such as theories with a de Sitter background or non-relativistic field theories with Galilean invariance, the theorem no longer applies.[14] It also does not hold for discrete symmetries, since these are not Lie groups, or for spontaneously broken symmetries since these do not act on the S-matrix level and thus do not commute with the S-matrix.[15] See
