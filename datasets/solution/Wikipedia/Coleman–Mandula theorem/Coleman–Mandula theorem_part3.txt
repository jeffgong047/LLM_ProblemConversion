Theorem: Consider a theory that can be described by an S-matrix and that satisfies the following conditions[1] The symmetry group is a Lie group which includes the Poincaré group as a subgroup, Below any mass, there are only a finite number of particle types, Any two-particle state undergoes some reaction at almost all energies, The amplitudes for elastic two-body scattering are analytic functions of the scattering angle at almost all energies and angles, A technical assumption that the group generators are distributions in momentum space. The Coleman–Mandula theorem states that the symmetry group of this theory is necessarily a direct product of the Poincaré group and an internal symmetry group.[10] The last technical assumption is unnecessary if the theory is described by a quantum field theory and is only needed to apply the theorem in a wider context. A kinematic argument for why the theorem should hold was provided by Edward Witten.[11] The argument is that Poincaré symmetry acts as a very strong constraint on elastic scattering, leaving only the scattering angle unknown. Any additional spacetime dependent symmetry would overdetermine the amplitudes, making them nonzero only at discrete scattering angles. Since this conflicts with the assumption of the analyticity of the scattering angles, such additional spacetime dependent symmetries are ruled out.
