1: Let I:=[a,b]:=[a,b] be an interval and let f:I→R:I→ℝ be a non-decreasing function (such as an increasing function). Then for any a<x<b,<x<b, f(a)≤f(a+)≤f(x−)≤f(x+)≤f(b−)≤f(b).(a) ≤ f(a^+) ≤ f(x^-) ≤ f(x^+) ≤ f(b^-) ≤ f(b). Let α>0α>0 and let x1<x2<⋯<xn_1<x_2<⋯<x_n be n points inside I at which the jump of f is greater or equal to αα: f(xi+)−f(xi−)≥α,i=1,2,…,n(x_i^+)-f(x_i^-)≥α,ı=1,2,…,n For any i=1,2,…,n,=1,2,…,n, f(xi+)≤f(xi+1−)(x_i^+)(x_i+1^-) so that f(xi+1−)−f(xi+)≥0.(x_i+1^-)-f(x_i^+)≥0. Consequently, f(b)−f(a)≥f(xn+)−f(x1−)=∑i=1n[f(xi+)−f(xi−)]+∑i=1n−1[f(xi+1−)−f(xi+)]≥∑i=1n[f(xi+)−f(xi−)]≥nα9f(b)-f(a) (x_n^+)-f(x_1^-) =∑_i=1^n[f(x_i^+)-f(x_i^-)]+∑_i=1^n-1[f(x_i+1^-)-f(x_i^+)] ≥∑_i=1^n[f(x_i^+)-f(x_i^-)] α and hence n≤f(b)−f(a)α.≤f(b)-f(a)/α. Since f(b)−f(a)<∞(b)-f(a)<∞ we have that the number of points at which the jump is greater than αα is finite (possibly even zero). Define the following sets: S1:=x:x∈I,f(x+)−f(x−)≥1,_1:={x:x,f(x^+)-f(x^-)≥1}, Sn:=x:x∈I,1n≤f(x+)−f(x−)<1n−1,n≥2._n:={x:x,1/n(x^+)-f(x^-)<1/n-1},≥2. Each set Sn_n is finite or the empty set. The union S=⋃n=1∞Sn=⋃_n=1^∞S_n contains all points at which the jump is positive and hence contains all points of discontinuity. Since every Si,i=1,2,…_i,ı=1,2,… is at most countable, their union S is also at most countable. If f is non-increasing (or decreasing) then the proof is similar. This completes the proof of the special case where the function's domain is a closed and bounded interval. ◼▪ Proof
