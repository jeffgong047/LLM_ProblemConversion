Definitions: Denote the limit from the left by f(x−):=limz↗xf(z)=limh>0h→0f(x−h)(x^-):=lim_zf(z)=lim_h→0h>0f(x-h) and denote the limit from the right by f(x+):=limz↘xf(z)=limh>0h→0f(x+h).(x^+):=lim_zf(z)=lim_h→0h>0f(x+h). If f(x+)(x^+) and f(x−)(x^-) exist and are finite then the difference f(x+)−f(x−)(x^+)-f(x^-) is called the jump[3] of f at x.. Consider a real-valued function f of real variable x defined in a neighborhood of a point x.. If f is discontinuous at the point x then the discontinuity will be a removable discontinuity, or an essential discontinuity, or a jump discontinuity (also called a discontinuity of the first kind).[4] If the function is continuous at x then the jump at x is zero. Moreover, if f is not continuous at x,, the jump can be zero at x if f(x+)=f(x−)≠f(x).(x^+)=f(x^-)(x). Precise
