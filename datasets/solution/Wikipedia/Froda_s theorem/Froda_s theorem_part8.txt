case: Suppose that the domain of f (a monotone real-valued function) is equal to a union of countably many closed and bounded intervals; say its domain is ⋃n[an,bn]⋃_n[a_n,b_n] (no requirements are placed on these closed and bounded intervals[a]). It follows from the special case proved above that for every index n,, the restriction f|[an,bn]:[an,bn]→R|_[a_n,b_n]:[a_n,b_n]→ℝ of f to the interval [an,bn][a_n,b_n] has at most countably many discontinuities; denote this (countable) set of discontinuities by Dn._n. If f has a discontinuity at a point x0∈⋃n[an,bn]_0∈⋃_n[a_n,b_n] in its domain then either x0_0 is equal to an endpoint of one of these intervals (that is, x0∈a1,b1,a2,b2,…_0∈{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,…}) or else there exists some index n such that an<x0<bn,_n<x_0<b_n, in which case x0_0 must be a point of discontinuity for f|[an,bn]|_[a_n,b_n] (that is, x0∈Dn_0_n). Thus the set D of all points of at which f is discontinuous is a subset of a1,b1,a2,b2,…∪⋃nDn,{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,…}∪⋃_nD_n, which is a countable set (because it is a union of countably many countable sets) so that its subset D must also be countable (because every subset of a countable set is countable). In particular, because every interval (including open intervals and half open/closed intervals) of real numbers can be written as a countable union of closed and bounded intervals, it follows that any monotone real-valued function defined on an interval has at most countable many discontinuities. To make this argument more concrete, suppose that the domain of f is an interval I that is not closed and bounded (and hence by Heine–Borel theorem not compact). Then the interval can be written as a countable union of closed and bounded intervals In_n with the property that any two consecutive intervals have an endpoint in common: I=∪n=1∞In.=∪_n=1^∞I_n. If I=(a,b]witha≥−∞=(a,b]witha≥-∞ then I1=[α1,b],I2=[α2,α1],…,In=[αn,αn−1],…_1=[α_1,b],_2=[α_2,α_1],…,I_n=[α_n,α_n-1],… where (αn)n=1∞(α_n)_n=1^∞ is a strictly decreasing sequence such that αn→a.α_n. In a similar way if I=[a,b),withb≤+∞=[a,b),withb≤+∞ or if I=(a,b)with−∞≤a<b≤∞.=(a,b)with-∞<b≤∞. In any interval In,_n, there are at most countable many points of discontinuity, and since a countable union of at most countable sets is at most countable, it follows that the set of all discontinuities is at most countable. ◼▪ Jump
