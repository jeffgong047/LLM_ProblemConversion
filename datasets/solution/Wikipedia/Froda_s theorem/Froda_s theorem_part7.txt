2: So let f:[a,b]→R:[a,b]→ℝ is a monotone function and let D denote the set of all points d∈[a,b]∈[a,b] in the domain of f at which f is discontinuous (which is necessarily a jump discontinuity). Because f has a jump discontinuity at d∈D,, f(d−)≠f(d+)(d^-)(d^+) so there exists some rational number yd∈Q_d∈ℚ that lies strictly in between f(d−)andf(d+)(d^-)andf(d^+) (specifically, if f↗↗ then pick yd∈Q_d∈ℚ so that f(d−)<yd<f(d+)(d^-)<y_d<f(d^+) while if f↘↘ then pick yd∈Q_d∈ℚ so that f(d−)>yd>f(d+)(d^-)>y_d>f(d^+) holds). It will now be shown that if d,e∈D,e are distinct, say with d<e,<e, then yd≠ye._d_e. If f↗↗ then d<e<e implies f(d+)≤f(e−)(d^+)(e^-) so that yd<f(d+)≤f(e−)<ye._d<f(d^+)(e^-)<y_e. If on the other hand f↘↘ then d<e<e implies f(d+)≥f(e−)(d^+)(e^-) so that yd>f(d+)≥f(e−)>ye._d>f(d^+)(e^-)>y_e. Either way, yd≠ye._d_e. Thus every d∈D is associated with a unique rational number (said differently, the map D→Q→ℚ defined by d↦yd_d is injective). Since Qℚ is countable, the same must be true of D.. ◼▪ Proof of general
