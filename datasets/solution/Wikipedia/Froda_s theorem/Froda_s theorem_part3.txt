statement: Let f be a real-valued monotone function defined on an interval I.. Then the set of discontinuities of the first kind is at most countable. One can prove[5][3] that all points of discontinuity of a monotone real-valued function defined on an interval are jump discontinuities and hence, by our definition, of the first kind. With this remark the theorem takes the stronger form: Let f be a monotone function defined on an interval I.. Then the set of discontinuities is at most countable.
