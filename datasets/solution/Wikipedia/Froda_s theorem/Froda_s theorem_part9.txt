functions: Examples. Let x1 < x2 < x3 < ⋅⋅⋅ be a countable subset of the compact interval [a,b] and let μ1, μ2, μ3, ... be a positive sequence with finite sum. Set f(x)=∑n=1∞μnχ[xn,b](x)(x)=∑_n=1^∞μ_nχ_[x_n,b](x) where χA denotes the characteristic function of a compact interval A. Then f is a non-decreasing function on [a,b], which is continuous except for jump discontinuities at xn for n ≥ 1. In the case of finitely many jump discontinuities, f is a step function. The examples above are generalised step functions; they are very special cases of what are called jump functions or saltus-functions.[8][9] More generally, the analysis of monotone functions has been studied by many mathematicians, starting from Abel, Jordan and Darboux. Following Riesz & Sz.-Nagy (1990), replacing a function by its negative if necessary, only the case of non-negative non-decreasing functions has to be considered. The domain [a,b] can be finite or have ∞ or −∞ as endpoints. The main task is to construct monotone functions — generalising step functions — with discontinuities at a given denumerable set of points and with prescribed left and right discontinuities at each of these points. Let xn (n ≥ 1) lie in (a, b) and take λ1, λ2, λ3, ... and μ1, μ2, μ3, ... non-negative with finite sum and with λn + μn > 0 for each n. Define fn(x)=0_n(x)=0 for x<xn,fn(xn)=λn,fn(x)=λn+μn x<x_n, f_n(x_n)=λ_n, f_n(x)=λ_n+μ_n for x>xn. x>x_n. Then the jump function, or saltus-function, defined by f(x)=∑n=1∞fn(x)=∑xn≤xλn+∑xn<xμn,(x)= ∑_n=1^∞f_n(x)= ∑_x_nλ_n+∑_x_n<xμ_n, is non-decreasing on [a, b] and is continuous except for jump discontinuities at xn for n ≥ 1.[10][11][12][13] To prove this, note that sup |fn| = λn + μn, so that Σ fn converges uniformly to f. Passing to the limit, it follows that f(xn)−f(xn−0)=λn,f(xn+0)−f(xn)=μn,(x_n)-f(x_n-0)=λ_n, f(x_n+0)-f(x_n)=μ_n, and f(x±0)=f(x) f(x±0)=f(x) if x is not one of the xn's.[10] Conversely, by a differentiation theorem of Lebesgue, the jump function f is uniquely determined by the properties:[14] (1) being non-decreasing and non-positive; (2) having given jump data at its points of discontinuity xn; (3) satisfying the boundary condition f(a) = 0; and (4) having zero derivative almost everywhere. Proof that a jump function has zero derivative almost everywhere. Property (4) can be checked following Riesz & Sz.-Nagy (1990), Rubel (1963) and Komornik (2016). Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that f is a non-negative jump function defined on the compact [a,b], with discontinuities only in (a,b). Note that an open set U of (a,b) is canonically the disjoint union of at most countably many open intervals Im; that allows the total length to be computed ℓ(U)= Σ ℓ(Im). Recall that a null set A is a subset such that, for any arbitrarily small ε' > 0, there is an open U containing A with ℓ(U) < ε'. A crucial property of length is that, if U and V are open in (a,b), then ℓ(U) + ℓ(V) = ℓ(U ∪ V) + ℓ(U ∩ V).[15] It implies immediately that the union of two null sets is null; and that a finite or countable set is null.[16][17] Proposition 1. For c > 0 and a normalised non-negative jump function f, let Uc(f) be the set of points x such that f(t)−f(s)t−s>cf(t)-f(s)-s>c for some s, t with s < x < t. Then Uc(f) is open and has total length ℓ(Uc(f)) ≤ 4 c–1 (f(b) – f(a)). Note that Uc(f) consists the points x where the slope of h is greater that c near x. By definition Uc(f) is an open subset of (a, b), so can be written as a disjoint union of at most countably many open intervals Ik = (ak, bk). Let Jk be an interval with closure in Ik and ℓ(Jk) = ℓ(Ik)/2. By compactness, there are finitely many open intervals of the form (s,t) covering the closure of Jk. On the other hand, it is elementary that, if three fixed bounded open intervals have a common point of intersection, then their union contains one of the three intervals: indeed just take the supremum and infimum points to identify the endpoints. As a result, the finite cover can be taken as adjacent open intervals (sk,1,tk,1), (sk,2,tk,2), ... only intersecting at consecutive intervals.[18] Hence ℓ(Jk)≤∑m(tk,m−sk,m)≤∑mc−1(f(tk,m)−f(sk,m))≤2c−1(f(bk)−f(ak)).ℓ(J_k)≤∑_m(t_k,m-s_k,m)≤∑_mc^-1(f(t_k,m)-f(s_k,m))≤2c^-1(f(b_k)-f(a_k)). Finally sum both sides over k.[16][17] Proposition 2. If f is a jump function, then f '(x) = 0 almost everywhere. To prove this, define Df(x)=limsups,t→x,s<x<tf(t)−f(s)t−s,(x)=lim sup_s,t, s<x<tf(t)-f(s)-s, a variant of the Dini derivative of f. It will suffice to prove that for any fixed c > 0, the Dini derivative satisfies Df(x) ≤ c almost everywhere, i.e. on a null set. Choose ε > 0, arbitrarily small. Starting from the definition of the jump function f = Σ fn, write f = g + h with g = Σn≤N fn and h = Σn>N fn where N ≥ 1. Thus g is a step function having only finitely many discontinuities at xn for n ≤ N and h is a non-negative jump function. It follows that Df = g' +Dh = Dh except at the N points of discontinuity of g. Choosing N sufficiently large so that Σn>N λn + μn < ε, it follows that h is a jump function such that h(b) − h(a) < ε and Dh ≤ c off an open set with length less than 4ε/c. By construction Df ≤ c off an open set with length less than 4ε/c. Now set ε' = 4ε/c — then ε' and c are arbitrarily small and Df ≤ c off an open set of length less than ε'. Thus Df ≤ c almost everywhere. Since c could be taken arbitrarily small, Df and hence also f ' must vanish almost everywhere.[16][17] As explained in Riesz & Sz.-Nagy (1990), every non-decreasing non-negative function F can be decomposed uniquely as a sum of a jump function f and a continuous monotone function g: the jump function f is constructed by using the jump data of the original monotone function F and it is easy to check that g = F − f is continuous and monotone.[10] See
