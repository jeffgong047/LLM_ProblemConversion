II: Proposition II with risky debt. As leverage (D/E) increases, the WACC (k0) stays constant. rE=r0+DE(r0âˆ’rD)_E=r_0+D/E(r_0-r_D) where rE_E is the expected rate of return on equity of a leveraged firm, or cost of equity. r0_0 is the company cost of equity capital with no leverage (unlevered cost of equity, or return on assets with D/E = 0). rD_D is the expected rate of return on borrowings, or cost of debt. DED/E is the debt-to-equity ratio. A higher debt-to-equity ratio leads to a higher required return on equity, because of the higher risk involved for equity-holders in a company with debt. The formula is derived from the theory of weighted average cost of capital (WACC). These propositions are true under the following assumptions: no transaction costs exist, and individuals and corporations borrow at the same rates. These results might seem irrelevant (after all, none of the conditions are met in the real world), but the theorem is still taught and studied because it tells something very important. That is, capital structure matters precisely because one or more of these assumptions is violated. It tells where to look for determinants of optimal capital structure and how those factors might affect optimal capital structure. With
