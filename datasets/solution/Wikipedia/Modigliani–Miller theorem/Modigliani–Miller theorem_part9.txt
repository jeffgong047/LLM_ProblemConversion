II: rE=r0+DE(r0−rD)(1−TC)_E=r_0+D/E(r_0-r_D)(1-T_C) where: rE_E is the required rate of return on equity, or cost of levered equity = unlevered equity + financing premium. r0_0 is the company cost of equity capital with no leverage (unlevered cost of equity, or return on assets with D/E = 0). rD_D is the required rate of return on borrowings, or cost of debt. D/ED/E is the debt-to-equity ratio. Tc_c is the tax rate. The same relationship as earlier described stating that the cost of equity rises with leverage, because the risk to equity rises, still holds. The formula, however, has implications for the difference with the WACC. Their second attempt on capital structure included taxes has identified that as the level of gearing increases by replacing equity with cheap debt the level of the WACC drops and an optimal capital structure does indeed exist at a point where debt is 100%. The following assumptions are made in the propositions with taxes: corporations are taxed at the rate TC_C on earnings after interest, no transaction costs exist, and individuals and corporations borrow at the same rate.
