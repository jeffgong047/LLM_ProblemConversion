I: VL=VU+TCD_L=V_U+T_CD where VL_L is the value of a levered firm. VU_U is the value of an unlevered firm. TCD_CD is the tax rate (TC_C) x the value of debt (D)" Derivation of TCD_CD- Amount of Annual Interest= Debt x Interest Rate Annual Tax Shield= Debt x Interest Rate x Tax Rate Capitalisation Value (Perpetual Firm) = (Debt ร Interest Rate x Tax Rate) รท Cost of Debt the term TCD_CD assumes debt is perpetual This means that there are advantages for firms to be levered, since corporations can deduct interest payments. Therefore leverage lowers tax payments. Dividend payments are non-deductible. Proposition
