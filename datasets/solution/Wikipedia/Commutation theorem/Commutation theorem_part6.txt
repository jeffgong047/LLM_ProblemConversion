Definition: A Hilbert algebra[3][13][14] is an algebra A𝔄 with involution x→x* and an inner product (,) such that (a, b) = (b*, a*) for a, b in A𝔄; left multiplication by a fixed a in A𝔄 is a bounded operator; * is the adjoint, in other words (xy, z) = (y, x*z); the linear span of all products xy is dense in A𝔄.
