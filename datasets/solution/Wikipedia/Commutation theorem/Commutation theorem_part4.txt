traces: Let M be a von Neumann algebra and M+ the set of positive operators in M. By definition,[3] a semifinite trace (or sometimes just trace) on M is a functional τ from M+ into [0, ∞] such that τ(λa+μb)=λτ(a)+μτ(b)τ(+)=λτ(a)+μτ(b) for a, b in M+ and λ, μ ≥ 0 (semilinearity); τ(uau∗)=τ(a)τ(uau^*)=τ(a) for a in M+ and u a unitary operator in M (unitary invariance); τ is completely additive on orthogonal families of projections in M (normality); each projection in M is as orthogonal direct sum of projections with finite trace (semifiniteness). If in addition τ is non-zero on every non-zero projection, then τ is called a faithful trace. If τ is a faithful trace on M, let H = L2(M, τ) be the Hilbert space completion of the inner product space M0=a∈M∣τ(a∗a)<∞_0={a|τ(a^*a)<∞} with respect to the inner product (a,b)=τ(b∗a).(a,b)=τ(b^*a). The von Neumann algebra M acts by left multiplication on H and can be identified with its image. Let Ja=a∗=a^* for a in M0. The operator J is again called the modular conjugation operator and extends to a conjugate-linear isometry of H satisfying J2 = I. The commutation theorem of Murray and von Neumann JMJ=M′=M^' is again valid in this case. This result can be proved directly by a variety of methods,[3][8] but follows immediately from the result for finite traces, by repeated use of the following elementary fact: If M1 ⊇ M2 are two von Neumann algebras such that pn M1 = pn M2 for a family of projections pn in the commutant of M1 increasing to I in the strong operator topology, then M1 = M2.
