Examples: One of the simplest cases of the commutation theorem, where it can easily be seen directly, is that of a finite group Γ acting on the finite-dimensional inner product space ℓ2(Γ)ℓ^2(Γ) by the left and right regular representations λ and ρ. These unitary representations are given by the formulas (λ(g)f)(x)=f(g−1x),(ρ(g)f)(x)=f(xg)(λ(g)f)(x)=f(g^-1x), (ρ(g)f)(x)=f(xg) for f in ℓ2(Γ)ℓ^2(Γ) and the commutation theorem implies that λ(Γ)′′=ρ(Γ)′,ρ(Γ)′′=λ(Γ)′.λ(Γ)^''=ρ(Γ)^', ρ(Γ)^''=λ(Γ)^'. The operator J is given by the formula Jf(g)=f(g−1)¯.(g)=f(g^-1). Exactly the same results remain true if Γ is allowed to be any countable discrete group.[3] The von Neumann algebra λ(Γ)' ' is usually called the group von Neumann algebra of Γ. Another important example is provided by a probability space (X, μ). The Abelian von Neumann algebra A = L∞(X, μ) acts by multiplication operators on H = L2(X, μ) and the constant function 1 is a cyclic-separating trace vector. It follows that A′=A,'=A, so that A is a maximal Abelian subalgebra of B(H), the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on H. The third class of examples combines the above two. Coming from ergodic theory, it was one of von Neumann's original motivations for studying von Neumann algebras. Let (X, μ) be a probability space and let Γ be a countable discrete group of measure-preserving transformations of (X, μ). The group therefore acts unitarily on the Hilbert space H = L2(X, μ) according to the formula Ugf(x)=f(g−1x),_gf(x)=f(g^-1x), for f in H and normalises the Abelian von Neumann algebra A = L∞(X, μ). Let H1=H⊗ℓ2(Γ),_1=H⊗ℓ^2(Γ), a tensor product of Hilbert spaces.[4] The group–measure space construction or crossed product von Neumann algebra M=A⋊Γ=A⋊Γ is defined to be the von Neumann algebra on H1 generated by the algebra A⊗I and the normalising operators Ug⊗λ(g)_g⊗λ(g).[5] The vector Ω=1⊗δ1Ω=1⊗δ_1 is a cyclic-separating trace vector. Moreover the modular conjugation operator J and commutant M ' can be explicitly identified. One of the most important cases of the group–measure space construction is when Γ is the group of integers Z, i.e. the case of a single invertible measurable transformation T. Here T must preserve the probability measure μ. Semifinite traces are required to handle the case when T (or more generally Γ) only preserves an infinite equivalent measure; and the full force of the Tomita–Takesaki theory is required when there is no invariant measure in the equivalence class, even though the equivalence class of the measure is preserved by T (or Γ).[6][7] Commutation theorem for semifinite
