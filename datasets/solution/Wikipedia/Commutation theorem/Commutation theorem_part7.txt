Examples: The Hilbert–Schmidt operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space form a Hilbert algebra with inner product (a, b) = Tr (b*a). If (X, μ) is an infinite measure space, the algebra L∞ (X) ∩∩ L2(X) is a Hilbert algebra with the usual inner product from L2(X). If M is a von Neumann algebra with faithful semifinite trace τ, then the *-subalgebra M0 defined above is a Hilbert algebra with inner product (a, b) = τ(b*a). If G is a unimodular locally compact group, the convolution algebra L1(G)∩∩L2(G) is a Hilbert algebra with the usual inner product from L2(G). If (G, K) is a Gelfand pair, the convolution algebra L1(K\G/K)∩∩L2(K\G/K) is a Hilbert algebra with the usual inner product from L2(G); here Lp(K\G/K) denotes the closed subspace of K-biinvariant functions in Lp(G). Any dense *-subalgebra of a Hilbert algebra is also a Hilbert algebra.
