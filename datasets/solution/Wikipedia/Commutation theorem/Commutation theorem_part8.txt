Properties: Let H be the Hilbert space completion of A𝔄 with respect to the inner product and let J denote the extension of the involution to a conjugate-linear involution of H. Define a representation λ and an anti-representation ρ of A𝔄 on itself by left and right multiplication: λ(a)x=ax,ρ(a)x=xa.λ(a)x=ax, ρ(a)x=xa. These actions extend continuously to actions on H. In this case the commutation theorem for Hilbert algebras states that λ(A)′′=ρ(A)′λ(𝔄)^''=ρ(𝔄)^' Moreover if M=λ(A)′′,=λ(𝔄)^'', the von Neumann algebra generated by the operators λ(a), then JMJ=M′=M^' These results were proved independently by Godement (1954) and Segal (1953). The proof relies on the notion of "bounded elements" in the Hilbert space completion H. An element of x in H is said to be bounded (relative to A𝔄) if the map a → xa of A𝔄 into H extends to a bounded operator on H, denoted by λ(x). In this case it is straightforward to prove that:[15] Jx is also a bounded element, denoted x*, and λ(x*) = λ(x)*; a → ax is given by the bounded operator ρ(x) = Jλ(x*)J on H; M ' is generated by the ρ(x)'s with x bounded; λ(x) and ρ(y) commute for x, y bounded. The commutation theorem follows immediately from the last assertion. In particular M=λ(B)″.=λ(𝔅)”. The space of all bounded elements B𝔅 forms a Hilbert algebra containing A𝔄 as a dense *-subalgebra. It is said to be completed or full because any element in H bounded relative to B𝔅 must actually already lie in B𝔅. The functional τ on M+ defined by τ(x)=(a,a)τ(x)=(a,a) if x = λ(a)*λ(a) and ∞ otherwise, yields a faithful semifinite trace on M with M0=B._0=𝔅. Thus: There is a one-one correspondence between von Neumann algebras on H with faithful semifinite trace and full Hilbert algebras with Hilbert space completion H. See
