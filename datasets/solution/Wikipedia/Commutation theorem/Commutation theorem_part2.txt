traces: Let H be a Hilbert space and M a von Neumann algebra on H with a unit vector Ω such that M Ω is dense in H M ' Ω is dense in H, where M ' denotes the commutant of M (abΩ, Ω) = (baΩ, Ω) for all a, b in M. The vector Ω is called a cyclic-separating trace vector. It is called a trace vector because the last condition means that the matrix coefficient corresponding to Ω defines a tracial state on M. It is called cyclic since Ω generates H as a topological M-module. It is called separating because if aΩ = 0 for a in M, then aM'Ω= (0), and hence a = 0. It follows that the map JaΩ=a∗ΩΩ=a^*Ω for a in M defines a conjugate-linear isometry of H with square the identity, J2 = I. The operator J is usually called the modular conjugation operator. It is immediately verified that JMJ and M commute on the subspace M Ω, so that[1] JMJ⊆M′.^'. The commutation theorem of Murray and von Neumann states that JMJ=M′=M^' One of the easiest ways to see this[2] is to introduce K, the closure of the real subspace Msa Ω, where Msa denotes the self-adjoint elements in M. It follows that H=K⊕iK,=K, an orthogonal direct sum for the real part of the inner product. This is just the real orthogonal decomposition for the ±1 eigenspaces of J. On the other hand for a in Msa and b in M'sa, the inner product (abΩ, Ω) is real, because ab is self-adjoint. Hence K is unaltered if M is replaced by M '. In particular Ω is a trace vector for M' and J is unaltered if M is replaced by M '. So the opposite inclusion JM′J⊆M^'J follows by reversing the roles of M and M'.
