statement: For an interval [a, b], let f:[a,b]→C:[a,b]→ℂ be a measurable function. Then, for every ε > 0, there exists a compact E ⊆ [a, b] such that f restricted to E is continuous and μ(E)>b−a−ε.μ(E)>b-a-ε. Note that E inherits the subspace topology from [a, b]; continuity of f restricted to E is defined using this topology. Also for any function f, defined on the interval [a, b] and almost-everywhere finite, if for any ε > 0 there is a function ϕ, continuous on [a, b], such that the measure of the set x∈[a,b]:f(x)≠ϕ(x){x∈[a,b]:f(x)≠ϕ(x)} is less than ε, then f is measurable.[1] General
