form: Let (X,Σ,μ)(X,Σ,μ) be a Radon measure space and Y be a second-countable topological space equipped with a Borel algebra, and let f:X→Y:X be a measurable function. Given ε>0ε>0, for every A∈Σ∈Σ of finite measure there is a closed set E with μ(A∖E)<εμ(A)<ε such that f restricted to E is continuous. On the
