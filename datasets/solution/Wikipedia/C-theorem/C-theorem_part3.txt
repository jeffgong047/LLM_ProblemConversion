A-theorem: John Cardy in 1988 considered the possibility to generalise C-theorem to higher-dimensional quantum field theory. He conjectured[2] that in four spacetime dimensions, the quantity behaving monotonically under renormalization group flows, and thus playing the role analogous to the central charge c in two dimensions, is a certain anomaly coefficient which came to be denoted as a. For this reason, the analog of the C-theorem in four dimensions is called the A-theorem. In perturbation theory, that is for renormalization flows which do not deviate much from free theories, the A-theorem in four dimensions was proved by Hugh Osborn[3] using the local renormalization group equation. However, the problem of finding a proof valid beyond perturbation theory remained open for many years. In 2011, Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer of the Weizmann Institute of Science proposed a nonperturbative proof for the A-theorem, which has gained acceptance.[4][5] (Still, simultaneous monotonic and cyclic (limit cycle) or even chaotic RG flows are compatible with such flow functions when multivalued in the couplings, as evinced in specific systems.[6]) RG flows of theories in 4 dimensions and the question of whether scale invariance implies conformal invariance, is a field of active research and not all questions are settled.
