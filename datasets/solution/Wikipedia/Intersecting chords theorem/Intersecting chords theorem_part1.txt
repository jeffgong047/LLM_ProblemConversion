Geometry theorem relating the line segments created by intersecting chords in a circle |AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD||AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD| |AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|=(r+d)⋅(r−d)=r2−d2 |AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD| = (r+d)·(r-d)=r^2-d^2 △ASD∼△BSC∼ In Euclidean geometry, the intersecting chords theorem, or just the chord theorem, is a statement that describes a relation of the four line segments created by two intersecting chords within a circle. It states that the products of the lengths of the line segments on each chord are equal. It is Proposition 35 of Book 3 of Euclid's Elements. More precisely, for two chords AC and BD intersecting in a point S the following equation holds: |AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD||AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD| The converse is true as well, that is if for two line segments AC and BD intersecting in S the equation above holds true, then their four endpoints A, B, C, D lie on a common circle. Or in other words, if the diagonals of a quadrilateral ABCD intersect in S and fulfill the equation above, then it is a cyclic quadrilateral. The value of the two products in the chord theorem depends only on the distance of the intersection point S from the circle's center and is called the absolute value of the power of S; more precisely, it can be stated that: |AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|=r2−d2|AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|=r^2-d^2 where r is the radius of the circle, and d is the distance between the center of the circle and the intersection point S. This property follows directly from applying the chord theorem to a third chord going through S and the circle's center M (see drawing). The theorem can be proven using similar triangles (via the inscribed-angle theorem). Consider the angles of the triangles △ASD and △BSC: ∠ADS=∠BCS(inscribedanglesoverAB)∠DAS=∠CBS(inscribedanglesoverCD)∠ASD=∠BSC(opposingangles) = (inscribedanglesoverAB) = (inscribedanglesoverCD) = (opposingangles) This means the triangles △ASD and △BSC are similar and therefore ASSD=BSSC⇔|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|AS/SD=BS/SC⇔|AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD| Next to the tangent-secant theorem and the intersecting secants theorem the intersecting chords theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle - the power of point theorem.
