In mathematics, the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a C1^1 function φ(x,y)φ(x,y) (called the Dulac function) such that the expression

According to Dulac theorem any 2D autonomous system with a periodic orbit has a region with positive and a region with negative divergence inside such orbit. Here represented by red and green regions respectively
∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y∂()/+∂()/
has the same sign (≠0≠0) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system

dxdt=f(x,y),dx/dt=f(x,y),
dydt=g(x,y)dy/dt=g(x,y)
has no nonconstant periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.[1] "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line.
The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1923 using Green's theorem.

Proof[edit]
Without loss of generality, let there exist a function φ(x,y)φ(x,y) such that

∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y>0∂()/+∂()/>0
in simply connected region R. Let C be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in R. Let D be the interior of C. Then by Green's theorem,

∬D(∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y)dxdy=∮C(−φgdx+φfdy)=∮Cφ(−y˙dx+x˙dy).   ∬_D(∂()/+∂()/) dx dy=∮_C(- dx+ dy)
=   ∮_Cφ(-ẏ dx+ẋ dy).
Because of the constant sign, the left-hand integral in the previous line must evaluate to a positive number. But on C, dx=x˙dt=ẋ dt and dy=y˙dt=ẏ dt, so the bottom integrand is in fact 0 everywhere and for this reason the right-hand integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory C.
