In mathematics, the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a C1^1 function φ(x,y)φ(x,y) (called the Dulac function) such that the expression According to Dulac theorem any 2D autonomous system with a periodic orbit has a region with positive and a region with negative divergence inside such orbit. Here represented by red and green regions respectively ∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y∂()/+∂()/ has the same sign (≠0≠0) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system dxdt=f(x,y),dx/dt=f(x,y), dydt=g(x,y)dy/dt=g(x,y) has no nonconstant periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.[1] "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line. The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1923 using Green's theorem.
