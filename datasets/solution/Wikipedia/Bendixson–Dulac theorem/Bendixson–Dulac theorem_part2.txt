Proof: Without loss of generality, let there exist a function φ(x,y)φ(x,y) such that ∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y>0∂()/+∂()/>0 in simply connected region R. Let C be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in R. Let D be the interior of C. Then by Green's theorem, ∬D(∂(φf)∂x+∂(φg)∂y)dxdy=∮C(−φgdx+φfdy)=∮Cφ(−y˙dx+x˙dy). ∬_D(∂()/+∂()/) dx dy=∮_C(- dx+ dy) = ∮_Cφ(-ẏ dx+ẋ dy). Because of the constant sign, the left-hand integral in the previous line must evaluate to a positive number. But on C, dx=x˙dt=ẋ dt and dy=y˙dt=ẏ dt, so the bottom integrand is in fact 0 everywhere and for this reason the right-hand integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory C.
