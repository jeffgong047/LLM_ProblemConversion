statement: Specifically, Sophie Germain proved that at least one of the numbers x, y, z must be divisible by p2^2 if an auxiliary prime q can be found such that two conditions are satisfied: No two nonzero pth^th powers differ by one modulo q; and p is itself not a pth^th power modulo q. Conversely, the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (the case in which p does not divide xyz) must hold for every prime p for which even one auxiliary prime can be found.
