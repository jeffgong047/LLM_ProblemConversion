On the divisibility of solutions to Fermat's Last Theorem for prime exponent
In number theory, Sophie Germain's theorem is a statement about the divisibility of solutions to the equation xp+yp=zp^p+y^p=z^p of Fermat's Last Theorem for odd prime p.


Formal statement[edit]
Specifically, Sophie Germain proved that at least one of the numbers x, y, z must be divisible by p2^2 if an auxiliary prime q can be found such that two conditions are satisfied:

No two nonzero pth^th powers differ by one modulo q; and
p is itself not a pth^th power modulo q.
Conversely, the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (the case in which p does not divide xyz) must hold for every prime p for which even one auxiliary prime can be found.

History[edit]
Germain identified such an auxiliary prime q for every prime less than 100.  The theorem and its application to primes p less than 100 were attributed to Germain by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1823.[1]
