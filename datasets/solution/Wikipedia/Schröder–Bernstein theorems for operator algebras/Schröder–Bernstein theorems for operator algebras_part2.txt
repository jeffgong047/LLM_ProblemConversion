algebras: Suppose M is a von Neumann algebra and E, F are projections in M. Let ~ denote the Murray-von Neumann equivalence relation on M. Define a partial order « on the family of projections by E « F if E ~ F' ≤ F. In other words, E « F if there exists a partial isometry U ∈ M such that U*U = E and UU* ≤ F. For closed subspaces M and N where projections PM and PN, onto M and N respectively, are elements of M, M « N if PM « PN. The Schröder–Bernstein theorem states that if M « N and N « M, then M ~ N. A proof, one that is similar to a set-theoretic argument, can be sketched as follows. Colloquially, N « M means that N can be isometrically embedded in M. So M=M0⊃N0=M_0_0 where N0 is an isometric copy of N in M. By assumption, it is also true that, N, therefore N0, contains an isometric copy M1 of M. Therefore, one can write M=M0⊃N0⊃M1.=M_0_0_1. By induction, M=M0⊃N0⊃M1⊃N1⊃M2⊃N2⊃⋯.=M_0_0_1_1_2_2⊃⋯. It is clear that R=∩i≥0Mi=∩i≥0Ni.=∩_i≥0M_i=∩_i≥0N_i. Let M⊖N=defM∩(N)⊥.def=M∩(N)^⊥. So M=⊕i≥0(Mi⊖Ni)⊕⊕j≥0(Nj⊖Mj+1)⊕R=⊕_i≥0(M_i_i) ⊕ ⊕_j≥0(N_j_j+1) and N0=⊕i≥1(Mi⊖Ni)⊕⊕j≥0(Nj⊖Mj+1)⊕R._0=⊕_i≥1(M_i_i) ⊕ ⊕_j≥0(N_j_j+1) . Notice Mi⊖Ni∼M⊖Nforalli._i_i . The theorem now follows from the countable additivity of ~. Representations of
