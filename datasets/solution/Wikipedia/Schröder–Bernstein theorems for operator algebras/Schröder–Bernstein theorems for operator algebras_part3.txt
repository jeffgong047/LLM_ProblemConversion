C*-algebras: There is also an analog of Schröder–Bernstein for representations of C*-algebras. If A is a C*-algebra, a representation of A is a *-homomorphism φ from A into L(H), the bounded operators on some Hilbert space H. If there exists a projection P in L(H) where P φ(a) = φ(a) P for every a in A, then a subrepresentation σ of φ can be defined in a natural way: σ(a) is φ(a) restricted to the range of P. So φ then can be expressed as a direct sum of two subrepresentations φ = φ' ⊕ σ. Two representations φ1 and φ2, on H1 and H2 respectively, are said to be unitarily equivalent if there exists a unitary operator U: H2 → H1 such that φ1(a)U = Uφ2(a), for every a. In this setting, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem reads: If two representations ρ and σ, on Hilbert spaces H and G respectively, are each unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of the other, then they are unitarily equivalent. A proof that resembles the previous argument can be outlined. The assumption implies that there exist surjective partial isometries from H to G and from G to H. Fix two such partial isometries for the argument. One has ρ=ρ1≃ρ1′⊕σ1whereσ1≃σ.ρ=ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕σ_1 σ_1≃σ. In turn, ρ1≃ρ1′⊕(σ1′⊕ρ2)whereρ2≃ρ.ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕(σ_1'⊕ρ_2) ρ_2≃ρ. By induction, ρ1≃ρ1′⊕σ1′⊕ρ2′⊕σ2′⋯≃(⊕i≥1ρi′)⊕(⊕i≥1σi′),ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕σ_1'⊕ρ_2'⊕σ_2'⋯≃(⊕_i≥1ρ_i')⊕(⊕_i≥1σ_i'), and σ1≃σ1′⊕ρ2′⊕σ2′⋯≃(⊕i≥2ρi′)⊕(⊕i≥1σi′).σ_1≃σ_1'⊕ρ_2'⊕σ_2'⋯≃(⊕_i≥2ρ_i')⊕(⊕_i≥1σ_i'). Now each additional summand in the direct sum expression is obtained using one of the two fixed partial isometries, so ρi′≃ρj′andσi′≃σj′foralli,j.ρ_i'≃ρ_j' σ_i'≃σ_j' ,j . This proves the theorem. See
