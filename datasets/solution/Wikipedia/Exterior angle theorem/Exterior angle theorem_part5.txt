theorem: The high school exterior angle theorem (HSEAT) says that the size of an exterior angle at a vertex of a triangle equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle (remote interior angles). So, in the picture, the size of angle ACD equals the size of angle ABC plus the size of angle CAB. The HSEAT is logically equivalent to the Euclidean statement that the sum of angles of a triangle is 180°. If it is known that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180°, then the HSEAT is proved as follows: b+d=180∘+d=180^∘ b+d=b+a+c+d=b+a+c ∴d=a+c.=a+c. On the other hand, if the HSEAT is taken as a true statement then: d=a+c=a+c b+d=180∘+d=180^∘ ∴b+a+c=180∘.+a+c=180^∘. Illustration of proof of the HSEAT Proving that the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180°. The Euclidean proof of the HSEAT (and simultaneously the result on the sum of the angles of a triangle) starts by constructing the line parallel to side AB passing through point C and then using the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles of parallel lines to get the conclusion as in the illustration.[9] The HSEAT can be extremely useful when trying to calculate the measures of unknown angles in a triangle.
