theorem: The proof of Proposition 1.16 given by Euclid is often cited as one place where Euclid gives a flawed proof.[5][6][7] Euclid proves the exterior angle theorem by: construct the midpoint E of segment AC, draw the ray BE, construct the point F on ray BE so that E is (also) the midpoint of B and F, draw the segment FC. By congruent triangles we can conclude that ∠ BAC = ∠ ECF and ∠ ECF is smaller than ∠ ECD, ∠ ECD = ∠ ACD therefore ∠ BAC is smaller than ∠ ACD and the same can be done for the angle ∠ CBA by bisecting BC. The flaw lies in the assumption that a point (F, above) lies "inside" angle (∠ ACD). No reason is given for this assertion, but the accompanying diagram makes it look like a true statement. When a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry is used (see Foundations of geometry) this assertion of Euclid can be proved.[8] Invalidity in spherical
