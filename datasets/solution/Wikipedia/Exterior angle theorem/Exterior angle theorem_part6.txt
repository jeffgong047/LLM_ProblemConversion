Notes: ^ Henderson & Taimi≈Üa 2005, p. 110 ^ Wylie 1964, p. 101 & p. 106 ^ One line segment is considered the initial side and the other the terminal side. The angle is formed by going counterclockwise from the initial side to the terminal side. The choice of which line segment is the initial side is arbitrary, so there are two possibilities for the angle determined by the line segments. ^ This way of defining interior angles does not presuppose that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. ^ Faber 1983, p. 113 ^ Greenberg 1974, p. 99 ^ Venema 2006, p. 10 ^ Greenberg 1974, p. 99 ^ Heath 1956, Vol. 1, p. 316
