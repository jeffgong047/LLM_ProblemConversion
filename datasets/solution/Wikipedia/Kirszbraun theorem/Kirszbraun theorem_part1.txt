Mathematical theorem related to real and functional analysis In mathematics, specifically real analysis and functional analysis, the Kirszbraun theorem states that if U is a subset of some Hilbert space H1, and H2 is another Hilbert space, and f:U→H2:U_2 is a Lipschitz-continuous map, then there is a Lipschitz-continuous map F:H1→H2:H_1_2 that extends f and has the same Lipschitz constant as f. Note that this result in particular applies to Euclidean spaces En and Em, and it was in this form that Kirszbraun originally formulated and proved the theorem.[1] The version for Hilbert spaces can for example be found in (Schwartz 1969, p. 21).[2] If H1 is a separable space (in particular, if it is a Euclidean space) the result is true in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory; for the fully general case, it appears to need some form of the axiom of choice; the Boolean prime ideal theorem is known to be sufficient.[3] The proof of the theorem uses geometric features of Hilbert spaces; the corresponding statement for Banach spaces is not true in general, not even for finite-dimensional Banach spaces. It is for instance possible to construct counterexamples where the domain is a subset of Rnℝ^n with the maximum norm and Rmℝ^m carries the Euclidean norm.[4] More generally, the theorem fails for Rmℝ^m equipped with any ℓpℓ_p norm (p≠2≠2) (Schwartz 1969, p. 20).[2] Explicit
