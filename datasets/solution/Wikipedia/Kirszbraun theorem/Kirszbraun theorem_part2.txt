formulas: For an Rℝ-valued function the extension is provided by f (x):=infu∈U(f(u)+Lip(f)⋅d(x,u)),f̃(x):=inf_u(f(u)+Lip(f)(x,u)), where Lip(f)Lip(f) is the Lipschitz constant of f on U.[5] In general, an extension can also be written for Rmℝ^m-valued functions as f (x):=∇y(conv(g(x,y))(x,0)f̃(x):=∇_y(conv(g(x,y))(x,0) where g(x,y):=infu∈U⟨f(u),y⟩+Lip(f)2‖x−u‖2+Lip(f)2‖x‖2+Lip(f)‖y‖2(x,y):=inf_u{(u),y⟩+Lip(f)/2x-u^2}+Lip(f)/2x^2+Lip(f)y^2 and conv(g) is the lower convex envelope of g.[6]
