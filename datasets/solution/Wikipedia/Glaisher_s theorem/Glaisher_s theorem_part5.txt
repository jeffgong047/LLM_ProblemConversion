Proof: A proof of the theorem can be obtained with generating functions. If we note pd(n)_d(n) the number of partitions with no parts divisible by d and qd(n)_d(n) the number of partitions with no parts repeated more than d-1 times, then the theorem means that for all n pd(n)=qd(n)_d(n)=q_d(n). The uniqueness of ordinary generating functions implies that instead of proving that pd(n)=qd(n)_d(n)=q_d(n) for all n, it suffices to prove that the generating functions of pd(n)_d(n) and qd(n)_d(n) are equal, i.e. that ∑n=0∞pd(n)xn=∑n=0∞qd(n)xn∑_n=0^∞p_d(n)x^n=∑_n=0^∞q_d(n)x^n. Each generating function can be rewritten as infinite products (with a method similar to the infinite product of the partition function) : ∑n=0∞pd(n)xn=∏n=1,d∤n∞11−xn∑_n=0^∞p_d(n)x^n=∏_n=1,d^∞1/1-x^n (i.e. the product of terms where n is not divisible by d). ∑n=0∞qd(n)xn=∏n=1∞1−xdn1−xn∑_n=0^∞q_d(n)x^n=∏_n=1^∞1-x^dn/1-x^n If we expand the infinite product for qd(n)_d(n): ∏n=1∞1−xdn1−xn=1−xd1−x1−x2d1−x2…1−xkd1−xk…∏_n=1^∞1-x^dn/1-x^n=1-x^d/1-x1-x^2d/1-x^2…1-x^kd/1-x^k… we see that each term in the numerator cancels with the corresponding multiple of d in the denominator. What remains after canceling all the numerator terms is exactly the infinite product for pd(n)_d(n). Hence the generating functions for pd(n)_d(n) and qd(n)_d(n) are equal. Rogers-Ramanujan
