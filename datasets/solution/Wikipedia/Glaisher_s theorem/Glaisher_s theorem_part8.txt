2: For an example of the second statement of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, we consider partitions of 7 with the further restriction of the smallest part at least 2, and there are only 2, shown in bold below: 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7 And there are also only 2 partitions of 7 involving only the parts 2, 3, 7: 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7
