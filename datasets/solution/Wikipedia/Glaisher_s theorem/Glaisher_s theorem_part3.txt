case): Among the 15 partitions of the number 7, there are 5, shown in bold below, that contain only odd parts (i.e. only odd numbers): 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7 If we count now the partitions of 7 with distinct parts (i.e. where no number is repeated), we also obtain 5: 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7 The partitions in bold in the first and second case are not the same, and it is not obvious why their number is the same.
