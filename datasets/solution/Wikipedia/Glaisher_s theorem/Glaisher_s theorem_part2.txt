Statement: It states that the number of partitions of an integer n into parts not divisible by d is equal to the number of partitions in which no part is repeated d or more times, which can be written formally as partitions of the form n=λ1+⋯+λk=λ_1+⋯+λ_k where λi≥λi+1λ_i≥λ_i+1 and λi≥λi+d−1+1λ_i≥λ_i+d-1+1. When d=2=2 this becomes the special case known as Euler's theorem, that the number of partitions of n into distinct parts is equal to the number of partitions of n into odd parts. In the following examples, we use the multiplicity notation of partitions. For example, 1421321^42^13^2 is a notation for the partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3. Example for d=2 (Euler's theorem
