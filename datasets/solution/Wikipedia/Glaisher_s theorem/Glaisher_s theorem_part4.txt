d=3: Among the 11 partitions of the number 6, there are 7, shown in bold below, that contain only parts not divisible by 3: 6,5111,4121,4112,32,312111,3113,23,2212,2114,166,5^11^1,4^12^1,4^11^2,3^2,3^12^11^1,3^11^3,2^3,2^21^2,2^11^4,1^6 And if we count the partitions of 6 with no part that repeats more than 2 times, we also obtain 7: 6,5111,4121,4112,32,312111,3113,23,2212,2114,166,5^11^1,4^12^1,4^11^2,3^2,3^12^11^1,3^11^3,2^3,2^21^2,2^11^4,1^6
