1: For example, there are only 3 partitions of 7, shown in bold below, into parts differing by at least 2 (note: if a number is repeated in a partition, it means a difference of 0 between two parts, hence the partition is not counted): 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7 And there are also only 3 partitions of 7 involving only the parts 1, 4, 6: 7,6111,5121,5112,4131,412111,4113,3211,3122,312112,3114,2311,2213,2115,177,6^11^1,5^12^1,5^11^2,4^13^1,4^12^11^1,4^11^3,3^21^1,3^12^2,3^12^11^2,3^11^4,2^31^1,2^21^3,2^11^5,1^7 Example
