hypotheses: The hypothesis of the last theorem are not the only ones under which Green's formula is true. Another common set of conditions is the following: The functions A,B:R¯→R,B:R→ℝ are still assumed to be continuous. However, we now require them to be Fréchet-differentiable at every point of R. This implies the existence of all directional derivatives, in particular DeiA=:DiA,DeiB=:DiB,i=1,2_e_iA=:D_iA,D_e_iB=:D_iB, i=1,2, where, as usual, (e1,e2)(e_1,e_2) is the canonical ordered basis of R2ℝ^2. In addition, we require the function D1B−D2A_1B-D_2A to be Riemann-integrable over R. As a corollary of this, we get the Cauchy Integral Theorem for rectifiable Jordan curves: Theorem (Cauchy) — If ΓΓ is a rectifiable Jordan curve in Cℂ and if f:closureofinnerregionofΓ→C:closureofinnerregionofΓ→ℂ is a continuous mapping holomorphic throughout the inner region of ΓΓ, then ∫Γf=0,∫_Γf=0, the integral being a complex contour integral. Proof We regard the complex plane as R2ℝ^2. Now, define u,v:R¯→R,v:R→ℝ to be such that f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y).(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y). These functions are clearly continuous. It is well known that u and v are Fréchet-differentiable and that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: D1v+D2u=D1u−D2v=zerofunction_1v+D_2u=D_1u-D_2v=zerofunction. Now, analyzing the sums used to define the complex contour integral in question, it is easy to realize that ∫Γf=∫Γudx−vdy+i∫Γvdx+udy,∫_Γf=∫_Γu dx-v dy +i∫_Γv dx+u dy, the integrals on the RHS being usual line integrals. These remarks allow us to apply Green's Theorem to each one of these line integrals, finishing the proof. Multiply-connected
