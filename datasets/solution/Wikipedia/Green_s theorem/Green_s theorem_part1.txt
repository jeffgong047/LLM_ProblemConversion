Theorem in calculus relating line and double integrals This article is about the theorem in the plane relating double integrals and line integrals. For Green's theorems relating volume integrals involving the Laplacian to surface integrals, see Green's identities. Not to be confused with Green's law for waves approaching a shoreline.

It is the two-dimensional special case of Stokes' theorem.
