region: If D is a simple type of region with its boundary consisting of the curves C1, C2, C3, C4, half of Green's theorem can be demonstrated. The following is a proof of half of the theorem for the simplified area D, a type I region where C1 and C3 are curves connected by vertical lines (possibly of zero length). A similar proof exists for the other half of the theorem when D is a type II region where C2 and C4 are curves connected by horizontal lines (again, possibly of zero length). Putting these two parts together, the theorem is thus proven for regions of type III (defined as regions which are both type I and type II). The general case can then be deduced from this special case by decomposing D into a set of type III regions. If it can be shown that ∮CLdx=∬D(−∂L∂y)dA∮_CL dx=∬_D(-/)dA (1) and ∮CMdy=∬D(∂M∂x)dA∮_C dy=∬_D(/)dA (2) are true, then Green's theorem follows immediately for the region D. We can prove (1) easily for regions of type I, and (2) for regions of type II. Green's theorem then follows for regions of type III. Assume region D is a type I region and can thus be characterized, as pictured on the right, by D=(x,y)∣a≤x≤b,g1(x)≤y≤g2(x)={(x,y),g_1(x)_2(x)} where g1 and g2 are continuous functions on [a, b]. Compute the double integral in (1): ∬D∂L∂ydA=∫ab∫g1(x)g2(x)∂L∂y(x,y)dydx=∫ab[L(x,g2(x))−L(x,g1(x))]dx.∬_D/ dA =∫_a^b ∫_g_1(x)^g_2(x)/(x,y) dy dx =∫_a^b[L(x,g_2(x))-L(x,g_1(x))] dx. (3) Now compute the line integral in (1). C can be rewritten as the union of four curves: C1, C2, C3, C4. With C1, use the parametric equations: x = x, y = g1(x), a ≤ x ≤ b. Then ∫C1L(x,y)dx=∫abL(x,g1(x))dx.∫_C_1L(x,y) dx=∫_a^bL(x,g_1(x)) dx. With C3, use the parametric equations: x = x, y = g2(x), a ≤ x ≤ b. Then ∫C3L(x,y)dx=−∫−C3L(x,y)dx=−∫abL(x,g2(x))dx.∫_C_3L(x,y) dx=-∫_-C_3L(x,y) dx=-∫_a^bL(x,g_2(x)) dx. The integral over C3 is negated because it goes in the negative direction from b to a, as C is oriented positively (anticlockwise). On C2 and C4, x remains constant, meaning ∫C4L(x,y)dx=∫C2L(x,y)dx=0.∫_C_4L(x,y) dx=∫_C_2L(x,y) dx=0. Therefore, ∫CLdx=∫C1L(x,y)dx+∫C2L(x,y)dx+∫C3L(x,y)dx+∫C4L(x,y)dx=∫abL(x,g1(x))dx−∫abL(x,g2(x))dx.∫_CL dx =∫_C_1L(x,y) dx+∫_C_2L(x,y) dx+∫_C_3L(x,y) dx+∫_C_4L(x,y) dx =∫_a^bL(x,g_1(x)) dx-∫_a^bL(x,g_2(x)) dx. (4) Combining (3) with (4), we get (1) for regions of type I. A similar treatment yields (2) for regions of type II. Putting the two together, we get the result for regions of type III.
