theorem: Green's theorem is a special case of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, when applied to a region in the xy-plane. We can augment the two-dimensional field into a three-dimensional field with a z component that is always 0. Write F for the vector-valued function F=(L,M,0)𝐅=(L,M,0). Start with the left side of Green's theorem: ∮C(Ldx+Mdy)=∮C(L,M,0)⋅(dx,dy,dz)=∮CF⋅dr.∮_C(L dx+M dy)=∮_C(L,M,0)·(dx,dy,dz)=∮_C𝐅𝐫. The Kelvin–Stokes theorem: ∮CF⋅dr=∬S∇×F⋅n^dS.∮_C𝐅𝐫=∬_S∇×𝐅·𝐧̂ dS. The surface S is just the region in the plane D, with the unit normal n^𝐧̂ defined (by convention) to have a positive z component in order to match the "positive orientation" definitions for both theorems. The expression inside the integral becomes ∇×F⋅n^=[(∂0∂y−∂M∂z)i+(∂L∂z−∂0∂x)j+(∂M∂x−∂L∂y)k]⋅k=(∂M∂x−∂L∂y).∇×𝐅·𝐧̂=[(∂0/-/)𝐢+(/-∂0/)𝐣+(/-/)𝐤]·𝐤=(/-/). Thus we get the right side of Green's theorem ∬S∇×F⋅n^dS=∬D(∂M∂x−∂L∂y)dA.∬_S∇×𝐅·𝐧̂ dS=∬_D(/-/) dA. Green's theorem is also a straightforward result of the general Stokes' theorem using differential forms and exterior derivatives: ∮CLdx+Mdy=∮∂Dω=∫Ddω=∫D∂L∂ydy∧dx+∂M∂xdx∧dy=∬D(∂M∂x−∂L∂y)dxdy.∮_CL dx+M dy=∮_ω=∫_Ddω=∫_D/ dy∧ dx+/ dx∧ dy=∬_D(/-/) dx dy.
