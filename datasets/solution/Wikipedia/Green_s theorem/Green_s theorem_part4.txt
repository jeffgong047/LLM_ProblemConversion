curves: We are going to prove the following Theorem — Let ΓΓ be a rectifiable, positively oriented Jordan curve in R2ℝ^2 and let R denote its inner region. Suppose that A,B:R¯→R,B:R→ℝ are continuous functions with the property that A has second partial derivative at every point of R, B has first partial derivative at every point of R and that the functions D1B,D2A:R→R_1B,D_2A:R→ℝ are Riemann-integrable over R. Then ∫Γ(Adx+Bdy)=∫R(D1B(x,y)−D2A(x,y))d(x,y).∫_Γ(A dx+B dy)=∫_R(D_1B(x,y)-D_2A(x,y)) d(x,y). We need the following lemmas whose proofs can be found in:[3] Lemma 1 (Decomposition Lemma) — Assume ΓΓ is a rectifiable, positively oriented Jordan curve in the plane and let R be its inner region. For every positive real δδ, let F(δ)ℱ(δ) denote the collection of squares in the plane bounded by the lines x=mδ,y=mδ=mδ,y=mδ, where m runs through the set of integers. Then, for this δδ, there exists a decomposition of R¯R into a finite number of non-overlapping subregions in such a manner that Each one of the subregions contained in R, say R1,R2,…,Rk_1,R_2,…,R_k, is a square from F(δ)ℱ(δ). Each one of the remaining subregions, say Rk+1,…,Rs_k+1,…,R_s, has as boundary a rectifiable Jordan curve formed by a finite number of arcs of ΓΓ and parts of the sides of some square from F(δ)ℱ(δ). Each one of the border regions Rk+1,…,Rs_k+1,…,R_s can be enclosed in a square of edge-length 2δ2δ. If ΓiΓ_i is the positively oriented boundary curve of Ri_i, then Γ=Γ1+Γ2+⋯+Γs.Γ=Γ_1+Γ_2+⋯+Γ_s. The number s−k-k of border regions is no greater than 4(Λδ+1)4(Λ/δ+1), where ΛΛ is the length of ΓΓ. Lemma 2 — Let ΓΓ be a rectifiable curve in the plane and let ΔΓ(h)Δ_Γ(h) be the set of points in the plane whose distance from (the range of) ΓΓ is at most h. The outer Jordan content of this set satisfies c¯ΔΓ(h)≤2hΛ+πh2c Δ_Γ(h)≤2hΛ+^2. Lemma 3 — Let ΓΓ be a rectifiable curve in R2ℝ^2 and let f:rangeofΓ→R:rangeofΓ→ℝ be a continuous function. Then |∫Γf(x,y)dy|≤12ΛΩf,|∫_Γf(x,y) dy|≤1/2ΛΩ_f, and |∫Γf(x,y)dx|≤12ΛΩf,|∫_Γf(x,y) dx|≤1/2ΛΩ_f, where ΩfΩ_f is the oscillation of f on the range of ΓΓ. Now we are in position to prove the theorem: Proof of Theorem. Let εε be an arbitrary positive real number. By continuity of A, B and compactness of R¯R, given ε>0ε>0, there exists 0<δ<10<δ<1 such that whenever two points of R¯R are less than 22δ2√(2) δ apart, their images under A,B,B are less than εε apart. For this δδ, consider the decomposition given by the previous Lemma. We have ∫ΓAdx+Bdy=∑i=1k∫ΓiAdx+Bdy+∑i=k+1s∫ΓiAdx+Bdy.∫_ΓA dx+B dy=∑_i=1^k∫_Γ_iA dx+B dy +∑_i=k+1^s∫_Γ_iA dx+B dy. Put φ:=D1B−D2Aφ:=D_1B-D_2A. For each i∈1,…,k∈{1,…,k}, the curve ΓiΓ_i is a positively oriented square, for which Green's formula holds. Hence ∑i=1k∫ΓiAdx+Bdy=∑i=1k∫Riφ=∫⋃i=1kRiφ.∑_i=1^k∫_Γ_iA dx+B dy=∑_i=1^k∫_R_iφ=∫_⋃_i=1^kR_i φ. Every point of a border region is at a distance no greater than 22δ2√(2) δ from ΓΓ. Thus, if K is the union of all border regions, then K⊂ΔΓ(22δ)⊂Δ_Γ(2√(2) δ); hence c(K)≤c¯ΔΓ(22δ)≤42δ+8πδ2(K)≤c Δ_Γ(2√(2) δ)≤4√(2) δ+8πδ^2, by Lemma 2. Notice that ∫Rφ−∫⋃i=1kRiφ=∫Kφ.∫_Rφ -∫_⋃_i=1^kR_iφ=∫_Kφ. This yields |∑i=1k∫ΓiAdx+Bdy−∫Rφ|≤Mδ(1+π2δ)forsomeM>0.|∑_i=1^k∫_Γ_iA dx+B dy -∫_Rφ|δ(1+π√(2) δ)forsomeM>0. We may as well choose δδ so that the RHS of the last inequality is <ε.<ε. The remark in the beginning of this proof implies that the oscillations of A and B on every border region is at most εε. We have |∑i=k+1s∫ΓiAdx+Bdy|≤12ε∑i=k+1sΛi.|∑_i=k+1^s∫_Γ_iA dx+B dy|≤1/2ε∑_i=k+1^sΛ_i. By Lemma 1(iii), ∑i=k+1sΛi≤Λ+(4δ)4(Λδ+1)≤17Λ+16.∑_i=k+1^sΛ_i≤Λ+(4δ) 4(Λ/δ+1)≤17Λ+16. Combining these, we finally get |∫ΓAdx+Bdy−∫Rφ|<Cε,|∫_ΓA dx+B dy -∫_Rφ|<Cε, for some C>0>0. Since this is true for every ε>0ε>0, we are done. Validity under different
