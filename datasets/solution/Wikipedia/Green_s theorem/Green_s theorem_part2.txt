Theorem: Let C be a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve in a plane, and let D be the region bounded by C. If L and M are functions of (x, y) defined on an open region containing D and have continuous partial derivatives there, then ∮C(Ldx+Mdy)=∬D(∂M∂x−∂L∂y)dxdy∮_C(L dx+M dy)=∬_D(/-/)dx dy where the path of integration along C is anticlockwise.[1][2] In physics, Green's theorem finds many applications. One is solving two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflowing from a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter. Proof when D is a simple
