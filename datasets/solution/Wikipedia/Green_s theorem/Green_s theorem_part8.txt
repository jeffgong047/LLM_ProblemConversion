theorem: Considering only two-dimensional vector fields, Green's theorem is equivalent to the two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem: ∬D(∇⋅F)dA=∮CF⋅n^ds,∬_D(∇·𝐅)dA=∮_C𝐅·𝐧̂ ds, where ∇⋅F∇·𝐅 is the divergence on the two-dimensional vector field F𝐅, and n^𝐧̂ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary. To see this, consider the unit normal n^𝐧̂ in the right side of the equation. Since in Green's theorem dr=(dx,dy)𝐫=(dx,dy) is a vector pointing tangential along the curve, and the curve C is the positively oriented (i.e. anticlockwise) curve along the boundary, an outward normal would be a vector which points 90° to the right of this; one choice would be (dy,−dx)(dy,-dx). The length of this vector is dx2+dy2=ds.√(dx^2+dy^2)=ds. So (dy,−dx)=n^ds.(dy,-dx)=𝐧̂ ds. Start with the left side of Green's theorem: ∮C(Ldx+Mdy)=∮C(M,−L)⋅(dy,−dx)=∮C(M,−L)⋅n^ds.∮_C(L dx+M dy)=∮_C(M,-L)·(dy,-dx)=∮_C(M,-L)·𝐧̂ ds. Applying the two-dimensional divergence theorem with F=(M,−L)𝐅=(M,-L), we get the right side of Green's theorem: ∮C(M,−L)⋅n^ds=∬D(∇⋅(M,−L))dA=∬D(∂M∂x−∂L∂y)dA.∮_C(M,-L)·𝐧̂ ds=∬_D(∇·(M,-L)) dA=∬_D(/-/) dA.
