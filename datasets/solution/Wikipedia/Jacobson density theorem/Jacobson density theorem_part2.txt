statement: Let R be a ring and let U be a simple right R-module. If u is a non-zero element of U, u • R = U (where u • R is the cyclic submodule of U generated by u). Therefore, if u, v are non-zero elements of U, there is an element of R that induces an endomorphism of U transforming u to v. The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple (x1, ..., xn) and (y1, ..., yn) separately, so that there is an element of R with the property that xi • r = yi for all i. If D is the set of all R-module endomorphisms of U, then Schur's lemma asserts that D is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the xi are linearly independent over D. With the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way: The Jacobson density theorem. Let U be a simple right R-module, D = End(UR), and X ⊂ U a finite and D-linearly independent set. If A is a D-linear transformation on U then there exists r ∈ R such that A(x) = x • r for all x in X.[5]
