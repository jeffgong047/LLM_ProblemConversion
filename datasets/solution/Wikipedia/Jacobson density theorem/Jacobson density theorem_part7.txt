results: This result is related to the Von Neumann bicommutant theorem, which states that, for a *-algebra A of operators on a Hilbert space H, the double commutant A′′ can be approximated by A on any given finite set of vectors. In other words, the double commutant is the closure of A in the weak operator topology. See also the Kaplansky density theorem in the von Neumann algebra setting.
