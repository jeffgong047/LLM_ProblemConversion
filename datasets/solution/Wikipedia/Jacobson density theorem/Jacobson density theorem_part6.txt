Consequences: The Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings.[9] Notably, the Artinâ€“Wedderburn theorem's conclusion about the structure of simple right Artinian rings is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left primitive rings as dense subrings of the ring of D-linear transformations on some D-vector space U, where D is a division ring.[3] Relations to other
