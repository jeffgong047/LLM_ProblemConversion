theorem: We use induction on |X|. If X is empty, then the theorem is vacuously true and the base case for induction is verified. Assume X is non-empty, let x be an element of X and write Y = X \{x}. If A is any D-linear transformation on U, by the induction hypothesis there exists s ∈ R such that A(y) = y • s for all y in Y. Write I = annR(Y). It is easily seen that x • I is a submodule of U. If x • I = 0, then the previous theorem implies that x would be in the D-span of Y, contradicting the D-linear independence of X, therefore x • I ≠ 0. Since U is simple, we have: x • I = U. Since A(x) − x • s ∈ U = x • I, there exists i in I such that x • i = A(x) − x • s. Define r = s + i and observe that for all y in Y we have: y⋅r=y⋅(s+i)=y⋅s+y⋅i=y⋅s(sincei∈annR(Y))=A(y)y =y·(s+i) =y⋯+y =y⋯ (sincei∈ann_R(Y)) =A(y) Now we do the same calculation for x: x⋅r=x⋅(s+i)=x⋅s+x⋅i=x⋅s+(A(x)−x⋅s)=A(x)x =x·(s+i) =x⋯+x =x⋯+(A(x)-x⋯) =A(x) Therefore, A(z) = z • r for all z in X, as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets X of any size. Topological
