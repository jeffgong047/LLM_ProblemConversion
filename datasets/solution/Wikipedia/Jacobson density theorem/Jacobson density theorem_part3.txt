Proof: In the Jacobson density theorem, the right R-module U is simultaneously viewed as a left D-module where D = End(UR), in the natural way: g • u = g(u). It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on U.[6] As noted before, Schur's lemma proves D is a division ring if U is simple, and so U is a vector space over D. The proof also relies on the following theorem proven in (Isaacs 1993) p. 185: Theorem. Let U be a simple right R-module, D = End(UR), and X ⊂ U a finite set. Write I = annR(X) for the annihilator of X in R. Let u be in U with u • I = 0. Then u is in XD; the D-span of X. Proof of the Jacobson density
