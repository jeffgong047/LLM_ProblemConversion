statement: Let P1P2P3P4P5P6_1P_2P_3P_4P_5P_6 be a hexagon formed by six tangent lines of a conic section. Then lines P1P4¯,P2P5¯,P3P6¯P_1P_4, P_2P_5, P_3P_6 (extended diagonals each connecting opposite vertices) intersect at a single point B, the Brianchon point.[1]: p. 218 [2] Connection to Pascal's
