functions: Suppose X and Y are σ-finite measure spaces, and suppose that X × Y is given the product measure (which is unique as X and Y are σ-finite). Fubini's theorem states that if f is X × Y integrable, meaning that f is a measurable function and ∫X×Y|f(x,y)|d(x,y)<∞,∫_X|f(x,y)| d(x,y)<∞, then ∫X(∫Yf(x,y)dy)dx=∫Y(∫Xf(x,y)dx)dy=∫X×Yf(x,y)d(x,y).∫_X(∫_Yf(x,y) dy) dx=∫_Y(∫_Xf(x,y) dx) dy=∫_Xf(x,y) d(x,y). The first two integrals are iterated integrals with respect to two measures, respectively, and the third is an integral with respect to the product measure. The partial integrals ∫Yf(x,y)dy∫_Yf(x,y) dy and ∫Xf(x,y)dx∫_Xf(x,y) dx need not be defined everywhere, but this does not matter as the points where they are not defined form a set of measure 0. If the above integral of the absolute value is not finite, then the two iterated integrals may have different values. See below for an illustration of this possibility. The condition that X and Y are σ-finite is usually harmless because in practice almost all measure spaces one wishes to use Fubini's theorem for are σ-finite. Fubini's theorem has some rather technical extensions to the case when X and Y are not assumed to be σ-finite (Fremlin 2003). The main extra complication in this case is that there may be more than one product measure on X×Y. Fubini's theorem continues to hold for the maximal product measure, but can fail for other product measures. For example, there is a product measure and a non-negative measurable function f for which the double integral of |f| is zero but the two iterated integrals have different values; see the section on counterexamples below for an example of this. Tonelli's theorem and the Fubini–Tonelli theorem (stated below) can fail on non σ-finite spaces even for the maximal product measure. Tonelli's theorem for non-negative measurable
