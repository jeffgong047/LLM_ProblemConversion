integrals: For Riemann integrals, Fubini's theorem is proven by refining the partitions along the x-axis and y-axis as to create a joint partition of the form [xi,xi+1]×[yj,yj+1][x_i,x_i+1]×[y_j,y_j+1], which is a partition over X×Y. This is used to show that the double integrals of either order are equal to the integral over X×Y.
