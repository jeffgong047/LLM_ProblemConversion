theorem: Combining Fubini's theorem with Tonelli's theorem gives the Fubini–Tonelli theorem (often just called Fubini's theorem), which states that if X and Y are σ-finite measure spaces, and if f is a measurable function, then ∫X(∫Y|f(x,y)|dy)dx=∫Y(∫X|f(x,y)|dx)dy=∫X×Y|f(x,y)|d(x,y)∫_X(∫_Y|f(x,y)| dy) dx=∫_Y(∫_X|f(x,y)| dx) dy=∫_X|f(x,y)| d(x,y) Besides if any one of these integrals is finite, then ∫X(∫Yf(x,y)dy)dx=∫Y(∫Xf(x,y)dx)dy=∫X×Yf(x,y)d(x,y).∫_X(∫_Yf(x,y) dy) dx=∫_Y(∫_Xf(x,y) dx) dy=∫_Xf(x,y) d(x,y). The absolute value of f in the conditions above can be replaced by either the positive or the negative part of f; these forms include Tonelli's theorem as a special case as the negative part of a non-negative function is zero and so has finite integral. Informally all these conditions say that the double integral of f is well defined, though possibly infinite. The advantage of the Fubini–Tonelli over Fubini's theorem is that the repeated integrals of |f||f| may be easier to study than the double integral. As in Fubini's theorem, the single integrals may fail to be defined on a measure 0 set. For complete
