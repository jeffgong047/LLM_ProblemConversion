History: The special case of Fubini's theorem for continuous functions on a product of closed bounded subsets of real vector spaces was known to Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. Henri Lebesgue (1904) extended this to bounded measurable functions on a product of intervals.[3] Levi conjectured that the theorem could be extended to functions that were integrable rather than bounded,[citation needed] and this was proved by Fubini (1907).[4] Leonida Tonelli (1909) gave a variation of Fubini's theorem that applies to non-negative functions rather than integrable functions.[5] Product
