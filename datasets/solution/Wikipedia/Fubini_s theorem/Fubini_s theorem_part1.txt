Conditions for switching order of integration in calculus For the Fubini theorem for category, see Kuratowski–Ulam theorem. This article may be too technical for most readers to understand.

(August 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mathematical analysis, Fubini's theorem is a result that gives conditions under which it is possible to compute a double integral by using an iterated integral, introduced by Guido Fubini in 1907. One may switch the order of integration if the double integral yields a finite answer when the integrand is replaced by its absolute value. ∬X×Yf(x,y)d(x,y)=∫X(∫Yf(x,y)dy)dx=∫Y(∫Xf(x,y)dx)dyif∬X×Y|f(x,y)|d(x,y)<+∞. ∬_Xf(x,y) d(x,y)=∫_X(∫_Yf(x,y) dy)dx=∫_Y(∫_Xf(x,y) dx)dy if ∬_X|f(x,y)| d(x,y)<+∞. Fubini's theorem implies that two iterated integrals are equal to the corresponding double integral across its integrands. Tonelli's theorem, introduced by Leonida Tonelli in 1909, is similar, but applies to a non-negative measurable function rather than one integrable over their domains. A related theorem is often called Fubini's theorem for infinite series,[1] which states that if am,nm=1,n=1∞{a_m,n}_m=1,n=1^∞ is a doubly-indexed sequence of real numbers, and if ∑(m,n)∈N×Nam,n∑_(m,n)∈ℕ×ℕa_m,n is absolutely convergent, then ∑(m,n)∈N×Nam,n=∑m=1∞∑n=1∞am,n=∑n=1∞∑m=1∞am,n∑_(m,n)∈ℕ×ℕa_m,n=∑_m=1^∞∑_n=1^∞a_m,n=∑_n=1^∞∑_m=1^∞a_m,n Although Fubini's theorem for infinite series is a special case of the more general Fubini's theorem, it is not appropriate to characterize it as a logical consequence of Fubini's theorem. This is because some properties of measures, in particular sub-additivity, are often proved using Fubini's theorem for infinite series.[2] In this case, Fubini's general theorem is a logical consequence of Fubini's theorem for infinite series.
