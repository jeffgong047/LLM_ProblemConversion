matrices: A linear function of a matrix M is a linear combination of its elements (with given coefficients), M ‚Ü¶ tr(AM) where A is the matrix of the coefficients; see Trace (linear algebra)#Inner product. A random orthogonal matrix is said to be distributed uniformly, if its distribution is the normalized Haar measure on the orthogonal group O(n,R); see Rotation matrix#Uniform random rotation matrices. Theorem ‚Äî Let M be a random orthogonal n √ó n matrix distributed uniformly, and A a fixed n √ó n matrix such that tr(AA*) = n, and let X = tr(AM). Then[41] the distribution of X is close to N(0,1)ùí©(0,1) in the total variation metric up to[clarification needed] 2‚àö3/n ‚àí 1.
