dependence: A useful generalization of a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables is a mixing random process in discrete time; "mixing" means, roughly, that random variables temporally far apart from one another are nearly independent. Several kinds of mixing are used in ergodic theory and probability theory. See especially strong mixing (also called Œ±-mixing) defined by Œ±(n)‚Üí0Œ±(n)‚Üí0 where Œ±(n)Œ±(n) is so-called strong mixing coefficient. A simplified formulation of the central limit theorem under strong mixing is:[14] Theorem ‚Äî Suppose that X1,‚Ä¶,Xn,‚Ä¶{X_1,‚Ä¶,X_n,‚Ä¶} is stationary and Œ±Œ±-mixing with Œ±n=O(n‚àí5)Œ±_n=O(n^-5) and that E‚Å°[Xn]=0E[X_n]=0 and E‚Å°[Xn12]<‚àûE[X_n^12]<‚àû. Denote Sn=X1+‚ãØ+Xn_n=X_1+‚ãØ+X_n, then the limit œÉ2=limn‚Üí‚àûE‚Å°(Sn2)nœÉ^2=lim_n‚Üí‚àûE(S_n^2)/n exists, and if œÉ‚â†0œÉ‚â†0 then SnœÉnS_n/œÉ‚àö(n) converges in distribution to N(0,1)ùí©(0,1). In fact, œÉ2=E‚Å°(X12)+2‚àëk=1‚àûE‚Å°(X1X1+k),œÉ^2=E(X_1^2)+2‚àë_k=1^‚àûE(X_1X_1+k), where the series converges absolutely. The assumption œÉ‚â†0œÉ‚â†0 cannot be omitted, since the asymptotic normality fails for Xn=Yn‚àíYn‚àí1_n=Y_n-Y_n-1 where Yn_n are another stationary sequence. There is a stronger version of the theorem:[15] the assumption E‚Å°[Xn12]<‚àûE[X_n^12]<‚àû is replaced with E‚Å°[|Xn|2+Œ¥]<‚àûE[|X_n|^2+Œ¥]<‚àû, and the assumption Œ±n=O(n‚àí5)Œ±_n=O(n^-5) is replaced with ‚àënŒ±nŒ¥2(2+Œ¥)<‚àû.‚àë_nŒ±_n^Œ¥/2(2+Œ¥)<‚àû. Existence of such Œ¥>0Œ¥>0 ensures the conclusion. For encyclopedic treatment of limit theorems under mixing conditions see (Bradley 2007). Martingale difference
