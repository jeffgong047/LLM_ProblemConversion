CLT: The theorem is named after Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov. In this variant of the central limit theorem the random variables Xi_i have to be independent, but not necessarily identically distributed. The theorem also requires that random variables |Xi||X_i| have moments of some order (2+δ)(2+δ), and that the rate of growth of these moments is limited by the Lyapunov condition given below. Lyapunov CLT[6] — Suppose X1,…,Xn,…{X_1,…,X_n,…} is a sequence of independent random variables, each with finite expected value μiμ_i and variance σi2σ_i^2. Define sn2=∑i=1nσi2._n^2=∑_i=1^nσ_i^2. If for some δ>0δ>0, Lyapunov’s condition limn→∞1sn2+δ∑i=1nE⁡[|Xi−μi|2+δ]=0lim_n→∞ 1/s_n^2+δ ∑_i=1^nE[|X_i-μ_i|^2+δ]=0 is satisfied, then a sum of Xi−μisnX_i-μ_i/s_n converges in distribution to a standard normal random variable, as n goes to infinity: 1sn∑i=1n(Xi−μi)→dN(0,1).1/s_n ∑_i=1^n(X_i-μ_i) xrightarrowd{𝒩(0,1). In practice it is usually easiest to check Lyapunov's condition for δ=1δ=1. If a sequence of random variables satisfies Lyapunov's condition, then it also satisfies Lindeberg's condition. The converse implication, however, does not hold. Lindeberg
