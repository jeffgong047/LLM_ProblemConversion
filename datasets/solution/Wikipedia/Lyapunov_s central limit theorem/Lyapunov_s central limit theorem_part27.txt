Subsequences: Theorem — Let random variables X1, X2, ... ∈ L2(Ω) be such that Xn → 0 weakly in L2(Ω) and Xn → 1 weakly in L1(Ω). Then there exist integers n1 < n2 < ⋯ such that Xn1+⋯+XnkkX_n_1+⋯+X_n_k/√(k) converges in distribution to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) as k tends to infinity.[42] Random walk on a crystal
