variance: Let Sn be the sum of n random variables. Many central limit theorems provide conditions such that Sn/√Var(Sn) converges in distribution to N(0,1) (the normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1) as n → ∞. In some cases, it is possible to find a constant σ2 and function f(n) such that Sn/(σ√n⋅f(n)) converges in distribution to N(0,1) as n→ ∞. Lemma[31] — Suppose X1,X2,…_1,X_2,… is a sequence of real-valued and strictly stationary random variables with E⁡(Xi)=0E(X_i)=0 for all i, g:[0,1]→R:[0,1]→ℝ, and Sn=∑i=1ng(in)Xi_n=∑_i=1^ng(in)X_i. Construct σ2=E⁡(X12)+2∑i=1∞E⁡(X1X1+i)σ^2=E(X_1^2)+2∑_i=1^∞E(X_1X_1+i) If ∑i=1∞E⁡(X1X1+i)∑_i=1^∞E(X_1X_1+i) is absolutely convergent, |∫01g(x)g′(x)dx|<∞|∫_0^1g(x)g'(x) dx|<∞, and 0<∫01(g(x))2dx<∞0<∫_0^1(g(x))^2dx<∞ then Var(Sn)/(nγn)→σ2Var(S_n)/(nγ_n)→σ^2 as n→∞→∞ where γn=1n∑i=1n(g(in))2γ_n=1/n∑_i=1^n(g(in))^2. If in addition σ>0σ>0 and Sn/Var(Sn)_n/√(Var(S_n)) converges in distribution to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) as n→∞→∞ then Sn/(σnγn)_n/(σ√(nγ_n)) also converges in distribution to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) as n→∞→∞.
