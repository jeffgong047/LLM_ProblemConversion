body: Theorem — There exists a sequence εn ↓ 0 for which the following holds. Let n ≥ 1, and let random variables X1, ..., Xn have a log-concave joint density f such that f(x1, ..., xn) = f(|x1|, ..., |xn|) for all x1, ..., xn, and E(X2k) = 1 for all k = 1, ..., n. Then the distribution of X1+⋯+XnnX_1+⋯+X_n/√(n) is εn-close to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) in the total variation distance.[33] These two εn-close distributions have densities (in fact, log-concave densities), thus, the total variance distance between them is the integral of the absolute value of the difference between the densities. Convergence in total variation is stronger than weak convergence. An important example of a log-concave density is a function constant inside a given convex body and vanishing outside; it corresponds to the uniform distribution on the convex body, which explains the term "central limit theorem for convex bodies". Another example: f(x1, ..., xn) = const · exp(−(|x1|α + ⋯ + |xn|α)β) where α > 1 and αβ > 1. If β = 1 then f(x1, ..., xn) factorizes into const · exp (−|x1|α) … exp(−|xn|α), which means X1, ..., Xn are independent. In general, however, they are dependent. The condition f(x1, ..., xn) = f(|x1|, ..., |xn|) ensures that X1, ..., Xn are of zero mean and uncorrelated;[citation needed] still, they need not be independent, nor even pairwise independent.[citation needed] By the way, pairwise independence cannot replace independence in the classical central limit theorem.[34] Here is a Berry–Esseen type result. Theorem — Let X1, ..., Xn satisfy the assumptions of the previous theorem, then [35] |P(a≤X1+⋯+Xnn≤b)−12π∫abe−12t2dt|≤Cn|ℙ(a≤X_1+⋯+X_n/√(n))-1/√(2π)∫_a^be^-1/2t^2 dt|≤C/n for all a < b; here C is a universal (absolute) constant. Moreover, for every c1, ..., cn ∈ R such that c21 + ⋯ + c2n = 1, |P(a≤c1X1+⋯+cnXn≤b)−12π∫abe−12t2dt|≤C(c14+⋯+cn4).|ℙ(a_1X_1+⋯+c_nX_n)-1/√(2π)∫_a^be^-1/2t^2 dt|(c_1^4+…+c_n^4). The distribution of X1 + ⋯ + Xn/√n need not be approximately normal (in fact, it can be uniform).[36] However, the distribution of c1X1 + ⋯ + cnXn is close to N(0,1)𝒩(0,1) (in the total variation distance) for most vectors (c1, ..., cn) according to the uniform distribution on the sphere c21 + ⋯ + c2n = 1.
