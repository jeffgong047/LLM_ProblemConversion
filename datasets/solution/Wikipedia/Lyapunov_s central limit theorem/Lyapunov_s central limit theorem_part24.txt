series: Theorem (Salem–Zygmund) — Let U be a random variable distributed uniformly on (0,2π), and Xk = rk cos(nkU + ak), where nk satisfy the lacunarity condition: there exists q > 1 such that nk + 1 ≥ qnk for all k, rk are such that r12+r22+⋯=∞andrk2r12+⋯+rk2→0,_1^2+r_2^2+⋯=∞ and r_k^2/r_1^2+⋯+r_k^2→0, 0 ≤ ak < 2π. Then[37][38] X1+⋯+Xkr12+⋯+rk2X_1+⋯+X_k/√(r_1^2+⋯+r_k^2) converges in distribution to N(0,12)𝒩(0,1/2). Gaussian
