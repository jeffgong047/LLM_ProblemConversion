decomposition: For every finitely generated module M over a principal ideal domain R, there is a unique decreasing sequence of proper ideals (d1)⊇(d2)⊇⋯⊇(dn)(d_1)⊇(d_2)⊇⋯⊇(d_n) such that M is isomorphic to the sum of cyclic modules: M≅⨁iR/(di)=R/(d1)⊕R/(d2)⊕⋯⊕R/(dn).≅⊕_iR/(d_i)=R/(d_1)/(d_2)⊕⋯/(d_n). The generators di_i of the ideals are unique up to multiplication by a unit, and are called invariant factors of M. Since the ideals should be proper, these factors must not themselves be invertible (this avoids trivial factors in the sum), and the inclusion of the ideals means one has divisibility d1|d2|⋯|dn_1 | d_2 | ⋯ | d_n. The free part is visible in the part of the decomposition corresponding to factors di=0_i=0. Such factors, if any, occur at the end of the sequence. While the direct sum is uniquely determined by M, the isomorphism giving the decomposition itself is not unique in general. For instance if R is actually a field, then all occurring ideals must be zero, and one obtains the decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces; the number of such factors is fixed, namely the dimension of the space, but there is a lot of freedom for choosing the subspaces themselves (if dim M > 1). The nonzero di_i elements, together with the number of di_i which are zero, form a complete set of invariants for the module. Explicitly, this means that any two modules sharing the same set of invariants are necessarily isomorphic. Some prefer to write the free part of M separately: Rf⊕⨁iR/(di)=Rf⊕R/(d1)⊕R/(d2)⊕⋯⊕R/(dn−f)^f⊕⊕_iR/(d_i)=R^f/(d_1)/(d_2)⊕⋯/(d_n-f) where the visible di_i are nonzero, and f is the number of di_i's in the original sequence which are 0.
