Uniqueness: While the invariants (rank, invariant factors, and elementary divisors) are unique, the isomorphism between M and its canonical form is not unique, and does not even preserve the direct sum decomposition. This follows because there are non-trivial automorphisms of these modules which do not preserve the summands. However, one has a canonical torsion submodule T, and similar canonical submodules corresponding to each (distinct) invariant factor, which yield a canonical sequence: 0<⋯<T<M.0<⋯<T<M. Compare composition series in Jordan–Hölder theorem. For instance, if M≈Z⊕Z/2≈𝐙⊕𝐙/2, and (1,0¯),(0,1¯)(1,0̅),(0,1̅) is one basis, then (1,1¯),(0,1¯)(1,1̅),(0,1̅) is another basis, and the change of basis matrix [1011][ 1 0; 1 1 ] does not preserve the summand Z𝐙. However, it does preserve the Z/2𝐙/2 summand, as this is the torsion submodule (equivalently here, the 2-torsion elements).
