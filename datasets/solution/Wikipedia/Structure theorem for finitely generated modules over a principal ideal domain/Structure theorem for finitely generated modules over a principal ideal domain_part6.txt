Corollaries: This includes the classification of finite-dimensional vector spaces as a special case, where R=K=K. Since fields have no non-trivial ideals, every finitely generated vector space is free. Taking R=Z=â„¤ yields the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. Let T be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V over K. Taking R=K[T]=K[T], the algebra of polynomials with coefficients in K evaluated at T, yields structure information about T. V can be viewed as a finitely generated module over K[T][T]. The last invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and the product of invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial. Combined with a standard matrix form for K[T]/p(T)[T]/p(T), this yields various canonical forms: invariant factors + companion matrix yields Frobenius normal form (aka, rational canonical form) primary decomposition + companion matrix yields primary rational canonical form primary decomposition + Jordan blocks yields Jordan canonical form (this latter only holds over an algebraically closed field)
