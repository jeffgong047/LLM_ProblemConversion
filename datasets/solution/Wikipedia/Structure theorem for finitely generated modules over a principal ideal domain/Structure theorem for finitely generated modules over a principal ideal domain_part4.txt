decomposition: Every finitely generated module M over a principal ideal domain R is isomorphic to one of the form ⨁iR/(qi)⊕_iR/(q_i) where (qi)≠R(q_i) and the (qi)(q_i) are primary ideals. The qi_i are unique (up to multiplication by units). The elements qi_i are called the elementary divisors of M. In a PID, nonzero primary ideals are powers of primes, and so (qi)=(piri)=(pi)ri(q_i)=(p_i^r_i)=(p_i)^r_i. When qi=0_i=0, the resulting indecomposable module is R itself, and this is inside the part of M that is a free module. The summands R/(qi)/(q_i) are indecomposable, so the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, and thus every finitely generated module over a PID is a completely decomposable module. Since PID's are Noetherian rings, this can be seen as a manifestation of the Lasker-Noether theorem. As before, it is possible to write the free part (where qi=0_i=0) separately and express M as: Rf⊕(⨁iR/(qi))^f⊕(⊕_iR/(q_i)) where the visible qi_i are nonzero.
