theorem: If S is an IP set and S=C1∪C2∪⋯∪Cn=C_1_2∪⋯_n, then at least one Ci_i is an IP set. This is known as Hindman's theorem or the finite sums theorem.[4][5] In different terms, Hindman's theorem states that the class of IP sets is partition regular. Since the set of natural numbers itself is an IP set and partitions can also be seen as colorings, one can reformulate a special case of Hindman's theorem in more familiar terms: Suppose the natural numbers are "colored" with n different colors; each natural number gets one and only one color. Then there exists a color c and an infinite set D of natural numbers, all colored with c, such that every finite sum over D also has color c. Hindman's theorem is named for mathematician Neil Hindman, who proved it in 1974.[4] The Milliken–Taylor theorem is a common generalisation of Hindman's theorem and Ramsey's theorem.
