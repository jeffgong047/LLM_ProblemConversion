Example: Use the Gershgorin circle theorem to estimate the eigenvalues of: This diagram shows the discs in yellow derived for the eigenvalues. The first two disks overlap and their union contains two eigenvalues. The third and fourth disks are disjoint from the others and contain one eigenvalue each. A=[101010.280.20.21121−1−1−1−11].=[ 10 1 0 1; 0.2 8 0.2 0.2; 1 1 2 1; -1 -1 -1 -11; ]. Starting with row one, we take the element on the diagonal, aii as the center for the disc. We then take the remaining elements in the row and apply the formula: ∑j≠i|aij|=Ri∑_j|a_ij|=R_i to obtain the following four discs: D(10,2),D(8,0.6),D(2,3),andD(−11,3).(10,2), D(8,0.6), D(2,3), and D(-11,3). Note that we can improve the accuracy of the last two discs by applying the formula to the corresponding columns of the matrix, obtaining D(2,1.2)(2,1.2) and D(−11,2.2)(-11,2.2). The eigenvalues are 9.8218, 8.1478, 1.8995, −10.86. Note that this is a (column) diagonally dominant matrix: |aii|>∑j≠i|aji||a_ii|>∑_j|a_ji|. This means that most of the matrix is in the diagonal, which explains why the eigenvalues are so close to the centers of the circles, and the estimates are very good. For a random matrix, we would expect the eigenvalues to be substantially further from the centers of the circles. See
