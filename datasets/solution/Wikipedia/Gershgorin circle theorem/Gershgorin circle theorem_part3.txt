Discussion: One way to interpret this theorem is that if the off-diagonal entries of a square matrix over the complex numbers have small norms, the eigenvalues of the matrix cannot be "far from" the diagonal entries of the matrix. Therefore, by reducing the norms of off-diagonal entries one can attempt to approximate the eigenvalues of the matrix. Of course, diagonal entries may change in the process of minimizing off-diagonal entries. The theorem does not claim that there is one disc for each eigenvalue; if anything, the discs rather correspond to the axes in Cnℂ^n, and each expresses a bound on precisely those eigenvalues whose eigenspaces are closest to one particular axis. In the matrix (322110101)(a000b000c)(322110101)−1=(−3a+2b+2c6a−2b−4c6a−4b−2cb−aa+(a−b)2(a−b)c−a2(a−c)a+(a−c))[ 3 2 2; 1 1 0; 1 0 1 ][ a 0 0; 0 b 0; 0 0 c ][ 3 2 2; 1 1 0; 1 0 1 ]^-1=[ -3a+2b+2c 6a-2b-4c 6a-4b-2c; b-a a+(a-b) 2(a-b); c-a 2(a-c) a+(a-c) ] — which by construction has eigenvalues a, b, and c with eigenvectors (311)([ 3; 1; 1 ]), (210)([ 2; 1; 0 ]), and (201)([ 2; 0; 1 ]) — it is easy to see that the disc for row 2 covers a and b while the disc for row 3 covers a and c. This is however just a happy coincidence; if working through the steps of the proof one finds that it in each eigenvector is the first element that is the largest (every eigenspace is closer to the first axis than to any other axis), so the theorem only promises that the disc for row 1 (whose radius can be twice the sum of the other two radii) covers all three eigenvalues.
