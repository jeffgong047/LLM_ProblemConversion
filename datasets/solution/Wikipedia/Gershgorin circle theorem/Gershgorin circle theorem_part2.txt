proof: Let A be a complex n×n matrix, with entries aij_ij. For i∈1,…,n∈{1,…,n} let Ri_i be the sum of the absolute values of the non-diagonal entries in the i-th row: Ri=∑j≠i|aij|._i=∑_j≠i|a_ij|. Let D(aii,Ri)⊆C(a_ii,R_i)⊆ℂ be a closed disc centered at aii_ii with radius Ri_i. Such a disc is called a Gershgorin disc. Theorem. Every eigenvalue of A lies within at least one of the Gershgorin discs D(aii,Ri).(a_ii,R_i). Proof. Let λλ be an eigenvalue of A with corresponding eigenvector x=(xj)=(x_j). Find i such that the element of x with the largest absolute value is xi_i. Since Ax=λx=, in particular we take the ith component of that equation to get: ∑jaijxj=λxi.∑_ja_ijx_j=_i. Taking aii_ii to the other side: ∑j≠iaijxj=(λ−aii)xi.∑_ja_ijx_j=(λ-a_ii)x_i. Therefore, applying the triangle inequality and recalling that |xj||xi|≤1|x_j|/|x_i|≤1 based on how we picked i, |λ−aii|=|∑j≠iaijxjxi|≤∑j≠i|aij|=Ri.|λ-a_ii|=|∑_ja_ijx_j/x_i|≤∑_j|a_ij|=R_i. Corollary. The eigenvalues of A must also lie within the Gershgorin discs Cj corresponding to the columns of A. Proof. Apply the Theorem to AT while recognizing that the eigenvalues of the transpose are the same as those of the original matrix. Example. For a diagonal matrix, the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum. Conversely, if the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum, the matrix is diagonal.
