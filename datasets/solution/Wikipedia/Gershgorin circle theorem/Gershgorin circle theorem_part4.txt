theorem: If one of the discs is disjoint from the others then it contains exactly one eigenvalue. If however it meets another disc it is possible that it contains no eigenvalue (for example, A=(0140)=([ 0 1; 4 0 ]) or A=(1−21−1)=([ 1 -2; 1 -1 ])). In the general case the theorem can be strengthened as follows: Theorem: If the union of k discs is disjoint from the union of the other n − k discs then the former union contains exactly k and the latter n − k eigenvalues of A, when the eigenvalues are counted with their algebraic multiplicities. Proof: Let D be the diagonal matrix with entries equal to the diagonal entries of A and let B(t)=(1−t)D+tA.(t)=(1-t)D+tA. We will use the fact that the eigenvalues are continuous in t, and show that if any eigenvalue moves from one of the unions to the other, then it must be outside all the discs for some t, which is a contradiction. The statement is true for D=B(0)=B(0). The diagonal entries of B(t)(t) are equal to that of A, thus the centers of the Gershgorin circles are the same, however their radii are t times that of A. Therefore, the union of the corresponding k discs of B(t)(t) is disjoint from the union of the remaining n-k for all t∈[0,1]∈[0,1]. The discs are closed, so the distance of the two unions for A is d>0>0. The distance for B(t)(t) is a decreasing function of t, so it is always at least d. Since the eigenvalues of B(t)(t) are a continuous function of t, for any eigenvalue λ(t)λ(t) of B(t)(t) in the union of the k discs its distance d(t)(t) from the union of the other n-k discs is also continuous. Obviously d(0)≥d(0), and assume λ(1)λ(1) lies in the union of the n-k discs. Then d(1)=0(1)=0, so there exists 0<t0<10<t_0<1 such that 0<d(t0)<d0<d(t_0)<d. But this means λ(t0)λ(t_0) lies outside the Gershgorin discs, which is impossible. Therefore λ(1)λ(1) lies in the union of the k discs, and the theorem is proven. Remarks: It is necessary to count the eigenvalues with respect to their algebraic multiplicities. Here is a counter-example : Consider the matrix, [5100005100005000001100001][ 5 1 0 0 0; 0 5 1 0 0; 0 0 5 0 0; 0 0 0 1 1; 0 0 0 0 1 ] The union of the first 3 disks does not intersect the last 2, but the matrix has only 2 eigenvectors, e1,e4, and therefore only 2 eigenvalues, demonstrating that theorem is false in its formulation. The demonstration of the shows only that eigenvalues are distinct, however any affirmation about number of them is something that does not fit, and this is a counterexample. The continuity of λ(t)λ(t) should be understood in the sense of topology. It is sufficient to show that the roots (as a point in space Cnℂ^n) is continuous function of its coefficients. Note that the inverse map that maps roots to coefficients is described by Vieta's formulas (note for Characteristic polynomial an≡1_n≡1) which can be proved an open map. This proves the roots as a whole is a continuous function of its coefficients. Since composition of continuous functions is again continuous, the λ(t)λ(t) as a composition of roots solver and B(t)(t) is also continuous. Individual eigenvalue λ(t)λ(t) could merge with other eigenvalue(s) or appeared from a splitting of previous eigenvalue. This may confuse people and questioning the concept of continuous. However, when viewing from the space of eigenvalue set Cnℂ^n, the trajectory is still a continuous curve although not necessarily smooth everywhere. Added Remark: The proof given above is arguably (in)correct...... There are two types of continuity concerning eigenvalues: (1) each individual eigenvalue is a usual continuous function (such a representation does exist on a real interval but may not exist on a complex domain), (2) eigenvalues are continuous as a whole in the topological sense (a mapping from the matrix space with metric induced by a norm to unordered tuples, i.e., the quotient space of C^n under permutation equivalence with induced metric). Whichever continuity is used in a proof of the Gerschgorin disk theorem, it should be justified that the sum of algebraic multiplicities of eigenvalues remains unchanged on each connected region. A proof using the argument principle of complex analysis requires no eigenvalue continuity of any kind.[1] For a brief discussion and clarification, see.[2]
