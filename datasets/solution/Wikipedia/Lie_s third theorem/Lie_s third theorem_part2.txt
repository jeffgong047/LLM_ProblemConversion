notes: The equivalence between the category of simply connected real Lie groups and finite-dimensional real Lie algebras is usually called (in the literature of the second half of 20th century) Cartan's or the Cartan-Lie theorem as it was proved by Élie Cartan. Sophus Lie had previously proved the infinitesimal version: local solvability of the Maurer-Cartan equation, or the equivalence between the category of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and the category of local Lie groups. Lie listed his results as three direct and three converse theorems. The infinitesimal variant of Cartan's theorem was essentially Lie's third converse theorem. In an influential book[1] Jean-Pierre Serre called it the third theorem of Lie. The name is historically somewhat misleading, but often used in connection to generalizations. Serre provided two proofs in his book: one based on Ado's theorem and another recounting the proof by Élie Cartan.
