proof: The classical proof is straightforward but relies on Ado's theorem, whose proof is algebraic and highly non-trivial.[2] Ado's theorem states that any finite-dimensional Lie algebra can be represented by matrices. As a consequence, integrating such algebra of matrices via the matrix exponential yields a Lie group integrating the original Lie algebra. Cohomological
