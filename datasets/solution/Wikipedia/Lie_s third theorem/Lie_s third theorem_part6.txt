proof: A different geometric proof was discovered in 2000 by Duistermaat and Kolk.[5] Unlike the previous ones, it is a constructive proof: the integrating Lie group is built as the quotient of the (infinite-dimensional) Banach Lie group of paths on the Lie algebra by a suitable subgroup. This proof was influential for Lie theory[6] since it paved the way to the generalisation of Lie third theorem for Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids.[7] See
