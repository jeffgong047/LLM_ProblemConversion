games: Main article: Determinacy A Gale–Stewart game is a two-player game of perfect information. The game is defined using a set A, and is denoted GA. The two players alternate turns, and each player is aware of all moves before making the next one. On each turn, each player chooses a single element of A to play. The same element may be chosen more than once without restriction. The game can be visualized through the following diagram, in which the moves are made from left to right, with the moves of player I above and the moves of player II below. Ia1a3a5⋯IIa2a4a6⋯I a_1 a_3 a_5 ⋯ II a_2 a_4 a_6 ⋯ The play continues without end, so that a single play of the game determines an infinite sequence ⟨a1,a2,a3…⟩_1,a_2,a_3…⟩ of elements of A. The set of all such sequences is denoted Aω. The players are aware, from the beginning of the game, of a fixed payoff set (a.k.a. winning set) that will determine who wins. The payoff set is a subset of Aω. If the infinite sequence created by a play of the game is in the payoff set, then player I wins. Otherwise, player II wins; there are no ties. This definition initially does not seem to include traditional perfect information games such as chess, since the set of moves available in such games changes every turn. However, this sort of case can be handled by declaring that a player who makes an illegal move loses immediately, so that the Gale-Stewart notion of a game does in fact generalize the concept of a game defined by a game tree.
