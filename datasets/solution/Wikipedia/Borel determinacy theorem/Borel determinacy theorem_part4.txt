strategies: A winning strategy for a player is a function that tells the player what move to make from any position in the game, such that if the player follows the function they will surely win. More specifically, a winning strategy for player I is a function f that takes as input sequences of elements of A of even length and returns an element of A, such that player I will win every play of the form Ia1=f(⟨⟩)a3=f(⟨a1,a2⟩)a5=f(⟨a1,a2,a3,a4⟩)⋯IIa2a4a6⋯.I a_1=f(⟨⟩) a_3=f(_1,a_2⟩) a_5=f(_1,a_2,a_3,a_4⟩) ⋯ II a_2 a_4 a_6 ⋯. A winning strategy for player II is a function g that takes odd-length sequences of elements of A and returns elements of A, such that player II will win every play of the form Ia1a3a5⋯IIa2=g(⟨a1⟩)a4=g(⟨a1,a2,a3⟩)a6=g(⟨a1,a2,a3,a4,a5⟩)⋯.I a_1 a_3 a_5 ⋯ II a_2=g(_1⟩) a_4=g(_1,a_2,a_3⟩) a_6=g(_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5⟩) ⋯. At most one player can have a winning strategy; if both players had winning strategies, and played the strategies against each other, only one of the two strategies could win that play of the game. If one of the players has a winning strategy for a particular payoff set, that payoff set is said to be determined.
