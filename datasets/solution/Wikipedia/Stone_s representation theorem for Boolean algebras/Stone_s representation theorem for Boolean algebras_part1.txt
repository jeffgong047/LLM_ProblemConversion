(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mathematics, Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a certain field of sets. The theorem is fundamental to the deeper understanding of Boolean algebra that emerged in the first half of the 20th century. The theorem was first proved by Marshall H. Stone.[1] Stone was led to it by his study of the spectral theory of operators on a Hilbert space. Stone
