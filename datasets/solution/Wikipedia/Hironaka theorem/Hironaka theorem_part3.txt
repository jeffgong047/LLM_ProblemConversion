curves: Every algebraic curve has a unique nonsingular projective model, which means that all resolution methods are essentially the same because they all construct this model. In higher dimensions this is no longer true: varieties can have many different nonsingular projective models. Koll√°r (2007) lists about 20 ways of proving resolution of singularities of curves.
