functorial: Conical singularity x2 + y2 = z2 Some resolution methods (in characteristic 0) are functorial for all smooth morphisms. However it is not possible to find a strong resolution functorial for all (possibly non-smooth) morphisms. An example is given by the map from the affine plane A2 to the conical singularity x2 + y2 = z2 taking (X,Y) to (2XY, X2 âˆ’ Y2, X2 + Y2). The XY-plane is already nonsingular so should not be changed by resolution, and any resolution of the conical singularity factorizes through the minimal resolution given by blowing up the singular point. However the rational map from the XY-plane to this blowup does not extend to a regular map. Minimal resolutions need not
