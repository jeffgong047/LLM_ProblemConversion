blowup: The most obvious invariant of a singularity is its multiplicity. However this need not decrease under blowup, so it is necessary to use more subtle invariants to measure the improvement. For example, the rhamphoid cusp y2 = x5 has a singularity of order 2 at the origin. After blowing up at its singular point it becomes the ordinary cusp y2 = x3, which still has multiplicity 2. It is clear that the singularity has improved, since the degree of defining polynomial has decreased. This does not happen in general. An example where it does not is given by the isolated singularity of x2 + y3z + z3 = 0 at the origin. Blowing it up gives the singularity x2 + y2z + yz3 = 0. It is not immediately obvious that this new singularity is better, as both singularities have multiplicity 2 and are given by the sum of monomials of degrees 2, 3, and 4. Blowing up the most singular points does not
