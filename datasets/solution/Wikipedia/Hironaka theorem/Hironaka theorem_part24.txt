problem: It is easy to extend the definition of resolution to all schemes. Not all schemes have resolutions of their singularities: Grothendieck & Dieudonn√© (1965, section 7.9) showed that if a locally Noetherian scheme X has the property that one can resolve the singularities of any finite integral scheme over X, then X must be quasi-excellent. Grothendieck also suggested that the converse might hold: in other words, if a locally Noetherian scheme X is reduced and quasi excellent, then it is possible to resolve its singularities. When X is defined over a field of characteristic 0 and is Noetherian, this follows from Hironaka's theorem, and when X has dimension at most 2 it was proved by Lipman. Hauser (2010) gave a survey of work on the unsolved characteristic p resolution problem. Method of proof in characteristic
