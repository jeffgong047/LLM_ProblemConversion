method: Resolution of singularities in characteristic 0 in all dimensions was first proved by Hironaka (1964). He proved that it was possible to resolve singularities of varieties over fields of characteristic 0 by repeatedly blowing up along non-singular subvarieties, using a very complicated argument by induction on the dimension. Simplified versions of his formidable proof were given by several people, including Bierstone & Milman (1991), Bierstone & Milman (1997), Villamayor (1992) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFVillamayor1992 (help), Encinas & Villamayor (1998), Encinas & Hauser (2002), Wlodarczyk (2005), Koll√°r (2007). Some of the recent proofs are about a tenth of the length of Hironaka's original proof, and are easy enough to give in an introductory graduate course.
