For the technique used for graph C*-algebras and Leavitt path algebras, see Graph C*-algebra § Desingularization. Strong desingularization of X:=(x2−y3=0)⊂W:=R2.:=(x^2-y^3=0):=𝐑^2. Observe that the resolution does not stop after the first blowing-up, when the strict transform is smooth, but when it is simple normal crossings with the exceptional divisors. In algebraic geometry, the problem of resolution of singularities asks whether every algebraic variety V has a resolution, a non-singular variety W with a proper birational map W→V. For varieties over fields of characteristic 0 this was proved in Hironaka (1964),[1] while for varieties over fields of characteristic p it is an open problem in dimensions at least 4.[2]
