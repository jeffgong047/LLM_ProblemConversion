Provability logic In mathematical logic, Löb's theorem states that in Peano arithmetic (PA) (or any formal system including PA), for any formula P, if it is provable in PA that "if P is provable in PA then P is true", then P is provable in PA. If Prov(P) means that the formula P is provable, we may express this more formally as If PA⊢Prov(P)→P𝑃𝐴⊢Prov(P) then PA⊢P𝑃𝐴. An immediate corollary (the contrapositive) of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then "if P is provable in PA, then P is true" is not provable in PA. For example, "If 1+1=31+1=3 is provable in PA, then 1+1=31+1=3" is not provable in PA.[note 1] Löb's theorem is named for Martin Hugo Löb, who formulated it in 1955. It is related to Curry's paradox.
