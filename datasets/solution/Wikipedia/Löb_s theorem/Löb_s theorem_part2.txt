logic: Provability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in Gödel's incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of ϕϕ in the given system in the language of modal logic, by means of the modality ◻ϕϕ. Then we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom ◻(◻P→P)→◻P,()→, known as axiom GL, for Gödel–Löb. This is sometimes formalized by means of the inference rule: If ⊢◻P→P⊢ then ⊢P. The provability logic GL that results from taking the modal logic K4 (or K, since the axiom schema 4, ◻A→◻◻A→, then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.
