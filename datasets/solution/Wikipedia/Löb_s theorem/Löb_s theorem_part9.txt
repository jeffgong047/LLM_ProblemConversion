points: Not only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too. When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence) p↔A(p)(p) for any formula A(p) modalized in p can be derived.[2] Thus in normal modal logic, Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema 4, (◻A→◻◻A)(→), and the existence of modal fixed points.
