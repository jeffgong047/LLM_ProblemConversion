theorem: Much of the proof does not make use of the assumption ◻P→P, so for ease of understanding, the proof below is subdivided to leave the parts depending on ◻P→P until the end. Let P be any modal sentence. Apply the existence of modal fixed points to the formula F(X)=X→P(X)=X. It then follows that there exists a sentence ΨΨ such that ⊢Ψ↔(◻Ψ→P)⊢Ψ↔(Ψ). ⊢Ψ→(◻Ψ→P)⊢Ψ→(Ψ), from 1. ⊢◻(Ψ→(◻Ψ→P))⊢(Ψ→(Ψ)), from 2 by the necessitation rule. ⊢◻Ψ→◻(◻Ψ→P)⊢Ψ→(Ψ), from 3 and the box distributivity rule. ⊢◻(◻Ψ→P)→(◻◻Ψ→◻P)⊢(Ψ)→(Ψ→), by applying the box distributivity rule with A=◻Ψ=Ψ and B=P=P. ⊢◻Ψ→(◻◻Ψ→◻P)⊢Ψ→(Ψ→), from 4 and 5. ⊢◻Ψ→◻◻Ψ⊢Ψ→Ψ, from 6 by the internal necessitation rule. ⊢◻Ψ→◻P⊢Ψ→, from 6 and 7.Now comes the part of the proof where the hypothesis is used. Assume that ⊢◻P→P⊢. Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if P is provable, then it is, in fact true. This is a claim of soundness. ⊢◻Ψ→P⊢Ψ, from 8 and 9. ⊢(◻Ψ→P)→Ψ⊢(Ψ)→Ψ, from 1. ⊢Ψ⊢Ψ, from 10 and 11. ⊢◻Ψ⊢Ψ, from 12 by the necessitation rule. ⊢P, from 13 and 10.
