points: If F(X)(X) is a modal formula with only one propositional variable X, then a modal fixed point of F(X)(X) is a sentence ΨΨ such that ⊢Ψ↔F(◻Ψ)⊢Ψ(Ψ) We will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret ◻ as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points follows from the diagonal lemma. Modal rules of
