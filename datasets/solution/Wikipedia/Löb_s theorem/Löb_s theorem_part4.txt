formulas: We will assume the following grammar for formulas: If X is a propositional variable, then X is a formula. If K is a propositional constant, then K is a formula. If A is a formula, then ◻A is a formula. If A and B are formulas, then so are ¬A, A→B, A∧B, A∨B, and A↔B A modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use ⊢A to mean A is a theorem. Modal fixed
