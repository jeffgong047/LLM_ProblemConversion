inference: In addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator ◻, known as Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions: (necessitation) From ⊢A conclude ⊢◻A⊢: Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable. (internal necessitation) ⊢◻A→◻◻A⊢→: If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable. (box distributivity) ⊢◻(A→B)→(◻A→◻B)⊢(A)→(→): This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.
