Examples: An immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if P is not provable in PA, then "if P is provable in PA, then P is true" is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples: "If 1+1=31+1=3 is provable in PA, then 1+1=31+1=3" is not provable in PA, as 1+1=31+1=3 is not provable in PA (as it is false). "If 1+1=21+1=2 is provable in PA, then 1+1=21+1=2" is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form "If X, then 1+1=21+1=2". "If the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA, as "The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA (despite being true). In Doxastic logic, Löb's theorem shows that any system classified as a reflexive "type 4" reasoner must also be "modest": such a reasoner can never believe "my belief in P would imply that P is true", without also believing that P is true.[1] Gödel's second incompleteness theorem follows from Löb's theorem by substituting the false statement ⊥ for P.
