Statement: The theorem asserts the existence of positive constants C, K such that given any n points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true: There is a line which contains at least n/C of the points. There exist at least n2/K^2/K lines, each of which contains at least two of the points. In Beck's original argument, C is 100 and K is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of C and K are.
