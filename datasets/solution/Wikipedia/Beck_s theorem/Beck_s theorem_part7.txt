Proof: A proof of Beck's theorem can be given as follows. Consider a set P of n points in the plane. Let j be a positive integer. Let us say that a pair of points A, B in the set P is j-connected if the line connecting A and B contains between 2j2^j and 2j+1−12^j+1-1 points of P (including A and B). From the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, the number of such lines is O(n2/23j+n/2j)(n^2/2^3j+n/2^j), as follows: Consider the set P of n points, and the set L of all those lines spanned by pairs of points of P that contain at least 2j2^j points of P. Since no two points can lie on two distinct lines |L|⋅(2j2)≤(n2)|L|·2^j2≤n2. Now using Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, it follows that the number of incidences between P and L is at most O(n2/22j+n)(n^2/2^2j+n). All the lines connecting j-connected points also lie in L, and each contributes at least 2j2^j incidences. Therefore, the total number of such lines is O(n2/23j+n/2j)(n^2/2^3j+n/2^j). Since each such line connects together Ω(22j)Ω(2^2j) pairs of points, we thus see that at most O(n2/2j+2jn)(n^2/2^j+2^jn) pairs of points can be j-connected. Now, let C be a large constant. By summing the geometric series, we see that the number of pairs of points which are j-connected for some j satisfying C≤2j≤n/C≤2^j/C is at most O(n2/C)(n^2/C). On the other hand, the total number of pairs is n(n−1)2n(n-1)/2. Thus if we choose C to be large enough, we can find at least n2/4^2/4 pairs (for instance) which are not j-connected for any C≤2j≤n/C≤2^j/C. The lines that connect these pairs either pass through fewer than 2C points, or pass through more than n/C points. If the latter case holds for even one of these pairs, then we have the first conclusion of Beck's theorem. Thus we may assume that all of the n2/4^2/4 pairs are connected by lines which pass through fewer than 2C points. But each such line can connect at most C(2C−1)(2C-1) pairs of points. Thus there must be at least n2/4C(2C−1)^2/4C(2C-1) lines connecting at least two points, and the claim follows by taking K=4C(2C−1)=4C(2C-1).
