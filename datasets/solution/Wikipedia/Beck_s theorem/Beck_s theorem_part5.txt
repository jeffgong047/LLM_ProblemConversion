theorem: Beck's theorem says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points. Although not mentioned in Beck's paper, this result is implied by the Erdős–Beck theorem.[5]
