On lower bounds on the number of lines determined by a set of points in the plane For the category theory developed by a different author, see Beck's monadicity theorem. In discrete geometry, Beck's theorem is any of several different results, two of which are given below. Both appeared, alongside several other important theorems, in a well-known paper by József Beck.[1] The two results described below primarily concern lower bounds on the number of lines determined by a set of points in the plane. (Any line containing at least two points of point set is said to be determined by that point set.) Erdős–Beck
