theorem: The Erdős–Beck theorem is a variation of a classical result by L. M. Kelly and W. O. J. Moser[2] involving configurations of n points of which at most n − k are collinear, for some 0 < k < O(√n). They showed that if n is sufficiently large, relative to k, then the configuration spans at least kn − (1/2)(3k + 2)(k − 1) lines.[3] Elekes and Csaba Toth noted that the Erdős–Beck theorem does not easily extend to higher dimensions.[4] Take for example a set of 2n points in R3 all lying on two skew lines. Assume that these two lines are each incident to n points. Such a configuration of points spans only 2n planes. Thus, a trivial extension to the hypothesis for point sets in Rd is not sufficient to obtain the desired result. This result was first conjectured by Erdős, and proven by Beck.
