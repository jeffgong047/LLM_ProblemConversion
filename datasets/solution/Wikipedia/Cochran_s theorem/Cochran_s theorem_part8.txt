formulation: The following version is often seen when considering linear regression.[5] Suppose that Y∼Nn(0,σ2In)_n(0,σ^2I_n) is a standard multivariate normal random vector (here In_n denotes the n-by-n identity matrix), and if A1,…,Ak_1,…,A_k are all n-by-n symmetric matrices with ∑i=1kAi=In∑_i=1^kA_i=I_n. Then, on defining ri=Rank⁡(Ai)_i=Rank(A_i), any one of the following conditions implies the other two: ∑i=1kri=n,∑_i=1^kr_i=n, YTAiY∼σ2χri2^TA_iY∼σ^2χ_r_i^2 (thus the Ai_i are positive semidefinite) YTAiY^TA_iY is independent of YTAjY^TA_jY for i≠j..
