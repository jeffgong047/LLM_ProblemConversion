Distributions: The result for the distributions is written symbolically as ∑(Xi−X¯)2∼σ2χn−12.∑(X_i-X)^2∼σ^2χ_n-1^2. n(X¯−μ)2∼σ2χ12,(X-μ)^2∼σ^2χ_1^2, Both these random variables are proportional to the true but unknown variance σ2. Thus their ratio does not depend on σ2 and, because they are statistically independent. The distribution of their ratio is given by n(X¯−μ)21n−1∑(Xi−X¯)2∼χ121n−1χn−12∼F1,n−1n(X-μ)^2/1/n-1∑(X_i-X)^2∼χ_1^2/1/n-1χ_n-1^2_1,n-1 where F1,n − 1 is the F-distribution with 1 and n − 1 degrees of freedom (see also Student's t-distribution). The final step here is effectively the definition of a random variable having the F-distribution. Estimation of
