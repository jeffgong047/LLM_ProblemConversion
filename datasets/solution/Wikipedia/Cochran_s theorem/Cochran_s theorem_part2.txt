Statement: Let U1, ..., UN be i.i.d. standard normally distributed random variables, and U=[U1,...,UN]T=[U_1,...,U_N]^T. Let B(1),B(2),…,B(k)^(1),B^(2),…,B^(k)be symmetric matrices. Define ri to be the rank of B(i)^(i). Define Qi=UTB(i)U_i=U^TB^(i)U, so that the Qi are quadratic forms. Further assume ∑iQi=UTU∑_iQ_i=U^TU. Cochran's theorem states that the following are equivalent: r1+⋯+rk=N_1+⋯+r_k=N, the Qi are independent each Qi has a chi-squared distribution with ri degrees of freedom.[1][3] Often it's stated as ∑iAi=A∑_iA_i=A, where A is idempotent, and ∑iri=N∑_ir_i=N is replaced by ∑iri=rank(A)∑_ir_i=rank(A). But after an orthogonal transform, A=diag(IM,0)=diag(I_M,0), and so we reduce to the above theorem.
