Proof: Since the sequence is uniformly bounded, there is a real number M such that |fn(x)| ≤ M for all x ∈ S and for all n. Define g(x) = M for all x ∈ S. Then the sequence is dominated by g. Furthermore, g is integrable since it is a constant function on a set of finite measure. Therefore, the result follows from the dominated convergence theorem. If the assumptions hold only μ-almost everywhere, then there exists a μ-null set N ∈ Σ such that the functions fn1S\N satisfy the assumptions everywhere on S. Dominated convergence in Lp-spaces
