(corollary): Let (Ω,A,μ)(Ω,𝒜,μ) be a measure space, 1≤p<∞1<∞ a real number and (fn)(f_n) a sequence of A𝒜-measurable functions fn:Ω→C∪∞_n:Ω→ℂ∪{∞}. Assume the sequence (fn)(f_n) converges μμ-almost everywhere to an A𝒜-measurable function f, and is dominated by a g∈Lp^p (cf. Lp space), i.e., for every natural number n we have: |fn|≤g|f_n|, μ-almost everywhere. Then all fn_n as well as f are in Lp^p and the sequence (fn)(f_n) converges to f in the sense of Lp^p, i.e.: limn→∞‖fn−f‖p=limn→∞(∫Ω|fn−f|pdμ)1p=0.lim_n→∞f_n-f_p=lim_n→∞(∫_Ω|f_n-f|^p dμ)^1/p=0. Idea of the proof: Apply the original theorem to the function sequence hn=|fn−f|p_n=|f_n-f|^p with the dominating function (2g)p(2g)^p.
