Proof: Without loss of generality, one can assume that f is real, because one can split f into its real and imaginary parts (remember that a sequence of complex numbers converges if and only if both its real and imaginary counterparts converge) and apply the triangle inequality at the end. Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem is a special case of the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem. Below, however, is a direct proof that uses Fatou’s lemma as the essential tool. Since f is the pointwise limit of the sequence (fn) of measurable functions that are dominated by g, it is also measurable and dominated by g, hence it is integrable. Furthermore, (these will be needed later), |f−fn|≤|f|+|fn|≤2g|f-f_n|≤|f|+|f_n|≤2g for all n and limsupn→∞|f−fn|=0.lim sup_n→∞|f-f_n|=0. The second of these is trivially true (by the very definition of f). Using linearity and monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral, |∫Sfdμ−∫Sfndμ|=|∫S(f−fn)dμ|≤∫S|f−fn|dμ.|∫_Sf dμ-∫_Sf_n dμ|=|∫_S(f-f_n) dμ|≤∫_S|f-f_n| dμ. By the reverse Fatou lemma (it is here that we use the fact that |f−fn| is bounded above by an integrable function) limsupn→∞∫S|f−fn|dμ≤∫Slimsupn→∞|f−fn|dμ=0,lim sup_n→∞∫_S|f-f_n| dμ≤∫_Slim sup_n→∞|f-f_n| dμ=0, which implies that the limit exists and vanishes i.e. limn→∞∫S|f−fn|dμ=0.lim_n→∞∫_S|f-f_n| dμ=0. Finally, since limn→∞|∫Sfdμ−∫Sfndμ|≤limn→∞∫S|f−fn|dμ=0.lim_n→∞|∫_Sfdμ-∫_Sf_ndμ|≤lim_n→∞∫_S|f-f_n| dμ=0. we have that limn→∞∫Sfndμ=∫Sfdμ.lim_n→∞∫_Sf_n dμ=∫_Sf dμ. The theorem now follows. If the assumptions hold only μ-almost everywhere, then there exists a μ-null set N ∈ Σ such that the functions fn 1S \ N satisfy the assumptions everywhere on S. Then the function f(x) defined as the pointwise limit of fn(x) for x ∈ S \ N and by f(x) = 0 for x ∈ N, is measurable and is the pointwise limit of this modified function sequence. The values of these integrals are not influenced by these changes to the integrands on this μ-null set N, so the theorem continues to hold. DCT holds even if fn converges to f in measure (finite measure) and the dominating function is non-negative almost everywhere. Discussion of the
