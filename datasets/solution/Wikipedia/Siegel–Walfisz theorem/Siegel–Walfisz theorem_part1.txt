In analytic number theory, the Siegelâ€“Walfisz theorem was obtained by Arnold Walfisz[1] as an application of a theorem by Carl Ludwig Siegel[2] to primes in arithmetic progressions. It is a refinement both of the prime number theorem and of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.
