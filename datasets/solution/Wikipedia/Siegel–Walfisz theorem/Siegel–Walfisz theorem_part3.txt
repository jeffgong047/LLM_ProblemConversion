Remarks: The constant CN is not effectively computable because Siegel's theorem is ineffective. From the theorem we can deduce the following bound regarding the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions: If, for (a, q) = 1, by π(x;q,a)π(x;q,a) we denote the number of primes less than or equal to x which are congruent to a mod q, then π(x;q,a)=Li(x)φ(q)+O(xexp⁡(−CN2(log⁡x)12)),π(x;q,a)=Li(x)/φ(q)+O(xexp(-C_N/2()^1/2)), where N, a, q, CN and φ are as in the theorem, and Li denotes the logarithmic integral.
