In mathematics, the Bourbaki–Witt theorem in order theory, named after Nicolas Bourbaki and Ernst Witt, is a basic fixed point theorem for partially ordered sets. It states that if X is a non-empty chain complete poset, and f:X→X:X such that f(x)≥x(x) for all x,, then f has a fixed point. Such a function f is called inflationary or progressive.
