Applications: The Bourbaki–Witt theorem has various important applications. One of the most common is in the proof that the axiom of choice implies Zorn's lemma. We first prove it for the case where X is chain complete and has no maximal element. Let g be a choice function on P(X)−∅.(X)-{∅}. Define a function f:X→X:X by f(x)=g(y:y>x).(x)=g({y >x}). This is allowed as, by assumption, the set is non-empty. Then f(x) > x, so f is an inflationary function with no fixed point, contradicting the theorem. This special case of Zorn's lemma is then used to prove the Hausdorff maximality principle, that every poset has a maximal chain, which is easily seen to be equivalent to Zorn's Lemma. Bourbaki–Witt has other applications. In particular in computer science, it is used in the theory of computable functions. It is also used to define recursive data types, e.g. linked lists, in domain theory.
