poset: If the poset X is finite then the statement of the theorem has a clear interpretation that leads to the proof. The sequence of successive iterates, xn+1=f(xn),n=0,1,2,…,_n+1=f(x_n),n=0,1,2,…, where x0 is any element of X, is monotone increasing. By the finiteness of X, it stabilizes: xn=x∞,_n=x_∞, for n sufficiently large. It follows that x∞ is a fixed point of f. Proof of the
