theorem: Pick some y∈X. Define a function K recursively on the ordinals as follows: K(0)=y K(0)=y K(α+1)=f(K(α)). K(α+1)=f(K(α)). If ββ is a limit ordinal, then by construction K(α):α<β{K(α) alpha<β} is a chain in X. Define K(β)=supK(α):α<β.(β)=sup{K(α) alpha<β}. This is now an increasing function from the ordinals into X. It cannot be strictly increasing, as if it were we would have an injective function from the ordinals into a set, violating Hartogs' lemma. Therefore the function must be eventually constant, so for some α,K(α+1)=K(α);α, K(α+1)=K(α); that is, f(K(α))=K(α). f(K(α))=K(α). So letting x=K(α), x=K(α), we have our desired fixed point. Q.E.D.
