Relates rational elliptic curves to modular forms Modularity theoremFieldNumber theoryConjectured byYutaka TaniyamaGoro ShimuraConjectured in1957First proof byChristophe BreuilBrian ConradFred DiamondRichard TaylorFirst proof in2001ConsequencesFermat's Last Theorem The modularity theorem (formerly called the Taniyamaâ€“Shimura conjecture, Taniyama-Weil conjecture or modularity conjecture for elliptic curves) states that elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers are related to modular forms. Andrew Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat's Last Theorem. Later, a series of papers by Wiles's former students Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor, culminating in a joint paper with Christophe Breuil, extended Wiles's techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001.
