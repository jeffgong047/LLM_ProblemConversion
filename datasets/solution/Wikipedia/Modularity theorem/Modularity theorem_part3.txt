statements: The modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement: To each elliptic curve E over Q𝐐 we may attach a corresponding L-series. The L-series is a Dirichlet series, commonly written L(E,s)=∑n=1∞anns.(E,s)=∑_n=1^∞a_n/n^s. The generating function of the coefficients an_n is then f(E,q)=∑n=1∞anqn.(E,q)=∑_n=1^∞a_nq^n. If we make the substitution q=e2πiτ=e^2τ we see that we have written the Fourier expansion of a function f(E,τ)(E,τ) of the complex variable ττ, so the coefficients of the q-series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of f. The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a cusp form of weight two and level N and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all Hecke operators); this is the Hasse–Weil conjecture, which follows from the modularity theorem. Some modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to holomorphic differentials for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible Abelian varieties, corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher-dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is isogenous to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it).
