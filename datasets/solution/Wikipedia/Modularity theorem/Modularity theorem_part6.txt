Example: For example,[14][15][16] the elliptic curve y2−y=x3−x^2-y=x^3-x, with discriminant (and conductor) 37, is associated to the form f(z)=q−2q2−3q3+2q4−2q5+6q6+⋯,q=e2πiz(z)=q-2q^2-3q^3+2q^4-2q^5+6q^6+⋯,=e^2 For prime numbers ℓ not equal to 37, one can verify the property about the coefficients. Thus, for ℓ = 3, there are 6 solutions of the equation modulo 3: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1); thus a(3) = 3 − 6 = −3. The conjecture, going back to the 1950s, was completely proven by 1999 using ideas of Andrew Wiles, who proved it in 1994 for a large family of elliptic curves.[17] There are several formulations of the conjecture. Showing that they are equivalent was a main challenge of number theory in the second half of the 20th century. The modularity of an elliptic curve E of conductor N can be expressed also by saying that there is a non-constant rational map defined over Q, from the modular curve X0(N) to E. In particular, the points of E can be parametrized by modular functions. For example, a modular parametrization of the curve y2−y=x3−x^2-y=x^3-x is given by[18] x(z)=q−2+2q−1+5+9q+18q2+29q3+51q4+⋯y(z)=q−3+3q−2+9q−1+21+46q+92q2+180q3+⋯x(z) =q^-2+2q^-1+5+9q+18q^2+29q^3+51q^4+⋯ y(z) =q^-3+3q^-2+9q^-1+21+46q+92q^2+180q^3+⋯ where, as above, q = exp(2πiz). The functions x(z) and y(z) are modular of weight 0 and level 37; in other words they are meromorphic, defined on the upper half-plane Im(z) > 0 and satisfy x(az+bcz+d)=x(z)(az+b/cz+d)=x(z) and likewise for y(z), for all integers a, b, c, d with ad − bc = 1 and 37|c. Another formulation depends on the comparison of Galois representations attached on the one hand to elliptic curves, and on the other hand to modular forms. The latter formulation has been used in the proof of the conjecture. Dealing with the level of the forms (and the connection to the conductor of the curve) is particularly delicate. The most spectacular application of the conjecture is the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT). Suppose that for a prime p ≥ 5, the Fermat equation ap+bp=cp^p+b^p=c^p has a solution with non-zero integers, hence a counter-example to FLT. Then as Yves Hellegouarch [fr] was the first to notice,[19] the elliptic curve y2=x(x−ap)(x+bp)^2=x(x-a^p)(x+b^p) of discriminant Δ=1256(abc)2pΔ=1/256(abc)^2p cannot be modular.[7] Thus, the proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for this family of elliptic curves (called Hellegouarch–Frey curves) implies FLT. The proof of the link between these two statements, based on an idea of Gerhard Frey (1985), is difficult and technical. It was established by Kenneth Ribet in 1987.[20] See
