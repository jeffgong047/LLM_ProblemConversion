Gives the Gaussian curvature of a surface from the length of a geodesic circle or its area In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces, the Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem expresses the Gaussian curvature of a surface in terms of the circumference of a geodesic circle, or the area of a geodesic disc. The theorem is named for Joseph Bertrand, Victor Puiseux, and Charles François Diguet. Let p be a point on a smooth surface M. The geodesic circle of radius r centered at p is the set of all points whose geodesic distance from p is equal to r. Let C(r) denote the circumference of this circle, and A(r) denote the area of the disc contained within the circle. The Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem asserts that K(p)=limr→0+32πr−C(r)πr3=limr→0+12πr2−A(r)πr4.(p)=lim_r→0^+32-C(r)/^3=lim_r→0^+12^2-A(r)/^4. The theorem is closely related to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.
