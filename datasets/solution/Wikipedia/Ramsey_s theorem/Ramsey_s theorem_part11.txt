Asymptotics: The inequality R(r, s) ≤ R(r − 1, s) + R(r, s − 1) may be applied inductively to prove that R(r,s)≤(r+s−2r−1).(r,s)≤r+s-2r-1. In particular, this result, due to Erdős and Szekeres, implies that when r = s, R(s,s)≤(1+o(1))4s−1πs.(s,s)≤(1+o(1))4^s-1/√(). An exponential lower bound, R(s,s)≥(1+o(1))s2e2s/2,(s,s)≥(1+o(1))s/√(2)e2^s/2, was given by Erdős in 1947 and was instrumental in his introduction of the probabilistic method. There is obviously a huge gap between these two bounds: for example, for s = 10, this gives 101 ≤ R(10, 10) ≤ 48,620. Nevertheless, the exponential growth factors of either bound were not improved for a long time, and that for the lower bound still stands at √2. There is no known explicit construction producing an exponential lower bound. The best known lower and upper bounds for diagonal Ramsey numbers are [1+o(1)]2se2s2≤R(s,s)≤s−(clog⁡s)/(log⁡log⁡s)4s,[1+o(1)]√(2)s/e2^s/2(s,s)^-(c)/(log)4^s, due to Spencer and Conlon respectively, while a 2023 preprint[16][17] by Morris, Campos, Griffiths and Sahasrabudhe claims to have made exponential progress using an algorithmic construction relaying on a graph structure dubbed books, improving the upper bound to R(s,s)≤(4−ε)sandR(s,t)≤e−δt+o(s)(s+tt).(s,s)≤(4-ε)^sandR(s,t)^-+o(s)s+tt. with ε=2−7ε=2^-7 and δ=50−1δ=50^-1 where it is believed these parameters could be optimized in particular εε. For the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers R(3, t), it is known that they are of order t2/log t; this may be stated equivalently as saying that the smallest possible independence number in an n-vertex triangle-free graph is Θ(nlog⁡n).Θ(√(n)). The upper bound for R(3, t) is given by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi,[18] the lower bound was obtained originally by Kim,[19] and was improved by Griffiths, Morris, Fiz Pontiveros,[20] and Bohman and Keevash,[21] by analysing the triangle-free process, and more broadly these works set the best known asymptotic bounds on t for general off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, R(s, t) cs′ts+12(log⁡t)s+12−1s−2≤R(s,t)≤csts−1(log⁡t)s−2,'_st^s+1/2/()^s+1/2-1/s-2(s,t)_st^s-1/()^s-2, For s=4=4 the bounds become cs′t52(log⁡t)−2≤R(4,t)≤cst3(log⁡t)−2'_st^5/2()^-2(4,t)_st^3()^-2, but a 2023 preprint[22][23] has improved the lower bound to cs′t3(log⁡t)−4'_st^3()^-4 which settles a question of Erdos who offered 250 dollars for a proof that the lower limit has form cs′t3(log⁡t)−d'_st^3()^-d.[24][25] Induced
