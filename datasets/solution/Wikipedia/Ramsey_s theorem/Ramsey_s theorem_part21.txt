finite: It is possible to deduce the finite Ramsey theorem from the infinite version by a proof by contradiction. Suppose the finite Ramsey theorem is false. Then there exist integers c, n, T such that for every integer k, there exists a c-colouring of [k](n) without a monochromatic set of size T. Let Ck denote the c-colourings of [k](n) without a monochromatic set of size T. For any k, the restriction of a colouring in Ck+1 to [k](n) (by ignoring the colour of all sets containing k + 1) is a colouring in Ck. Define Ck1_k^1 to be the colourings in Ck which are restrictions of colourings in Ck+1. Since Ck+1 is not empty, neither is Ck1_k^1. Similarly, the restriction of any colouring in Ck+11_k+1^1 is in Ck1_k^1, allowing one to define Ck2_k^2 as the set of all such restrictions, a non-empty set. Continuing so, define Ckm_k^m for all integers m, k. Now, for any integer k, Ck⊇Ck1⊇Ck2⊇⋯_k_k^1_k^2⊇⋯ and each set is non-empty. Furthermore, Ck is finite as |Ck|≤ck!n!(k−n)!|C_k|^k!/n!(k-n)! It follows that the intersection of all of these sets is non-empty, and let Dk=Ck∩Ck1∩Ck2∩⋯_k=C_k_k^1_k^2∩⋯ Then every colouring in Dk is the restriction of a colouring in Dk+1. Therefore, by unrestricting a colouring in Dk to a colouring in Dk+1, and continuing doing so, one constructs a colouring of N(n)ℕ^(n) without any monochromatic set of size T. This contradicts the infinite Ramsey theorem. If a suitable topological viewpoint is taken, this argument becomes a standard compactness argument showing that the infinite version of the theorem implies the finite version.[41]
