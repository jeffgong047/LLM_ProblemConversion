colors: We can also generalize the induced Ramsey's theorem to a multicolor setting. For graphs H1, H2, …, Hr, define rind(H1, H2, …, Hr) to be the minimum number of vertices in a graph G such that any coloring of the edges of G into r colors contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to Hi where all edges are colored in the i-th color for some 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Let rind(H;q) := rind(H, H, …, H) (q copies of H). It is possible to derive a bound on rind(H;q) which is approximately a tower of two of height ~ log q by iteratively applying the bound on the two-color case. The current best known bound is due to Fox and Sudakov, which achieves rind(H;q) ≤ 2ck3, where k is the number of vertices of H and c is a constant depending only on q.[37]
