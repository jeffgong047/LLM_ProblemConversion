cardinals: Main article: Ramsey cardinal In terms of the partition calculus Ramsey's theorem can be stated as ℵ0→(ℵ0)knℵ_0→(ℵ_0)_k^n for all finite n and k. A Ramsey cardinal, κκ, is a large cardinal axiomatically defined to satisfy the related formula: κ→(κ)2<ωκ→(κ)_2^<ω. Relationship to the axiom of
