case: The theorem for the 2-colour case can be proved by induction on r + s.[3] It is clear from the definition that for all n, R(n, 2) = R(2, n) = n. This starts the induction. We prove that R(r, s) exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis R(r − 1, s) and R(r, s − 1) exist. Lemma 1. R(r,s)≤R(r−1,s)+R(r,s−1).(r,s)(r-1,s)+R(r,s-1). Proof. Consider a complete graph on R(r − 1, s) + R(r, s − 1) vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex v from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets M and N, such that for every vertex w, w is in M if edge (vw) is blue, and w is in N if (vw) is red. Because the graph has R(r−1,s)+R(r,s−1)=|M|+|N|+1(r-1,s)+R(r,s-1)=|M|+|N|+1 vertices, it follows that either |M|≥R(r−1,s)|M|(r-1,s) or |N|≥R(r,s−1).|N|(r,s-1). In the former case, if M has a red Ks then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise M has a blue Kr − 1 and so M∪v∪{v} has a blue Kr by the definition of M. The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours. In this 2-colour case, if R(r − 1, s) and R(r, s − 1) are both even, the induction inequality can be strengthened to:[4] R(r,s)≤R(r−1,s)+R(r,s−1)−1.(r,s)(r-1,s)+R(r,s-1)-1. Proof. Suppose p = R(r − 1, s) and q = R(r, s − 1) are both even. Let t = p + q − 1 and consider a two-coloured graph of t vertices. If di is degree of i-th vertex in the blue subgraph, then, according to the Handshaking lemma, ∑i=1tdi∑_i=1^td_i is even. Given that t is odd, there must be an even di. Assume d1 is even, M and N are the vertices incident to vertex 1 in the blue and red subgraphs, respectively. Then both |M|=d1|M|=d_1 and |N|=t−1−d1|N|=t-1-d_1 are even. According to the Pigeonhole principle, either |M|≥p−1,|M|-1, or |N|≥q.|N|≧. Since |M| is even, while p – 1 is odd, the first inequality can be strengthened, so either |M|≥p|M| or |N|≥q.|N|≧. Suppose |M|≥p=R(r−1,s).|M|=R(r-1,s). Then either the M subgraph has a red Ks and the proof is complete, or it has a blue Kr – 1 which along with vertex 1 makes a blue Kr. The case |N|≥q=R(r,s−1)|N|≧=R(r,s-1) is treated similarly. Case of more
