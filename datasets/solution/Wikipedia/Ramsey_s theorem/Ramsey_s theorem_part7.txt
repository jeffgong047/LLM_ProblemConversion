colours: Lemma 2. If c > 2, then R(n1,…,nc)≤R(n1,…,nc−2,R(nc−1,nc)).(n_1,…,n_c)(n_1,…,n_c-2,R(n_c-1,n_c)). Proof. Consider a complete graph of R(n1,…,nc−2,R(nc−1,nc))(n_1,…,n_c-2,R(n_c-1,n_c)) vertices and colour its edges with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c − 1 and c are the same colour. Thus the graph is now (c − 1)-coloured. Due to the definition of R(n1,…,nc−2,R(nc−1,nc)),(n_1,…,n_c-2,R(n_c-1,n_c)), such a graph contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c − 2 or a KR(nc − 1, nc)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(nc − 1, nc) we must have either a (c − 1)-monochrome Knc − 1 or a c-monochrome Knc. In either case the proof is complete. Lemma 1 implies that any R(r,s) is finite. The right hand side of the inequality in Lemma 2 expresses a Ramsey number for c colours in terms of Ramsey numbers for fewer colours. Therefore any R(n1, …, nc) is finite for any number of colours. This proves the theorem. Ramsey
