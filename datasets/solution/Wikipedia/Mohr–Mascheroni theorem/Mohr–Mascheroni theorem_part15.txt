line: Compass only construction of intersection of a circle and a line (circle center on line) Given the circle C(D) whose center C lies on the line AB, find the points P and Q, the intersection points of the circle and the line.[17] Construct point D' â‰  D as the other intersection of circles A(D) and C(D). Construct point F as the intersection of circles C(DD' ) and D(C). (F is the fourth vertex of parallelogram CD'DF.) Construct point F' as the intersection of circles C(DD' ) and D' (C). (F' is the fourth vertex of parallelogram CDD'F'.) Construct point M as an intersection of circles F(D' ) and F' (D). (M lies on AB.) Points P and Q are the intersections of circles F(CM) and C(D). Thus it has been shown that all of the basic construction one can perform with a straightedge and compass can be done with a compass alone, provided that it is understood that a line cannot be literally drawn but merely defined by two points.
