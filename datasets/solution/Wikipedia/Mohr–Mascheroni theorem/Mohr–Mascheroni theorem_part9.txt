segment: A compass-only construction of doubling the length of segment AB Given a line segment AB find a point C on the line AB such that B is the midpoint of line segment AC.[10] Construct point D as the intersection of circles A(B) and B(A). (∆ABD is an equilateral triangle.) Construct point E ≠ A as the intersection of circles D(B) and B(D). (∆DBE is an equilateral triangle.) Finally, construct point C ≠ D as the intersection of circles B(E) and E(B). (∆EBC is an equilateral triangle, and the three angles at B show that A, B and C are collinear.) This construction can be repeated as often as necessary to find a point Q so that the length of line segment AQ = n⋅ length of line segment AB for any positive integer n. Inversion in a
