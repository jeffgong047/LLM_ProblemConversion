History: The result was originally published by Georg Mohr in 1672,[2] but his proof languished in obscurity until 1928.[3][4][5] The theorem was independently discovered by Lorenzo Mascheroni in 1797 and it was known as Mascheroni's Theorem until Mohr's work was rediscovered.[6] Several proofs of the result are known. Mascheroni's proof of 1797 was generally based on the idea of using reflection in a line as the major tool. Mohr's solution was different.[3] In 1890, August Adler published a proof using the inversion transformation.[7] An algebraic approach uses the isomorphism between the Euclidean plane and the real coordinate space R2‚Ñù^2. In this way, a stronger version of the theorem was proven in 1990.[8] It also shows the dependence of the theorem on Archimedes' axiom (which cannot be formulated in a first-order language).
