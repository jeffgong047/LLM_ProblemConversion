#3): Compass-only construction of the intersection of two lines (not all construction steps shown) Given non-parallel lines AB and CD, find their point of intersection, X.[13] Select circle O(r) of arbitrary radius whose center O does not lie on either line. Invert points A and B in circle O(r) to points A' and B' respectively. The line AB is inverted to the circle passing through O, A' and B'. Find the center E of this circle. Invert points C and D in circle O(r) to points C' and D' respectively. The line CD is inverted to the circle passing through O, C' and D'. Find the center F of this circle. Let Y â‰  O be the intersection of circles E(O) and F(O). X is the inverse of Y in the circle O(r). Intersection of a line and a circle (construction
