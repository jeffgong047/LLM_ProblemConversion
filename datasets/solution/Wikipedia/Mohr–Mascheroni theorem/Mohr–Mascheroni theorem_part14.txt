line: Assume that center of the circle does not lie on the line. Line-circle intersection (non-collinear case) Given a circle C(r) (in black) and a line AB. We wish to construct the points of intersection, P and Q, between them (if they exist).[14][15] Construct the point D, which is the reflection of point C across line AB. (See above.) Under the assumption of this case, C â‰  D. Construct a circle D(r) (in red). (See above, compass equivalence.) The intersections of circle C(r) and the new red circle D(r) are points P and Q. If the two circles are (externally) tangential then P=Q=Q. Points P and Q are the intersection points of circle C(r) and the line AB. If P=Q=Q then the line is tangential to the circle C(r)(r). An alternate construction, using circle inversion can also be given.[13] Given a circle C(r) and a line AB. We wish to construct the points of intersection, P and Q, between them (if they exist). Invert points A and B in circle C(r) to points A' and B' respectively. Under the assumption of this case, points A', B', and C are not collinear. Find the center E of the circle passing through points C, A', and B'. Construct circle E(C), which represents the inversion of the line AB into circle C(r). P and Q are the intersection points of circles C(r) and E(C).[16] If the two circles are (internally) tangential then P=Q=Q, and the line is also tangential. Circle center is collinear with the
