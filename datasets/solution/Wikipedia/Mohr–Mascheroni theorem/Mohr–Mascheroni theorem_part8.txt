line: Point symmetry Given a line segment AB and a point C not on the line determined by that segment, construct the image of C upon reflection across this line. Construct two circles: one centered at A and one centered at B, both passing through C. D, the other point of intersection of the two circles, is the reflection of C across the line AB. If C = D (that is, there is a unique point of intersection of the two circles), then C is its own reflection and lies on the line AB (contrary to the assumption), and the two circles are internally tangential.
