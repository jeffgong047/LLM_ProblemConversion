circle: Point inversion in a circle Given a circle B(r), for some radius r (in black) and a point D (≠ B) construct the point I that is the inverse of D in the circle.[11] Naturally there is no inversion for a point D=B=B. Draw a circle D(B) (in red). Assume that the red circle intersects the black circle at E and E' if the circles do not intersect in two points see below for an alternative construction. if the circles intersect in only one point, E=E′=E', it is possible to invert D simply by doubling the length of EB (quadrupling the length of DB). Reflect the circle center B across the line EE′': Construct two new circles E(B) and E' (B) (in light blue). The light blue circles intersect at B and at another point I ≠ B. Point I is the desired inverse of D in the black circle. Point I is such that the radius r of B(r) is to IB as DB is to the radius; or IB / r = r / DB. In the event that the above construction fails (that is, the red circle and the black circle do not intersect in two points),[12] find a point Q on the line BD so that the length of line segment BQ is a positive integral multiple, say n, of the length of BD and is greater than r / 2 (this is possible by Archimede's axiom). Find Q' the inverse of Q in circle B(r) as above (the red and black circles must now intersect in two points). The point I is now obtained by extending BQ' so that BI = n ⋅ BQ' .
