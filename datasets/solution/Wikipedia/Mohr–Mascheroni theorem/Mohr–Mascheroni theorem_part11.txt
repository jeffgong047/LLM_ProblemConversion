points: Compass-only construction of the center of a circle through three points (A,B,C) Given three non-collinear points A, B and C, find the center O of the circle they determine.[13] Construct point D, the inverse of C in the circle A(B). Reflect A in the line BD to the point X. O is the inverse of X in the circle A(B). Intersection of two non-parallel lines (construction
