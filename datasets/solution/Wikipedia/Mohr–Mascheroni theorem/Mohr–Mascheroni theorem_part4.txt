Outline: To prove the theorem, each of the basic constructions of compass and straightedge need to be proven to be possible by using a compass alone, as these are the foundations of, or elementary steps for, all other constructions. These are: Creating the line through two existing points Creating the circle through one point with centre another point Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect) Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect). #1 - A line through two points It is understood that a straight line cannot be drawn without a straightedge. A line is considered to be given by any two points, as any such pair define a unique line. In keeping with the intent of the theorem which we aim to prove, the actual line need not be drawn but for aesthetic reasons. #2 - A circle through one point with defined center This can be done with a compass alone. A straightedge is not required for this. #5 - Intersection of two circles This construction can also be done directly with a compass. #3, #4 - The other constructions Thus, to prove the theorem, only compass-only constructions for #3 and #4 need to be given.
