Formulation: The proof of the theorem is commonly illustrated for the setup of Bell tests in which two observers Alice and Bob perform local observations on a common bipartite system, and uses the statistical machinery of quantum mechanics, namely density states and quantum operations.[1] Alice and Bob perform measurements on system S whose underlying Hilbert space is H=HA⊗HB.=H_A_B. It is also assumed that everything is finite-dimensional to avoid convergence issues. The state of the composite system is given by a density operator on H. Any density operator σ on H is a sum of the form: σ=∑iTi⊗Siσ=∑_iT_i_i where Ti and Si are operators on HA and HB respectively. For the following, it is not required to assume that Ti and Si are state projection operators: i.e. they need not necessarily be non-negative, nor have a trace of one. That is, σ can have a definition somewhat broader than that of a density matrix; the theorem still holds. Note that the theorem holds trivially for separable states. If the shared state σ is separable, it is clear that any local operation by Alice will leave Bob's system intact. Thus the point of the theorem is no communication can be achieved via a shared entangled state. Alice performs a local measurement on her subsystem. In general, this is described by a quantum operation, on the system state, of the following kind P(σ)=∑k(Vk⊗IHB)∗σ(Vk⊗IHB),(σ)=∑_k(V_k_H_B)^* sigmaV_k_H_B), where Vk are called Kraus matrices which satisfy ∑kVkVk∗=IHA.∑_kV_kV_k^*=I_H_A. The term IHB_H_B from the expression (Vk⊗IHB)(V_k_H_B) means that Alice's measurement apparatus does not interact with Bob's subsystem. Supposing the combined system is prepared in state σ and assuming, for purposes of argument, a non-relativistic situation, immediately (with no time delay) after Alice performs her measurement, the relative state of Bob's system is given by the partial trace of the overall state with respect to Alice's system. In symbols, the relative state of Bob's system after Alice's operation is trHA⁡(P(σ))tr_H_A(P(σ)) where trHAtr_H_A is the partial trace mapping with respect to Alice's system. One can directly calculate this state: trHA⁡(P(σ))=trHA⁡(∑k(Vk⊗IHB)∗σ(Vk⊗IHB))=trHA⁡(∑k∑iVk∗TiVk⊗Si)=∑i∑ktr⁡(Vk∗TiVk)Si=∑i∑ktr⁡(TiVkVk∗)Si=∑itr⁡(Ti∑kVkVk∗)Si=∑itr⁡(Ti)Si=trHA⁡(σ).tr_H_A(P(σ)) =tr_H_A(∑_k(V_k_H_B)^*σ(V_k_H_B)) =tr_H_A(∑_k∑_iV_k^*T_iV_k_i) =∑_i∑_ktr(V_k^*T_iV_k)S_i =∑_i∑_ktr(T_iV_kV_k^*)S_i =∑_itr(T_i∑_kV_kV_k^*)S_i =∑_itr(T_i)S_i =tr_H_A(σ). From this it is argued that, statistically, Bob cannot tell the difference between what Alice did and a random measurement (or whether she did anything at all). Some
