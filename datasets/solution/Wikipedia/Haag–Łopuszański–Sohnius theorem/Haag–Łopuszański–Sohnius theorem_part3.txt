Theorem: The main assumptions of the Coleman–Mandula theorem are that the theory includes an S-matrix with analytic scattering amplitudes such that any two-particle state must undergo some reaction at almost all energies and scattering angles.[4] Furthermore, there must only be a finite number of particle types below any mass, disqualifying massless particles. The theorem then restricts the Lie algebra of the theory to be a direct sum of the Poincare algebra with some internal symmetry algebra. The Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem is based on the same assumptions, except for allowing additional anticommutating generators, elevating the Lie algebra to a Lie superalgebra. In four dimensions the theorem states that the only nontrivial anticommutating generators that can be added are a set of N𝒩 pairs of supercharges QαL_α^L and Q¯α˙RQ̅_α̇^R which commute with the momentum generator and transform as left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors. The undotted and dotted index notation, known as Van der Waerden notation, distinguishes left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors from each other. Generators of other spin, such spin-3/2 or higher, are disallowed by the theorem.[5] In a basis where (Q¯α˙A)=(QαA)†(Q̅_α̇^A)=(Q_α^A)^†, these supercharges satisfy QαA,QβB=ϵαβZAB,QαA,Q¯β˙B=δABσαβ˙μPμ,{Q_α^A,Q_β^B}=ϵ_αβZ^AB, {Q_α^A,Q̅_β̇^B}=δ^ABσ_αβ̇^μP_μ, where ZAB^AB are known as central charges, which commute with all generators of the superalgebra. Together with the Poincaré algebra, this Lie superalgebra is known as the super-Poincaré algebra. Since four dimensional Minkowski spacetime also admits Majorana spinors as fundamental spinor representations, the algebra can equivalently be written in terms of four-component Majorana spinor supercharges, with the algebra generally expressed in terms of gamma matrices and the charge conjugation operator rather than Pauli matrices used for the two-component Weyl spinors.[6] The supercharges can also admit an additional Lie algebra symmetry known as R-symmetry, whose generators Bi_i satisfy [QαA,Bi]=∑BsiABQαB,[Q_α^A,B_i]=∑_Bs_i^ABQ_α^B, where siAB_i^AB are Hermitian representation matrices of the generators in the N𝒩-dimensional representation of the R-symmetry group.[7] For N=1𝒩=1 the central charge must vanish and the R-symmetry is given by a U(1)U(1) group, while for extended supersymmetry N>1𝒩>1, central charges need not be vanish, while the R-symmetry is a U(N)U(𝒩) group. If massless particles are allowed, then the algebra can additionally be extended using conformal generators: the dilaton generator D and the special conformal transformations generator Kμ_μ. For N𝒩 supercharges, there must also be the same number of superconformal transformations Sα_α which satisfy SαA,S¯β˙B=δABσαβ˙μKμ,{S_α^A,S̅_β̇^B}=δ^ABσ_αβ̇^μK_μ, with both the supercharges and the superconformal generators being charged under a U(N)U(𝒩) R-symmetry.[8] This algebra is an example of a superconformal algebra, in this four dimensional case is denoted by su(2,2|N)𝔰𝔲(2,2|𝒩).[9] Unlike for non-conformal supersymmetric algebras, the R-symmetry is always present in superconformal algebras.[10]
