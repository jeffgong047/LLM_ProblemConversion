prime: For every positive integer n, a primary decomposition in k[x,y][x,y] of the ideal I=⟨x2,xy⟩=^2,xy⟩ is I=⟨x2,xy⟩=⟨x⟩∩⟨x2,xy,yn⟩.=^2,xy⟩=⟩∩^2,xy,y^n⟩. The associated primes are ⟨x⟩⊂⟨x,y⟩.⟩⊂,y⟩. Example: Let N = R = k[x, y] for some field k, and let M be the ideal (xy, y2). Then M has two different minimal primary decompositions M = (y) ∩ (x, y2) = (y) ∩ (x + y, y2). The minimal prime is (y) and the embedded prime is (x, y). Non-associated prime between two associated
