primes: In k[x,y,z],[x,y,z], the ideal I=⟨x2,xy,xz⟩=^2,xy,xz⟩ has the (non-unique) primary decomposition I=⟨x2,xy,xz⟩=⟨x⟩∩⟨x2,y2,z2,xy,xz,yz⟩.=^2,xy,xz⟩=⟩∩^2,y^2,z^2,xy,xz,yz⟩. The associated prime ideals are ⟨x⟩⊂⟨x,y,z⟩,⟩⊂,y,z⟩, and ⟨x,y⟩,y⟩ is a non associated prime ideal such that ⟨x⟩⊂⟨x,y⟩⊂⟨x,y,z⟩.⟩⊂,y⟩⊂,y,z⟩. A complicated
