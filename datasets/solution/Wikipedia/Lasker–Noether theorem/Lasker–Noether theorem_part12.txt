case: The next theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ring to have primary decompositions for its ideals. Theorem — Let R be a commutative ring. Then the following are equivalent. Every ideal in R has a primary decomposition. R has the following properties: (L1) For every proper ideal I and a prime ideal P, there exists an x in R - P such that (I : x) is the pre-image of I RP under the localization map R → RP. (L2) For every ideal I, the set of all pre-images of I S−1R under the localization map R → S−1R, S running over all multiplicatively closed subsets of R, is finite. The proof is given at Chapter 4 of Atiyah–Macdonald as a series of exercises.[17] There is the following uniqueness theorem for an ideal having a primary decomposition. Theorem — Let R be a commutative ring and I an ideal. Suppose I has a minimal primary decomposition I=∩1rQi=∩_1^rQ_i (note: "minimal" implies Qi√(Q_i) are distinct.) Then The set E=Qi|1≤i≤r={√(Q_i)|1} is the set of all prime ideals in the set (I:x)|x∈R{√((I:x))|x}. The set of minimal elements of E is the same as the set of minimal prime ideals over I. Moreover, the primary ideal corresponding to a minimal prime P is the pre-image of I RP and thus is uniquely determined by I. Now, for any commutative ring R, an ideal I and a minimal prime P over I, the pre-image of I RP under the localization map is the smallest P-primary ideal containing I.[18] Thus, in the setting of preceding theorem, the primary ideal Q corresponding to a minimal prime P is also the smallest P-primary ideal containing I and is called the P-primary component of I. For example, if the power Pn of a prime P has a primary decomposition, then its P-primary component is the n-th symbolic power of P. Additive theory of
