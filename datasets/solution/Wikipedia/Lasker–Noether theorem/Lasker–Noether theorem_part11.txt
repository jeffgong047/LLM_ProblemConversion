primes: Let R be a Noetherian ring. Then The set of zero-divisors on R is the same as the union of the associated primes of R (this is because the set of zerodivisors of R is the union of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements, the maximal elements of which are associated primes).[10] For the same reason, the union of the associated primes of an R-module M is exactly the set of zero-divisors on M, that is, an element r such that the endomorphism m↦rm,M→M,M is not injective.[11] Given a subset Φ⊂Ass⁡(M)Φ⊂Ass(M), M an R-module , there exists a submodule N⊂M such that Ass⁡(N)=Ass⁡(M)−ΦAss(N)=Ass(M)-Φ and Ass⁡(M/N)=ΦAss(M/N)=Φ.[12] Let S⊂R be a multiplicative subset, M an R-module and ΦΦ the set of all prime ideals of R not intersecting S. Then p↦S−1p,AssR⁡(M)∩Φ→AssS−1R⁡(S−1M)𝔭^-1𝔭, Ass_R(M)∩Φ→Ass_S^-1R(S^-1M) is a bijection.[13] Also, AssR⁡(M)∩Φ=AssR⁡(S−1M)Ass_R(M)∩Φ=Ass_R(S^-1M).[14] Any prime ideal minimal with respect to containing an ideal J is in AssR(R/J).Ass_R(R/J). These primes are precisely the isolated primes. A module M over R has finite length if and only if M is finitely generated and Ass(M)Ass(M) consists of maximal ideals.[15] Let A→B be a ring homomorphism between Noetherian rings and F a B-module that is flat over A. Then, for each A-module E, AssB⁡(E⊗AF)=⋃p∈Ass⁡(E)AssB⁡(F/pF)Ass_B(E⊗_AF)=⋃_𝔭∈Ass(E)Ass_B(F/𝔭F).[16] Non-Noetherian
