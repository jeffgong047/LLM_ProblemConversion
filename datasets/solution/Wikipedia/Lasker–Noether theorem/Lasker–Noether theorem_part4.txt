product: The primary decomposition in k[x,y,z][x,y,z] of the ideal I=⟨x,yz⟩=,yz⟩ is I=⟨x,yz⟩=⟨x,y⟩∩⟨x,z⟩.=,yz⟩=,y⟩∩,z⟩. Because of the generator of degree one, I is not the product of two larger ideals. A similar example is given, in two indeterminates by I=⟨x,y(y+1)⟩=⟨x,y⟩∩⟨x,y+1⟩.=,y(y+1)⟩=,y⟩∩,y+1⟩.
