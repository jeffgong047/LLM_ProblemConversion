ideal: Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. An ideal I of R is called primary if it is a proper ideal and for each pair of elements x and y in R such that xy is in I, either x or some power of y is in I; equivalently, every zero-divisor in the quotient R/I/I is nilpotent. The radical of a primary ideal Q is a prime ideal and Q is said to be p𝔭-primary for p=Q𝔭=√(Q). Let I be an ideal in R. Then I has an irredundant primary decomposition into primary ideals: I=Q1∩⋯∩Qn=Q_1∩⋯_n}. Irredundancy means: Removing any of the Qi_i changes the intersection, i.e. for each i we have: ∩j≠iQj⊄Qi∩_jQ_j_i. The prime ideals Qi√(Q_i) are all distinct. Moreover, this decomposition is unique in the two ways: The set Qi∣i{√(Q_i)} is uniquely determined by I, and If p=Qi𝔭=√(Q_i) is a minimal element of the above set, then Qi_i is uniquely determined by I; in fact, Qi_i is the pre-image of IRp_𝔭 under the localization map R→Rp_𝔭. Primary ideals which correspond to non-minimal prime ideals over I are in general not unique (see an example below). For the existence of the decomposition, see #Primary decomposition from associated primes below. The elements of Qi∣i{√(Q_i)} are called the prime divisors of I or the primes belonging to I. In the language of module theory, as discussed below, the set Qi∣i{√(Q_i)} is also the set of associated primes of the R-module R/I/I. Explicitly, that means that there exist elements g1,…,gn_1,…,g_n in R such that Qi=f∈R∣fgi∈I.√(Q_i)={f_i}.[3] By a way of shortcut, some authors call an associated prime of R/I/I simply an associated prime of I (note this practice will conflict with the usage in the module theory). The minimal elements of Qi∣i{√(Q_i)} are the same as the minimal prime ideals containing I and are called isolated primes. The non-minimal elements, on the other hand, are called the embedded primes. In the case of the ring of integers Zℤ, the Lasker–Noether theorem is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. If an integer n has prime factorization n=±p1d1⋯prdr=_1^d_1_r^d_r, then the primary decomposition of the ideal ⟨n⟩⟩ generated by n in Zℤ, is ⟨n⟩=⟨p1d1⟩∩⋯∩⟨prdr⟩.⟩=_1^d_1⟩∩⋯∩_r^d_r⟩. Similarly, in a unique factorization domain, if an element has a prime factorization f=up1d1⋯prdr,=up_1^d_1_r^d_r, where u is a unit, then the primary decomposition of the principal ideal generated by f is ⟨f⟩=⟨p1d1⟩∩⋯∩⟨prdr⟩.⟩=_1^d_1⟩∩⋯∩_r^d_r⟩.
