Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring R and N a submodule. To show N admits a primary decomposition, by replacing M by M/N/N, it is enough to show that when N=0=0. Now, 0=∩Qi⟺∅=Ass⁡(∩Qi)=∩Ass⁡(Qi)0=_i∅=Ass(_i)=∩Ass(Q_i) where Qi_i are primary submodules of M. In other words, 0 has a primary decomposition if, for each associated prime P of M, there is a primary submodule Q such that P∉Ass⁡(Q)∉Ass(Q). Now, consider the set N⊆M|P∉Ass⁡(N){N|P∉Ass(N)} (which is nonempty since zero is in it). The set has a maximal element Q since M is a Noetherian module. If Q is not P-primary, say, P′≠P' is associated with M/Q/Q, then R/P′≃Q′/Q/P''/Q for some submodule Q', contradicting the maximality. Thus, Q is primary and the proof is complete. Remark: The same proof shows that if R, M, N are all graded, then Qi_i in the decomposition may be taken to be graded as well. ^ Bourbaki, Ch. IV, § 1, Corollary 3. ^ Bourbaki, Ch.
