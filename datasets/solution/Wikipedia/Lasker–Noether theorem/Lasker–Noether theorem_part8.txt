example: Unless for very simple examples, a primary decomposition may be hard to compute and may have a very complicated output. The following example has been designed for providing such a complicated output, and, nevertheless, being accessible to hand-written computation. Let P=a0xm+a1xm−1y+⋯+amymQ=b0xn+b1xn−1y+⋯+bnynP =a_0x^m+a_1x^m-1y+⋯+a_my^m Q =b_0x^n+b_1x^n-1y+⋯+b_ny^n be two homogeneous polynomials in x, y, whose coefficients a1,…,am,b0,…,bn_1,…,a_m,b_0,…,b_n are polynomials in other indeterminates z1,…,zh_1,…,z_h over a field k. That is, P and Q belong to R=k[x,y,z1,…,zh],=k[x,y,z_1,…,z_h], and it is in this ring that a primary decomposition of the ideal I=⟨P,Q⟩=,Q⟩ is searched. For computing the primary decomposition, we suppose first that 1 is a greatest common divisor of P and Q. This condition implies that I has no primary component of height one. As I is generated by two elements, this implies that it is a complete intersection (more precisely, it defines an algebraic set, which is a complete intersection), and thus all primary components have height two. Therefore, the associated primes of I are exactly the primes ideals of height two that contain I. It follows that ⟨x,y⟩,y⟩ is an associated prime of I. Let D∈k[z1,…,zh][z_1,…,z_h] be the homogeneous resultant in x, y of P and Q. As the greatest common divisor of P and Q is a constant, the resultant D is not zero, and resultant theory implies that I contains all products of D by a monomial in x, y of degree m + n – 1. As D∉⟨x,y⟩,∉,y⟩, all these monomials belong to the primary component contained in ⟨x,y⟩.,y⟩. This primary component contains P and Q, and the behavior of primary decompositions under localization shows that this primary component is t|∃e,Det∈I.{t|,D^et}. In short, we have a primary component, with the very simple associated prime ⟨x,y⟩,,y⟩, such all its generating sets involve all indeterminates. The other primary component contains D. One may prove that if P and Q are sufficiently generic (for example if the coefficients of P and Q are distinct indeterminates), then there is only another primary component, which is a prime ideal, and is generated by P, Q and D.
