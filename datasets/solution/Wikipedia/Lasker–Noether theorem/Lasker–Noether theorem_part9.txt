interpretation: In algebraic geometry, an affine algebraic set V(I) is defined as the set of the common zeros of an ideal I of a polynomial ring R=k[x1,…,xn].=k[x_1,…,x_n]. An irredundant primary decomposition I=Q1∩⋯∩Qr=Q_1∩⋯_r of I defines a decomposition of V(I) into a union of algebraic sets V(Qi), which are irreducible, as not being the union of two smaller algebraic sets. If Pi_i is the associated prime of Qi_i, then V(Pi)=V(Qi),(P_i)=V(Q_i), and Lasker–Noether theorem shows that V(I) has a unique irredundant decomposition into irreducible algebraic varieties V(I)=⋃V(Pi),(I)=(P_i), where the union is restricted to minimal associated primes. These minimal associated primes are the primary components of the radical of I. For this reason, the primary decomposition of the radical of I is sometimes called the prime decomposition of I. The components of a primary decomposition (as well as of the algebraic set decomposition) corresponding to minimal primes are said isolated, and the others are said embedded. For the decomposition of algebraic varieties, only the minimal primes are interesting, but in intersection theory, and, more generally in scheme theory, the complete primary decomposition has a geometric meaning.
