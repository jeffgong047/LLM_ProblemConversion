primes: Nowadays, it is common to do primary decomposition of ideals and modules within the theory of associated primes. Bourbaki's influential textbook Algèbre commutative, in particular, takes this approach. Let R be a ring and M a module over it. By definition, an associated prime is a prime ideal which is the annihilator of a nonzero element of M; that is, p=Ann⁡(m)𝔭=Ann(m) for some m∈M (this implies m≠0≠0). Equivalently, a prime ideal p𝔭 is an associated prime of M if there is an injection of R-modules R/p↪M/𝔭. A maximal element of the set of annihilators of nonzero elements of M can be shown to be a prime ideal and thus, when R is a Noetherian ring, there exists an associated prime of M if and only if M is nonzero. The set of associated primes of M is denoted by AssR⁡(M)Ass_R(M) or Ass⁡(M)Ass(M). Directly from the definition, If M=⨁iMi=⊕_iM_i, then Ass⁡(M)=⋃iAss⁡(Mi)Ass(M)=⋃_iAss(M_i). For an exact sequence 0→N→M→L→00→0, Ass⁡(N)⊂Ass⁡(M)⊂Ass⁡(N)∪Ass⁡(L)Ass(N)⊂Ass(M)⊂Ass(N)∪Ass(L).[4] If R is a Noetherian ring, then Ass⁡(M)⊂Supp⁡(M)Ass(M)⊂Supp(M) where SuppSupp refers to support.[5] Also, the set of minimal elements of Ass⁡(M)Ass(M) is the same as the set of minimal elements of Supp⁡(M)Supp(M).[5] If M is a finitely generated module over R, then there is a finite ascending sequence of submodules 0=M0⊊M1⊊⋯⊊Mn−1⊊Mn=M0=M_0_1⊊⋯_n-1_n=M such that each quotient Mi /Mi−1 is isomorphic to R/pi/𝔭_i for some prime ideals pi𝔭_i, each of which is necessarily in the support of M.[6] Moreover every associated prime of M occurs among the set of primes pi𝔭_i; i.e., Ass⁡(M)⊂p1,…,pn⊂Supp⁡(M)Ass(M)⊂{𝔭_1,…,𝔭_n}⊂Supp(M).[7] (In general, these inclusions are not the equalities.) In particular, Ass⁡(M)Ass(M) is a finite set when M is finitely generated. Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring R and N a submodule of M. Given Ass⁡(M/N)=p1,…,pnAss(M/N)={𝔭_1,…,𝔭_n}, the set of associated primes of M/N/N, there exist submodules Qi⊂M_i such that Ass⁡(M/Qi)=piAss(M/Q_i)={𝔭_i} and N=⋂i=1nQi.=⋂_i=1^nQ_i.[8][9] A submodule N of M is called p𝔭-primary if Ass⁡(M/N)=pAss(M/N)={𝔭}. A submodule of the R-module R is p𝔭-primary as a submodule if and only if it is a p𝔭-primary ideal; thus, when M=R=R, the above decomposition is precisely a primary decomposition of an ideal. Taking N=0=0, the above decomposition says the set of associated primes of a finitely generated module M is the same as Ass⁡(M/Qi)|i{Ass(M/Q_i)|i} when 0=∩1nQi0=∩_1^nQ_i (without finite generation, there can be infinitely many associated primes.)
