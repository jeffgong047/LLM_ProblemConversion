Formulation: Let X and Y be oriented smooth closed manifolds, and f: X → Y a continuous map. Let vf=f*(TY) − TX in the K-group K(X). If dim(X) ≡ dim(Y) mod 2, then ch(fK∗(x))=fH∗(ch(x)ed(vf)/2A^(vf)),ch(f_K*(x))=f_H*(ch(x)e^d(v_f)/2Â(v_f)), where ch is the Chern character, d(vf) an element of the integral cohomology group H2(Y, Z) satisfying d(vf) ≡ f* w2(TY)-w2(TX) mod 2, fK* the Gysin homomorphism for K-theory, and fH* the Gysin homomorphism for cohomology .[1] This theorem was first proven by Atiyah and Hirzebruch.[2] The theorem is proven by considering several special cases.[3] If Y is the Thom space of a vector bundle V over X, then the Gysin maps are just the Thom isomorphism. Then, using the splitting principle, it suffices to check the theorem via explicit computation for line bundles. If f: X → Y is an embedding, then the Thom space of the normal bundle of X in Y can be viewed as a tubular neighborhood of X in Y, and excision gives a map u:H∗(B(N),S(N))→H∗(Y,Y−B(N))→H∗(Y):H^*(B(N),S(N))^*(Y,Y-B(N))^*(Y) and v:K(B(N),S(N))→K(Y,Y−B(N))→K(Y):K(B(N),S(N))(Y,Y-B(N))(Y). The Gysin map for K-theory/cohomology is defined to be the composition of the Thom isomorphism with these maps. Since the theorem holds for the map from X to the Thom space of N, and since the Chern character commutes with u and v, the theorem is also true for embeddings. f: X → Y. Finally, we can factor a general map f: X → Y into an embedding i:X→Y×S2n:X^2n and the projection p:Y×S2n→Y.:Y^2n. The theorem is true for the embedding. The Gysin map for the projection is the Bott-periodicity isomorphism, which commutes with the Chern character, so the theorem holds in this general case also.
