lemmas: Lemma A. — Let c(1), ..., c(r) be integers and, for every k between 1 and r, let {γ(k)1, ..., γ(k)m(k)} be the roots of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients Tk(x)_k(x). If γ(k)i ≠ γ(u)v whenever (k, i) ≠ (u, v), then c(1)(eγ(1)1+⋯+eγ(1)m(1))+⋯+c(r)(eγ(r)1+⋯+eγ(r)m(r))=0(1)(e^γ(1)_1+⋯+e^γ(1)_m(1))+⋯+c(r)(e^γ(r)_1+⋯+e^γ(r)_m(r))=0 has only the trivial solution c(i)=0(i)=0 for all i=1,…,r.=1,…,r. Proof of Lemma A. To simplify the notation set: n0=0,ni=∑k=1im(k),i=1,…,rn=nr,αni−1+j=γ(i)j,1≤i≤r,1≤j≤m(i)βni−1+j=c(i). n_0=0, n_i=∑_k=1^im(k), i=1,…,r n=n_r, α_n_i-1+j=γ(i)_j, 1,(i) β_n_i-1+j=c(i). Then the statement becomes ∑k=1nβkeαk≠0.∑_k=1^nβ_ke^α_k≠0. Let p be a prime number and define the following polynomials: fi(x)=ℓnp(x−α1)p⋯(x−αn)p(x−αi),_i(x)=ℓ^np(x-α_1)^p⋯(x-α_n)^p/(x-α_i), where ℓ is a non-zero integer such that ℓα1,…,ℓαnℓα_1,…,ℓα_n are all algebraic integers. Define[11] Ii(s)=∫0ses−xfi(x)dx._i(s)=∫_0^se^s-xf_i(x) dx. Using integration by parts we arrive at Ii(s)=es∑j=0np−1fi(j)(0)−∑j=0np−1fi(j)(s),_i(s)=e^s∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(0)-∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(s), where np−1-1 is the degree of fi_i, and fi(j)_i^(j) is the j-th derivative of fi_i. This also holds for s complex (in this case the integral has to be intended as a contour integral, for example along the straight segment from 0 to s) because −es−x∑j=0np−1fi(j)(x)-e^s-x∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(x) is a primitive of es−xfi(x)^s-xf_i(x). Consider the following sum: Ji=∑k=1nβkIi(αk)=∑k=1nβk(eαk∑j=0np−1fi(j)(0)−∑j=0np−1fi(j)(αk))=(∑j=0np−1fi(j)(0))(∑k=1nβkeαk)−∑k=1n∑j=0np−1βkfi(j)(αk)=−∑k=1n∑j=0np−1βkfi(j)(αk)J_i =∑_k=1^nβ_kI_i(α_k) =∑_k=1^nβ_k(e^α_k∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(0)-∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(α_k)) =(∑_j=0^np-1f_i^(j)(0))(∑_k=1^nβ_ke^α_k)-∑_k=1^n∑_j=0^np-1β_kf_i^(j)(α_k) =-∑_k=1^n∑_j=0^np-1β_kf_i^(j)(α_k) In the last line we assumed that the conclusion of the Lemma is false. In order to complete the proof we need to reach a contradiction. We will do so by estimating |J1⋯Jn||J_1_n| in two different ways. First fi(j)(αk)_i^(j)(α_k) is an algebraic integer which is divisible by p! for j≥p and vanishes for j<p<p unless j=p−1=p-1 and k=i=i, in which case it equals ℓnp(p−1)!∏k≠i(αi−αk)p.ℓ^np(p-1)!∏_k(α_i-α_k)^p. This is not divisible by p when p is large enough because otherwise, putting δi=∏k≠i(ℓαi−ℓαk)δ_i=∏_k(ℓα_i-ℓα_k) (which is a non-zero algebraic integer) and calling di∈Z_i∈ℤ the product of its conjugates (which is still non-zero), we would get that p divides ℓp(p−1)!dipℓ^p(p-1)!d_i^p, which is false. So Ji_i is a non-zero algebraic integer divisible by (p − 1)!. Now Ji=−∑j=0np−1∑t=1rc(t)(fi(j)(αnt−1+1)+⋯+fi(j)(αnt))._i=-∑_j=0^np-1∑_t=1^rc(t)(f_i^(j)(α_n_t-1+1)+⋯+f_i^(j)(α_n_t)). Since each fi(x)_i(x) is obtained by dividing a fixed polynomial with integer coefficients by (x−αi)(x-α_i), it is of the form fi(x)=∑m=0np−1gm(αi)xm,_i(x)=∑_m=0^np-1g_m(α_i)x^m, where gm_m is a polynomial (with integer coefficients) independent of i. The same holds for the derivatives fi(j)(x)_i^(j)(x). Hence, by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, fi(j)(αnt−1+1)+⋯+fi(j)(αnt)_i^(j)(α_n_t-1+1)+⋯+f_i^(j)(α_n_t) is a fixed polynomial with rational coefficients evaluated in αiα_i (this is seen by grouping the same powers of αnt−1+1,…,αntα_n_t-1+1,…,α_n_t appearing in the expansion and using the fact that these algebraic numbers are a complete set of conjugates). So the same is true of Ji_i, i.e. it equals G(αi)(α_i), where G is a polynomial with rational coefficients independent of i. Finally J1⋯Jn=G(α1)⋯G(αn)_1_n=G(α_1)(α_n) is rational (again by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials) and is a non-zero algebraic integer divisible by (p−1)!n(p-1)!^n (since the Ji_i's are algebraic integers divisible by (p−1)!(p-1)!). Therefore |J1⋯Jn|≥(p−1)!n.|J_1_n|≥(p-1)!^n. However one clearly has: |Ii(αk)|≤|αk|e|αk|Fi(|αk|),|I_i(α_k)|≤|α_k|e^|α_k|F_i(|α_k|), where Fi is the polynomial whose coefficients are the absolute values of those of fi (this follows directly from the definition of Ii(s)_i(s)). Thus |Ji|≤∑k=1n|βkαk|e|αk|Fi(|αk|)|J_i|≤∑_k=1^n|β_kα_k|e^|α_k|F_i(|α_k|) and so by the construction of the fi_i's we have |J1⋯Jn|≤Cp|J_1_n|^p for a sufficiently large C independent of p, which contradicts the previous inequality. This proves Lemma A. ∎ Lemma B. — If b(1), ..., b(n) are integers and γ(1), ..., γ(n), are distinct algebraic numbers, then b(1)eγ(1)+⋯+b(n)eγ(n)=0(1)e^γ(1)+⋯+b(n)e^γ(n)=0 has only the trivial solution b(i)=0(i)=0 for all i=1,…,n.=1,…,n. Proof of Lemma B: Assuming b(1)eγ(1)+⋯+b(n)eγ(n)=0,(1)e^γ(1)+⋯+b(n)e^γ(n)=0, we will derive a contradiction, thus proving Lemma B. Let us choose a polynomial with integer coefficients which vanishes on all the γ(k)γ(k)'s and let γ(1),…,γ(n),γ(n+1),…,γ(N)γ(1),…,γ(n),γ(n+1),…,γ(N) be all its distinct roots. Let b(n + 1) = ... = b(N) = 0. The polynomial P(x1,…,xN)=∏σ∈SN(b(1)xσ(1)+⋯+b(N)xσ(N))(x_1,…,x_N)=∏_σ_N(b(1)x_σ(1)+⋯+b(N)x_σ(N)) vanishes at (eγ(1),…,eγ(N))(e^γ(1),…,e^γ(N)) by assumption. Since the product is symmetric, for any τ∈SNτ_N the monomials xτ(1)h1⋯xτ(N)hN_τ(1)^h_1_τ(N)^h_N and x1h1⋯xNhN_1^h_1_N^h_N have the same coefficient in the expansion of P. Thus, expanding P(eγ(1),…,eγ(N))(e^γ(1),…,e^γ(N)) accordingly and grouping the terms with the same exponent, we see that the resulting exponents h1γ(1)+⋯+hNγ(N)_1γ(1)+…+h_Nγ(N) form a complete set of conjugates and, if two terms have conjugate exponents, they are multiplied by the same coefficient. So we are in the situation of Lemma A. To reach a contradiction it suffices to see that at least one of the coefficients is non-zero. This is seen by equipping C with the lexicographic order and by choosing for each factor in the product the term with non-zero coefficient which has maximum exponent according to this ordering: the product of these terms has non-zero coefficient in the expansion and does not get simplified by any other term. This proves Lemma B. ∎ Final
