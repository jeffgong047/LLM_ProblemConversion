π: See also: e (mathematical constant) and Pi The transcendence of e and π are direct corollaries of this theorem. Suppose α is a non-zero algebraic number; then {α} is a linearly independent set over the rationals, and therefore by the first formulation of the theorem {eα} is an algebraically independent set; or in other words eα is transcendental. In particular, e1 = e is transcendental. (A more elementary proof that e is transcendental is outlined in the article on transcendental numbers.) Alternatively, by the second formulation of the theorem, if α is a non-zero algebraic number, then {0, α} is a set of distinct algebraic numbers, and so the set {e0, eα} = {1, eα} is linearly independent over the algebraic numbers and in particular eα cannot be algebraic and so it is transcendental. To prove that π is transcendental, we prove that it is not algebraic. If π were algebraic, πi would be algebraic as well, and then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem eπi = −1 (see Euler's identity) would be transcendental, a contradiction. Therefore π is not algebraic, which means that it is transcendental. A slight variant on the same proof will show that if α is a non-zero algebraic number then sin(α), cos(α), tan(α) and their hyperbolic counterparts are also transcendental. p-adic
