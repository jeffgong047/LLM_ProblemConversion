conjecture: p-adic Lindemann–Weierstrass Conjecture. — Suppose p is some prime number and α1, ..., αn are p-adic numbers which are algebraic and linearly independent over Qℚ, such that | αi |p < 1/p for all i; then the p-adic exponentials expp(α1), . . . , expp(αn) are p-adic numbers that are algebraically independent over Qℚ.
