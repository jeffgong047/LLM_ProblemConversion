conjecture: An analogue of the theorem involving the modular function j was conjectured by Daniel Bertrand in 1997, and remains an open problem.[9] Writing q = e2πiτ for the square of the nome and j(τ) = J(q), the conjecture is as follows. Modular conjecture — Let q1, ..., qn be non-zero algebraic numbers in the complex unit disc such that the 3n numbers J(q1),J′(q1),J″(q1),…,J(qn),J′(qn),J″(qn){J(q_1),J'(q_1),J”(q_1),…,J(q_n),J'(q_n),J”(q_n)} are algebraically dependent over Qℚ. Then there exist two indices 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n such that qi and qj are multiplicatively dependent. Lindemann–Weierstrass
