Proof: Snyder (2000) gave the following elementary proof of the Mason–Stothers theorem.[4] Step 1. The condition a + b + c = 0 implies that the Wronskians W(a, b) = ab′ − a′b, W(b, c), and W(c, a) are all equal. Write W for their common value. Step 2. The condition that at least one of the derivatives a′, b′, or c′ is nonzero and that a, b, and c are coprime is used to show that W is nonzero. For example, if W = 0 then ab′ = a′b so a divides a′ (as a and b are coprime) so a′ = 0 (as deg a > deg a′ unless a is constant). Step 3. W is divisible by each of the greatest common divisors (a, a′), (b, b′), and (c, c′). Since these are coprime it is divisible by their product, and since W is nonzero we get deg (a, a′) + deg (b, b′) + deg (c, c′) ≤ deg W. Step 4. Substituting in the inequalities deg (a, a′) ≥ deg a − (number of distinct roots of a) deg (b, b′) ≥ deg b − (number of distinct roots of b) deg (c, c′) ≥ deg c − (number of distinct roots of c) (where the roots are taken in some algebraic closure) and deg W ≤ deg a + deg b − 1 we find that deg c ≤ (number of distinct roots of abc) − 1 which is what we needed to prove.
