Theorem about polynomials, analogous to the abc conjecture for integers The Mason–Stothers theorem, or simply Mason's theorem, is a mathematical theorem about polynomials, analogous to the abc conjecture for integers. It is named after Walter Wilson Stothers, who published it in 1981,[1] and R. C. Mason, who rediscovered it shortly thereafter.[2] The theorem states: Let a(t), b(t), and c(t) be relatively prime polynomials over a field such that a + b = c and such that not all of them have vanishing derivative. Then maxdeg⁡(a),deg⁡(b),deg⁡(c)≤deg⁡(rad⁡(abc))−1.max{(a),(b),(c)}≤(rad(abc))-1. Here rad(f) is the product of the distinct irreducible factors of f. For algebraically closed fields it is the polynomial of minimum degree that has the same roots as f; in this case deg(rad(f)) gives the number of distinct roots of f.[3]
