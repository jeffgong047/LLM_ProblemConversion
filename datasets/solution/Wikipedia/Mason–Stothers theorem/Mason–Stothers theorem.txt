Theorem about polynomials, analogous to the abc conjecture for integers
The Mason–Stothers theorem, or simply Mason's theorem, is a mathematical theorem about polynomials, analogous to the abc conjecture for integers. It is named after Walter Wilson Stothers, who published it in 1981,[1] and R. C. Mason, who rediscovered it shortly thereafter.[2]
The theorem states:

Let a(t), b(t), and c(t) be relatively prime polynomials over a field such that a + b = c and such that not all of them have vanishing derivative. Then
maxdeg⁡(a),deg⁡(b),deg⁡(c)≤deg⁡(rad⁡(abc))−1.max{(a),(b),(c)}≤(rad(abc))-1.
Here rad(f) is the product of the distinct irreducible factors of f. For algebraically closed fields it is the polynomial of minimum degree that has the same roots as f; in this case deg(rad(f)) gives the number of distinct roots of f.[3]


Examples[edit]
Over fields of characteristic 0 the condition that a, b, and c do not all have vanishing derivative is equivalent to the condition that they are not all constant. Over fields of characteristic p > 0 it is not enough to assume that they are not all constant. For example, considered as polynomials over some field of characteristic p, the identity tp + 1 = (t + 1)p gives an example where the maximum degree of the three polynomials (a and b as the summands on the left hand side, and c as the right hand side) is p, but the degree of the radical is only 2.
Taking a(t) = tn and c(t) = (t+1)n gives an example where equality holds in the Mason–Stothers theorem, showing that the inequality is in some sense the best possible.
A corollary of the Mason–Stothers theorem is the analog of Fermat's Last Theorem for function fields: if a(t)n + b(t)n = c(t)n for a, b, c relatively prime polynomials over a field of characteristic not dividing n  and n > 2 then either at least one of a, b, or c is 0 or they are all constant.
Proof[edit]
Snyder (2000) gave the following elementary proof of the Mason–Stothers theorem.[4]
Step 1. The condition a + b + c = 0 implies that the Wronskians W(a, b) = ab′ − a′b, W(b, c), and W(c, a) are all equal. Write W for their common value.
Step 2. The condition that at least one of the derivatives a′, b′, or c′ is nonzero and that a, b, and c are coprime is used to show that W is nonzero.
For example, if W = 0 then ab′ = a′b so a divides a′ (as a and b are coprime) so a′ = 0 (as deg a > deg a′ unless a is constant).
Step 3. W is divisible by each of the greatest common divisors (a, a′), (b, b′), and (c, c′). Since these are coprime it is divisible by their product, and since W is nonzero we get

deg (a, a′) + deg (b, b′) + deg (c, c′) ≤ deg W.
Step 4. Substituting in the inequalities

deg (a, a′) ≥ deg a − (number of distinct roots of a)
deg (b, b′) ≥ deg b − (number of distinct roots of b)
deg (c, c′) ≥ deg c − (number of distinct roots of c)
(where the roots are taken in some algebraic closure) and

deg W ≤ deg a + deg b − 1 
we find that

deg c ≤ (number of distinct roots of abc)  − 1
which is what we needed to prove.

Generalizations[edit]
There is a natural generalization in which the ring of polynomials is replaced by a one-dimensional function field.
Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, let C/k be a smooth projective curve
of genus g, let

a,b∈k(C),b(C) be rational functions on C satisfying a+b=1+b=1,
and let
S be a set of points in C(k) containing all of the zeros and poles of a and b.
Then

maxdeg⁡(a),deg⁡(b)≤max|S|+2g−2,0.max{(a),(b)}≤max{|S|+2g-2,0}.
Here the degree of a function in k(C) is the degree of
the map it induces from C to P1.
This was proved by Mason, with an alternative short proof published the same year by J. H. Silverman
.[5]
There is a further generalization, due independently to J. F. Voloch[6]
and to
W. D. Brownawell and D. W. Masser,[7]
that gives an upper bound for  n-variable S-unit
equations a1 + a2 + ... + an = 1 provided that
no subset of the ai are k-linearly dependent. Under this assumption, they prove that

maxdeg⁡(a1),…,deg⁡(an)≤12n(n−1)max|S|+2g−2,0.max{(a_1),…,(a_n)}≤1/2n(n-1)max{|S|+2g-2,0}.
