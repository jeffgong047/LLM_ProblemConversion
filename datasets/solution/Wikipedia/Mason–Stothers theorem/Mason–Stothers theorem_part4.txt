Generalizations: There is a natural generalization in which the ring of polynomials is replaced by a one-dimensional function field. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, let C/k be a smooth projective curve of genus g, let a,b∈k(C),b(C) be rational functions on C satisfying a+b=1+b=1, and let S be a set of points in C(k) containing all of the zeros and poles of a and b. Then maxdeg⁡(a),deg⁡(b)≤max|S|+2g−2,0.max{(a),(b)}≤max{|S|+2g-2,0}. Here the degree of a function in k(C) is the degree of the map it induces from C to P1. This was proved by Mason, with an alternative short proof published the same year by J. H. Silverman .[5] There is a further generalization, due independently to J. F. Voloch[6] and to W. D. Brownawell and D. W. Masser,[7] that gives an upper bound for n-variable S-unit equations a1 + a2 + ... + an = 1 provided that no subset of the ai are k-linearly dependent. Under this assumption, they prove that maxdeg⁡(a1),…,deg⁡(an)≤12n(n−1)max|S|+2g−2,0.max{(a_1),…,(a_n)}≤1/2n(n-1)max{|S|+2g-2,0}.
