theorem: Main article: Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem If isosceles triangles with apex angles 2kπn2kπn are erected on the sides of an arbitrary n-gon A0, and if this process is repeated with the n-gon formed by the free apices of the triangles, but with a different value of k, and so on until all values 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 2 have been used (in arbitrary order), then a regular n-gon An−2 is formed whose centroid coincides with the centroid of A0.[19] Napoleon-Barlotti
