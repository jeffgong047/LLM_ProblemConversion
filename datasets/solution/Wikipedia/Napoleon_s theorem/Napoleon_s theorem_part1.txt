On lines connecting the centres of equilateral triangles built on the sides of a triangle Napoleon's theorem: If the triangles centered on L, M, N are equilateral, then so is the green triangle. In geometry, Napoleon's theorem states that if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward or all inward, the lines connecting the centres of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle. The triangle thus formed is called the inner or outer Napoleon triangle. The difference in the areas of the outer and inner Napoleon triangles equals the area of the original triangle. The theorem is often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte (1769â€“1821). Some have suggested that it may date back to W. Rutherford's 1825 question published in The Ladies' Diary, four years after the French emperor's death,[1][2] but the result is covered in three questions set in an examination for a Gold Medal at the University of Dublin in October, 1820, whereas Napoleon died the following May.
