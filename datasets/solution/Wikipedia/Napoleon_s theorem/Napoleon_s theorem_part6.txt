triangles: The area of the inner Napoleon triangle of a triangle with area △ is Area(inner)=−△2+324(a2+b2+c2)≥0,Area(inner)=-/2+√(3)/24(a^2+b^2+c^2)≥0, where a, b, c are the side lengths of the original triangle, with equality only in the case in which the original triangle is equilateral, by Weitzenböck's inequality. However, from an algebraic standpoint[16] the inner triangle is "retrograde" and its algebraic area is the negative of this expression.[17] The area of the outer Napoleon triangle is[18] Area(outer)=△2+324(a2+b2+c2).Area(outer)=/2+√(3)/24(a^2+b^2+c^2). Analytically, it can be shown[6] that each of the three sides of the outer Napoleon triangle has a length of Side(outer)=a2+b2+c26+(a+b+c)(a+b−c)(a−b+c)(−a+b+c)23.Side(outer)=√(a^2+b^2+c^26+√((a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(-a+b+c))2√(3)). The relation between the latter two equations is that the area of an equilateral triangle equals the square of the side times 3/4.√(3)/4.
