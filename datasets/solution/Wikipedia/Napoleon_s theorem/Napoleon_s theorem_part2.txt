Proofs: In the figure above, △ABC is the original triangle. △AZB, △BXC, △CYA are equilateral triangles constructed on its sides' exteriors, and points L, M, N are the centroids of those triangles. The theorem for outer triangles states that triangle △LMN (green) is equilateral. A quick way to see that △LMN is equilateral is to observe that MN becomes CZ under a clockwise rotation of 30° around A and a homothety of ratio 3√(3) with the same center, and that LN also becomes CZ after a counterclockwise rotation of 30° around B and a homothety of ratio 3√(3) with the same center. The respective spiral similarities[3] are A(3,−30∘),B(3,30∘).(√(3),-30^∘),(√(3),30^∘). That implies MN = LN and the angle between them must be 60°.[4] There are in fact many proofs of the theorem's statement, including a synthetic (coordinate-free) one,[5] a trigonometric one,[6] a symmetry-based approach,[7] and proofs using complex numbers.[6]
