Generalization: Given a hexagon A1A2A3A4A5A6 with equilateral triangles constructed on the sides, either inwardly or outwardly, and the apexes of the equilateral triangles labelled Bi. If G1, G3, G5 are the respective centroids of △B6B1B2, △B2B3B4, △B4B5B6, then G1, G3, G5 form an equilateral triangle.[22] See
