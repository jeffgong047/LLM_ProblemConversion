Examples: Noetherian rings of the following types are Cohen–Macaulay. Any regular local ring. This leads to various examples of Cohen–Macaulay rings, such as the integers Zℤ, or a polynomial ring K[x1,…,xn][x_1,…,x_n] over a field K, or a power series ring K[[x1,…,xn]][[x_1,…,x_n]] . In geometric terms, every regular scheme, for example a smooth variety over a field, is Cohen–Macaulay. Any 0-dimensional ring (or equivalently, any Artinian ring). Any 1-dimensional reduced ring, for example any 1-dimensional domain. Any 2-dimensional normal ring. Any Gorenstein ring. In particular, any complete intersection ring. The ring of invariants RG^G when R is a Cohen–Macaulay algebra over a field of characteristic zero and G is a finite group (or more generally, a linear algebraic group whose identity component is reductive). This is the Hochster–Roberts theorem. Any determinantal ring. That is, let R be the quotient of a regular local ring S by the ideal I generated by the r × r minors of some p × q matrix of elements of S. If the codimension (or height) of I is equal to the "expected" codimension (p−r+1)(q−r+1), R is called a determinantal ring. In that case, R is Cohen−Macaulay.[2] Similarly, coordinate rings of determinantal varieties are Cohen-Macaulay. Some more examples: The ring K[x]/(x²) has dimension 0 and hence is Cohen–Macaulay, but it is not reduced and therefore not regular. The subring K[t2, t3] of the polynomial ring K[t], or its localization or completion at t=0, is a 1-dimensional domain which is Gorenstein, and hence Cohen–Macaulay, but not regular. This ring can also be described as the coordinate ring of the cuspidal cubic curve y2 = x3 over K. The subring K[t3, t4, t5] of the polynomial ring K[t], or its localization or completion at t=0, is a 1-dimensional domain which is Cohen–Macaulay but not Gorenstein. Rational singularities over a field of characteristic zero are Cohen–Macaulay. Toric varieties over any field are Cohen–Macaulay.[3] The minimal model program makes prominent use of varieties with klt (Kawamata log terminal) singularities; in characteristic zero, these are rational singularities and hence are Cohen–Macaulay,[4] One successful analog of rational singularities in positive characteristic is the notion of F-rational singularities; again, such singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.[5] Let X be a projective variety of dimension n ≥ 1 over a field, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. Then the section ring of L R=⨁j≥0H0(X,Lj)=⊕_j≥0H^0(X,L^j) is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if the cohomology group Hi(X, Lj) is zero for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 and all integers j.[6] It follows, for example, that the affine cone Spec R over an abelian variety X is Cohen–Macaulay when X has dimension 1, but not when X has dimension at least 2 (because H1(X, O) is not zero).
