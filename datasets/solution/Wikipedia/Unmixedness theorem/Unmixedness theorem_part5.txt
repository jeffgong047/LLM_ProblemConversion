curves: Cohen–Macaulay curves are a special case of Cohen–Macaulay schemes, but are useful for compactifying moduli spaces of curves[7] where the boundary of the smooth locus Mgℳ_g is of Cohen–Macaulay curves. There is a useful criterion for deciding whether or not curves are Cohen–Macaulay. Schemes of dimension ≤1≤1 are Cohen–Macaulay if and only if they have no embedded primes.[8] The singularities present in Cohen–Macaulay curves can be classified completely by looking at the plane curve case.[9]
