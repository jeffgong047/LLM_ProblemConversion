Definition: For a commutative Noetherian local ring R, a finite (i.e. finitely generated) R-module M≠0≠0 is a Cohen-Macaulay module if depth(M)=dim(M)depth(M)=dim(M) (in general we have: depth(M)≤dim(M)depth(M)≤dim(M), see Auslander–Buchsbaum formula for the relation between depth and dim of a certain kind of modules). On the other hand, R is a module on itself, so we call R a Cohen-Macaulay ring if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module as an R-module. A maximal Cohen-Macaulay module is a Cohen-Macaulay module M such that dim(M)=dim(R)dim(M)=dim(R). The above definition was for a Noetherian local rings. But we can expand the definition for a more general Noetherian ring: If R is a commutative Noetherian ring, then an R-module M is called Cohen–Macaulay module if Mm_m is a Cohen-Macaulay module for all maximal ideals m∈Supp(M)m∈Supp(M). (This is a kind of circular definition unless we define zero modules as Cohen-Macaulay. So we define zero modules as Cohen-Macaulay modules in this definition.) Now, to define maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules for these rings, we require that Mm_m to be such an Rm_m-module for each maximal ideal mm of R. As in the local case, R is a Cohen-Macaulay ring if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module (as an R-module on itself).[1]
