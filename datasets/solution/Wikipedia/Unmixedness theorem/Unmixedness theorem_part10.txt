Properties: A Noetherian local ring is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if its completion is Cohen–Macaulay.[15] If R is a Cohen–Macaulay ring, then the polynomial ring R[x] and the power series ring R[[x]] are Cohen–Macaulay.[16][17] For a non-zero-divisor u in the maximal ideal of a Noetherian local ring R, R is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if R/(u) is Cohen–Macaulay.[18] The quotient of a Cohen–Macaulay ring by any ideal is universally catenary.[19] If R is a quotient of a Cohen–Macaulay ring, then the locus { p ∈ Spec R | Rp is Cohen–Macaulay } is an open subset of Spec R.[20] Let (R, m, k) be a Noetherian local ring of embedding codimension c, meaning that c = dimk(m/m2) − dim(R). In geometric terms, this holds for a local ring of a subscheme of codimension c in a regular scheme. For c=1, R is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if it is a hypersurface ring. There is also a structure theorem for Cohen–Macaulay rings of codimension 2, the Hilbert–Burch theorem: they are all determinantal rings, defined by the r × r minors of an (r+1) × r matrix for some r. For a Noetherian local ring (R, m), the following are equivalent:[21] R is Cohen–Macaulay. For every parameter ideal Q (an ideal generated by a system of parameters), length⁡(R/Q)=e(Q)length(R/Q)=e(Q) := the Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity of Q. For some parameter ideal Q, length⁡(R/Q)=e(Q)length(R/Q)=e(Q). (See Generalized Cohen–Macaulay ring as well as Buchsbaum ring for rings that generalize this characterization.) The unmixedness
