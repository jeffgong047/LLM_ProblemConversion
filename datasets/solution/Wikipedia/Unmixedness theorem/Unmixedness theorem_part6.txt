Non-examples: Using the criterion, there are easy examples of non-Cohen–Macaulay curves from constructing curves with embedded points. For example, the scheme X=Spec(C[x,y](x2,xy))=Spec(ℂ[x,y]/(x^2,xy)) has the decomposition into prime ideals (x)⋅(x,y)(x)·(x,y). Geometrically it is the y-axis with an embedded point at the origin, which can be thought of as a fat point. Given a smooth projective plane curve C⊂P2⊂ℙ^2, a curve with an embedded point can be constructed using the same technique: find the ideal Ix_x of a point in x∈C and multiply it with the ideal IC_C of C. Then X=Proj(C[x,y,z]IC⋅Ix)=Proj(ℂ[x,y,z]/I_C_x) is a curve with an embedded point at x. Intersection
