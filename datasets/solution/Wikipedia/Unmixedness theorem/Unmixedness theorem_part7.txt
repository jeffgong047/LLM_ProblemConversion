theory: Cohen–Macaulay schemes have a special relation with intersection theory. Precisely, let X be a smooth variety[10] and V, W closed subschemes of pure dimension. Let Z be a proper component of the scheme-theoretic intersection V×XW×_XW, that is, an irreducible component of expected dimension. If the local ring A of V×XW×_XW at the generic point of Z is Cohen-Macaulay, then the intersection multiplicity of V and W along Z is given as the length of A:[11] i(Z,V⋅W,X)=length⁡(A)(Z,V,X)=length(A). In general, that multiplicity is given as a length essentially characterizes Cohen–Macaulay ring; see #Properties. Multiplicity one criterion, on the other hand, roughly characterizes a regular local ring as a local ring of multiplicity one.
