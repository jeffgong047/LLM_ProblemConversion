Example: For a simple example, if we take the intersection of a parabola with a line tangent to it, the local ring at the intersection point is isomorphic to C[x,y](y−x2)⊗C[x,y]C[x,y](y)≅C[x](x2)ℂ[x,y]/(y-x^2)⊗_ℂ[x,y]ℂ[x,y]/(y)≅ℂ[x]/(x^2) which is Cohen–Macaulay of length two, hence the intersection multiplicity is two, as expected.
