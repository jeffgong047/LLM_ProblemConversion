In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem, named after Jacques Charles François Sturm and Mauro Picone, is a classical theorem which provides criteria for the oscillation and non-oscillation of solutions of certain linear differential equations in the real domain. Let pi, qi for i = 1, 2 be real-valued continuous functions on the interval [a, b] and let (p1(x)y′)′+q1(x)y=0(p_1(x)y^')^'+q_1(x)y=0 (p2(x)y′)′+q2(x)y=0(p_2(x)y^')^'+q_2(x)y=0 be two homogeneous linear second order differential equations in self-adjoint form with 0<p2(x)≤p1(x)0<p_2(x)_1(x) and q1(x)≤q2(x)._1(x)≦_2(x). Let u be a non-trivial solution of (1) with successive roots at z1 and z2 and let v be a non-trivial solution of (2). Then one of the following properties holds. There exists an x in (z1, z2) such that v(x) = 0; or there exists a λ in R such that v(x) = λ u(x). The first part of the conclusion is due to Sturm (1836),[1] while the second (alternative) part of the theorem is due to Picone (1910)[2][3] whose simple proof was given using his now famous Picone identity. In the special case where both equations are identical one obtains the Sturm separation theorem.[4]
