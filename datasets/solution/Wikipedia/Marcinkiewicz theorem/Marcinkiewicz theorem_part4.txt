examples: A famous application example is the Hilbert transform. Viewed as a multiplier, the Hilbert transform of a function f can be computed by first taking the Fourier transform of f, then multiplying by the sign function, and finally applying the inverse Fourier transform. Hence Parseval's theorem easily shows that the Hilbert transform is bounded from L2^2 to L2^2. A much less obvious fact is that it is bounded from L1^1 to L1,w^1,w. Hence Marcinkiewicz's theorem shows that it is bounded from Lp^p to Lp^p for any 1 < p < 2. Duality arguments show that it is also bounded for 2 < p < ∞. In fact, the Hilbert transform is really unbounded for p equal to 1 or ∞. Another famous example is the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function, which is only sublinear operator rather than linear. While Lp^p to Lp^p bounds can be derived immediately from the L1^1 to weak L1^1 estimate by a clever change of variables, Marcinkiewicz interpolation is a more intuitive approach. Since the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Function is trivially bounded from L∞^∞ to L∞^∞, strong boundedness for all p>1>1 follows immediately from the weak (1,1) estimate and interpolation. The weak (1,1) estimate can be obtained from the Vitali covering lemma.
