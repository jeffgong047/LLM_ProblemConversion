Preliminaries: Let f be a measurable function with real or complex values, defined on a measure space (X, F, ω). The distribution function of f is defined by λf(t)=ωx∈X∣|f(x)|>t.λ_f(t)=ω{x||f(x)|>t}. Then f is called weak L1^1 if there exists a constant C such that the distribution function of f satisfies the following inequality for all t > 0: λf(t)≤Ct.λ_f(t)≤C/t. The smallest constant C in the inequality above is called the weak L1^1 norm and is usually denoted by ‖f‖1,wf_1,w or ‖f‖1,∞.f_1,∞. Similarly the space is usually denoted by L1,w or L1,∞. (Note: This terminology is a bit misleading since the weak norm does not satisfy the triangle inequality as one can see by considering the sum of the functions on (0,1)(0,1) given by 1/x1/x and 1/(1−x)1/(1-x), which has norm 4 not 2.) Any L1^1 function belongs to L1,w and in addition one has the inequality ‖f‖1,w≤‖f‖1.f_1,w≤f_1. This is nothing but Markov's inequality (aka Chebyshev's Inequality). The converse is not true. For example, the function 1/x belongs to L1,w but not to L1. Similarly, one may define the weak Lp^p space as the space of all functions f such that |f|p|f|^p belong to L1,w, and the weak Lp^p norm using ‖f‖p,w=‖|f|p‖1,w1p.f_p,w=|f|^p_1,w^1/p. More directly, the Lp,w norm is defined as the best constant C in the inequality λf(t)≤Cptpλ_f(t)≤C^p/t^p for all t > 0.
