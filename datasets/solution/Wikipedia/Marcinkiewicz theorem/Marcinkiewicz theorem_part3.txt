Formulation: Informally, Marcinkiewicz's theorem is Theorem. Let T be a bounded linear operator from Lp^p to Lp,w^p,w and at the same time from Lq^q to Lq,w^q,w. Then T is also a bounded operator from Lr^r to Lr^r for any r between p and q. In other words, even if one only requires weak boundedness on the extremes p and q, regular boundedness still holds. To make this more formal, one has to explain that T is bounded only on a dense subset and can be completed. See Riesz-Thorin theorem for these details. Where Marcinkiewicz's theorem is weaker than the Riesz-Thorin theorem is in the estimates of the norm. The theorem gives bounds for the Lr^r norm of T but this bound increases to infinity as r converges to either p or q. Specifically (DiBenedetto 2002, Theorem VIII.9.2), suppose that ‖Tf‖p,w≤Np‖f‖p,Tf_p,w_pf_p, ‖Tf‖q,w≤Nq‖f‖q,Tf_q,w_qf_q, so that the operator norm of T from Lp to Lp,w is at most Np, and the operator norm of T from Lq to Lq,w is at most Nq. Then the following interpolation inequality holds for all r between p and q and all f ∈ Lr: ‖Tf‖r≤γNpδNq1−δ‖f‖rTf_r≤_p^δN_q^1-δf_r where δ=p(q−r)r(q−p)δ=p(q-r)/r(q-p) and γ=2(r(q−p)(r−p)(q−r))1/r.γ=2(r(q-p)/(r-p)(q-r))^1/r. The constants δ and γ can also be given for q = ∞ by passing to the limit. A version of the theorem also holds more generally if T is only assumed to be a quasilinear operator in the following sense: there exists a constant C > 0 such that T satisfies |T(f+g)(x)|≤C(|Tf(x)|+|Tg(x)|)|T(f+g)(x)|(|Tf(x)|+|Tg(x)|) for almost every x. The theorem holds precisely as stated, except with γ replaced by γ=2C(r(q−p)(r−p)(q−r))1/r.γ=2C(r(q-p)/(r-p)(q-r))^1/r. An operator T (possibly quasilinear) satisfying an estimate of the form ‖Tf‖q,w≤C‖f‖pTf_q,wf_p is said to be of weak type (p,q). An operator is simply of type (p,q) if T is a bounded transformation from Lp to Lq: ‖Tf‖q≤C‖f‖p.Tf_qf_p. A more general formulation of the interpolation theorem is as follows: If T is a quasilinear operator of weak type (p0, q0) and of weak type (p1, q1) where q0 ≠ q1, then for each θ ∈ (0,1), T is of type (p,q), for p and q with p ≤ q of the form 1p=1−θp0+θp1,1q=1−θq0+θq1.1/p=1-θ/p_0+θ/p_1, 1/q=1-θ/q_0+θ/q_1. The latter formulation follows from the former through an application of Hölder's inequality and a duality argument.[citation needed] Applications and
