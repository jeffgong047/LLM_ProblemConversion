Statement: Let D be a nef divisor on a smooth projective surface X. Denote by KX the canonical divisor of X. If D2 > 4, then the linear system |KX+D| has no base points unless there exists a nonzero effective divisor E such that DE=0,E2=−1=0,E^2=-1, or DE=1,E2=0=1,E^2=0; If D2 > 8, then the linear system |KX+D| is very ample unless there exists a nonzero effective divisor E satisfying one of the following: DE=0,E2=−1=0,E^2=-1 or −2-2; DE=1,E2=0=1,E^2=0 or −1-1; DE=2,E2=0=2,E^2=0; DE=3,D=3E,E2=1=3,D=3E,E^2=1
