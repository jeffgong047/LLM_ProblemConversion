Quillen–Suslin theoremFieldCommutative algebraConjectured byJean-Pierre SerreConjectured in1955First proof byDaniel QuillenAndrei SuslinFirst proof in1976 The Quillen–Suslin theorem, also known as Serre's problem or Serre's conjecture, is a theorem in commutative algebra concerning the relationship between free modules and projective modules over polynomial rings. In the geometric setting it is a statement about the triviality of vector bundles on affine space. The theorem states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.
