Generalization: A generalization relating projective modules over regular Noetherian rings A and their polynomial rings is known as the Bassâ€“Quillen conjecture. Note that although GLn_n-bundles on affine space are all trivial, this is not true for G-bundles where G is a general reductive algebraic group.
