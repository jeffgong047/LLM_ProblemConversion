In fluid mechanics, the Taylor–Proudman theorem (after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and Joseph Proudman) states that when a solid body[clarification needed] is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high angular velocity ΩΩ, the fluid velocity will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. ΩΩ must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the Coriolis force large compared to the acceleration terms.
