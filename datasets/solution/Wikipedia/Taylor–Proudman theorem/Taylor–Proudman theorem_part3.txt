column: Main article: Taylor column The Taylor column is an imaginary cylinder projected above and below a real cylinder that has been placed parallel to the rotation axis (anywhere in the flow, not necessarily in the center). The flow will curve around the imaginary cylinders just like the real due to the Taylor–Proudman theorem, which states that the flow in a rotating, homogeneous, inviscid fluid are 2-dimensional in the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis and thus there is no variation in the flow along the Ω→Ω⃗ axis, often taken to be the z^ẑ axis. The Taylor column is a simplified, experimentally observed effect of what transpires in the Earth's atmospheres and oceans.
