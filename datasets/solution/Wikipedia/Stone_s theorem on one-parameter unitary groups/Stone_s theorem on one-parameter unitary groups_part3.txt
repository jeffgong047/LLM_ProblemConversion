Example: The family of translation operators [Tt(ψ)](x)=ψ(x+t)[T_t(ψ)](x)=ψ(x+t) is a one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator −iddx-id/dx defined on the space of continuously differentiable complex-valued functions with compact support on R.ℝ. Thus Tt=etddx._t=e^td/dx. In other words, motion on the line is generated by the momentum operator.
