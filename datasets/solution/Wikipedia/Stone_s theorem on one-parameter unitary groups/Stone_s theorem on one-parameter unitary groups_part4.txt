Applications: Stone's theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics. For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states H, time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on Hℋ. The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian. Further information: Stone–von Neumann theorem and Heisenberg group Using Fourier
