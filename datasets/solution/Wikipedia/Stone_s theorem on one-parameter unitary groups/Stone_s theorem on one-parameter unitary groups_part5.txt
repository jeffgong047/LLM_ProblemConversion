transform: Stone's Theorem can be recast using the language of the Fourier transform. The real line Rℝ is a locally compact abelian group. Non-degenerate *-representations of the group C*-algebra C∗(R)^*(ℝ) are in one-to-one correspondence with strongly continuous unitary representations of R,ℝ, i.e., strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups. On the other hand, the Fourier transform is a *-isomorphism from C∗(R)^*(ℝ) to C0(R),_0(ℝ), the C∗^*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the real line that vanish at infinity. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups and *-representations of C0(R)._0(ℝ). As every *-representation of C0(R)_0(ℝ) corresponds uniquely to a self-adjoint operator, Stone's Theorem holds. Therefore, the procedure for obtaining the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group is as follows: Let (Ut)t∈R(U_t)_t∈ℝ be a strongly continuous unitary representation of Rℝ on a Hilbert space Hℋ. Integrate this unitary representation to yield a non-degenerate *-representation ρρ of C∗(R)^*(ℝ) on Hℋ by first defining ∀f∈Cc(R):ρ(f):=∫Rf(t)Utdt,_c(ℝ): ρ(f):=∫_ℝf(t) U_tdt, and then extending ρρ to all of C∗(R)^*(ℝ) by continuity. Use the Fourier transform to obtain a non-degenerate *-representation ττ of C0(R)_0(ℝ) on Hℋ. By the Riesz-Markov Theorem, ττ gives rise to a projection-valued measure on Rℝ that is the resolution of the identity of a unique self-adjoint operator A, which may be unbounded. Then A is the infinitesimal generator of (Ut)t∈R.(U_t)_t∈ℝ. The precise definition of C∗(R)^*(ℝ) is as follows. Consider the *-algebra Cc(R),_c(ℝ), the continuous complex-valued functions on Rℝ with compact support, where the multiplication is given by convolution. The completion of this *-algebra with respect to the L1^1-norm is a Banach *-algebra, denoted by (L1(R),⋆).(L^1(ℝ),⋆). Then C∗(R)^*(ℝ) is defined to be the enveloping C∗^*-algebra of (L1(R),⋆)(L^1(ℝ),⋆), i.e., its completion with respect to the largest possible C∗^*-norm. It is a non-trivial fact that, via the Fourier transform, C∗(R)^*(ℝ) is isomorphic to C0(R)._0(ℝ). A result in this direction is the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, which says that the Fourier transform maps L1(R)^1(ℝ) to C0(R)._0(ℝ).
