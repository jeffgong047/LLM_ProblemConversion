statement: The statement of the theorem is as follows.[1] Theorem. Let (Ut)t∈R(U_t)_t∈ℝ be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Then there exists a unique (possibly unbounded) operator A:DA→H:𝒟_A→ℋ, that is self-adjoint on DA𝒟_A and such that ∀t∈R:Ut=eitA.∈ℝ:_t=e^itA. The domain of A is defined by DA=ψ∈H|limε→0−iε(Uε(ψ)−ψ)exists.𝒟_A={ψ∈ℋ|lim_ε→0-i/ε(U_ε(ψ)-ψ)exists.}. Conversely, let A:DA→H:𝒟_A→ℋ be a (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operator on DA⊆H.𝒟_A⊆ℋ. Then the one-parameter family (Ut)t∈R(U_t)_t∈ℝ of unitary operators defined by ∀t∈R:Ut:=eitA∈ℝ:_t:=e^itA is a strongly continuous one-parameter group. In both parts of the theorem, the expression eitA^itA is defined by means of the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators. The operator A is called the infinitesimal generator of (Ut)t∈R.(U_t)_t∈ℝ. Furthermore, A will be a bounded operator if and only if the operator-valued mapping t↦Ut_t is norm-continuous. The infinitesimal generator A of a strongly continuous unitary group (Ut)t∈R(U_t)_t∈ℝ may be computed as Aψ=−ilimε→0Uεψ−ψε,ψ=-ilim_ε→0U_εψ-ψ/ε, with the domain of A consisting of those vectors ψψ for which the limit exists in the norm topology. That is to say, A is equal to −i-i times the derivative of Ut_t with respect to t at t=0=0. Part of the statement of the theorem is that this derivative exists—i.e., that A is a densely defined self-adjoint operator. The result is not obvious even in the finite-dimensional case, since Ut_t is only assumed (ahead of time) to be continuous, and not differentiable.
