Generalizations: The Stone–von Neumann theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to a pair of self-adjoint operators, (P,Q)(P,Q), satisfying the canonical commutation relation, and shows that these are all unitarily equivalent to the position operator and momentum operator on L2(R).^2(ℝ). The Hille–Yosida theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces.
