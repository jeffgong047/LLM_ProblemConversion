Applications: Lafforgue's theorem implies the Ramanujanâ€“Petersson conjecture that if an automorphic form for GLn(F) has central character of finite order, then the corresponding Hecke eigenvalues at every unramified place have absolute value 1. Lafforgue's theorem implies the conjecture of Deligne (1980, 1.2.10) that an irreducible finite-dimensional l-adic representation of the absolute Galois group with determinant character of finite order is pure of weight 0.
