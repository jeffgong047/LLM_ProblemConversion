GLn(F): Here F is a global field of some positive characteristic p, and ℓ is some prime not equal to p. Lafforgue's theorem states that there is a bijection σ between: Equivalence classes of cuspidal representations π of GLn(F), and Equivalence classes of irreducible ℓ-adic representations σ(π) of dimension n of the absolute Galois group of F that preserves the L-function at every place of F. The proof of Lafforgue's theorem involves constructing a representation σ(π) of the absolute Galois group for each cuspidal representation π. The idea of doing this is to look in the ℓ-adic cohomology of the moduli stack of shtukas of rank n that have compatible level N structures for all N. The cohomology contains subquotients of the form π⊗σ(π)⊗σ(π)∨ which can be used to construct σ(π) from π. A major problem is that the moduli stack is not of finite type, which means that there are formidable technical difficulties in studying its cohomology.
