condition: A result, due to Rubel (1956), relaxes the condition that f vanish on the integers. Namely, Rubel showed that the conclusion of the theorem remains valid if f vanishes on a subset A ⊂ {0, 1, 2, ...} of upper density 1, meaning that limsupn→∞|A∩0,1,…,n−1|n=1.lim sup_n→∞|A∩{0,1,…,n-1}|/n=1. This condition is sharp, meaning that the theorem fails for sets A of upper density smaller than 1.
