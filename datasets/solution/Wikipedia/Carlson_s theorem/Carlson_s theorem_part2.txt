Statement: Assume that f satisfies the following three conditions. The first two conditions bound the growth of f at infinity, whereas the third one states that f vanishes on the non-negative integers. f(z) is an entire function of exponential type, meaning that |f(z)|≤Ceτ|z|,z∈C|f(z)|^τ|z|,∈ℂ for some real values C, τ. There exists c < π such that |f(iy)|≤Cec|y|,y∈R|f(iy)|^c|y|,∈ℝ f(n) = 0 for every non-negative integer n. Then f is identically zero.
