Applications: Suppose f(z) is a function that possesses all finite forward differences Δnf(0)Δ^nf(0). Consider then the Newton series g(z)=∑n=0∞(zn)Δnf(0)(z)=∑_n=0^∞z Δ^nf(0) with (zn)z is the binomial coefficient and Δnf(0)Δ^nf(0) is the n-th forward difference. By construction, one then has that f(k) = g(k) for all non-negative integers k, so that the difference h(k) = f(k) − g(k) = 0. This is one of the conditions of Carlson's theorem; if h obeys the others, then h is identically zero, and the finite differences for f uniquely determine its Newton series. That is, if a Newton series for f exists, and the difference satisfies the Carlson conditions, then f is unique. See
