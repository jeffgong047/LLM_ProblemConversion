History: According to University of California, Berkeley computer scientist Eric Brewer, the theorem first appeared in autumn 1998.[8] It was published as the CAP principle in 1999[9] and presented as a conjecture by Brewer at the 2000 Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC).[10] In 2002, Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch of MIT published a formal proof of Brewer's conjecture, rendering it a theorem.[1] In 2012, Brewer clarified some of his positions, including why the often-used "two out of three" concept can be somewhat misleading because system designers only need to sacrifice consistency or availability in the presence of partitions; partition management and recovery techniques exist. Brewer also noted the different definition of consistency used in the CAP theorem relative to the definition used in ACID.[8][11] A similar theorem stating the trade-off between consistency and availability in distributed systems was published by Birman and Friedman in 1996.[12] Birman and Friedman's result restricted this lower bound to non-commuting operations. The PACELC theorem, introduced in 2010,[7] builds on CAP by stating that even in the absence of partitioning, there is another trade-off between latency and consistency. PACELC means, if partition (P) happens, the trade-off is between availability (A) and consistency (C); Else (E), the trade-off is between latency (L) and consistency (C). See
