Need to sacrifice consistency or availability in the presence of network partitions In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees:[1][2][3] Consistency Every read receives the most recent write or an error. Availability Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. Partition tolerance The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. When a network partition failure happens, it must be decided whether to do one of the following: cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency. CAP Theorem Venn Diagram Thus, if there is a network partition, one has to choose between consistency or availability. Note that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.[4]
