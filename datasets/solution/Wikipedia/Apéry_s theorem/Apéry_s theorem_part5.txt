constants: See also Particular values of the Riemann zeta function § Odd positive integers Apéry and Beukers could simplify their proofs to work on ζ(2) as well thanks to the series representation ζ(2)=3∑n=1∞1n2(2nn).ζ(2)=3∑_n=1^∞1/n^22nn. Due to the success of Apéry's method a search was undertaken for a number ξ5 with the property that ζ(5)=ξ5∑n=1∞(−1)n−1n5(2nn).ζ(5)=ξ_5∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n-1/n^52nn. If such a ξ5 were found then the methods used to prove Apéry's theorem would be expected to work on a proof that ζ(5) is irrational. Unfortunately, extensive computer searching[8] has failed to find such a constant, and in fact it is now known that if ξ5 exists and if it is an algebraic number of degree at most 25, then the coefficients in its minimal polynomial must be enormous, at least 10383, so extending Apéry's proof to work on the higher odd zeta constants does not seem likely to work. Despite this, many mathematicians working in this area expect a breakthrough sometime soon.[when?][9] Indeed, recent work by Wadim Zudilin and Tanguy Rivoal has shown that infinitely many of the numbers ζ(2n + 1) must be irrational,[10] and even that at least one of the numbers ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), and ζ(11) must be irrational.[11] Their work uses linear forms in values of the zeta function and estimates upon them to bound the dimension of a vector space spanned by values of the zeta function at odd integers. Hopes that Zudilin could cut his list further to just one number did not materialise, but work on this problem is still an active area of research. Higher zeta constants have application to physics: they describe correlation functions in quantum spin chains.[12]
