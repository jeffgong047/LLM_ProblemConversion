Sum of the inverses of the positive integers cubed is irrational In mathematics, Apéry's theorem is a result in number theory that states the Apéry's constant ζ(3) is irrational. That is, the number ζ(3)=∑n=1∞1n3=113+123+133+⋯=1.2020569…ζ(3)=∑_n=1^∞1/n^3=1/1^3+1/2^3+1/3^3+⋯=1.2020569… cannot be written as a fraction p/q/q where p and q are integers. The theorem is named after Roger Apéry. The special values of the Riemann zeta function at even integers 2n2n (n>0>0) can be shown in terms of Bernoulli numbers to be irrational, while it remains open whether the function's values are in general rational or not at the odd integers 2n+12n+1 (n>1>1) (though they are conjectured to be irrational).
