proofs: Within a year of Apéry's result an alternative proof was found by Frits Beukers,[5] who replaced Apéry's series with integrals involving the shifted Legendre polynomials Pn (x)P̃_̃ñ(x). Using a representation that would later be generalized to Hadjicostas's formula, Beukers showed that ∫01∫01−log⁡(xy)1−xyPn (x)Pn (y)dxdy=An+Bnζ(3)lcm⁡[1,…,n]3∫_0^1∫_0^1-log(xy)/1-xyP̃_̃ñ(x)P̃_̃ñ(y)dxdy=A_n+B_nζ(3)/lcm[1,…,n]^3 for some integers An and Bn (sequences OEIS: A171484 and OEIS: A171485). Using partial integration and the assumption that ζ(3) was rational and equal to a/b, Beukers eventually derived the inequality 0<1b≤|An+Bnζ(3)|≤4(45)n0<1/b≤|A_n+B_nζ(3)|≤4(4/5)^n which is a contradiction since the right-most expression tends to zero as n → ∞, and so must eventually fall below 1/b. A more recent proof by Wadim Zudilin is more reminiscent of Apéry's original proof,[6] and also has similarities to a fourth proof by Yuri Nesterenko.[7] These later proofs again derive a contradiction from the assumption that ζ(3) is rational by constructing sequences that tend to zero but are bounded below by some positive constant. They are somewhat less transparent than the earlier proofs, since they rely upon hypergeometric series. Higher zeta
