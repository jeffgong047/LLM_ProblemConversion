proof: Apéry's original proof[3][4] was based on the well known irrationality criterion from Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, which states that a number ξ is irrational if there are infinitely many coprime integers p and q such that |ξ−pq|<cq1+δ|ξ-p/q|<c/q^1+δ for some fixed c, δ > 0. The starting point for Apéry was the series representation of ζ(3) as ζ(3)=52∑n=1∞(−1)n−1n3(2nn).ζ(3)=5/2∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n-1/n^32nn. Roughly speaking, Apéry then defined a sequence cn,k which converges to ζ(3) about as fast as the above series, specifically cn,k=∑m=1n1m3+∑m=1k(−1)m−12m3(nm)(n+mm)._n,k=∑_m=1^n1/m^3+∑_m=1^k(-1)^m-1/2m^3nmn+mm. He then defined two more sequences an and bn that, roughly, have the quotient cn,k. These sequences were an=∑k=0ncn,k(nk)2(n+kk)2_n=∑_k=0^nc_n,knk^2n+kk^2 and bn=∑k=0n(nk)2(n+kk)2._n=∑_k=0^nnk^2n+kk^2. The sequence an /bn converges to ζ(3) fast enough to apply the criterion, but unfortunately an is not an integer after n = 2. Nevertheless, Apéry showed that even after multiplying an and bn by a suitable integer to cure this problem the convergence was still fast enough to guarantee irrationality. Later
