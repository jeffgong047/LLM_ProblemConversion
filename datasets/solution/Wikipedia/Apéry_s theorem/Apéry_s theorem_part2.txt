History: Leonhard Euler proved that if n is a positive integer then 112n+122n+132n+142n+⋯=pqπ2n1/1^2n+1/2^2n+1/3^2n+1/4^2n+⋯=p/qπ^2n for some rational number p/q/q. Specifically, writing the infinite series on the left as ζ(2n)ζ(2n), he showed ζ(2n)=(−1)n+1B2n(2π)2n2(2n)!ζ(2n)=(-1)^n+1B_2n(2π)^2n/2(2n)! where the Bn_n are the rational Bernoulli numbers. Once it was proved that πnπ^n is always irrational, this showed that ζ(2n)ζ(2n) is irrational for all positive integers n. No such representation in terms of π is known for the so-called zeta constants for odd arguments, the values ζ(2n+1)ζ(2n+1) for positive integers n. It has been conjectured that the ratios of these quantities ζ(2n+1)π2n+1,ζ(2n+1)/π^2n+1, are transcendental for every integer n≥1≥1.[1] Because of this, no proof could be found to show that the zeta constants with odd arguments were irrational, even though they were (and still are) all believed to be transcendental. However, in June 1978, Roger Apéry gave a talk titled "Sur l'irrationalité de ζ(3)." During the course of the talk he outlined proofs that ζ(3) and ζ(2) were irrational, the latter using methods simplified from those used to tackle the former rather than relying on the expression in terms of π. Due to the wholly unexpected nature of the proof and Apéry's blasé and very sketchy approach to the subject, many of the mathematicians in the audience dismissed the proof as flawed. However Henri Cohen, Hendrik Lenstra, and Alfred van der Poorten suspected Apéry was on to something and set out to confirm his proof. Two months later they finished verification of Apéry's proof, and on August 18 Cohen delivered a lecture giving full details of the proof. After the lecture Apéry himself took to the podium to explain the source of some of his ideas.[2] Apéry's
