Theorem in complex analysis In mathematical analysis, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem[1][2] is a theorem proved by the Danish mathematicians Harald Bohr and Johannes Mollerup.[3] The theorem characterizes the gamma function, defined for x > 0 by Γ(x)=∫0∞tx−1e−tdtΓ(x)=∫_0^∞t^x-1e^-t dt as the only positive function f , with domain on the interval x > 0, that simultaneously has the following three properties: f (1) = 1, and f (x + 1) = x f (x) for x > 0 and f is logarithmically convex. A treatment of this theorem is in Artin's book The Gamma Function,[4] which has been reprinted by the AMS in a collection of Artin's writings.[5] The theorem was first published in a textbook on complex analysis, as Bohr and Mollerup thought it had already been proved.[3] The theorem admits a far-reaching generalization to a wide variety of functions (that have convexity or concavity properties of any order).[6]
