convention: According to the Figure 04, The moment M1, M2, and M3 be positive if they cause compression in the upper part of the beam. (sagging positive) The deflection downward positive. (Downward settlement positive) Let ABC is a continuous beam with support at A,B, and C. Then moment at A,B, and C are M1, M2, and M3, respectively. Let A' B' and C' be the final positions of the beam ABC due to support settlements. Figure 04-Deflection Curve of a Continuous Beam Under Settlement Derivation of three moment
