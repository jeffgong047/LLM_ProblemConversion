Notes: ^ In theories with gauge symmetry, the Goldstone bosons are absent. Their degrees of freedom are absorbed ("eaten", gauged out) by gauge bosons, through the Higgs mechanism. The latter become massive and their new, longitudinal polarization is provided by the would-be Goldstone boson, in an elaborate rearrangement of degrees of freedom . ^ It corresponds to the Goldstone sombrero potential where the tip and the sides shoot to infinity, preserving the location of the minimum at its base.
