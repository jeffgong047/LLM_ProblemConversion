argument: The principle behind Goldstone's argument is that the ground state is not unique. Normally, by current conservation, the charge operator for any symmetry current is time-independent, ddtQ=ddt∫xJ0(x)=0.dQ=d∫_xJ^0(x)=0. Acting with the charge operator on the vacuum either annihilates the vacuum, if that is symmetric; else, if not, as is the case in spontaneous symmetry breaking, it produces a zero-frequency state out of it, through its shift transformation feature illustrated above. Actually, here, the charge itself is ill-defined, cf. the Fabri–Picasso argument below. But its better behaved commutators with fields, that is, the nonvanishing transformation shifts 〈δϕg〉, are, nevertheless, time-invariant, d⟨δϕg⟩dt=0,d⟨δϕ_g⟩/dt=0, thus generating a δ(k0) in its Fourier transform.[15] (This ensures that, inserting a complete set of intermediate states in a nonvanishing current commutator can lead to vanishing time-evolution only when one or more of these states is massless.) Thus, if the vacuum is not invariant under the symmetry, action of the charge operator produces a state which is different from the vacuum chosen, but which has zero frequency. This is a long-wavelength oscillation of a field which is nearly stationary: there are physical states with zero frequency, k0, so that the theory cannot have a mass gap. This argument is further clarified by taking the limit carefully. If an approximate charge operator acting in a huge but finite region A is applied to the vacuum, ddtQA=ddt∫xe−x22A2J0(x)=−∫xe−x22A2∇⋅J=∫x∇(e−x22A2)⋅J,dQ_A=d∫_xe^-x^2/2A^2J^0(x)=-∫_xe^-x^2/2A^2∇=∫_x∇(e^-x^2/2A^2), a state with approximately vanishing time derivative is produced, ‖ddtQA|0⟩‖≈1A‖QA|0⟩‖.dQ_A|0⟩≈1/AQ_A|0⟩. Assuming a nonvanishing mass gap m0, the frequency of any state like the above, which is orthogonal to the vacuum, is at least m0, ‖ddt|θ⟩‖=‖H|θ⟩‖≥m0‖|θ⟩‖.d/dt|θ⟩=H|θ⟩_0|θ⟩. Letting A become large leads to a contradiction. Consequently m0 = 0. However this argument fails when the symmetry is gauged, because then the symmetry generator is only performing a gauge transformation. A gauge transformed state is the same exact state, so that acting with a symmetry generator does not get one out of the vacuum (see Higgs mechanism). Fabri–Picasso Theorem. Q does not properly exist in the Hilbert space, unless Q|0〉 = 0. The argument[16][17] requires both the vacuum and the charge Q to be translationally invariant, P|0〉 = 0, [P,Q]= 0. Consider the correlation function of the charge with itself, ⟨0|QQ|0⟩=∫d3x⟨0|j0(x)Q|0⟩=∫d3x⟨0|eiPxj0(0)e−iPxQ|0⟩=∫d3x⟨0|eiPxj0(0)e−iPxQeiPxe−iPx|0⟩=∫d3x⟨0|j0(0)Q|0⟩⟨0|QQ|0⟩ =^3x⟨0|j_0(x)Q|0⟩ =^3x⟨0|e^iPxj_0(0)e^-iPxQ|0⟩ =^3x⟨0|e^iPxj_0(0)e^-iPxQe^iPxe^-iPx|0⟩ =^3x⟨0|j_0(0)Q|0⟩ so the integrand in the right hand side does not depend on the position. Thus, its value is proportional to the total space volume, ‖Q|0⟩‖2=∞Q|0⟩^2=∞ — unless the symmetry is unbroken, Q|0〉 = 0. Consequently, Q does not properly exist in the Hilbert space.
