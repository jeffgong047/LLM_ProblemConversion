Theory: Consider a complex scalar field ϕ, with the constraint that ϕ∗ϕ=v2ϕ^*ϕ=v^2, a constant. One way to impose a constraint of this sort is by including a potential interaction term in its Lagrangian density, λ(ϕ∗ϕ−v2)2,λ(ϕ^*ϕ-v^2)^2 , and taking the limit as λ → ∞. This is called the "Abelian nonlinear σ-model".[nb 2] The constraint, and the action, below, are invariant under a U(1) phase transformation, δϕ=iεϕ. The field can be redefined to give a real scalar field (i.e., a spin-zero particle) θ without any constraint by ϕ=veiθϕ=ve^iθ where θ is the Nambu–Goldstone boson (actually vθθ is) and the U(1) symmetry transformation effects a shift on θ, namely δθ=ϵ,δθ=ϵ , but does not preserve the ground state |0〉 (i.e. the above infinitesimal transformation does not annihilate it—the hallmark of invariance), as evident in the charge of the current below. Thus, the vacuum is degenerate and noninvariant under the action of the spontaneously broken symmetry. The corresponding Lagrangian density is given by L=12(∂μϕ∗)∂μϕ−m2ϕ∗ϕ=12(−ive−iθ∂μθ)(iveiθ∂μθ)−m2v2,ℒ=1/2(∂^μϕ^*)∂_μϕ-m^2ϕ^*ϕ=1/2(-ive^-iθ∂^μθ)(ive^iθ∂_μθ)-m^2v^2, and thus =v22(∂μθ)(∂μθ)−m2v2.=v^2/2(∂^μθ)(∂_μθ)-m^2v^2 . Note that the constant term m2v2^2v^2 in the Lagrangian density has no physical significance, and the other term in it is simply the kinetic term for a massless scalar. The symmetry-induced conserved U(1) current is Jμ=v2∂μθ._μ=v^2∂_μθ . The charge, Q, resulting from this current shifts θ and the ground state to a new, degenerate, ground state. Thus, a vacuum with 〈θ〉 = 0 will shift to a different vacuum with 〈θ〉 = ε. The current connects the original vacuum with the Nambu–Goldstone boson state, 〈0|J0(0)|θ〉≠ 0. In general, in a theory with several scalar fields, ϕj, the Nambu–Goldstone mode ϕg is massless, and parameterises the curve of possible (degenerate) vacuum states. Its hallmark under the broken symmetry transformation is nonvanishing vacuum expectation 〈δϕg〉, an order parameter, for vanishing 〈ϕg〉 = 0, at some ground state |0〉 chosen at the minimum of the potential, 〈∂V/∂ϕi〉 = 0. In principle the vacuum should be the minimum of the effective potential which takes into account quantum effects, however it is equal to the classical potential to first approximation. Symmetry dictates that all variations of the potential with respect to the fields in all symmetry directions vanish. The vacuum value of the first order variation in any direction vanishes as just seen; while the vacuum value of the second order variation must also vanish, as follows. Vanishing vacuum values of field symmetry transformation increments add no new information. By contrast, however, nonvanishing vacuum expectations of transformation increments, 〈δϕg〉, specify the relevant (Goldstone) null eigenvectors of the mass matrix, ⟨∂2V∂ϕi∂ϕj⟩⟨δϕj⟩=0,⟨∂^2V∂ϕ_i∂ϕ_j⟩⟨δϕ_j⟩=0 , and hence the corresponding zero-mass eigenvalues.
