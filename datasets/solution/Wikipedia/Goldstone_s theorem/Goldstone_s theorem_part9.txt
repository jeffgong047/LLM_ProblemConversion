theories: A version of Goldstone's theorem also applies to nonrelativistic theories.[18][19] It essentially states that, for each spontaneously broken symmetry, there corresponds some quasiparticle which is typically a boson and has no energy gap. In condensed matter these goldstone bosons are also called gapless modes (i.e. states where the energy dispersion relation is like E∝pn^n and is zero for p=0=0), the nonrelativistic version of the massless particles (i.e. photons where the dispersion relation is also E=pc=pc and zero for p=0=0). Note that the energy in the non relativistic condensed matter case is H−μN−α→⋅P→ and not H as it would be in a relativistic case. However, two different spontaneously broken generators may now give rise to the same Nambu–Goldstone boson. As a first example an antiferromagnet has 2 goldstone bosons, a ferromagnet has 1 goldstone bosons, where in both cases we are breaking symmetry from SO(3) to SO(2), for the antiferromagnet the dispersion is E∝p and the expectation value of the ground state is zero, for the ferromagnet instead the dispersion is E∝p2^2 and the expectation value of the ground state is not zero, i.e. there is a spontaneously broken symmetry for the ground state [20][21] As a second example, in a superfluid, both the U(1) particle number symmetry and Galilean symmetry are spontaneously broken. However, the phonon is the Goldstone boson for both.[22][23] Still in regards to symmetry breaking there is also a close analogy between gapless modes in condensed matter and the higgs boson, e.g. in the paramagnet to ferromagnet phase transition[24][25] Breaking of spacetime
