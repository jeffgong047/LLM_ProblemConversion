symmetries: In contrast to the case of the breaking of internal symmetries, when spacetime symmetries such as Lorentz, conformal, rotational, or translational symmetries are broken, the order parameter need not be a scalar field, but may be a tensor field, and the number of independent massless modes may be fewer than the number of spontaneously broken generators. For a theory with an order parameter ⟨ϕ(r)⟩⟨ϕ(r)⟩ that spontaneously breaks a spacetime symmetry, the number of broken generators Ta^a minus the number non-trivial independent solutions ca(r)_a(r) to ca(r)Ta⟨ϕ(r)⟩=0_a(r)T^a⟨ϕ(r)⟩=0 is the number of Goldstone modes that arise.[26] For internal symmetries, the above equation has no non-trivial solutions, so the usual Goldstone theorem holds. When solutions do exist, this is because the Goldstone modes are linearly dependent among themselves, in that the resulting mode can be expressed as a gradients of another mode. Since the spacetime dependence of the solutions ca(r)_a(r) is in the direction of the unbroken generators, when all translation generators are broken, no non-trivial solutions exist and the number of Goldstone modes is once again exactly the number of broken generators. In general, the phonon is effectively the Nambu–Goldstone boson for spontaneously broken translation[27] symmetry. Nambu–Goldstone
