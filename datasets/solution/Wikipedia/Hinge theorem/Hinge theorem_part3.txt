Converse: The converse of the hinge theorem is also true: If the two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, and the third side of the first triangle is greater than the third side of the second triangle, then the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second triangle. In some textbooks, the theorem and its converse are written as the SAS Inequality Theorem and the AAS Inequality Theorem respectively.
