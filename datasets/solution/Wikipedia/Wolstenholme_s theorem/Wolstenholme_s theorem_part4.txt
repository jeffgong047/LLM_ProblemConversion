conjecture: It is conjectured that if (2n−1n−1)≡1(modnk)2n-1-1≡1n^k (1) when k=3, then n is prime. The conjecture can be understood by considering k = 1 and 2 as well as 3. When k = 1, Babbage's theorem implies that it holds for n = p2 for p an odd prime, while Wolstenholme's theorem implies that it holds for n = p3 for p > 3, and it holds for n = p4 if p is a Wolstenholme prime. When k = 2, it holds for n = p2 if p is a Wolstenholme prime. These three numbers, 4 = 22, 8 = 23, and 27 = 33 are not held for (1) with k = 1, but all other prime square and prime cube are held for (1) with k = 1. Only 5 other composite values (neither prime square nor prime cube) of n are known to hold for (1) with k = 1, they are called Wolstenholme pseudoprimes, they are 27173, 2001341, 16024189487, 80478114820849201, 20378551049298456998947681, ... (sequence A082180 in the OEIS) The first three are not prime powers (sequence A228562 in the OEIS), the last two are 168434 and 21246794, 16843 and 2124679 are Wolstenholme primes (sequence A088164 in the OEIS). Besides, with an exception of 168432 and 21246792, no composites are known to hold for (1) with k = 2, much less k = 3. Thus the conjecture is considered likely because Wolstenholme's congruence seems over-constrained and artificial for composite numbers. Moreover, if the congruence does hold for any particular n other than a prime or prime power, and any particular k, it does not imply that (anbn)≡(ab)(modnk).an≡an^k. The number of Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to x is O(x1/2log⁡(log⁡(x))499712)(x^1/2log(log(x))^499712), so the sum of reciprocals of those numbers converges. The constant 499712499712 follows from the existence of only three Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to 101210^12. The number of Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to 101210^12 should be at least 7 if the sum of its reciprocals diverged, and since this is not satisfied, the counting function of these pseudoprimes is at most O(x1/2log⁡(log⁡(x))C)(x^1/2log(log(x))^C) for some efficiently computable constant C; we can take C as 499712.
