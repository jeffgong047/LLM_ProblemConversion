theorem: There is more than one way to prove Wolstenholme's theorem. Here is a proof that directly establishes Glaisher's version using both combinatorics and algebra. For the moment let p be any prime, and let a and b be any non-negative integers. Then a set A with ap elements can be divided into a rings of length p, and the rings can be rotated separately. Thus, the a-fold direct sum of the cyclic group of order p acts on the set A, and by extension it acts on the set of subsets of size bp. Every orbit of this group action has pk elements, where k is the number of incomplete rings, i.e., if there are k rings that only partly intersect a subset B in the orbit. There are (ab)a orbits of size 1 and there are no orbits of size p. Thus we first obtain Babbage's theorem (apbp)≡(ab)(modp2).ap≡ap^2. Examining the orbits of size p2, we also obtain (apbp)≡(ab)+(a2)((2pp)−2)(a−2b−1)(modp3).ap≡a+a2(2p-2)a-2-1p^3. Among other consequences, this equation tells us that the case a=2 and b=1 implies the general case of the second form of Wolstenholme's theorem. Switching from combinatorics to algebra, both sides of this congruence are polynomials in a for each fixed value of b. The congruence therefore holds when a is any integer, positive or negative, provided that b is a fixed positive integer. In particular, if a=-1 and b=1, the congruence becomes (−pp)≡(−11)+(−12)((2pp)−2)(modp3).-p≡-11+-12(2p-2)p^3. This congruence becomes an equation for (2pp)2p using the relation (−pp)=(−1)p2(2pp).-p=(-1)^p/22p. When p is odd, the relation is 3(2pp)≡6(modp3).32p≡6p^3. When p≠3, we can divide both sides by 3 to complete the argument. A similar derivation modulo p4 establishes that (apbp)≡(ab)(modp4)ap≡ap^4 for all positive a and b if and only if it holds when a=2 and b=1, i.e., if and only if p is a Wolstenholme prime.
