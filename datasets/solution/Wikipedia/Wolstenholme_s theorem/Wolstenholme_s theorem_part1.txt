Result in number theory In mathematics, Wolstenholme's theorem states that for a prime number p≥5≥5, the congruence (2p−1p−1)≡1(modp3)2p-1-1≡1p^3 holds, where the parentheses denote a binomial coefficient. For example, with p = 7, this says that 1716 is one more than a multiple of 343. The theorem was first proved by Joseph Wolstenholme in 1862. In 1819, Charles Babbage showed the same congruence modulo p2, which holds for p≥3≥3. An equivalent formulation is the congruence (apbp)≡(ab)(modp3)ap≡ap^3 for p≥5≥5, which is due to Wilhelm Ljunggren[1] (and, in the special case b=1=1, to J. W. L. Glaisher[citation needed]) and is inspired by Lucas' theorem. No known composite numbers satisfy Wolstenholme's theorem and it is conjectured that there are none (see below). A prime that satisfies the congruence modulo p4 is called a Wolstenholme prime (see below). As Wolstenholme himself established, his theorem can also be expressed as a pair of congruences for (generalized) harmonic numbers: 1+12+13+⋯+1p−1≡0(modp2),and1+12+13+…+1-1≡0p^2 1+122+132+⋯+1(p−1)2≡0(modp).1+12^2+13^2+…+1(p-1)^2≡0p. (Congruences with fractions make sense, provided that the denominators are coprime to the modulus.) For example, with p=7, the first of these says that the numerator of 49/20 is a multiple of 49, while the second says the numerator of 5369/3600 is a multiple of 7. Wolstenholme
