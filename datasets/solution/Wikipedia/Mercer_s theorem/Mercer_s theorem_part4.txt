Trace: The following is immediate: Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel; TK has a sequence of nonnegative eigenvalues {λi}i. Then ∫abK(t,t)dt=∑iλi.∫_a^bK(t,t) dt=∑_iλ_i. This shows that the operator TK is a trace class operator and trace⁡(TK)=∫abK(t,t)dt.trace(T_K)=∫_a^bK(t,t) dt.
