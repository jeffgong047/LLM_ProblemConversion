Details: We now explain in greater detail the structure of the proof of Mercer's theorem, particularly how it relates to spectral theory of compact operators. The map K ↦ TK is injective. TK is a non-negative symmetric compact operator on L2[a,b]; moreover K(x, x) ≥ 0. To show compactness, show that the image of the unit ball of L2[a,b] under TK equicontinuous and apply Ascoli's theorem, to show that the image of the unit ball is relatively compact in C([a,b]) with the uniform norm and a fortiori in L2[a,b]. Now apply the spectral theorem for compact operators on Hilbert spaces to TK to show the existence of the orthonormal basis {ei}i of L2[a,b] λiei(t)=[TKei](t)=∫abK(t,s)ei(s)ds.λ_ie_i(t)=[T_Ke_i](t)=∫_a^bK(t,s)e_i(s) ds. If λi ≠ 0, the eigenvector (eigenfunction) ei is seen to be continuous on [a,b]. Now ∑i=1∞λi|ei(t)ei(s)|≤supx∈[a,b]|K(x,x)|,∑_i=1^∞λ_i|e_i(t)e_i(s)|≤sup_x∈[a,b]|K(x,x)|, which shows that the sequence ∑i=1∞λiei(t)ei(s)∑_i=1^∞λ_ie_i(t)e_i(s) converges absolutely and uniformly to a kernel K0 which is easily seen to define the same operator as the kernel K. Hence K=K0 from which Mercer's theorem follows. Finally, to show non-negativity of the eigenvalues one can write λ⟨f,f⟩=⟨f,TKf⟩λ,f⟩=,T_Kf⟩ and expressing the right hand side as an integral well-approximated by its Riemann sums, which are non-negative by positive-definiteness of K, implying λ⟨f,f⟩≥0λ,f⟩≥0, implying λ≥0λ≥0.
