Introduction: To explain Mercer's theorem, we first consider an important special case; see below for a more general formulation. A kernel, in this context, is a symmetric continuous function K:[a,b]×[a,b]→R:[a,b]×[a,b]→ℝ where symmetric means that K(x,y)=K(y,x)(x,y)=K(y,x) for all x,y∈[a,b],y∈[a,b]. K is said to be positive-definite if and only if ∑i=1n∑j=1nK(xi,xj)cicj≥0∑_i=1^n∑_j=1^nK(x_i,x_j)c_ic_j≥0 for all finite sequences of points x1, ..., xn of [a, b] and all choices of real numbers c1, ..., cn. Note that the term "positive-definite" is well-established in literature despite the weak inequality in the definition.[2][3] Associated to K is a linear operator (more specifically a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator) on functions defined by the integral [TKφ](x)=∫abK(x,s)φ(s)ds.[T_Kφ](x)=∫_a^bK(x,s)φ(s) ds. For technical considerations we assume φφ can range through the space L2[a, b] (see Lp space) of square-integrable real-valued functions. Since TK is a linear operator, we can talk about eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of TK. Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel. Then there is an orthonormal basis {ei}i of L2[a, b] consisting of eigenfunctions of TK such that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {λi}i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on [a, b] and K has the representation K(s,t)=∑j=1∞λjej(s)ej(t)(s,t)=∑_j=1^∞λ_j e_j(s) e_j(t) where the convergence is absolute and uniform.
