Generalizations: Mercer's theorem itself is a generalization of the result that any symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix of a set of vectors. The first generalization[citation needed] replaces the interval [a, b] with any compact Hausdorff space and Lebesgue measure on [a, b] is replaced by a finite countably additive measure μ on the Borel algebra of X whose support is X. This means that μ(U) > 0 for any nonempty open subset U of X. A recent generalization[citation needed] replaces these conditions by the following: the set X is a first-countable topological space endowed with a Borel (complete) measure μ. X is the support of μ and, for all x in X, there is an open set U containing x and having finite measure. Then essentially the same result holds: Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel on X. If the function κ is L1μ(X), where κ(x)=K(x,x), for all x in X, then there is an orthonormal set {ei}i of L2μ(X) consisting of eigenfunctions of TK such that corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {λi}i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on X and K has the representation K(s,t)=∑j=1∞λjej(s)ej(t)(s,t)=∑_j=1^∞λ_j e_j(s) e_j(t) where the convergence is absolute and uniform on compact subsets of X. The next generalization[citation needed] deals with representations of measurable kernels. Let (X, M, μ) be a σ-finite measure space. An L2 (or square-integrable) kernel on X is a function K∈Lμ⊗μ2(X×X)._μ⊗μ^2(X). L2 kernels define a bounded operator TK by the formula ⟨TKφ,ψ⟩=∫X×XK(y,x)φ(y)ψ(x)d[μ⊗μ](y,x)._Kφ,ψ⟩=∫_XK(y,x)φ(y)ψ(x) d[μ⊗μ](y,x). TK is a compact operator (actually it is even a Hilbert–Schmidt operator). If the kernel K is symmetric, by the spectral theorem, TK has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Those eigenvectors that correspond to non-zero eigenvalues can be arranged in a sequence {ei}i (regardless of separability). Theorem. If K is a symmetric positive-definite kernel on (X, M, μ), then K(y,x)=∑i∈Nλiei(y)ei(x)(y,x)=∑_i∈ℕλ_ie_i(y)e_i(x) where the convergence in the L2 norm. Note that when continuity of the kernel is not assumed, the expansion no longer converges uniformly. Mercer's
