In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Hadamard three-circle theorem is a result about the behavior of holomorphic functions. Let f(z)(z) be a holomorphic function on the annulus r1≤|z|≤r3._1≤|z|_3. Let M(r)(r) be the maximum of |f(z)||f(z)| on the circle |z|=r.|z|=r. Then, log⁡M(r)(r) is a convex function of the logarithm log⁡(r).log(r). Moreover, if f(z)(z) is not of the form czλ^λ for some constants λλ and c, then log⁡M(r)(r) is strictly convex as a function of log⁡(r).log(r). The conclusion of the theorem can be restated as log⁡(r3r1)log⁡M(r2)≤log⁡(r3r2)log⁡M(r1)+log⁡(r2r1)log⁡M(r3)log(r_3/r_1)(r_2)≤log(r_3/r_2)(r_1)+log(r_2/r_1)(r_3) for any three concentric circles of radii r1<r2<r3._1<r_2<r_3.
