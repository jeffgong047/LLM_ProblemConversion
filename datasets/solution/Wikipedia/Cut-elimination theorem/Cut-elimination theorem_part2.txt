rule: A sequent is a logical expression relating multiple formulas, in the form "A1,A2,A3,…⊢B1,B2,B3,…_1,A_2,A_3,…_1,B_2,B_3,…", which is to be read as "A1,A2,A3,…_1,A_2,A_3,… proves B1,B2,B3,…_1,B_2,B_3,…", and (as glossed by Gentzen) should be understood as equivalent to the truth-function "If (A1_1 and A2_2 and A3_3 …) then (B1_1 or B2_2 or B3_3 …)."[3] Note that the left-hand side (LHS) is a conjunction (and) and the right-hand side (RHS) is a disjunction (or). The LHS may have arbitrarily many or few formulae; when the LHS is empty, the RHS is a tautology. In LK, the RHS may also have any number of formulae—if it has none, the LHS is a contradiction, whereas in LJ the RHS may only have one formula or none: here we see that allowing more than one formula in the RHS is equivalent, in the presence of the right contraction rule, to the admissibility of the law of the excluded middle. However, the sequent calculus is a fairly expressive framework, and there have been sequent calculi for intuitionistic logic proposed that allow many formulae in the RHS. From Jean-Yves Girard's logic LC it is easy to obtain a rather natural formalisation of classical logic where the RHS contains at most one formula; it is the interplay of the logical and structural rules that is the key here. "Cut" is a rule in the normal statement of the sequent calculus, and equivalent to a variety of rules in other proof theories, which, given Γ⊢A,ΔΓ,Δ and Π,A⊢ΛΠ,A⊢Λ allows one to infer Γ,Π⊢Δ,ΛΓ,Π⊢Δ,Λ That is, it "cuts" the occurrences of the formula A out of the inferential relation.
