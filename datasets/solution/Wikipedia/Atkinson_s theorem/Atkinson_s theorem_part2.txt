theorem: Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H) the set of bounded operators on H. The following is the classical definition of a Fredholm operator: an operator T ∈ L(H) is said to be a Fredholm operator if the kernel Ker(T) is finite-dimensional, Ker(T*) is finite-dimensional (where T* denotes the adjoint of T), and the range Ran(T) is closed. Atkinson's theorem states: A T ∈ L(H) is a Fredholm operator if and only if T is invertible modulo compact perturbation, i.e. TS = I + C1 and ST = I + C2 for some bounded operator S and compact operators C1 and C2. In other words, an operator T ∈ L(H) is Fredholm, in the classical sense, if and only if its projection in the Calkin algebra is invertible. Sketch of
