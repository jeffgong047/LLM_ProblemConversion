derivatives: We can also generalize Rolle's theorem by requiring that f has more points with equal values and greater regularity. Specifically, suppose that the function f is n − 1 times continuously differentiable on the closed interval [a, b] and the nth derivative exists on the open interval (a, b), and there are n intervals given by a1 < b1 ≤ a2 < b2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ an < bn in [a, b] such that f (ak) = f (bk) for every k from 1 to n. Then there is a number c in (a, b) such that the nth derivative of f at c is zero. The red curve is the graph of function with 3 roots in the interval [−3, 2]. Thus its second derivative (graphed in green) also has a root in the same interval. The requirements concerning the nth derivative of f can be weakened as in the generalization above, giving the corresponding (possibly weaker) assertions for the right- and left-hand limits defined above with f (n − 1) in place of f. Particularly, this version of the theorem asserts that if a function differentiable enough times has n roots (so they have the same value, that is 0), then there is an internal point where f (n − 1) vanishes.
