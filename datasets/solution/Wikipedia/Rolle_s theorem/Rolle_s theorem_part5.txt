example: A semicircle of radius r. For a radius r > 0, consider the function f(x)=r2−x2,x∈[−r,r].(x)=√(r^2-x^2),∈[-r,r]. Its graph is the upper semicircle centered at the origin. This function is continuous on the closed interval [−r, r] and differentiable in the open interval (−r, r), but not differentiable at the endpoints −r and r. Since f (−r) = f (r), Rolle's theorem applies, and indeed, there is a point where the derivative of f is zero. The theorem applies even when the function cannot be differentiated at the endpoints because it only requires the function to be differentiable in the open interval. Second
