Remarks: If f is convex or concave, then the right- and left-hand derivatives exist at every inner point, hence the above limits exist and are real numbers. This generalized version of the theorem is sufficient to prove convexity when the one-sided derivatives are monotonically increasing:[3] f′(x−)≤f′(x+)≤f′(y−),x<y.'(x^-)'(x^+)'(y^-),<y. Proof of the generalized
