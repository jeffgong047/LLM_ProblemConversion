example: The graph of the absolute value function. If differentiability fails at an interior point of the interval, the conclusion of Rolle's theorem may not hold. Consider the absolute value function f(x)=|x|,x∈[−1,1].(x)=|x|,∈[-1,1]. Then f (−1) = f (1), but there is no c between −1 and 1 for which the f ′(c) is zero. This is because that function, although continuous, is not differentiable at x = 0. The derivative of f changes its sign at x = 0, but without attaining the value 0. The theorem cannot be applied to this function because it does not satisfy the condition that the function must be differentiable for every x in the open interval. However, when the differentiability requirement is dropped from Rolle's theorem, f will still have a critical number in the open interval (a, b), but it may not yield a horizontal tangent (as in the case of the absolute value represented in the graph).
