Proof: The proof uses mathematical induction. The case n = 1 is simply the standard version of Rolle's theorem. For n > 1, take as the induction hypothesis that the generalization is true for n − 1. We want to prove it for n. Assume the function f satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem. By the standard version of Rolle's theorem, for every integer k from 1 to n, there exists a ck in the open interval (ak, bk) such that f ′(ck) = 0. Hence, the first derivative satisfies the assumptions on the n − 1 closed intervals [c1, c2], …, [cn − 1, cn]. By the induction hypothesis, there is a c such that the (n − 1)st derivative of f ′ at c is zero. Generalizations to other
