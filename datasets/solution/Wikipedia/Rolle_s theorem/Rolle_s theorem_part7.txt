Generalization: The second example illustrates the following generalization of Rolle's theorem: Consider a real-valued, continuous function f on a closed interval [a, b] with f (a) = f (b). If for every x in the open interval (a, b) the right-hand limit f′(x+):=limh→0+f(x+h)−f(x)h'(x^+):=lim_h→0^+f(x+h)-f(x)/h and the left-hand limit f′(x−):=limh→0−f(x+h)−f(x)h'(x^-):=lim_h→0^-f(x+h)-f(x)/h exist in the extended real line [−∞, ∞], then there is some number c in the open interval (a, b) such that one of the two limits f′(c+)andf′(c−)'(c^+) and'(c^-) is ≥ 0 and the other one is ≤ 0 (in the extended real line). If the right- and left-hand limits agree for every x, then they agree in particular for c, hence the derivative of f exists at c and is equal to zero.
