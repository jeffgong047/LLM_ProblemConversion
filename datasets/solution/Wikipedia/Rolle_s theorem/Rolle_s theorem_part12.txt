fields: Rolle's theorem is a property of differentiable functions over the real numbers, which are an ordered field. As such, it does not generalize to other fields, but the following corollary does: if a real polynomial factors (has all of its roots) over the real numbers, then its derivative does as well. One may call this property of a field Rolle's property.[citation needed] More general fields do not always have differentiable functions, but they do always have polynomials, which can be symbolically differentiated. Similarly, more general fields may not have an order, but one has a notion of a root of a polynomial lying in a field. Thus Rolle's theorem shows that the real numbers have Rolle's property. Any algebraically closed field such as the complex numbers has Rolle's property. However, the rational numbers do not – for example, x3 − x = x(x − 1)(x + 1) factors over the rationals, but its derivative, 3x2−1=3(x−13)(x+13),3x^2-1=3(x-1√(3))(x+1√(3)), does not. The question of which fields satisfy Rolle's property was raised in (Kaplansky 1972).[4] For finite fields, the answer is that only F2 and F4 have Rolle's property.[5][6] For a complex version, see Voorhoeve index.
