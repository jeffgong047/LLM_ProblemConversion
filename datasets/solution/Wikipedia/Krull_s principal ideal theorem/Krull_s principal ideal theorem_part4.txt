theorem: Krull’s height theorem can be proved as a consequence of the principal ideal theorem by induction on the number of elements. Let x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n be elements in A, p𝔭 a minimal prime over (x1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_n) and q⊊p𝔮⊊𝔭 a prime ideal such that there is no prime strictly between them. Replacing A by the localization Ap_𝔭 we can assume (A,p)(A,𝔭) is a local ring; note we then have p=(x1,…,xn)𝔭=√((x_1,…,x_n)). By minimality, q𝔮 cannot contain all the xi_i; relabeling the subscripts, say, x1∉q_1∉𝔮. Since every prime ideal containing q+(x1)𝔮+(x_1) is between q𝔮 and p𝔭, q+(x1)=p√(𝔮+(x_1))=𝔭 and thus we can write for each i≥2≥2, xiri=yi+aix1_i^r_i=y_i+a_ix_1 with yi∈q_i∈𝔮 and ai∈A_i. Now we consider the ring A¯=A/(y2,…,yn)A=A/(y_2,…,y_n) and the corresponding chain q¯⊂p¯𝔮⊂𝔭 in it. If r¯𝔯 is a minimal prime over x1¯x_1, then r𝔯 contains x1,x2r2,…,xnrn_1,x_2^r_2,…,x_n^r_n and thus r=p𝔯=𝔭; that is to say, p¯𝔭 is a minimal prime over x1¯x_1 and so, by Krull’s principal ideal theorem, q¯𝔮 is a minimal prime (over zero); q𝔮 is a minimal prime over (y2,…,yn)(y_2,…,y_n). By inductive hypothesis, ht⁡(q)≤n−1ht(𝔮)-1 and thus ht⁡(p)≤nht(𝔭). ◻□
