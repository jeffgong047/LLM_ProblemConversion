Theorem in commutative algebra In commutative algebra, Krull's principal ideal theorem, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899â€“1971), gives a bound on the height of a principal ideal in a commutative Noetherian ring. The theorem is sometimes referred to by its German name, Krulls Hauptidealsatz (Satz meaning "proposition" or "theorem"). Precisely, if R is a Noetherian ring and I is a principal, proper ideal of R, then each minimal prime ideal over I has height at most one. This theorem can be generalized to ideals that are not principal, and the result is often called Krull's height theorem. This says that if R is a Noetherian ring and I is a proper ideal generated by n elements of R, then each minimal prime over I has height at most n. The converse is also true: if a prime ideal has height n, then it is a minimal prime ideal over an ideal generated by n elements.[1] The principal ideal theorem and the generalization, the height theorem, both follow from the fundamental theorem of dimension theory in commutative algebra (see also below for the direct proofs). Bourbaki's Commutative Algebra gives a direct proof. Kaplansky's Commutative Rings includes a proof due to David Rees.
