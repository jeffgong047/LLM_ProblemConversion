theorem: Let A be a Noetherian ring, x an element of it and p𝔭 a minimal prime over x. Replacing A by the localization Ap_𝔭, we can assume A is local with the maximal ideal p𝔭. Let q⊊p𝔮⊊𝔭 be a strictly smaller prime ideal and let q(n)=qnAq∩A𝔮^(n)=𝔮^nA_𝔮, which is a q𝔮-primary ideal called the n-th symbolic power of q𝔮. It forms a descending chain of ideals A⊃q⊃q(2)⊃q(3)⊃⋯⊃𝔮⊃𝔮^(2)⊃𝔮^(3)⊃⋯. Thus, there is the descending chain of ideals q(n)+(x)/(x)𝔮^(n)+(x)/(x) in the ring A¯=A/(x)A=A/(x). Now, the radical (x)√((x)) is the intersection of all minimal prime ideals containing x; p𝔭 is among them. But p𝔭 is a unique maximal ideal and thus (x)=p√((x))=𝔭. Since (x)(x) contains some power of its radical, it follows that A¯A is an Artinian ring and thus the chain q(n)+(x)/(x)𝔮^(n)+(x)/(x) stabilizes and so there is some n such that q(n)+(x)=q(n+1)+(x)𝔮^(n)+(x)=𝔮^(n+1)+(x). It implies: q(n)=q(n+1)+xq(n)𝔮^(n)=𝔮^(n+1)+x 𝔮^(n), from the fact q(n)𝔮^(n) is q𝔮-primary (if y is in q(n)𝔮^(n), then y=z+ax=z+ax with z∈q(n+1)∈𝔮^(n+1) and a∈A. Since p𝔭 is minimal over x, x∉q∉𝔮 and so ax∈q(n)∈𝔮^(n) implies a is in q(n)𝔮^(n).) Now, quotienting out both sides by q(n+1)𝔮^(n+1) yields q(n)/q(n+1)=(x)q(n)/q(n+1)𝔮^(n)/𝔮^(n+1)=(x)𝔮^(n)/𝔮^(n+1). Then, by Nakayama's lemma (which says a finitely generated module M is zero if M=IM=IM for some ideal I contained in the radical), we get M=q(n)/q(n+1)=0=𝔮^(n)/𝔮^(n+1)=0; i.e., q(n)=q(n+1)𝔮^(n)=𝔮^(n+1) and thus qnAq=qn+1Aq𝔮^nA_𝔮=𝔮^n+1A_𝔮. Using Nakayama's lemma again, qnAq=0𝔮^nA_𝔮=0 and Aq_𝔮 is an Artinian ring; thus, the height of q𝔮 is zero. ◻□ Proof of the height
