proof: Given a system of n dimensional variables q1,…,qn_1,…,q_n in ℓℓ fundamental (basis) dimensions, the dimensional matrix is the ℓ×nℓ matrix M whose ℓℓ rows correspond to the fundamental dimensions and whose n columns are the dimensions of the variables: the (i,j)(i,j)th entry (where 1≤i≤ℓ1≤ℓ and 1≤j≤n1) is the power of the ith fundamental dimension in the jth variable. The matrix can be interpreted as taking in a combination of the variable quantities and giving out the dimensions of the combination in terms of the fundamental dimensions. So the ℓ×1ℓ×1 (column) vector that results from the multiplication M[a1⋮an][ a_1; ⋮; a_n ] consists of the units of q1a1q2a2⋯qnan_1^a_1 q_2^a_2_n^a_n in terms of the ℓℓ fundamental independent (basis) units.[note 3] If we rescale the ith fundamental unit by a factor of αiα_i, then qj_j gets rescaled by α1−m1jα2−m2j⋯αℓ−mℓjα_1^-m_1j α_2^-m_2j⋯α_ℓ^-m_, where mij_ij is the (i,j)(i,j)th entry of the dimensional matrix. In order to convert this into a linear algebra problem, we take logarithms (the base is irrelevant), yielding [log⁡q1⋮log⁡qn]↦[log⁡q1⋮log⁡qn]−MT[log⁡α1⋮log⁡αℓ],[ logq_1; ⋮; logq_n ]↦[ logq_1; ⋮; logq_n ]-M^T[ logα_1; ⋮; logα_ℓ ], which is an action of Rℓℝ^ℓ on Rnℝ^n. We define a physical law to be an arbitrary function f:(R+)n→R(ℝ^+)^n→ℝ such that (q1,q2,…,qn)(q_1,q_2,…,q_n) is a permissible set of values for the physical system when f(q1,q2,…,qn)=0(q_1,q_2,…,q_n)=0. We further require f to be invariant under this action. Hence it descends to a function F:Rn/im⁡MT→Rℝ^n/imM^T→ℝ. All that remains is to exhibit an isomorphism between Rn/im⁡MTℝ^n/imM^T and Rpℝ^p, the (log) space of pi groups (log⁡π1,log⁡π2,…,log⁡πp)(logπ_1,logπ_2,…,logπ_p). We construct an n×p matrix K whose columns are a basis for ker⁡MM. It tells us how to embed Rpℝ^p into Rnℝ^n as the kernel of M. That is, we have an exact sequence 0→Rp→KRn→MRℓ.0→ℝ^p Taking tranposes yields another exact sequence Rℓ→MTRn→KTRp→0.ℝ^ℓ The first isomorphism theorem produces the desired isomorphism, which sends the coset v+MTRℓ+M^Tℝ^ℓ to KTv^Tv. This corresponds to rewriting the tuple (log⁡q1,log⁡q2,…,log⁡qn)(_1,_2,…,_n) into the pi groups (log⁡π1,log⁡π2,…,log⁡πp)(logπ_1,logπ_2,…,logπ_p) coming from the columns of K. The International System of Units defines seven base units, which are the ampere, kelvin, second, metre, kilogram, candela and mole. It is sometimes advantageous to introduce additional base units and techniques to refine the technique of dimensional analysis. (See orientational analysis and reference.[8])
