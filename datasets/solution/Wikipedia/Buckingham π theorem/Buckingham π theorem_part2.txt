History: Although named for Edgar Buckingham, the π theorem was first proved by the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand[1] in 1878. Bertrand considered only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains, in distinct terms, all the basic ideas of the modern proof of the theorem and clearly indicates the theorem's utility for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of using the theorem ("the method of dimensions") became widely known due to the works of Rayleigh. The first application of the π theorem in the general case[note 1] to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892,[2] a heuristic proof with the use of series expansions, to 1894.[3] Formal generalization of the π theorem for the case of arbitrarily many quantities was given first by A. Vaschy [fr] in 1892,[4] then in 1911—apparently independently—by both A. Federman[5] and D. Riabouchinsky,[6] and again in 1914 by Buckingham.[7] It was Buckingham's article that introduced the use of the symbol "πiπ_i" for the dimensionless variables (or parameters), and this is the source of the theorem's name.
