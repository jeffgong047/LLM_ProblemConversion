Notes: ^ When in applying the π–theorem there arises an arbitrary function of dimensionless numbers. ^ A dimensionally independent set of variables is one for which the only exponents q1a1q2a2⋯qkak_1^a_1 q_2^a_2_k^a_k yielding a dimensionless quantity are a1=a2=⋯=0_1=a_2=⋯=0. This is precisely the notion of linear independence. ^ If these basis units are b1,…,bℓ_1,…,b_ℓ and if the units of qj=m1jb1+⋯+mℓjbℓ_j=m_1jb_1+⋯+m_b_ℓ for every 1≤j≤n1, then M=[m11⋯m1j⋯m1n⋮⋮⋮mℓ1⋯mℓj⋯mℓn]=[ m_11 ⋯ m_1j ⋯ m_1n; ⋮ ⋮ ⋮; m_ℓ1 ⋯ m_ ⋯ m_; ] so that, for instance, the units of q1_1 in terms of these basis units are M([10⋯0]T)=[m11⋮mℓ1].([1 cdots]^T)=[ m_11; ⋮; m_ℓ1; ]. For a concrete example, suppose that the ℓ=2ℓ=2 fundamental units are meters b1=m_1=m and seconds b2=s,_2=s, and that there are n=3=3 dimensional variables: q1=m/s2,q2=1/m,q3=s/m._1=m/s^2,q_2=1/m,q_3=s/m. By definition of vector addition and scalar multiplication of units, q1=ms−2=1m+(−2)s,q2=m−1=(−1)m+0s,andq3=m−1s=(−1)m+1s,_1=ms^-2=1m+(-2)s,_2=m^-1=(-1)m+0s, and_3=m^-1s=(-1)m+1s, so that M=[m11m12m13m21m22m23]=[1−1−1−201].=[ m_11 m_12 m_13; m_21 m_22 m_23; ]=[ 1 -1 -1; -2 0 1; ]. By definition, the dimensionless variables are those whose units are m0s0,^0s^0, which are exactly the vectors in ker⁡M=span⁡[1,−1,2]T=(q1−q2+2q3)s:s∈Q.=span{[1,-1,2]^T}={(q_1-q_2+2q_3)^s:s∈ℚ}. This can be verified by a direct computation: q1−q2+2q3=(ms−2)1+(m−1)−1+(sm−1)2=m1s−2+m1+m−2s2=m1+1+(−2)s−2+0+2=m0s0,_1-q_2+2q_3=(ms^-2)^1+(m^-1)^-1+(sm^-1)^2=m^1s^-2+m^1+m^-2s^2=m^1+1+(-2)s^-2+0+2=m^0s^0, which is indeed dimensionless. Consequently, if some physical law states that q1,q2,q3_1,q_2,q_3 are necessarily related by a (presumably unknown) equation of the form f(q1,q2,q3)=0(q_1,q_2,q_3)=0 for some (unknown) function f with domain⁡(f)⊆R3domain(f)⊆ℝ^3 (that is, the tuple (q1,q2,q3)(q_1,q_2,q_3) is necessarily a zero of f), then there exists some (also unknown) function F:R1→R:ℝ^1→ℝ that depends on only p=3−2=1=3-2=1 variable, the dimensionless variable π1:=q1−q2+2q3=q1q32/q2π_1:=q_1-q_2+2q_3=q_1q_3^2/q_2 (or any non-zero rational power π^1:=π1sπ̂_1:=π_1^s of π1,π_1, where 0≠s∈Q0∈ℚ), such that F(π1)=0(π_1)=0 holds (if π^1:=π1sπ̂_1:=π_1^s is used instead of π1π_1 then F can be replaced with F^(x):=F(x1/s)F̂(x):=F(x^1/s) and once again F^(π^1)=0F̂(π̂_1)=0 holds). Thus in terms of the original variables, F(q1q32/q2)=0(q_1q_3^2/q_2)=0 must hold (alternatively, if using π^1:=π11/2=π1π̂_1:=π_1^1/2=√(π_1) for instance, then F^(q1q32/q2)=0F̂(√(q_1q_3^2/q_2))=0 must hold). In other words, the Buckingham π theorem implies that q1q32/q2∈F−1(0),_1q_3^2/q_2^-1(0), so that if it happens to be the case that this F has exactly one zero, call it C,, then the equation q1q32/q2=C_1q_3^2/q_2=C will necessarily hold (the theorem does not give information about what the exact value of the constant C will be, nor does it guarantee that F has exactly one zero).
