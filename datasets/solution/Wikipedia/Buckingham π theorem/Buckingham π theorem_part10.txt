pendulum: We wish to determine the period T of small oscillations in a simple pendulum. It will be assumed that it is a function of the length L,, the mass M,, and the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth g,, which has dimensions of length divided by time squared. The model is of the form f(T,M,L,g)=0.(T,M,L,g)=0. (Note that it is written as a relation, not as a function: T is not written here as a function of M,L,andg.,L,andg.) Period, mass, and length are dimensionally independent, but acceleration can be expressed in terms of time and length, which means the four variables taken together are not dimensionally independent. Thus we need only p=n−k=4−3=1=n-k=4-3=1 dimensionless parameter, denoted by π,π, and the model can be re-expressed as F(π)=0,(π)=0, where ππ is given by π=Ta1Ma2La3ga4π=T^a_1M^a_2L^a_3g^a_4 for some values of a1,a2,a3,a4._1,a_2,a_3,a_4. The dimensions of the dimensional quantities are: T=t,M=m,L=ℓ,g=ℓ/t2.=t,M=m,L=ℓ,g=ℓ/t^2. The dimensional matrix is: M=[100−201000011].𝐌=[ 1 0 0 -2; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 1 ]. (The rows correspond to the dimensions t,m,,m, and ℓ,ℓ, and the columns to the dimensional variables T,M,L,andg.,M,L,andg. For instance, the 4th column, (−2,0,1),(-2,0,1), states that the g variable has dimensions of t−2m0ℓ1.^-2m^0ℓ^1.) We are looking for a kernel vector a=[a1,a2,a3,a4]=[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4] such that the matrix product of M𝐌 on a yields the zero vector [0,0,0].[0,0,0]. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a kernel vector within a multiplicative constant: a=[20−11].=[ 2; 0; -1; 1 ]. Were it not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant may be written: π=T2M0L−1g1=gT2/L.π =T^2M^0L^-1g^1 =gT^2/L. In fundamental terms: π=(t)2(m)0(ℓ)−1(ℓ/t2)1=1,π=(t)^2(m)^0(ℓ)^-1(ℓ/t^2)^1=1, which is dimensionless. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, if the above dimensionless constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent dimensionless constant. In this example, three of the four dimensional quantities are fundamental units, so the last (which is g) must be a combination of the previous. Note that if a2_2 (the coefficient of M) had been non-zero then there would be no way to cancel the M value; therefore a2_2 must be zero. Dimensional analysis has allowed us to conclude that the period of the pendulum is not a function of its mass M.. (In the 3D space of powers of mass, time, and distance, we can say that the vector for mass is linearly independent from the vectors for the three other variables. Up to a scaling factor, g→+2T→−L→g⃗+2T⃗-L⃗ is the only nontrivial way to construct a vector of a dimensionless parameter.) The model can now be expressed as: F(gT2/L)=0.(gT^2/L)=0. Then this implies that gT2/L=Ci^2/L=C_i for some zero Ci_i of the function F.. If there is only one zero, call it C,, then gT2/L=C.^2/L=C. It requires more physical insight or an experiment to show that there is indeed only one zero and that the constant is in fact given by C=4π2.=4π^2. For large oscillations of a pendulum, the analysis is complicated by an additional dimensionless parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the angle approaches zero. Electric
