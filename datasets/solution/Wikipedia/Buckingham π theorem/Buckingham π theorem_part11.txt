power: To demonstrate the application of the π theorem, consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape. The power, P, in dimensions [M · L2/T3], is a function of the density, ρ [M/L3], and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred, μ [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter, D [L], and the angular speed of the stirrer, n [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of n = 5 variables representing our example. Those n = 5 variables are built up from k = 3 independent dimensions, e.g., length: L (SI units: m), time: T (s), and mass: M (kg). According to the π-theorem, the n = 5 variables can be reduced by the k = 3 dimensions to form p = n − k = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. Usually, these quantities are chosen as Re=ρnD2μRe=^2/μ, commonly named the Reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime, and Np=Pρn3D5_p=P/^3D^5, the power number, which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer. Note that the two dimensionless quantities are not unique and depend on which of the n = 5 variables are chosen as the k = 3 dimensionally independent basis variables, which, in this example, appear in both dimensionless quantities. The Reynolds number and power number fall from the above analysis if ρρ, n, and D are chosen to be the basis variables. If, instead, μμ, n, and D are selected, the Reynolds number is recovered while the second dimensionless quantity becomes NRep=PμD3n2_Rep=P/^3n^2. We note that NRep_Rep is the product of the Reynolds number and the power number. Other
