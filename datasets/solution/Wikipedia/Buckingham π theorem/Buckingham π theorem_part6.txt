units: Suppose we have quantities q1,q2,…,qn_1,q_2,…,q_n, where the units of qi_i contain length raised to the power ci_i. If we originally measure length in meters but later switch to centimeters, then the numerical value of qi_i would be rescaled by a factor of 100ci100^c_i. Any physically meaningful law should be invariant under an arbitrary rescaling of every fundamental unit; this is the fact that the pi theorem hinges on. Formal
