Speed: This example is elementary but serves to demonstrate the procedure. Suppose a car is driving at 100 km/h; how long does it take to go 200 km? This question considers n=3=3 dimensioned variables: distance d,, time t,, and speed v,, and we are seeking some law of the form t=Duration⁡(v,d).=Duration(v,d). Any two of these variables are dimensionally independent, but the three taken together are not. Thus there is p=n−k=3−2=1=n-k=3-2=1 dimensionless quantity. The dimensional matrix is M=[10101−1]=[ 1 0 1; 0 1 -1 ] in which the rows correspond to the basis dimensions L and T,, and the columns to the considered dimensions L,T,andV,,T,andV, where the latter stands for the speed dimension. The elements of the matrix correspond to the powers to which the respective dimensions are to be raised. For instance, the third column (1,−1),(1,-1), states that V=L0T0V1,=L^0T^0V^1, represented by the column vector v=[0,0,1],𝐯=[0,0,1], is expressible in terms of the basis dimensions as V=L1T−1=L/T,=L^1T^-1=L/T, since Mv=[1,−1].𝐯=[1,-1]. For a dimensionless constant π=La1Ta2Va3,π=L^a_1T^a_2V^a_3, we are looking for vectors a=[a1,a2,a3]𝐚=[a_1,a_2,a_3] such that the matrix-vector product Ma𝐚 equals the zero vector [0,0].[0,0]. In linear algebra, the set of vectors with this property is known as the kernel (or nullspace) of the dimensional matrix. In this particular case its kernel is one-dimensional. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a non-zero kernel vector to within a multiplicative constant: a=[−111].𝐚=[ -1; 1; 1; ]. If the dimensional matrix were not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant, replacing the dimensions by the corresponding dimensioned variables, may be written: π=d−1t1v1=tv/d.π=d^-1t^1v^1=tv/d. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, the above dimensionless constant raised to any arbitrary power yields another (equivalent) dimensionless constant. Dimensional analysis has thus provided a general equation relating the three physical variables: F(π)=0,(π)=0, or, letting C denote a zero of function F,, π=C,π=C, which can be written in the desired form (which recall was t=Duration⁡(v,d)=Duration(v,d)) as t=Cdv.=Cd/v. The actual relationship between the three variables is simply d=vt.=vt. In other words, in this case F has one physically relevant root, and it is unity. The fact that only a single value of C will do and that it is equal to 1 is not revealed by the technique of dimensional analysis. The simple
