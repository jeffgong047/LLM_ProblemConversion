Statement: More formally, the number p of dimensionless terms that can be formed is equal to the nullity of the dimensional matrix, and k is the rank. For experimental purposes, different systems that share the same description in terms of these dimensionless numbers are equivalent. In mathematical terms, if we have a physically meaningful equation such as f(q1,q2,…,qn)=0,(q_1,q_2,…,q_n)=0, where q1,…,qn_1,…,q_n are any n physical variables, and there is a maximal dimensionally independent subset of size k,[note 2] then the above equation can be restated as F(π1,π2,…,πp)=0,(π_1,π_2,…,π_p)=0, where π1,…,πpπ_1,…,π_p are dimensionless parameters constructed from the qi_i by p=n−k=n-k dimensionless equations — the so-called Pi groups — of the form πi=q1a1q2a2⋯qnan,π_i=q_1^a_1 q_2^a_2_n^a_n, where the exponents ai_i are rational numbers. (They can always be taken to be integers by redefining πiπ_i as being raised to a power that clears all denominators.) If there are ℓℓ fundamental units in play, then p≥n−ℓ-ℓ.
