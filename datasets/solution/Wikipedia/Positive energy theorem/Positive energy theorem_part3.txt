sets: An initial data set consists of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) and a symmetric 2-tensor field k on M. One says that an initial data set (M, g, k): is time-symmetric if k is zero is maximal if trgk = 0 [1] satisfies the dominant energy condition if Rg−|k|g2+(trg⁡k)2≥2|divg⁡k−d(trg⁡k)|g,^g-|k|_g^2+(tr_gk)^2≥2|div^gk-d(tr_gk)|_g, where Rg denotes the scalar curvature of g.[2] Note that a time-symmetric initial data set (M, g, 0) satisfies the dominant energy condition if and only if the scalar curvature of g is nonnegative. One says that a Lorentzian manifold (M, g) is a development of an initial data set (M, g, k) if there is a (necessarily spacelike) hypersurface embedding of M into M, together with a continuous unit normal vector field, such that the induced metric is g and the second fundamental form with respect to the given unit normal is k. This definition is motivated from Lorentzian geometry. Given a Lorentzian manifold (M, g) of dimension n + 1 and a spacelike immersion f from a connected n-dimensional manifold M into M which has a trivial normal bundle, one may consider the induced Riemannian metric g = f *g as well as the second fundamental form k of f with respect to either of the two choices of continuous unit normal vector field along f. The triple (M, g, k) is an initial data set. According to the Gauss-Codazzi equations, one has G¯(ν,ν)=12(Rg−|k|g2+(trg⁡k)2)G¯(ν,⋅)=d(trg⁡k)−divg⁡k.G(ν,ν) =1/2(R^g-|k|_g^2+(tr^gk)^2) G(ν,·) =d(tr^gk)-div^gk. where G denotes the Einstein tensor Ricg - 1/2Rgg of g and ν denotes the continuous unit normal vector field along f used to define k. So the dominant energy condition as given above is, in this Lorentzian context, identical to the assertion that G(ν, ⋅), when viewed as a vector field along f, is timelike or null and is oriented in the same direction as ν.[3] The ends of asymptotically flat initial data
