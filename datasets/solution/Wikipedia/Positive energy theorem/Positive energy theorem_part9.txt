remarks: According to the above statements, Witten's conclusion is stronger than Schoen and Yau's. However, a third paper by Schoen and Yau[4] shows that their 1981 result implies Witten's, retaining only the extra assumption that |x|4RΦi∗g|x|^4R^Φ_i^∗g and |x|5∂pRΦi∗g|x|^5∂_pR^Φ_i^∗g are bounded for any p.. It also must be noted that Schoen and Yau's 1981 result relies on their 1979 result, which is proved by contradiction; therefore their extension of their 1981 result is also by contradiction. By contrast, Witten's proof is logically direct, exhibiting the ADM energy directly as a nonnegative quantity. Furthermore, Witten's proof in the case trg⁡k=0tr_gk=0 can be extended without much effort to higher-dimensional manifolds, under the topological condition that the manifold admits a spin structure.[5] Schoen and Yau's 1979 result and proof can be extended to the case of any dimension less than eight.[6] More recently, Witten's result, using Schoen and Yau (1981)'s methods, has been extended to the same context.[7] In summary: following Schoen and Yau's methods, the positive energy theorem has been proven in dimension less than eight, while following Witten, it has been proven in any dimension but with a restriction to the setting of spin manifolds. As of April 2017, Schoen and Yau have released a preprint which proves the general higher-dimensional case in the special case trg⁡k=0,tr_gk=0, without any restriction on dimension or topology. However, it has not yet (as of May 2020) appeared in an academic journal.
