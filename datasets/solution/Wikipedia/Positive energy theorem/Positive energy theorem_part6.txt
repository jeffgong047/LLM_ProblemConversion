(1979): Let (M, g, 0) be a time-symmetric initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. Suppose that (M, g) is an oriented three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold-with-boundary, and that each boundary component has positive mean curvature. Suppose that it has one end, and it is asymptotically Schwarzschild in the following sense: Suppose that K is an open precompact subset of M such that there is a diffeomorphism Φ : ℝ3 − B1(0) → M − K, and suppose that there is a number m such that the symmetric 2-tensor hij=(Φ∗g)ij−δij−m2|x|δij_ij=(Φ^∗g)_ij-δ_ij-m/2|x|δ_ij on ℝ3 − B1(0) is such that for any i, j, p, q, the functions |x|2hij(x),|x|^2h_ij(x), |x|3∂phij(x),|x|^3∂_ph_ij(x), and |x|4∂p∂qhij(x)|x|^4∂_p∂_qh_ij(x) are all bounded. Schoen and Yau's theorem asserts that m must be nonnegative. If, in addition, the functions |x|5∂p∂q∂rhij(x),|x|^5∂_p∂_q∂_rh_ij(x), |x|5∂p∂q∂r∂shij(x),|x|^5∂_p∂_q∂_r∂_sh_ij(x), and |x|5∂p∂q∂r∂s∂thij(x)|x|^5∂_p∂_q∂_r∂_s∂_th_ij(x) are bounded for any i,j,p,q,r,s,t,,j,p,q,r,s,t, then m must be positive unless the boundary of M is empty and (M, g) is isometric to ℝ3 with its standard Riemannian metric. Note that the conditions on h are asserting that h, together with some of its derivatives, are small when x is large. Since h is measuring the defect between g in the coordinates Φ and the standard representation of the t = constant slice of the Schwarzschild metric, these conditions are a quantification of the term "asymptotically Schwarzschild". This can be interpreted in a purely mathematical sense as a strong form of "asymptotically flat", where the coefficient of the |x|−1 part of the expansion of the metric is declared to be a constant multiple of the Euclidean metric, as opposed to a general symmetric 2-tensor. Note also that Schoen and Yau's theorem, as stated above, is actually (despite appearances) a strong form of the "multiple ends" case. If (M, g) is a complete Riemannian manifold with multiple ends, then the above result applies to any single end, provided that there is a positive mean curvature sphere in every other end. This is guaranteed, for instance, if each end is asymptotically flat in the above sense; one can choose a large coordinate sphere as a boundary, and remove the corresponding remainder of each end until one has a Riemannian manifold-with-boundary with a single end.
