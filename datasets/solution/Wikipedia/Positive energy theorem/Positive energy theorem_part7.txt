(1981): Let (M, g, k) be an initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. Suppose that (M, g) is an oriented three-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold (without boundary); suppose that it has finitely many ends, each of which is asymptotically flat in the following sense. Suppose that K⊂M is an open precompact subset such that M∖K has finitely many connected components M1,…,Mn,_1,…,M_n, and for each i=1,…,n=1,…,n there is a diffeomorphism Φi:R3∖B1(0)→MiΦ_i:ℝ^3_1(0)_i such that the symmetric 2-tensor hij=(Φ∗g)ij−δij_ij=(Φ^∗g)_ij-δ_ij satisfies the following conditions: |x|hij(x),|x|h_ij(x), |x|2∂phij(x),|x|^2∂_ph_ij(x), and |x|3∂p∂qhij(x)|x|^3∂_p∂_qh_ij(x) are bounded for all i,j,p,q.,j,p,q. Also suppose that |x|4RΦi∗g|x|^4R^Φ_i^∗g and |x|5∂pRΦi∗g|x|^5∂_pR^Φ_i^∗g are bounded for any p |x|2(Φi∗k)ij(x),|x|^2(Φ_i^∗k)_ij(x), |x|3∂p(Φi∗k)ij(x),|x|^3∂_p(Φ_i^∗k)_ij(x), and |x|4∂p∂q(Φi∗k)ij(x)|x|^4∂_p∂_q(Φ_i^∗k)_ij(x) for any p,q,i,j,q,i,j |x|3((Φi∗k)11(x)+(Φ∗k)22(x)+(Φi∗k)33(x))|x|^3((Φ_i^∗k)_11(x)+(Φ^∗k)_22(x)+(Φ_i^∗k)_33(x)) is bounded. The conclusion is that the ADM energy of each M1,…,Mn,_1,…,M_n, defined as E(Mi)=116πlimr→∞∫|x|=r∑p=13∑q=13(∂q(Φi∗g)pq−∂p(Φi∗g)qq)xp|x|dH2(x),E(M_i)=1/16πlim_r→∞∫_|x|=r∑_p=1^3∑_q=1^3(∂_q(Φ_i^∗g)_pq-∂_p(Φ_i^∗g)_qq)x^p/|x| dℋ^2(x), is nonnegative. Furthermore, supposing in addition that |x|4∂p∂q∂rhij(x)|x|^4∂_p∂_q∂_rh_ij(x) and |x|4∂p∂r∂s∂thij(x)|x|^4∂_p∂_r∂_s∂_th_ij(x) are bounded for any i,j,p,q,r,s,,j,p,q,r,s, the assumption that E(Mi)=0E(M_i)=0 for some i∈1,…,n∈{1,…,n} implies that n = 1, that M is diffeomorphic to ℝ3, and that Minkowski space ℝ3,1 is a development of the initial data set (M, g, k).
