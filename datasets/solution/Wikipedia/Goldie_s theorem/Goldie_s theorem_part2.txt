proof: This is a sketch of the characterization mentioned in the introduction. It may be found in (Lam 1999, p.324). If R be a semiprime right Goldie ring, then it is a right order in a semisimple ring: Essential right ideals of R are exactly those containing a regular element. There are no non-zero nil ideals in R. R is a right nonsingular ring.[1] From the previous observations, R is a right Ore ring, and so its right classical ring of quotients Qr exists. Also from the previous observations, Qr is a semisimple ring. Thus R is a right order in Qr. If R is a right order in a semisimple ring Q, then it is semiprime right Goldie: Any right order in a Noetherian ring (such as Q) is right Goldie. Any right order in a Noetherian semiprime ring (such as Q) is itself semiprime. Thus, R is semiprime right Goldie.
