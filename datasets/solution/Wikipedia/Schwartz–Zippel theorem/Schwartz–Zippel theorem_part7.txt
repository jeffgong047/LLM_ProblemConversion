matching: Let G=(V,E)=(V,E) be a graph of n vertices where n is even. Does G contain a perfect matching? Theorem 2 (Tutte 1947): A Tutte matrix determinant is not a 0-polynomial if and only if there exists a perfect matching. A subset D of E is called a matching if each vertex in V is incident with at most one edge in D. A matching is perfect if each vertex in V has exactly one edge that is incident to it in D. Create a Tutte matrix A in the following way: A=[a11a12⋯a1na21a22⋯a2n⋮⋮⋱⋮an1an2…ann]=[ a_11 a_12 ⋯ a_1𝑛; a_21 a_22 ⋯ a_2𝑛; ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮; a_𝑛1 a_𝑛2 … a_𝑛𝑛 ] where aij=xijif(i,j)∈Eandi<j−xjiif(i,j)∈Eandi>j0otherwise._ij=x_ij (i,j)i<j -x_ji (i,j)i>j 0 . The Tutte matrix determinant (in the variables xij, i<j<j ) is then defined as the determinant of this skew-symmetric matrix which coincides with the square of the pfaffian of the matrix A and is non-zero (as polynomial) if and only if a perfect matching exists. One can then use polynomial identity testing to find whether G contains a perfect matching. There exists a deterministic black-box algorithm for graphs with polynomially bounded permanents (Grigoriev & Karpinski 1987).[5] In the special case of a balanced bipartite graph on n=m+m=m+m vertices this matrix takes the form of a block matrix A=(0X−Xt0)=[ 0 X; -X^t 0 ] if the first m rows (resp. columns) are indexed with the first subset of the bipartition and the last m rows with the complementary subset. In this case the pfaffian coincides with the usual determinant of the m × m matrix X (up to sign). Here X is the Edmonds matrix. Determinant of a matrix with polynomial
