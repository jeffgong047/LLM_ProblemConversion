Tool used in probabilistic polynomial identity testing In mathematics, the Schwartz–Zippel lemma (also called the DeMillo–Lipton–Schwartz–Zippel lemma) is a tool commonly used in probabilistic polynomial identity testing, i.e. in the problem of determining whether a given multivariate polynomial is the 0-polynomial[clarification needed] (or identically equal to 0). It was discovered independently by Jack Schwartz,[1] Richard Zippel,[2] and Richard DeMillo and Richard J. Lipton, although DeMillo and Lipton's version was shown a year prior to Schwartz and Zippel's result.[3] The finite field version of this bound was proved by Øystein Ore in 1922.[4] Statement and proof of the
