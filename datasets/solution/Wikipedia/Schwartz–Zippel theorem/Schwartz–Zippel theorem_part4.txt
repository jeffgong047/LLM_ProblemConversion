testing: For example, is (x1+3x2−x3)(3x1+x4−1)⋯(x7−x2)≡0?(x_1+3x_2-x_3)(3x_1+x_4-1)⋯(x_7-x_2)≡0 To solve this, we can multiply it out and check that all the coefficients are 0. However, this takes exponential time. In general, a polynomial can be algebraically represented by an arithmetic formula or circuit. Comparison of two
