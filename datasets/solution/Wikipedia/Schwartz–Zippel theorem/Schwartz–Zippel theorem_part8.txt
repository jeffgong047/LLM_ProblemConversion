entries: Let p(x1,x2,…,xn)(x_1,x_2,…,x_n) be the determinant of the polynomial matrix. Currently, there is no known sub-exponential time algorithm that can solve this problem deterministically. However, there are randomized polynomial algorithms whose analysis requires a bound on the probability that a non-zero polynomial will have roots at randomly selected test points.
