structure: Because H2 = −I ("I" is the identity operator) on the real Banach space of real-valued functions in Lp(R)^p(ℝ), the Hilbert transform defines a linear complex structure on this Banach space. In particular, when p = 2, the Hilbert transform gives the Hilbert space of real-valued functions in L2(R)^2(ℝ) the structure of a complex Hilbert space. The (complex) eigenstates of the Hilbert transform admit representations as holomorphic functions in the upper and lower half-planes in the Hardy space H2 by the Paley–Wiener theorem.
