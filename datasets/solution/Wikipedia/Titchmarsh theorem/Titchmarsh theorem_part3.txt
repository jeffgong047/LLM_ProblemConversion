Notation: In signal processing the Hilbert transform of u(t) is commonly denoted by u^(t)û(t).[3] However, in mathematics, this notation is already extensively used to denote the Fourier transform of u(t).[4] Occasionally, the Hilbert transform may be denoted by u (t)ũ(t). Furthermore, many sources define the Hilbert transform as the negative of the one defined here.[5]
