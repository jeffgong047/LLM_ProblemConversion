modulation: The form:[43] u(t)=A⋅cos⁡(ωt+ϕm(t))(t)=A·cos(+ϕ_m(t)) is called angle modulation, which includes both phase modulation and frequency modulation. The instantaneous frequency is ω+ϕm′(t).ω+ϕ_m^'(t). For sufficiently large ω, compared to ϕm′ϕ_m^': H⁡(u)(t)≈A⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕm(t))H(u)(t)·sin(+ϕ_m(t)) and: ua(t)≈A⋅ei(ωt+ϕm(t))._a(t)^i(+ϕ_m(t)).
