functions: The Hilbert transform can be understood in terms of a pair of functions f(x) and g(x) such that the function F(x)=f(x)+ig(x)(x)=f(x)+i g(x) is the boundary value of a holomorphic function F(z) in the upper half-plane.[32] Under these circumstances, if f and g are sufficiently integrable, then one is the Hilbert transform of the other. Suppose that f∈Lp(R).^p(ℝ). Then, by the theory of the Poisson integral, f admits a unique harmonic extension into the upper half-plane, and this extension is given by u(x+iy)=u(x,y)=1π∫−∞∞f(s)y(x−s)2+y2ds(x+iy)=u(x,y)=1/π∫_-∞^∞f(s) y/(x-s)^2+y^2 ds which is the convolution of f with the Poisson kernel P(x,y)=yπ(x2+y2)(x,y)=y/π (x^2+y^2) Furthermore, there is a unique harmonic function v defined in the upper half-plane such that F(z) = u(z) + i v(z) is holomorphic and limy→∞v(x+iy)=0lim_y→∞v (x+i y)=0 This harmonic function is obtained from f by taking a convolution with the conjugate Poisson kernel Q(x,y)=xπ(x2+y2).(x,y)=x/π (x^2+y^2). Thus v(x,y)=1π∫−∞∞f(s)x−s(x−s)2+y2ds.(x,y)=1/π∫_-∞^∞f(s) x-s/ (x-s)^2+y^2 ds. Indeed, the real and imaginary parts of the Cauchy kernel are iπz=P(x,y)+iQ(x,y)i/π z=P(x,y)+i Q(x,y) so that F = u + i v is holomorphic by Cauchy's integral formula. The function v obtained from u in this way is called the harmonic conjugate of u. The (non-tangential) boundary limit of v(x,y) as y → 0 is the Hilbert transform of f. Thus, succinctly, H⁡(f)=limy→0Q(−,y)⋆fH(f)=lim_y→0Q(-,y) Titchmarsh's
