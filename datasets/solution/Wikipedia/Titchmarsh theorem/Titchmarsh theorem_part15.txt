Invariance: The Hilbert transform has the following invariance properties on L2(R)^2(ℝ). It commutes with translations. That is, it commutes with the operators Ta f(x) = f(x + a) for all a in R.ℝ. It commutes with positive dilations. That is it commutes with the operators Mλ f (x) = f (λ x) for all λ > 0. It anticommutes with the reflection R f (x) = f (−x). Up to a multiplicative constant, the Hilbert transform is the only bounded operator on L2 with these properties.[27] In fact there is a wider set of operators that commute with the Hilbert transform. The group SL(2,R)SL(2,ℝ) acts by unitary operators Ug on the space L2(R)^2(ℝ) by the formula Ug−1⁡f(x)=1cx+df(ax+bcx+d),g=[abcd],forad−bc=±1.U_g^-1f(x)=1/cx+d f(ax+b/cx+d) ,=[ a b; c d ] , for ad-bc=±1. This unitary representation is an example of a principal series representation of SL(2,R). SL(2,ℝ) . In this case it is reducible, splitting as the orthogonal sum of two invariant subspaces, Hardy space H2(R)^2(ℝ) and its conjugate. These are the spaces of L2 boundary values of holomorphic functions on the upper and lower halfplanes. H2(R)^2(ℝ) and its conjugate consist of exactly those L2 functions with Fourier transforms vanishing on the negative and positive parts of the real axis respectively. Since the Hilbert transform is equal to H = −i (2P − I), with P being the orthogonal projection from L2(R)^2(ℝ) onto H2⁡(R),H^2(ℝ), and I the identity operator, it follows that H2⁡(R)H^2(ℝ) and its orthogonal complement are eigenspaces of H for the eigenvalues ±i. In other words, H commutes with the operators Ug. The restrictions of the operators Ug to H2⁡(R)H^2(ℝ) and its conjugate give irreducible representations of SL(2,R)SL(2,ℝ) – the so-called limit of discrete series representations.[28] Extending the domain of
