theorem: Titchmarsh's theorem (named for E. C. Titchmarsh who included it in his 1937 work) makes precise the relationship between the boundary values of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane and the Hilbert transform.[33] It gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function F(x) on the real line to be the boundary value of a function in the Hardy space H2(U) of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane U. The theorem states that the following conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function F:R→C:ℝ→ℂ are equivalent: F(x) is the limit as z → x of a holomorphic function F(z) in the upper half-plane such that ∫−∞∞|F(x+iy)|2dx<K∫_-∞^∞|F(x+i y)|^2 dx<K The real and imaginary parts of F(x) are Hilbert transforms of each other. The Fourier transform F(F)(x)ℱ(F)(x) vanishes for x < 0. A weaker result is true for functions of class Lp for p > 1.[34] Specifically, if F(z) is a holomorphic function such that ∫−∞∞|F(x+iy)|pdx<K∫_-∞^∞|F(x+i y)|^p dx<K for all y, then there is a complex-valued function F(x) in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) such that F(x + i y) → F(x) in the Lp norm as y → 0 (as well as holding pointwise almost everywhere). Furthermore, F(x)=f(x)−ig(x)(x)=f(x)-i g(x) where f is a real-valued function in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) and g is the Hilbert transform (of class Lp) of f. This is not true in the case p = 1. In fact, the Hilbert transform of an L1 function f need not converge in the mean to another L1 function. Nevertheless,[35] the Hilbert transform of f does converge almost everywhere to a finite function g such that ∫−∞∞|g(x)|p1+x2dx<∞∫_-∞^∞|g(x)|^p/1+x^2 dx<∞ This result is directly analogous to one by Andrey Kolmogorov for Hardy functions in the disc.[36] Although usually called Titchmarsh's theorem, the result aggregates much work of others, including Hardy, Paley and Wiener (see Paley–Wiener theorem), as well as work by Riesz, Hille, and Tamarkin[37] Riemann–Hilbert
