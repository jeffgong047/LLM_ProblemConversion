transform: The Hilbert transform is a multiplier operator.[14] The multiplier of H is σH(ω) = −i sgn(ω), where sgn is the signum function. Therefore: F(H⁡(u))(ω)=−isgn⁡(ω)⋅F(u)(ω),ℱ(H(u))(ω)=-isgn(ω)·ℱ(u)(ω), where Fℱ denotes the Fourier transform. Since sgn(x) = sgn(2πx), it follows that this result applies to the three common definitions of Fℱ. By Euler's formula, σH(ω)=i=e+iπ2,forω<0,0,forω=0,−i=e−iπ2,forω>0.σ_H(ω)= i=e^+iπ/2, forω<0, 0, forω=0, -i=e^-iπ/2, forω>0. Therefore, H(u)(t) has the effect of shifting the phase of the negative frequency components of u(t) by +90° (π⁄2 radians) and the phase of the positive frequency components by −90°, and i·H(u)(t) has the effect of restoring the positive frequency components while shifting the negative frequency ones an additional +90°, resulting in their negation (i.e., a multiplication by −1). When the Hilbert transform is applied twice, the phase of the negative and positive frequency components of u(t) are respectively shifted by +180° and −180°, which are equivalent amounts. The signal is negated; i.e., H(H(u)) = −u, because (σH(ω))2=e±iπ=−1forω≠0.(σ_H(ω))^2=e^π=-1 forω≠0. Table of selected Hilbert
