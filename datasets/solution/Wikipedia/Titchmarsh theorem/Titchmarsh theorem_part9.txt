Boundedness: If 1 < p < ∞, then the Hilbert transform on Lp(R)^p(ℝ) is a bounded linear operator, meaning that there exists a constant Cp such that ‖H⁡u‖p≤Cp‖u‖pHu_p_pu_p for all u∈Lp(R)^p(ℝ).[19] The best constant Cp_p is given by[20] Cp=tan⁡π2pfor1<p≤2cot⁡π2pfor2<p<∞_p=tanπ/2p for 1<p≤2 π/2p for 2<p<∞ An easy way to find the best Cp_p for p being a power of 2 is through the so-called Cotlar's identity that (H⁡f)2=f2+2H⁡(fH⁡f)(Hf)^2=f^2+2H(fHf) for all real valued f. The same best constants hold for the periodic Hilbert transform. The boundedness of the Hilbert transform implies the Lp(R)^p(ℝ) convergence of the symmetric partial sum operator SRf=∫−RRf^(ξ)e2πixξdξ_Rf=∫_-R^Rf̂(ξ)e^2ξ dξ to f in Lp(R)^p(ℝ).[21] Anti-self
