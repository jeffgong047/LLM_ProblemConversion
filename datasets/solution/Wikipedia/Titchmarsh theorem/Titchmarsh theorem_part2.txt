Definition: The Hilbert transform of u can be thought of as the convolution of u(t) with the function h(t) = 1/πt, known as the Cauchy kernel. Because 1/t is not integrable across t = 0, the integral defining the convolution does not always converge. Instead, the Hilbert transform is defined using the Cauchy principal value (denoted here by p.v.). Explicitly, the Hilbert transform of a function (or signal) u(t) is given by H⁡(u)(t)=1πp.v.⁡∫−∞+∞u(τ)t−τdτ,H(u)(t)=1/π p.v.∫_-∞^+∞u(τ)/t-τ dτ, provided this integral exists as a principal value. This is precisely the convolution of u with the tempered distribution p.v. 1/πt.[1] Alternatively, by changing variables, the principal-value integral can be written explicitly[2] as H⁡(u)(t)=2πlimε→0∫ε∞u(t−τ)−u(t+τ)2τdτ.H(u)(t)=2/π lim_ε→0∫_ε^∞u(t-τ)-u(t+τ)/2τ dτ. When the Hilbert transform is applied twice in succession to a function u, the result is H⁡(H⁡(u))(t)=−u(t),H(H(u))(t)=-u(t), provided the integrals defining both iterations converge in a suitable sense. In particular, the inverse transform is H3H^3. This fact can most easily be seen by considering the effect of the Hilbert transform on the Fourier transform of u(t) (see § Relationship with the Fourier transform below). For an analytic function in the upper half-plane, the Hilbert transform describes the relationship between the real part and the imaginary part of the boundary values. That is, if f(z) is analytic in the upper half complex plane {z : Im{z} > 0}, and u(t) = Re{f (t + 0·i)}, then Im{f(t + 0·i)} = H(u)(t) up to an additive constant, provided this Hilbert transform exists.
