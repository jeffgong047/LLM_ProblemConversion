definition: It is by no means obvious that the Hilbert transform is well-defined at all, as the improper integral defining it must converge in a suitable sense. However, the Hilbert transform is well-defined for a broad class of functions, namely those in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) for 1 < p < ∞. More precisely, if u is in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) for 1 < p < ∞, then the limit defining the improper integral H⁡(u)(t)=2πlimε→0∫ε∞u(t−τ)−u(t+τ)2τdτH(u)(t)=2/πlim_ε→0∫_ε^∞u(t-τ)-u(t+τ)/2τ dτ exists for almost every t. The limit function is also in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) and is in fact the limit in the mean of the improper integral as well. That is, 2π∫ε∞u(t−τ)−u(t+τ)2τdτ→H⁡(u)(t)2/π∫_ε^∞u(t-τ)-u(t+τ)/2τ dτ→H(u)(t) as ε → 0 in the Lp norm, as well as pointwise almost everywhere, by the Titchmarsh theorem.[16] In the case p = 1, the Hilbert transform still converges pointwise almost everywhere, but may itself fail to be integrable, even locally.[17] In particular, convergence in the mean does not in general happen in this case. The Hilbert transform of an L1 function does converge, however, in L1-weak, and the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator from L1 to L1,w.[18] (In particular, since the Hilbert transform is also a multiplier operator on L2, Marcinkiewicz interpolation and a duality argument furnishes an alternative proof that H is bounded on Lp.)
