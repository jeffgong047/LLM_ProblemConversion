distributions: It is further possible to extend the Hilbert transform to certain spaces of distributions (Pandey 1996, Chapter 3). Since the Hilbert transform commutes with differentiation, and is a bounded operator on Lp, H restricts to give a continuous transform on the inverse limit of Sobolev spaces: DLp=lim⟵n→∞Wn,p(R)𝒟_L^p=n→∞⟵limW^n,p(ℝ) The Hilbert transform can then be defined on the dual space of DLp𝒟_L^p, denoted DLp′𝒟_L^p', consisting of Lp distributions. This is accomplished by the duality pairing: For u∈DLp′∈𝒟'_L^p, define: H⁡(u)∈DLp′=⟨H⁡u,v⟩≜⟨u,−H⁡v⟩,forallv∈DLp.H(u)∈𝒟'_L^p=⟨Hu,v⟩ triangleq langleu,-Hv⟩,{forall∈̌𝒟_L^p. It is possible to define the Hilbert transform on the space of tempered distributions as well by an approach due to Gel'fand and Shilov,[29] but considerably more care is needed because of the singularity in the integral.
