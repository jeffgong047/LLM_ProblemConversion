Causality: The function h(t)=1/(πt)(t)=1/() presents two causality-based challenges to practical implementation in a convolution (in addition to its undefined value at 0): Its duration is infinite (technically infinite support). Finite-length windowing reduces the effective frequency range of the transform; shorter windows result in greater losses at low and high frequencies. See also quadrature filter. It is a non-causal filter. So a delayed version, h(t−τ),(t-τ), is required. The corresponding output is subsequently delayed by τ.τ. When creating the imaginary part of an analytic signal, the source (real part) must also be delayed by ττ. Discrete Hilbert
