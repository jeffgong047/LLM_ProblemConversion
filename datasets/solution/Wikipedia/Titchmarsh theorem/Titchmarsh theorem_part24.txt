theorem: Bedrosian's theorem states that the Hilbert transform of the product of a low-pass and a high-pass signal with non-overlapping spectra is given by the product of the low-pass signal and the Hilbert transform of the high-pass signal, or H⁡(fLP(t)⋅fHP(t))=fLP(t)⋅H⁡(fHP(t)),H(f_LP(t)_HP(t))=f_LP(t)·H(f_HP(t)), where fLP and fHP are the low- and high-pass signals respectively.[40] A category of communication signals to which this applies is called the narrowband signal model. A member of that category is amplitude modulation of a high-frequency sinusoidal "carrier": u(t)=um(t)⋅cos⁡(ωt+ϕ),(t)=u_m(t)·cos(+ϕ), where um(t) is the narrow bandwidth "message" waveform, such as voice or music. Then by Bedrosian's theorem:[41] H⁡(u)(t)=um(t)⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕ),ω>0−um(t)⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕ),ω<0.H(u)(t)=[ u_m(t)·sin(+ϕ), ω>0; -u_m(t)·sin(+ϕ), ω<0 ]. Analytic
