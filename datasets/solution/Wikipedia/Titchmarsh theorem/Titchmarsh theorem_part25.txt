representation: Main article: analytic signal A specific type of conjugate function is: ua(t)≜u(t)+i⋅H(u)(t),_a(t)(t)+i(u)(t), known as the analytic representation of u(t).(t). The name reflects its mathematical tractability, due largely to Euler's formula. Applying Bedrosian's theorem to the narrowband model, the analytic representation is:[42] ua(t)=um(t)⋅cos⁡(ωt+ϕ)+i⋅um(t)⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕ),ω>0=um(t)⋅[cos⁡(ωt+ϕ)+i⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕ)],ω>0=um(t)⋅ei(ωt+ϕ),ω>0.u_a(t) =u_m(t)·cos(+ϕ)+i_m(t)·sin(+ϕ), ω>0 =u_m(t)·[cos(+ϕ)+i·sin(+ϕ)], ω>0 =u_m(t)^i(+ϕ), ω>0. (Eq.1) A Fourier transform property indicates that this complex heterodyne operation can shift all the negative frequency components of um(t) above 0 Hz. In that case, the imaginary part of the result is a Hilbert transform of the real part. This is an indirect way to produce Hilbert transforms. Angle (phase/frequency)
