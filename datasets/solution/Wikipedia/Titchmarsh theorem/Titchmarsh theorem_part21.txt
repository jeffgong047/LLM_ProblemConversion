problem: One form of the Riemann–Hilbert problem seeks to identify pairs of functions F+ and F− such that F+ is holomorphic on the upper half-plane and F− is holomorphic on the lower half-plane, such that for x along the real axis, F+(x)−F−(x)=f(x)_+(x)-F_-(x)=f(x) where f(x) is some given real-valued function of x∈R∈ℝ. The left-hand side of this equation may be understood either as the difference of the limits of F± from the appropriate half-planes, or as a hyperfunction distribution. Two functions of this form are a solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem. Formally, if F± solve the Riemann–Hilbert problem f(x)=F+(x)−F−(x)(x)=F_+(x)-F_-(x) then the Hilbert transform of f(x) is given by[38] H(f)(x)=−i(F+(x)+F−(x)).(f)(x)=-i(F_+(x)+F_-(x)).
