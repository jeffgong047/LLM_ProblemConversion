(SSB): Main article: Single-sideband modulation When um(t) in Eq.1 is also an analytic representation (of a message waveform), that is: um(t)=m(t)+i⋅m^(t)_m(t)=m(t)+i·m(t) the result is single-sideband modulation: ua(t)=(m(t)+i⋅m^(t))⋅ei(ωt+ϕ)_a(t)=(m(t)+i·m(t))^i(+ϕ) whose transmitted component is:[44][45] u(t)=Re⁡ua(t)=m(t)⋅cos⁡(ωt+ϕ)−m^(t)⋅sin⁡(ωt+ϕ)u(t) =Re{u_a(t)} =m(t)·cos(+ϕ)-m(t)·sin(+ϕ)
