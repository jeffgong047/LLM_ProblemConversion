functions: The Hilbert transform can be defined for functions in L∞(R)^∞(ℝ) as well, but it requires some modifications and caveats. Properly understood, the Hilbert transform maps L∞(R)^∞(ℝ) to the Banach space of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) classes. Interpreted naïvely, the Hilbert transform of a bounded function is clearly ill-defined. For instance, with u = sgn(x), the integral defining H(u) diverges almost everywhere to ±∞. To alleviate such difficulties, the Hilbert transform of an L∞ function is therefore defined by the following regularized form of the integral H⁡(u)(t)=p.v.⁡∫−∞∞u(τ)h(t−τ)−h0(−τ)dτH(u)(t)=p.v.∫_-∞^∞u(τ){h(t-τ)-h_0(-τ)} dτ where as above h(x) = 1/πx and h0(x)=0for|x|<11πxfor|x|≥1_0(x)=0 for |x|<1 1/π x for |x|≥1 The modified transform H agrees with the original transform up to an additive constant on functions of compact support from a general result by Calderón and Zygmund.[30] Furthermore, the resulting integral converges pointwise almost everywhere, and with respect to the BMO norm, to a function of bounded mean oscillation. A deep result of Fefferman's work[31] is that a function is of bounded mean oscillation if and only if it has the form f + H(g) for some f,g∈L∞(R),g^∞(ℝ). Conjugate
