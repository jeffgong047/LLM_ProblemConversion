Differentiation: Formally, the derivative of the Hilbert transform is the Hilbert transform of the derivative, i.e. these two linear operators commute: H⁡(dudt)=ddtH⁡(u)H(du/dt)=d/dtH(u) Iterating this identity, H⁡(dkudtk)=dkdtkH⁡(u)H(d^ku/dt^k)=d^k/dt^kH(u) This is rigorously true as stated provided u and its first k derivatives belong to Lp(R)^p(ℝ).[24] One can check this easily in the frequency domain, where differentiation becomes multiplication by ω.
