Convolutions: The Hilbert transform can formally be realized as a convolution with the tempered distribution[25] h(t)=p.v.⁡1πt(t)=p.v.1/π t Thus formally, H⁡(u)=h∗uH(u)=h*u However, a priori this may only be defined for u a distribution of compact support. It is possible to work somewhat rigorously with this since compactly supported functions (which are distributions a fortiori) are dense in Lp. Alternatively, one may use the fact that h(t) is the distributional derivative of the function log|t|/π; to wit H⁡(u)(t)=ddt(1π(u∗log⁡|⋅|)(t))H(u)(t)=d/dt(1/π(u*log|·|)(t)) For most operational purposes the Hilbert transform can be treated as a convolution. For example, in a formal sense, the Hilbert transform of a convolution is the convolution of the Hilbert transform applied on only one of either of the factors: H⁡(u∗v)=H⁡(u)∗v=u∗H⁡(v)H(u*v)=H(u)*v=u*H(v) This is rigorously true if u and v are compactly supported distributions since, in that case, h∗(u∗v)=(h∗u)∗v=u∗(h∗v)*(u*v)=(h*u)*v=u*(h*v) By passing to an appropriate limit, it is thus also true if u ∈ Lp and v ∈ Lq provided that 1<1p+1q1<1/p+1/q from a theorem due to Titchmarsh.[26]
