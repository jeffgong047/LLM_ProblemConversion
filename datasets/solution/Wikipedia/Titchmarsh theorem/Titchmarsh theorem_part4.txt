History: The Hilbert transform arose in Hilbert's 1905 work on a problem Riemann posed concerning analytic functions,[6][7] which has come to be known as the Riemann–Hilbert problem. Hilbert's work was mainly concerned with the Hilbert transform for functions defined on the circle.[8][9] Some of his earlier work related to the Discrete Hilbert Transform dates back to lectures he gave in Göttingen. The results were later published by Hermann Weyl in his dissertation.[10] Schur improved Hilbert's results about the discrete Hilbert transform and extended them to the integral case.[11] These results were restricted to the spaces L2 and ℓ2. In 1928, Marcel Riesz proved that the Hilbert transform can be defined for u in Lp(R)^p(ℝ) (Lp space) for 1 < p < ∞, that the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator on Lp(R)^p(ℝ) for 1 < p < ∞, and that similar results hold for the Hilbert transform on the circle as well as the discrete Hilbert transform.[12] The Hilbert transform was a motivating example for Antoni Zygmund and Alberto Calderón during their study of singular integrals.[13] Their investigations have played a fundamental role in modern harmonic analysis. Various generalizations of the Hilbert transform, such as the bilinear and trilinear Hilbert transforms are still active areas of research today. Relationship with the Fourier
