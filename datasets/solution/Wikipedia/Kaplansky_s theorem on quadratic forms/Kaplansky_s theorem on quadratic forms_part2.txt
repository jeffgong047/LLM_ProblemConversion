theorem: Kaplansky's theorem states that a prime p congruent to 1 modulo 16 is representable by both or none of x2 + 32y2 and x2 + 64y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9 modulo 16 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. This is remarkable since the primes represented by each of these forms individually are not describable by congruence conditions.[2]
