results: Five results similar to Kaplansky's theorem are known:[3] A prime p congruent to 1 modulo 20 is representable by both or none of x2 + 20y2 and x2 + 100y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9 modulo 20 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. A prime p congruent to 1, 16 or 22 modulo 39 is representable by both or none of x2 + xy + 10y2 and x2 + xy + 127y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 4, 10 or 25 modulo 39 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. A prime p congruent to 1, 16, 26, 31 or 36 modulo 55 is representable by both or none of x2 + xy + 14y2 and x2 + xy + 69y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 4, 9, 14, 34 or 49 modulo 55 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. A prime p congruent to 1, 65 or 81 modulo 112 is representable by both or none of x2 + 14y2 and x2 + 448y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9, 25 or 57 modulo 112 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. A prime p congruent to 1 or 169 modulo 240 is representable by both or none of x2 + 150y2 and x2 + 960y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 49 or 121 modulo 240 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. It is conjectured that there are no other similar results involving definite forms.
