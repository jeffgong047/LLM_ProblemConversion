variables: The mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem. Let G be an open subset of Rnℝ^n, and let f:G→R:G→ℝ be a differentiable function. Fix points x,y∈G,y such that the line segment between x,y,y lies in G, and define g(t)=f((1−t)x+ty)(t)=f((1-t)x+ty). Since g is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives: g(1)−g(0)=g′(c)(1)-g(0)=g'(c) for some c between 0 and 1. But since g(1)=f(y)(1)=f(y) and g(0)=f(x)(0)=f(x), computing g′(c)'(c) explicitly we have: f(y)−f(x)=∇f((1−c)x+cy)⋅(y−x)(y)-f(x)=((1-c)x+cy)·(y-x) where ∇∇ denotes a gradient and ⋅· a dot product. This is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case n=1=1 this is the theorem in one variable). By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the equation gives the estimate: |f(y)−f(x)|≤|∇f((1−c)x+cy)||y−x|.|f(y)-f(x)|≤|((1-c)x+cy)|{|y-x|. In particular, when the partial derivatives of f are bounded, f is Lipschitz continuous (and therefore uniformly continuous). As an application of the above, we prove that f is constant if the open subset G is connected and every partial derivative of f is 0. Pick some point x0∈G_0, and let g(x)=f(x)−f(x0)(x)=f(x)-f(x_0). We want to show g(x)=0(x)=0 for every x∈G. For that, let E=x∈G:g(x)=0={x:g(x)=0}. Then E is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every x∈E , |g(y)|=|g(y)−g(x)|≤(0)|y−x|=0|g(y)|=|g(y)-g(x)|≤(0)|y-x|=0 for every y in some neighborhood of x. (Here, it is crucial that x and y are sufficiently close to each other.) Since G is connected, we conclude E=G=G. The above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when G is a subset of a Banach space. Mean value theorem for vector-valued
