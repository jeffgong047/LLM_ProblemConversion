integrals: There are various slightly different theorems called the second mean value theorem for definite integrals. A commonly found version is as follows: If G : [a, b] → R is a positive monotonically decreasing function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b] such that ∫abG(t)φ(t)dt=G(a+)∫axφ(t)dt.∫_a^bG(t)φ(t) dt=G(a^+)∫_a^xφ(t) dt. Here G(a+)(a^+) stands for limx→a+G(x)lim_x^+G(x), the existence of which follows from the conditions. Note that it is essential that the interval (a, b] contains b. A variant not having this requirement is:[15] If G : [a, b] → R is a monotonic (not necessarily decreasing and positive) function and φ : [a, b] → R is an integrable function, then there exists a number x in (a, b) such that ∫abG(t)φ(t)dt=G(a+)∫axφ(t)dt+G(b−)∫xbφ(t)dt.∫_a^bG(t)φ(t) dt=G(a^+)∫_a^xφ(t) dt+G(b^-)∫_x^bφ(t) dt.
