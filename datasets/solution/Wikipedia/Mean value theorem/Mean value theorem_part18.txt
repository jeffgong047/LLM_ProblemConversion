functions: If the function G returns a multi-dimensional vector, then the MVT for integration is not true, even if the domain of G is also multi-dimensional. For example, consider the following 2-dimensional function defined on an n-dimensional cube: G:[0,2π]n→R2G(x1,…,xn)=(sin⁡(x1+⋯+xn),cos⁡(x1+⋯+xn))G:[0,2π]^n→ℝ^2 G(x_1,…,x_n)=(sin(x_1+⋯+x_n),cos(x_1+⋯+x_n)) Then, by symmetry it is easy to see that the mean value of G over its domain is (0,0): ∫[0,2π]nG(x1,…,xn)dx1⋯dxn=(0,0)∫_[0,2π]^nG(x_1,…,x_n)dx_1_n=(0,0) However, there is no point in which G=(0,0)=(0,0), because |G|=1|G|=1 everywhere.
