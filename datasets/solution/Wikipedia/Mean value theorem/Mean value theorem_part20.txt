variables: As noted above, the theorem does not hold for differentiable complex-valued functions. Instead, a generalization of the theorem is stated such:[17] Let f : Ω → C be a holomorphic function on the open convex set Ω, and let a and b be distinct points in Ω. Then there exist points u, v on the interior of the line segment from a to b such that Re⁡(f′(u))=Re⁡(f(b)−f(a)b−a),Re(f'(u))=Re(f(b)-f(a)/b-a), Im⁡(f′(v))=Im⁡(f(b)−f(a)b−a).Im(f'(v))=Im(f(b)-f(a)/b-a). Where Re() is the real part and Im() is the imaginary part of a complex-valued function. See also: Voorhoeve index See
