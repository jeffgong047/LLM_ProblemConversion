theorem: Cauchy's mean value theorem, also known as the extended mean value theorem,[7] is a generalization of the mean value theorem. It states: if the functions f and g are both continuous on the closed interval [a,b][a,b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b)(a,b), then there exists some c∈(a,b)∈(a,b), such that[5] Geometrical meaning of Cauchy's theorem (f(b)−f(a))g′(c)=(g(b)−g(a))f′(c).(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c). Of course, if g(a)≠g(b)(a)(b) and g′(c)≠0'(c)≠0, this is equivalent to: f′(c)g′(c)=f(b)−f(a)g(b)−g(a).f'(c)/g'(c)=f(b)-f(a)/g(b)-g(a). Geometrically, this means that there is some tangent to the graph of the curve[8] [a,b]→R2t↦(f(t),g(t))[a,b]→ℝ^2 t↦(f(t),g(t)) which is parallel to the line defined by the points (f(a),g(a))(f(a),g(a)) and (f(b),g(b))(f(b),g(b)). However, Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (f(a),g(a))(f(a),g(a)) and (f(b),g(b))(f(b),g(b)) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value c with f′(c)=g′(c)=0'(c)=g'(c)=0, in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is stationary; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by t↦(t3,1−t2),↦(t^3,1-t^2), which on the interval [−1,1][-1,1] goes from the point (−1,0)(-1,0) to (1,0)(1,0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a cusp) at t=0=0. Cauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove L'Hôpital's rule. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when g(t)=t(t)=t. Proof of Cauchy's mean value
