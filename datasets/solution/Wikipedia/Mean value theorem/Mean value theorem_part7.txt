theorem: The proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem. Suppose g(a)≠g(b)(a)(b). Define h(x)=f(x)−rg(x)(x)=f(x)-rg(x), where r is fixed in such a way that h(a)=h(b)(a)=h(b), namely h(a)=h(b)⟺f(a)−rg(a)=f(b)−rg(b)⟺r(g(b)−g(a))=f(b)−f(a)⟺r=f(b)−f(a)g(b)−g(a).h(a)=h(b) (a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b) (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a) =f(b)-f(a)/g(b)-g(a). Since f and g are continuous on [a,b][a,b] and differentiable on (a,b)(a,b), the same is true for h. All in all, h satisfies the conditions of Rolle's theorem: consequently, there is some c in (a,b)(a,b) for which h′(c)=0'(c)=0. Now using the definition of h we have: 0=h′(c)=f′(c)−rg′(c)=f′(c)−(f(b)−f(a)g(b)−g(a))g′(c).0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c)=f'(c)-(f(b)-f(a)/g(b)-g(a))g'(c). Therefore: f′(c)=f(b)−f(a)g(b)−g(a)g′(c),'(c)=f(b)-f(a)/g(b)-g(a)g'(c), which implies the result.[5] If g(a)=g(b)(a)=g(b), then, applying Rolle's theorem to g, it follows that there exists c in (a,b)(a,b) for which g′(c)=0'(c)=0. Using this choice of c, Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds. Generalization for
