determinants: Assume that f,g,,g, and h are differentiable functions on (a,b)(a,b) that are continuous on [a,b][a,b]. Define D(x)=|f(x)g(x)h(x)f(a)g(a)h(a)f(b)g(b)h(b)|(x)=f(x) g(x) h(x) f(a) g(a) h(a) f(b) g(b) h(b) There exists c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) such that D′(c)=0'(c)=0. Notice that D′(x)=|f′(x)g′(x)h′(x)f(a)g(a)h(a)f(b)g(b)h(b)|'(x)=f'(x) g'(x) h'(x) f(a) g(a) h(a) f(b) g(b) h(b) and if we place h(x)=1(x)=1, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place h(x)=1(x)=1 and g(x)=x(x)=x we get Lagrange's mean value theorem. The proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of D(a)(a) and D(b)(b) are determinants with two identical rows, hence D(a)=D(b)=0(a)=D(b)=0. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists c∈(a,b)∈(a,b) such that D′(c)=0'(c)=0. Mean value theorem in several
