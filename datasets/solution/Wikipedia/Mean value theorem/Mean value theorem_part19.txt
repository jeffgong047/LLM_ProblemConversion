theorem: Let X and Y be non-negative random variables such that E[X] < E[Y] < ∞ and X≤stY≤_stY (i.e. X is smaller than Y in the usual stochastic order). Then there exists an absolutely continuous non-negative random variable Z having probability density function fZ(x)=Pr(Y>x)−Pr(X>x)E[Y]−E[X],x⩾0._Z(x)=(Y>x)-(X>x)E[Y]-E[X] ,⩾0. Let g be a measurable and differentiable function such that E[g(X)], E[g(Y)] < ∞, and let its derivative g′ be measurable and Riemann-integrable on the interval [x, y] for all y ≥ x ≥ 0. Then, E[g′(Z)] is finite and[16] E[g(Y)]−E[g(X)]=E[g′(Z)][E(Y)−E(X)].E[g(Y)]-E[g(X)]=E[g'(Z)] [E(Y)-E(X)]. Mean value theorem in complex
