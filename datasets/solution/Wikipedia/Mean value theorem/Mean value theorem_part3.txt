statement: The function f attains the slope of the secant between a and b as the derivative at the point ξ∈(a,b)ξ∈(a,b). It is also possible that there are multiple tangents parallel to the secant. Let f:[a,b]→R:[a,b]→ℝ be a continuous function on the closed interval [a,b][a,b], and differentiable on the open interval (a,b)(a,b), where a<b<b. Then there exists some c in (a,b)(a,b) such that f′(c)=f(b)−f(a)b−a.'(c)=f(b)-f(a)/b-a. The mean value theorem is a generalization of Rolle's theorem, which assumes f(a)=f(b)(a)=f(b), so that the right-hand side above is zero. The mean value theorem is still valid in a slightly more general setting. One only needs to assume that f:[a,b]→R:[a,b]→ℝ is continuous on [a,b][a,b], and that for every x in (a,b)(a,b) the limit limh→0f(x+h)−f(x)hlim_h→0f(x+h)-f(x)/h exists as a finite number or equals ∞∞ or −∞-∞. If finite, that limit equals f′(x)'(x). An example where this version of the theorem applies is given by the real-valued cube root function mapping x↦x1/3^1/3, whose derivative tends to infinity at the origin. The theorem, as stated, is false if a differentiable function is complex-valued instead of real-valued. For example, define f(x)=exi(x)=e^xi for all real x. Then f(2π)−f(0)=0=0(2π−0)(2π)-f(0)=0=0(2π-0) while f′(x)≠0'(x)≠0 for any real x. These formal statements are also known as Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem.[5]
