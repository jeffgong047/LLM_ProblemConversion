applied: Both conditions for the mean value theorem are necessary: f(x)f(x) is differentiable on (a,b)(a,b) f(x)f(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b] Where one of the above conditions is not satisfied, the mean value theorem is not valid in general, and so it cannot be applied. Function is differentiable on open interval
