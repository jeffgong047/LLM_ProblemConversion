integrals: Geometrically: interpreting f(c) as the height of a rectangle and b–a as the width, this rectangle has the same area as the region below the curve from a to b[12] Let f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function. Then there exists c in (a, b) such that ∫abf(x)dx=f(c)(b−a).∫_a^bf(x) dx=f(c)(b-a). Since the mean value of f on [a, b] is defined as 1b−a∫abf(x)dx,1/b-a∫_a^bf(x) dx, we can interpret the conclusion as f achieves its mean value at some c in (a, b).[13] In general, if f : [a, b] → R is continuous and g is an integrable function that does not change sign on [a, b], then there exists c in (a, b) such that ∫abf(x)g(x)dx=f(c)∫abg(x)dx.∫_a^bf(x)g(x) dx=f(c)∫_a^bg(x) dx. Proof that there is some c in [a,
