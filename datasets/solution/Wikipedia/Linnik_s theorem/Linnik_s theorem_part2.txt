Properties: It is known that L ≤ 2 for almost all integers d.[3] On the generalized Riemann hypothesis it can be shown that p⁡(a,d)≤(1+o(1))φ(d)2(log⁡d)2,p(a,d)≤(1+o(1))φ(d)^2()^2 , where φφ is the totient function,[4] and the stronger bound p⁡(a,d)≤φ(d)2(log⁡d)2,p(a,d)≤φ(d)^2()^2 , has been also proved.[5] It is also conjectured that: p⁡(a,d)<d2.p(a,d)<d^2.
