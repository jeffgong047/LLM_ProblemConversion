theorem: If f is a holomorphic function in the unit disk with the property |f′(0)| = 1, then let Lf be the radius of the largest disk contained in the image of f. Landau's theorem states that there is a constant L defined as the infimum of Lf over all such functions f, and that L is greater than Bloch's constant L ≥ B. This theorem is named after Edmund Landau. Valiron's
