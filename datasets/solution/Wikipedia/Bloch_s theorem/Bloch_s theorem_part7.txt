Theorem: In the proof of Landau's Theorem above, Rouché's theorem implies that not only can we find a disk D of radius at least 1/24 in the range of f, but there is also a small disk D0 inside the unit disk such that for every w ∈ D there is a unique z ∈ D0 with f(z) = w. Thus, f is a bijective analytic function from D0 ∩ f−1(D) to D, so its inverse φ is also analytic by the inverse function theorem. Bloch's and Landau's
