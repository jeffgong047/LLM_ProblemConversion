theorem: We first prove the case when f(0) = 0, f′(0) = 1, and |f′(z)| ≤ 2 in the unit disk. By Cauchy's integral formula, we have a bound |f″(z)|=|12πi∮γf′(w)(w−z)2dw|≤12π⋅2πrsupw=γ(t)|f′(w)||w−z|2≤2r,|f”(z)|=|1/2∮_γf'(w)/(w-z)^2 dw|≤1/2π·2sup_w=γ(t)|f'(w)|/|w-z|^2≤2/r, where γ is the counterclockwise circle of radius r around z, and 0 < r < 1 − |z|. By Taylor's theorem, for each z in the unit disk, there exists 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 such that f(z) = z + z2f″(tz) / 2. Thus, if |z| = 1/3 and |w| < 1/6, we have |(f(z)−w)−(z−w)|=12|z|2|f″(tz)|≤|z|21−t|z|≤|z|21−|z|=16<|z|−|w|≤|z−w|.|(f(z)-w)-(z-w)|=1/2|z|^2|f”(tz)|≤|z|^2/1-t|z|≤|z|^2/1-|z|=1/6<|z|-|w|≤|z-w|. By Rouché's theorem, the range of f contains the disk of radius 1/6 around 0. Let D(z0, r) denote the open disk of radius r around z0. For an analytic function g : D(z0, r) → C such that g(z0) ≠ 0, the case above applied to (g(z0 + rz) − g(z0)) / (rg′(0)) implies that the range of g contains D(g(z0), |g′(0)|r / 6). For the general case, let f be an analytic function in the unit disk such that |f′(0)| = 1, and z0 = 0. If |f′(z)| ≤ 2|f′(z0)| for |z − z0| < 1/4, then by the first case, the range of f contains a disk of radius |f′(z0)| / 24 = 1/24. Otherwise, there exists z1 such that |z1 − z0| < 1/4 and |f′(z1)| > 2|f′(z0)|. If |f′(z)| ≤ 2|f′(z1)| for |z − z1| < 1/8, then by the first case, the range of f contains a disk of radius |f′(z1)| / 48 > |f′(z0)| / 24 = 1/24. Otherwise, there exists z2 such that |z2 − z1| < 1/8 and |f′(z2)| > 2|f′(z1)|. Repeating this argument, we either find a disk of radius at least 1/24 in the range of f, proving the theorem, or find an infinite sequence (zn) such that |zn − zn−1| < 1/2n+1 and |f′(zn)| > 2|f′(zn−1)|. In the latter case the sequence is in D(0, 1/2), so f′ is unbounded in D(0, 1/2), a contradiction. Bloch's
