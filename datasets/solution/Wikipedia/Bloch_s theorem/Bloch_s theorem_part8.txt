constants: The number B is called the Bloch's constant. The lower bound 1/72 in Bloch's theorem is not the best possible. Bloch's theorem tells us B ≥ 1/72, but the exact value of B is still unknown. The best known bounds for B at present are 0.4332≈34+2×10−4≤B≤3−12⋅Γ(13)Γ(1112)Γ(14)≈0.47186,0.4332≈√(3)/4+2×10^-4≤√(√(3)-1/2)·Γ(1/3)Γ(11/12)/Γ(1/4)≈0.47186, where Γ is the Gamma function. The lower bound was proved by Chen and Gauthier, and the upper bound dates back to Ahlfors and Grunsky. The similarly defined optimal constant L in Landau's theorem is called the Landau's constant. Its exact value is also unknown, but it is known that 0.5<L≤Γ(13)Γ(56)Γ(16)=0.543258965342...0.5<L≤Γ(1/3)Γ(5/6)/Γ(1/6)=0.543258965342... (sequence A081760 in the OEIS) In their paper, Ahlfors and Grunsky conjectured that their upper bounds are actually the true values of B and L. For injective holomorphic functions on the unit disk, a constant A can similarly be defined. It is known that 0.5<A≤0.78530.5<A≤0.7853 See
