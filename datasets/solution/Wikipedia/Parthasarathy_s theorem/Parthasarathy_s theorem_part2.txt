Theorem: Let X and Y stand for the unit interval [0,1][0,1]; MXℳ_X denote the set of probability distributions on X (with MYℳ_Y defined similarly); and AX_X denote the set of absolutely continuous distributions on X (with AY_Y defined similarly). Suppose that k(x,y)(x,y) is bounded on the unit square X×Y=(x,y):0≤x,y≤1={(x,y):0,y≤1} and that k(x,y)(x,y) is continuous except possibly on a finite number of curves of the form y=ϕk(x)=ϕ_k(x) (with k=1,2,…,n=1,2,…,n) where the ϕk(x)ϕ_k(x) are continuous functions. For μ∈MX,λ∈MYμ_X,λ_Y, define k(μ,λ)=∫y=01∫x=01k(x,y)dμ(x)dλ(y)=∫x=01∫y=01k(x,y)dλ(y)dμ(x).(μ,λ)=∫_y=0^1∫_x=0^1k(x,y) dμ(x) dλ(y)=∫_x=0^1∫_y=0^1k(x,y) dλ(y) dμ(x). Then maxμ∈MXinfλ∈AYk(μ,λ)=infλ∈AYmaxμ∈MXk(μ,λ).max_μ∈ℳ_X inf_λ_Yk(μ,λ)=inf_λ_Y max_μ∈ℳ_Xk(μ,λ). This is equivalent to the statement that the game induced by k(⋅,⋅)(·,·) has a value. Note that one player (WLOG Y) is forbidden from using a pure strategy. Parthasarathy goes on to exhibit a game in which maxμ∈MXinfλ∈MYk(μ,λ)≠infλ∈MYmaxμ∈MXk(μ,λ)max_μ∈ℳ_X inf_λ∈ℳ_Yk(μ,λ)≠inf_λ∈ℳ_Y max_μ∈ℳ_Xk(μ,λ) which thus has no value. There is no contradiction because in this case neither player is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions (and the demonstration that the game has no value requires both players to use pure strategies).
