It states that a particular class of games has a mixed value, provided that at least one of the players has a strategy that is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions with respect to the Lebesgue measure (in other words, one of the players is forbidden to use a pure strategy). The theorem is attributed to the Indian mathematician Thiruvenkatachari Parthasarathy.
