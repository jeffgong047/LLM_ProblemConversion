This article is about projective geometry. For a result on tensor products of modules, see Homological conjectures in commutative algebra. In projective geometry, an intersection theorem or incidence theorem is a statement concerning an incidence structure – consisting of points, lines, and possibly higher-dimensional objects and their incidences – together with a pair of objects A and B (for instance, a point and a line). The "theorem" states that, whenever a set of objects satisfies the incidences (i.e. can be identified with the objects of the incidence structure in such a way that incidence is preserved), then the objects A and B must also be incident. An intersection theorem is not necessarily true in all projective geometries; it is a property that some geometries satisfy but others don't. For example, Desargues' theorem can be stated using the following incidence structure: Points: A,B,C,a,b,c,P,Q,R,O{A,B,C,a,b,c,P,Q,R,O} Lines: AB,AC,BC,ab,ac,bc,Aa,Bb,Cc,PQ{AB,AC,BC,ab,ac,bc,Aa,Bb,Cc,PQ} Incidences (in addition to obvious ones such as (A,AB)(A,AB)): (O,Aa),(O,Bb),(O,Cc),(P,BC),(P,bc),(Q,AC),(Q,ac),(R,AB),(R,ab){(O,Aa),(O,Bb),(O,Cc),(P,BC),(P,bc),(Q,AC),(Q,ac),(R,AB),(R,ab)} The implication is then (R,PQ)(R,PQ)—that point R is incident with line PQ.
