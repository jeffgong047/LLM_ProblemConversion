examples: Desargues' theorem holds in a projective plane P if and only if P is the projective plane over some division ring (skewfield} D — P=P2D=ℙ_2D. The projective plane is then called desarguesian. A theorem of Amitsur and Bergman states that, in the context of desarguesian projective planes, for every intersection theorem there is a rational identity such that the plane P satisfies the intersection theorem if and only if the division ring D satisfies the rational identity. Pappus's hexagon theorem holds in a desarguesian projective plane P2Dℙ_2D if and only if D is a field; it corresponds to the identity ∀a,b∈D,a⋅b=b⋅a,b,=b. Fano's axiom (which states a certain intersection does not happen) holds in P2Dℙ_2D if and only if D has characteristic ≠2≠2; it corresponds to the identity a + a = 0.
