Criticism: The validity of the Heckscher–Ohlin model has been questioned since the classical Leontief paradox. Indeed, Feenstra called the Heckscher–Ohlin model "hopelessly inadequate as an explanation for historical and modern trade patterns".[4] As for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem itself, Davis and Mishra recently stated, "It is time to declare Stolper–Samuelson dead".[5] They argue that the Stolper–Samuelson theorem is "dead" because following trade liberalization in some developing countries (particularly in Latin America), wage inequality rose, and, under the assumption that these countries are labor-abundant, the SS theorem predicts that wage inequality should have fallen. Aside from the declining trend in wage inequality in Latin America that has followed trade liberalization in the longer run (see Lopez-Calva and Lustig), an alternative view would be to recognize that technically the SS theorem predicts a relationship between output prices and relative wages.[6] Papers that compare output prices with changes in relative wages find moderate-to-strong support for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem for Chile,[7] Mexico,[8] and Brazil.[9] See
