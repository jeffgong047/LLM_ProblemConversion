Application: If the initial point (pa) of a ray (in red) lies outside a simple polygon (region A), the number of intersections of the ray and the polygon is even. If the initial point (pb) of a ray lies inside the polygon (region B), the number of intersections is odd. Main article: Point in polygon ยง Ray casting algorithm In computational geometry, the Jordan curve theorem can be used for testing whether a point lies inside or outside a simple polygon.[14][15][16] From a given point, trace a ray that does not pass through any vertex of the polygon (all rays but a finite number are convenient). Then, compute the number n of intersections of the ray with an edge of the polygon. Jordan curve theorem proof implies that the point is inside the polygon if and only if n is odd. Computational
