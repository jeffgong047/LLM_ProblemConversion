processing: In image processing, a binary picture is a discrete square grid of 0 and 1, or equivalently, a compact subset of Z2ℤ^2. Topological invariants on R2ℝ^2, such as number of components, might fail to be well-defined for Z2ℤ^2 if Z2ℤ^2 does not have an appropriately defined graph structure. There are two obvious graph structures on Z2ℤ^2: 8-neighbor and 4-neighbor square grids. the "4-neighbor square grid", where each vertex (x,y)(x,y) is connected with (x+1,y),(x−1,y),(x,y+1),(x,y−1)(x+1,y),(x-1,y),(x,y+1),(x,y-1). the "8-neighbor square grid", where each vertex (x,y)(x,y) is connected with (x′,y′)(x',y') iff |x−x′|≤1,|y−y′|≤1|x-x'|≤1,|y-y'|≤1, and (x,y)≠(x′,y′)(x,y)≠(x',y'). Both graph structures fail to satisfy the strong Hex theorem. The 4-neighbor square grid allows a no-winner situation, and the 8-neighbor square grid allows a two-winner situation. Consequently, connectedness properties in R2ℝ^2, such as the Jordan curve theorem, do not generalize to Z2ℤ^2 under either graph structure. If the "6-neighbor square grid" structure is imposed on Z2ℤ^2, then it is the hexagonal grid, and thus satisfies the strong Hex theorem, allowing the Jordan curve theorem to generalize. For this reason, when computing connected components in a binary image, the 6-neighbor square grid is generally used.[6] Steinhaus chessboard
