aspects: Adler, Daskalakis and Demaine[17] prove that a computational version of Jordanâ€™s theorem is PPAD-complete. As a corollary, they show that Jordan's theorem implies the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. This complements the earlier result by Maehara, that Brouwer's fixed point theorem implies Jordan's theorem.[18] See
