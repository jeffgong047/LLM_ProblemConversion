curve: As above, one may write the equation of the line in projective coordinates as y=sx+mt.=sx+mt. If curve is defined in projective coordinates by a homogeneous polynomial p(x,y,t)(x,y,t) of degree n, the substitution of y provides a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in x and t. The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that it can be factored in linear factors. Each factor gives the ratio of the x and t coordinates of an intersection point, and the multiplicity of the factor is the multiplicity of the intersection point. If t is viewed as the coordinate of infinity, a factor equal to t represents an intersection point at infinity. If at least one partial derivative of the polynomial p is not zero at an intersection point, then the tangent of the curve at this point is defined (see Algebraic curve ยง Tangent at a point), and the intersection multiplicity is greater than one if and only if the line is tangent to the curve. If all partial derivatives are zero, the intersection point is a singular point, and the intersection multiplicity is at least two. Two conic
