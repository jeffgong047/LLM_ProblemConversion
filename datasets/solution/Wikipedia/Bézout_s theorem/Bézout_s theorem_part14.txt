U-resultant: Main article: U-Resultant In the early 20th century, Francis Sowerby Macaulay introduced the multivariate resultant (also known as Macaulay's resultant) of n homogeneous polynomials in n indeterminates, which is generalization of the usual resultant of two polynomials. Macaulay's resultant is a polynomial function of the coefficients of n homogeneous polynomials that is zero if and only the polynomials have a nontrivial (that is some component is nonzero) common zero in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients. The U-resultant is a particular instance of Macaulay's resultant, introduced also by Macaulay. Given n homogeneous polynomials f1,…,fn_1,…,f_n in n + 1 indeterminates x0,…,xn,_0,…,x_n, the U-resultant is the resultant of f1,…,fn,_1,…,f_n, and U0x0+⋯+Unxn,_0x_0+⋯+U_nx_n, where the coefficients U0,…,Un_0,…,U_n are auxiliary indeterminates. The U-resultant is a homogeneous polynomial in U0,…,Un,_0,…,U_n, whose degree is the product of the degrees of the fi._i. Although a multivariate polynomial is generally irreducible, the U-resultant can be factorized into linear (in the Ui_i) polynomials over an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of the fi._i. These linear factors correspond to the common zeros of the fi_i in the following way: to each common zero (α0,…,αn)(α_0,…,α_n) corresponds a linear factor (α0U0+⋯+αnUn),(α_0U_0+⋯+α_nU_n), and conversely. This proves Bézout's theorem, if the multiplicity of a common zero is defined as the multiplicity of the corresponding linear factor of the U-resultant. As for the preceding proof, the equality of this multiplicity with the definition by deformation results from the continuity of the U-resultant as a function of the coefficients of the fi._i. This proof of Bézout's theorem seems the oldest proof that satisfies the modern criteria of rigor. Using the degree of an
