case: The affine case of the theorem is the following statement, that has been proven in 1983 by David Masser and Gisbert Wüstholz.[7] Let n affine hypersurfaces which are defined over an algebraically closed field by n polynomials in n variables, of degrees d1,…,dn._1,…,d_n. Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with their multiplicities, is at most the product d1⋯dn._1_n. If the hypersurfaces are in relative general position, then there are exactly d1⋯dn_1_n intersection points, all with multiplicity 1. This version is not a direct consequence of the general case, because it is possible to have a finite number of intersection points in the affine space, with infinitely many intersection points at infinity. The above statement is a special case of a more general statement, which is the result that Masser and Wüstholz proved. For stating the general result, one has to recall that the intersection points form an algebraic set, and that there is a finite number of intersection points if and only if all component of the intersection have a zero dimension (an algebraic set of positive dimension has an infinity of points over an algebraically closed field). An intersection point is said isolated if it does not belong to a component of positive dimension of the intersection; the terminology make sense, since an isolated intersection point has neighborhoods (for Zariski topology or for the usual topology in the case of complex hypersurfaces) that does not contain any other intersection point. Let n projective hypersurfaces which are defined over an algebraically closed field by n homogeneous polynomials in n+1+1 variables, of degrees d1,…,dn._1,…,d_n. Then, the sum of the multiplicities of their isolated intersection points is at most the product d1⋯dn._1_n. The result remains valid for any number m of hypersurfaces, if one sets dm+1=0_m+1=0 in the case m<n,<n, and, otherwise, if one orders the degrees for having d2≥d3≥⋯≥dm≥d1._2_3≥⋯_m_1. That is, there is no isolated intersection point if m<n,<n, and, otherwise, the bound is the product of the smallest degree and the n−1-1 largest degrees. Examples (plane
