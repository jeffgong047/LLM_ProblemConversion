lines: The equation of a line in a Euclidean plane is linear, that is, it equates to zero a polynomial of degree one. So, the Bézout bound for two lines is 1, meaning that two lines either intersect at a single point, or do not intersect. In the latter case, the lines are parallel and meet at a point at infinity. One can verify this with equations. The equation of a first line can be written in slope-intercept form y=sx+m=sx+m or, in projective coordinates y=sx+mt=sx+mt (if the line is vertical, one may exchange x and y). If the equation of a second line is (in projective coordinates) ax+by+ct=0,+by+ct=0, by substituting sx+mt+mt for y in it, one gets (a+bs)x+(c+bm)t=0.(a+bs)x+(c+bm)t=0. If a+bs≠0,+bs≠0, one gets the x-coordinate of the intersection point by solving the latter equation in x and putting t = 1. If a+bs=0,+bs=0, that is s=−a/b,=-a/b, the two line are parallel as having the same slope. If m≠−c/b,≠-c/b, they are distinct, and the substituted equation gives t = 0. This gives the point at infinity of projective coordinates (1, s, 0). A line and a
