case: The generalization in higher dimension may be stated as: Let n projective hypersurfaces be given in a projective space of dimension n over an algebraically closed field, which are defined by n homogeneous polynomials in n + 1 variables, of degrees d1,…,dn._1,…,d_n. Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product d1⋯dn._1_n. If the hypersurfaces are in relative general position, then there are d1⋯dn_1_n intersection points, all with multiplicity 1. There are various proofs of this theorem, which either are expressed in purely algebraic terms, or use the language or algebraic geometry. Three algebraic proofs are sketched below. Bézout's theorem has been generalized as the so-called multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem. Affine
