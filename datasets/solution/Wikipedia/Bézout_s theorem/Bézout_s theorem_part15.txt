ideal: Bézout's theorem can be proved by recurrence on the number of polynomials by using the following theorem. Let V be a projective algebraic set of dimension δδ and degree d1_1, and H be a hypersurface (defined by a single polynomial) of degree d2_2, that does not contain any irreducible component of V; under these hypotheses, the intersection of V and H has dimension δ−1δ-1 and degree d1d2._1d_2. For a (sketched) proof using Hilbert series, see Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial § Degree of a projective variety and Bézout's theorem. Beside allowing a conceptually simple proof of Bézout's theorem, this theorem is fundamental for intersection theory, since this theory is essentially devoted to the study of intersection multiplicities when the hypotheses of the above theorem do not apply.
