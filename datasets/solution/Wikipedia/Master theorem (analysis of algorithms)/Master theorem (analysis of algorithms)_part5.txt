example: T(n)=8T(n2)+1000n2(n)=8T(n/2)+1000n^2 As one can see from the formula above: a=8,b=2,f(n)=1000n2=8, b=2, f(n)=1000n^2, so f(n)=O(nc)(n)=O(n^c), where c=2=2 Next, we see if we satisfy the case 1 condition: logb⁡a=log2⁡8=3>clog_ba=log_28=3>c. It follows from the first case of the master theorem that T(n)=Θ(nlogb⁡a)=Θ(n3)(n)=Θ(n^log_ba)=Θ(n^3) (This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is T(n)=1001n3−1000n2(n)=1001n^3-1000n^2, assuming T(1)=1(1)=1).
