example: T(n)=2T(n2)+10n(n)=2T(n/2)+10n As we can see in the formula above the variables get the following values: a=2,b=2,c=1,f(n)=10n=2, b=2, c=1, f(n)=10n f(n)=Θ(nclogk⁡n)(n)=Θ(n^clog^kn) where c=1,k=0=1,k=0 Next, we see if we satisfy the case 2 condition: logb⁡a=log2⁡2=1log_ba=log_22=1, and therefore, c and logb⁡alog_ba are equal So it follows from the second case of the master theorem: T(n)=Θ(nlogb⁡alogk+1⁡n)=Θ(n1log1⁡n)=Θ(nlog⁡n)(n)=Θ(n^log_balog^k+1n)=Θ(n^1log^1n)=Θ(n) Thus the given recurrence relation T(n)(n) was in Θ(nlog⁡n)Θ(n). (This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is T(n)=n+10nlog2⁡n(n)=n+10nlog_2n, assuming T(1)=1(1)=1). Case 3
