equations: The following equations cannot be solved using the master theorem:[4] T(n)=2nT(n2)+nn(n)=2^nT(n/2)+n^n a is not a constant; the number of subproblems should be fixed T(n)=2T(n2)+nlog⁡n(n)=2T(n/2)+n/ non-polynomial difference between f(n)(n) and nlogb⁡a^log_ba (see below; extended version applies) T(n)=0.5T(n2)+n(n)=0.5T(n/2)+n a<1<1 cannot have less than one sub problem T(n)=64T(n8)−n2log⁡n(n)=64T(n/8)-n^2 f(n)(n), which is the combination time, is not positive T(n)=T(n2)+n(2−cos⁡n)(n)=T(n/2)+n(2-) case 3 but regularity violation. In the second inadmissible example above, the difference between f(n)(n) and nlogb⁡a^log_ba can be expressed with the ratio f(n)nlogb⁡a=n/log⁡nnlog2⁡2=nnlog⁡n=1log⁡nf(n)/n^log_ba=n//n^log_22=n/n=1/. It is clear that 1log⁡n<nϵ1/<n^ϵ for any constant ϵ>0ϵ>0. Therefore, the difference is not polynomial and the basic form of the Master Theorem does not apply. The extended form (case 2b) does apply, giving the solution T(n)=Θ(nlog⁡log⁡n)(n)=Θ(nlog). Application to common
