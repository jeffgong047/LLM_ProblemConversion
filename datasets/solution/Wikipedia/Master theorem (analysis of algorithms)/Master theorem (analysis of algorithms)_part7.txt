example: T(n)=2T(n2)+n2(n)=2T(n/2)+n^2 As we can see in the formula above the variables get the following values: a=2,b=2,f(n)=n2=2, b=2, f(n)=n^2 f(n)=Ω(nc)(n)=Ω(n^c), where c=2=2 Next, we see if we satisfy the case 3 condition: logb⁡a=log2⁡2=1log_ba=log_22=1, and therefore, yes, c>logb⁡a>log_ba The regularity condition also holds: 2(n24)≤kn22(n^2/4)^2, choosing k=1/2=1/2 So it follows from the third case of the master theorem: T(n)=Θ(f(n))=Θ(n2).(n)=Θ(f(n))=Θ(n^2). Thus the given recurrence relation T(n)(n) was in Θ(n2)Θ(n^2), that complies with the f(n)(n) of the original formula. (This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is T(n)=2n2−n(n)=2n^2-n, assuming T(1)=1(1)=1.) Inadmissible
