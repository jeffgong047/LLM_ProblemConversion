Counterexample: This theorem may not hold for normed spaces that are not complete. For example, consider the space X of sequences x : N → R with only finitely many non-zero terms equipped with the supremum norm. The map T : X → X defined by Tx=(x1,x22,x33,…)=(x_1,x_2/2,x_3/3,…) is bounded, linear and invertible, but T−1 is unbounded. This does not contradict the bounded inverse theorem since X is not complete, and thus is not a Banach space. To see that it's not complete, consider the sequence of sequences x(n) ∈ X given by x(n)=(1,12,…,1n,0,0,…)^(n)=(1,1/2,…,1/n,0,0,…) converges as n → ∞ to the sequence x(∞) given by x(∞)=(1,12,…,1n,…),^(∞)=(1,1/2,…,1/n,…), which has all its terms non-zero, and so does not lie in X. The completion of X is the space c0_0 of all sequences that converge to zero, which is a (closed) subspace of the ℓp space ℓ∞(N), which is the space of all bounded sequences. However, in this case, the map T is not onto, and thus not a bijection. To see this, one need simply note that the sequence x=(1,12,13,…),=(1,1/2,1/3,…), is an element of c0_0, but is not in the range of T:c0→c0:c_0_0. See
