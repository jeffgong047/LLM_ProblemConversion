In mathematics, the bounded inverse theorem ( also called inverse mapping theorem or Banach isomorphism theorem) is a result in the theory of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces. It states that a bijective bounded linear operator T from one Banach space to another has bounded inverse Tâˆ’1. It is equivalent to both the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem.
