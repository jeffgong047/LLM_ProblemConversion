In mathematics, the bounded inverse theorem ( also called inverse mapping theorem or Banach isomorphism theorem) is a result in the theory of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces. 
It states that a bijective bounded linear operator T from one Banach space to another has bounded inverse T−1. It is equivalent to both the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem.


Generalization[edit]

Theorem[1] — If A : X → Y is a continuous linear bijection from a complete pseudometrizable topological vector space (TVS) onto a Hausdorff TVS that is a Baire space, then A : X → Y is a homeomorphism (and thus an isomorphism of TVSs).


Counterexample[edit]
This theorem may not hold for normed spaces that are not complete. 
For example, consider the space X of sequences x : N → R with only finitely many non-zero terms equipped with the supremum norm. The map T : X → X defined by

Tx=(x1,x22,x33,…)=(x_1,x_2/2,x_3/3,…)
is bounded, linear and invertible, but T−1 is unbounded. 
This does not contradict the bounded inverse theorem since X is not complete, and thus is not a Banach space. 
To see that it's not complete, consider the sequence of sequences x(n) ∈ X given by

x(n)=(1,12,…,1n,0,0,…)^(n)=(1,1/2,…,1/n,0,0,…)
converges as n → ∞ to the sequence x(∞) given by

x(∞)=(1,12,…,1n,…),^(∞)=(1,1/2,…,1/n,…),
which has all its terms non-zero, and so does not lie in X.
The completion of X is  the space c0_0 of all sequences that converge to zero, which is a (closed) subspace of the ℓp space ℓ∞(N), which is the space of all bounded sequences. 
However, in this case, the map T is not onto, and thus not a bijection. To see this, one need simply note that the sequence

x=(1,12,13,…),=(1,1/2,1/3,…),
is an element of c0_0, but is not in the range of T:c0→c0:c_0_0.
