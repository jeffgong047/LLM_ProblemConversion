variants: The theorem is typically credited[3]: 381 to a 1966 paper by Corrado Böhm and Giuseppe Jacopini.[4] David Harel wrote in 1980 that the Böhm–Jacopini paper enjoyed "universal popularity",[3]: 381 particularly with proponents of structured programming. Harel also noted that "due to its rather technical style [the 1966 Böhm–Jacopini paper] is apparently more often cited than read in detail"[3]: 381 and, after reviewing a large number of papers published up to 1980, Harel argued that the contents of the Böhm–Jacopini proof were usually misrepresented as a folk theorem that essentially contains a simpler result, a result which itself can be traced to the inception of modern computing theory in the papers of von Neumann[5] and Kleene.[3]: 383 Harel also writes that the more generic name was proposed by H.D. Mills as "The Structure Theorem" in the early 1970s.[3]: 381 Single-while-loop, folk version of the
