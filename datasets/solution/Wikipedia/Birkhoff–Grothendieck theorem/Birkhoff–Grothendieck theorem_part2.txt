Statement: More precisely, the statement of the theorem is as the following. Every holomorphic vector bundle Eℰ on CP1ℂℙ^1 is holomorphically isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles: E≅O(a1)⊕⋯⊕O(an).ℰ≅𝒪(a_1)⊕⋯⊕𝒪(a_n). The notation implies each summand is a Serre twist some number of times of the trivial bundle. The representation is unique up to permuting factors.
