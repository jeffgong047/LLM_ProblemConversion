Applications: One application of this theorem is it gives a classification of all coherent sheaves on CP1ℂℙ^1. We have two cases, vector bundles and coherent sheaves supported along a subvariety, so O(k),Onx𝒪(k),𝒪_nx where n is the degree of the fat point at x∈CP1∈ℂℙ^1. Since the only subvarieties are points, we have a complete classification of coherent sheaves. See
