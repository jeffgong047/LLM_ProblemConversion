theorem: Ford (1999) proved that for every integer k ≥ 2 there is a totient number m of multiplicity k: that is, for which the equation φ(n) = m has exactly k solutions; this result had previously been conjectured by Wacław Sierpiński,[47] and it had been obtained as a consequence of Schinzel's hypothesis H.[43] Indeed, each multiplicity that occurs, does so infinitely often.[43][46] However, no number m is known with multiplicity k = 1. Carmichael's totient function conjecture is the statement that there is no such m.[48] Perfect totient
