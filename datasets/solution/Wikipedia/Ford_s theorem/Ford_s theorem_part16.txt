rate: In the words of Hardy & Wright, the order of φ(n) is "always 'nearly n'."[28] First[29] limsupφ(n)n=1,limsupφ(n)/n=1, but as n goes to infinity,[30] for all δ > 0 φ(n)n1−δ→∞.φ(n)/n^1-δ→∞. These two formulae can be proved by using little more than the formulae for φ(n) and the divisor sum function σ(n). In fact, during the proof of the second formula, the inequality 6π2<φ(n)σ(n)n2<1,6/π^2<φ(n)σ(n)/n^2<1, true for n > 1, is proved. We also have[20] liminfφ(n)nlog⁡log⁡n=e−γ.liminfφ(n)/nlog=e^-γ. Here γ is Euler's constant, γ = 0.577215665..., so eγ = 1.7810724... and e−γ = 0.56145948.... Proving this does not quite require the prime number theorem.[31][32] Since log log n goes to infinity, this formula shows that liminfφ(n)n=0.liminfφ(n)/n=0. In fact, more is true.[33][34][35] φ(n)>neγlog⁡log⁡n+3log⁡log⁡nforn>2φ(n)>n/e^γ log+3/log forn>2 and φ(n)<neγlog⁡log⁡nforinfinitelymanyn.φ(n)<n/e^γlog forinfinitelymanyn. The second inequality was shown by Jean-Louis Nicolas. Ribenboim says "The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption."[35]: 173 For the average order, we have[22][36] φ(1)+φ(2)+⋯+φ(n)=3n2π2+O(n(log⁡n)23(log⁡log⁡n)43)asn→∞,φ(1)+φ(2)+⋯+φ(n)=3n^2/π^2+O(n()^2/3(log)^4/3) asn→∞, due to Arnold Walfisz, its proof exploiting estimates on exponential sums due to I. M. Vinogradov and N. M. Korobov. By a combination of van der Corput's and Vinogradov's methods, H.-Q. Liu (On Euler's function.Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 146 (2016), no. 4, 769–775) improved the error term to O(n(log⁡n)23(log⁡log⁡n)13)(n()^2/3(log)^1/3) (this is currently the best known estimate of this type). The "Big O" stands for a quantity that is bounded by a constant times the function of n inside the parentheses (which is small compared to n2). This result can be used to prove[37] that the probability of two randomly chosen numbers being relatively prime is 6/π2. Ratio of consecutive
