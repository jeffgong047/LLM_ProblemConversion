numbers: A totient number is a value of Euler's totient function: that is, an m for which there is at least one n for which φ(n) = m. The valency or multiplicity of a totient number m is the number of solutions to this equation.[40] A nontotient is a natural number which is not a totient number. Every odd integer exceeding 1 is trivially a nontotient. There are also infinitely many even nontotients,[41] and indeed every positive integer has a multiple which is an even nontotient.[42] The number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is xlog⁡xe(C+o(1))(log⁡log⁡log⁡x)2x/e^(C+o(1))(loglog)^2 for a constant C = 0.8178146....[43] If counted accordingly to multiplicity, the number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is |n:φ(n)≤x|=ζ(2)ζ(3)ζ(6)⋅x+R(x)|{n:φ(n)}|=ζ(2)ζ(3)/ζ(6)+R(x) where the error term R is of order at most x/(log x)k for any positive k.[44] It is known that the multiplicity of m exceeds mδ infinitely often for any δ < 0.55655.[45][46] Ford's
