sum: The property established by Gauss,[17] that ∑d∣nφ(d)=n,∑_dφ(d)=n, where the sum is over all positive divisors d of n, can be proven in several ways. (See Arithmetical function for notational conventions.) One proof is to note that φ(d) is also equal to the number of possible generators of the cyclic group Cd ; specifically, if Cd = ⟨g⟩ with gd = 1, then gk is a generator for every k coprime to d. Since every element of Cn generates a cyclic subgroup, and all subgroups Cd ⊆ Cn are generated by precisely φ(d) elements of Cn, the formula follows.[18] Equivalently, the formula can be derived by the same argument applied to the multiplicative group of the nth roots of unity and the primitive dth roots of unity. The formula can also be derived from elementary arithmetic.[19] For example, let n = 20 and consider the positive fractions up to 1 with denominator 20: 120,220,320,420,520,620,720,820,920,1020,1120,1220,1320,1420,1520,1620,1720,1820,1920,2020.120, 220, 320, 420, 520, 620, 720, 820, 920, 1020, 1120, 1220, 1320, 1420, 1520, 1620, 1720, 1820, 1920, 2020. Put them into lowest terms: 120,110,320,15,14,310,720,25,920,12,1120,35,1320,710,34,45,1720,910,1920,11120, 110, 320, 15, 14, 310, 720, 25, 920, 12, 1120, 35, 1320, 710, 34, 45, 1720, 910, 1920, 11 These twenty fractions are all the positive k/d ≤ 1 whose denominators are the divisors d = 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. The fractions with 20 as denominator are those with numerators relatively prime to 20, namely 1/20, 3/20, 7/20, 9/20, 11/20, 13/20, 17/20, 19/20; by definition this is φ(20) fractions. Similarly, there are φ(10) fractions with denominator 10, and φ(5) fractions with denominator 5, etc. Thus the set of twenty fractions is split into subsets of size φ(d) for each d dividing 20. A similar argument applies for any n. Möbius inversion applied to the divisor sum formula gives φ(n)=∑d∣nμ(d)⋅nd=n∑d∣nμ(d)d,φ(n)=∑_dμ(d)·n/d=n∑_dμ(d)/d, where μ is the Möbius function, the multiplicative function defined by μ(p)=−1μ(p)=-1 and μ(pk)=0μ(p^k)=0 for each prime p and k ≥ 2. This formula may also be derived from the product formula by multiplying out ∏p∣n(1−1p)∏_p(1-1/p) to get ∑d∣nμ(d)d.∑_dμ(d)/d. An example:φ(20)=μ(1)⋅20+μ(2)⋅10+μ(4)⋅5+μ(5)⋅4+μ(10)⋅2+μ(20)⋅1=1⋅20−1⋅10+0⋅5−1⋅4+1⋅2+0⋅1=8.φ(20) =μ(1)·20+μ(2)·10+μ(4)·5+μ(5)·4+μ(10)·2+μ(20)·1 =1·20-1·10+0·5-1·4+1·2+0·1=8. Some
