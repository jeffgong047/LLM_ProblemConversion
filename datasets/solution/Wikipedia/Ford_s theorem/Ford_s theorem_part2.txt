notation: Leonhard Euler introduced the function in 1763.[7][8][9] However, he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it. In a 1784 publication, Euler studied the function further, choosing the Greek letter π to denote it: he wrote πD for "the multitude of numbers less than D, and which have no common divisor with it".[10] This definition varies from the current definition for the totient function at D = 1 but is otherwise the same. The now-standard notation[8][11] φ(A) comes from Gauss's 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,[12][13] although Gauss did not use parentheses around the argument and wrote φA. Thus, it is often called Euler's phi function or simply the phi function. In 1879, J. J. Sylvester coined the term totient for this function,[14][15] so it is also referred to as Euler's totient function, the Euler totient, or Euler's totient. Jordan's totient is a generalization of Euler's. The cototient of n is defined as n − φ(n). It counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that have at least one prime factor in common with n. Computing Euler's totient
