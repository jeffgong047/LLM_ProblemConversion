Example: φ(20)=φ(225)=20(1−12)(1−15)=20⋅12⋅45=8.φ(20)=φ(2^25)=20 (1-12) (1-15)=20·12·45=8. In words: the distinct prime factors of 20 are 2 and 5; half of the twenty integers from 1 to 20 are divisible by 2, leaving ten; a fifth of those are divisible by 5, leaving eight numbers coprime to 20; these are: 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19. The alternative formula uses only integers:φ(20)=φ(2251)=22−1(2−1)51−1(5−1)=2⋅1⋅1⋅4=8.φ(20)=φ(2^25^1)=2^2-1(2-1) 5^1-1(5-1)=2·1·1·4=8. Fourier
