conjecture: Main article: Lehmer's totient problem If p is prime, then φ(p) = p − 1. In 1932 D. H. Lehmer asked if there are any composite numbers n such that φ(n) divides n − 1. None are known.[53] In 1933 he proved that if any such n exists, it must be odd, square-free, and divisible by at least seven primes (i.e. ω(n) ≥ 7). In 1980 Cohen and Hagis proved that n > 1020 and that ω(n) ≥ 14.[54] Further, Hagis showed that if 3 divides n then n > 101937042 and ω(n) ≥ 298848.[55][56] Carmichael's
