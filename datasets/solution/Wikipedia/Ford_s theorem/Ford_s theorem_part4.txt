formula: It states φ(n)=n∏p∣n(1−1p),φ(n)=n∏_p(1-1/p), where the product is over the distinct prime numbers dividing n. (For notation, see Arithmetical function.) An equivalent formulation is φ(n)=p1k1−1(p1−1)p2k2−1(p2−1)⋯prkr−1(pr−1),φ(n)=p_1^k_1-1(p_1-1) p_2^k_2-1(p_2-1)_r^k_r-1(p_r-1), where n=p1k1p2k2⋯prkr=p_1^k_1p_2^k_2_r^k_r is the prime factorization of n (that is, p1,p2,…,pr_1,p_2,…,p_r are distinct prime numbers). The proof of these formulae depends on two important facts. Phi is a multiplicative
