argument: If p is prime and k ≥ 1, then φ(pk)=pk−pk−1=pk−1(p−1)=pk(1−1p).φ(p^k)=p^k-p^k-1=p^k-1(p-1)=p^k(1-1p). Proof: Since p is a prime number, the only possible values of gcd(pk, m) are 1, p, p2, ..., pk, and the only way to have gcd(pk, m) > 1 is if m is a multiple of p, that is, m ∈ {p, 2p, 3p, ..., pk − 1p = pk}, and there are pk − 1 such multiples not greater than pk. Therefore, the other pk − pk − 1 numbers are all relatively prime to pk. Proof of Euler's product
