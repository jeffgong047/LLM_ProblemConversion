Non algebraically closed field whose extension by sqrt(–1) is algebraically closed "Artin–Schreier theorem" redirects here. For the branch of Galois theory, see Artin–Schreier theory. In mathematics, a real closed field is a field F that has the same first-order properties as the field of real numbers. Some examples are the field of real numbers, the field of real algebraic numbers, and the field of hyperreal numbers.
