ùòõrcf: Tarski's original algorithm for quantifier elimination has nonelementary computational complexity, meaning that no tower 22‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖn2^2^¬∑^¬∑^¬∑^n can bound the execution time of the algorithm if n is the size of the input formula. The cylindrical algebraic decomposition, introduced by George E. Collins, provides a much more practicable algorithm of complexity d2O(n)^2^O(n) where n is the total number of variables (free and bound), d is the product of the degrees of the polynomials occurring in the formula, and O(n) is big O notation. Davenport and Heintz (1988) proved that this worst-case complexity is nearly optimal for quantifier elimination by producing a family Œ¶n of formulas of length O(n), with n quantifiers, and involving polynomials of constant degree, such that any quantifier-free formula equivalent to Œ¶n must involve polynomials of degree 22Œ©(n)2^2^Œ©(n) and length 22Œ©(n),2^2^Œ©(n), where Œ©(n)Œ©(n) is big Omega notation. This shows that both the time complexity and the space complexity of quantifier elimination are intrinsically double exponential. For the decision problem, Ben-Or, Kozen, and Reif (1986) claimed to have proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable in exponential space, and therefore in double exponential time, but their argument (in the case of more than one variable) is generally held as flawed; see Renegar (1992) for a discussion. For purely existential formulas, that is for formulas of the form ‚àÉx1, ..., ‚àÉxk P1(x1, ..., xk) ‚ãà 0 ‚àß ... ‚àß Ps(x1, ..., xk) ‚ãà 0, where ‚ãà stands for either <, > or =, the complexity is lower. Basu and Roy (1996) provided a well-behaved algorithm to decide the truth of such an existential formula with complexity of sk+1dO(k) arithmetic operations and polynomial space. Order
