hypothesis: The characteristics of real closed fields become much simpler if we are willing to assume the generalized continuum hypothesis. If the continuum hypothesis holds, all real closed fields with cardinality of the continuum and having the Œ∑1 property are order isomorphic. This unique field œú can be defined by means of an ultrapower, as RN/M‚Ñù^‚Ñï/ùêå, where M is a maximal ideal not leading to a field order-isomorphic to R‚Ñù. This is the most commonly used hyperreal number field in nonstandard analysis, and its uniqueness is equivalent to the continuum hypothesis. (Even without the continuum hypothesis we have that if the cardinality of the continuum is ‚ÑµŒ≤‚Ñµ_Œ≤ then we have a unique Œ∑Œ≤ field of size ‚ÑµŒ≤‚Ñµ_Œ≤.) Moreover, we do not need ultrapowers to construct œú, we can do so much more constructively as the subfield of series with a countable number of nonzero terms of the field R[[G]]‚Ñù[[G]] of formal power series on a totally ordered abelian divisible group G that is an Œ∑1 group of cardinality ‚Ñµ1‚Ñµ_1 (Alling 1962). œú however is not a complete field; if we take its completion, we end up with a field Œö of larger cardinality. œú has the cardinality of the continuum, which by hypothesis is ‚Ñµ1‚Ñµ_1, Œö has cardinality ‚Ñµ2‚Ñµ_2, and contains œú as a dense subfield. It is not an ultrapower but it is a hyperreal field, and hence a suitable field for the usages of nonstandard analysis. It can be seen to be the higher-dimensional analogue of the real numbers; with cardinality ‚Ñµ2‚Ñµ_2 instead of ‚Ñµ1‚Ñµ_1, cofinality ‚Ñµ1‚Ñµ_1 instead of ‚Ñµ0‚Ñµ_0, and weight ‚Ñµ1‚Ñµ_1 instead of ‚Ñµ0‚Ñµ_0, and with the Œ∑1 property in place of the Œ∑0 property (which merely means between any two real numbers we can find another).
