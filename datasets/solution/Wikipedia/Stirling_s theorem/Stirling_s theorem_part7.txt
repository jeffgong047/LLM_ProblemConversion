function: For all positive integers, n!=Γ(n+1),!=Γ(n+1), where Γ denotes the gamma function. However, the gamma function, unlike the factorial, is more broadly defined for all complex numbers other than non-positive integers; nevertheless, Stirling's formula may still be applied. If Re(z) > 0, then ln⁡Γ(z)=zln⁡z−z+12ln⁡2πz+∫0∞2arctan⁡(tz)e2πt−1dt.lnΓ(z)=z-z+12ln2π/z+∫_0^∞2arctan(t/z)/e^2-1 dt. Repeated integration by parts gives ln⁡Γ(z)∼zln⁡z−z+12ln⁡2πz+∑n=1N−1B2n2n(2n−1)z2n−1,lnΓ(z)-z+12ln2π/z+∑_n=1^N-1B_2n/2n(2n-1)z^2n-1, where Bn_n is the nth Bernoulli number (note that the limit of the sum as N→∞→∞ is not convergent, so this formula is just an asymptotic expansion). The formula is valid for z large enough in absolute value, when |arg(z)| < π − ε, where ε is positive, with an error term of O(z−2N+ 1). The corresponding approximation may now be written: Γ(z)=2πz(ze)z(1+O(1z)).Γ(z)=√(2π/z) (z/e)^z(1+O(1/z)). where the expansion is identical to that of Stirling's series above for n!!, except that n is replaced with z − 1.[9] A further application of this asymptotic expansion is for complex argument z with constant Re(z). See for example the Stirling formula applied in Im(z) = t of the Riemann–Siegel theta function on the straight line 1/4 + it. Error
