calculators: The approximation Γ(z)≈2πz(zezsinh⁡1z+1810z6)zΓ(z)≈√(2π/z)(z/e√(zsinh1/z+1/810z^6))^z and its equivalent form 2ln⁡Γ(z)≈ln⁡(2π)−ln⁡z+z(2ln⁡z+ln⁡(zsinh⁡1z+1810z6)−2)2lnΓ(z)≈ln(2π)-+z(2+ln(zsinh1/z+1/810z^6)-2) can be obtained by rearranging Stirling's extended formula and observing a coincidence between the resultant power series and the Taylor series expansion of the hyperbolic sine function. This approximation is good to more than 8 decimal digits for z with a real part greater than 8. Robert H. Windschitl suggested it in 2002 for computing the gamma function with fair accuracy on calculators with limited program or register memory.[14] Gergő Nemes proposed in 2007 an approximation which gives the same number of exact digits as the Windschitl approximation but is much simpler:[15] Γ(z)≈2πz(1e(z+112z−110z))z,Γ(z)≈√(2π/z)(1/e(z+1/12z-1/10z))^z, or equivalently, ln⁡Γ(z)≈12(ln⁡(2π)−ln⁡z)+z(ln⁡(z+112z−110z)−1).lnΓ(z)≈12(ln(2π)-)+z(ln(z+1/12z-1/10z)-1). An alternative approximation for the gamma function stated by Srinivasa Ramanujan (Ramanujan 1988[clarification needed]) is Γ(1+x)≈π(xe)x(8x3+4x2+x+130)16Γ(1+x)≈√(π)(x/e)^x(8x^3+4x^2+x+1/30)^1/6 for x ≥ 0. The equivalent approximation for ln n! has an asymptotic error of 1/1400n3 and is given by ln⁡n!≈nln⁡n−n+16ln⁡(8n3+4n2+n+130)+12ln⁡π.!-n+16ln(8n^3+4n^2+n+130)+12lnπ. The approximation may be made precise by giving paired upper and lower bounds; one such inequality is[16][17][18][19] π(xe)x(8x3+4x2+x+1100)1/6<Γ(1+x)<π(xe)x(8x3+4x2+x+130)1/6.√(π)(x/e)^x(8x^3+4x^2+x+1/100)^1/6<Γ(1+x)<√(π)(x/e)^x(8x^3+4x^2+x+1/30)^1/6.
