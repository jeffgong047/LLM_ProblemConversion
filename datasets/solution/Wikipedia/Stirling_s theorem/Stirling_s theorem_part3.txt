derivations: An alternative formula for n!! using the gamma function is n!=∫0∞xne−xdx.!=∫_0^∞x^ne^-x dx. (as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables x = ny, one obtains n!=∫0∞enln⁡x−xdx=enln⁡nn∫0∞en(ln⁡y−y)dy.!=∫_0^∞e^n-x dx=e^nn∫_0^∞e^n(-y) dy. Applying Laplace's method one has ∫0∞en(ln⁡y−y)dy∼2πne−n,∫_0^∞e^n(-y) dy∼√(2π/n)e^-n, which recovers Stirling's formula: n!∼enln⁡nn2πne−n=2πn(ne)n.!^nn√(2π/n)e^-n=√(2)(n/e)^n. Higher
