estimates: The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. n, for 0 to 5 terms. The kinks in the curves represent points where the truncated series coincides with Γ(n + 1). Stirling's formula is in fact the first approximation to the following series (now called the Stirling series):[5] n!∼2πn(ne)n(1+112n+1288n2−13951840n3−5712488320n4+⋯).!∼√(2)(n/e)^n(1+1/12n+1/288n^2-139/51840n^3-571/2488320n^4+⋯). An explicit formula for the coefficients in this series was given by G. Nemes.[6] Further terms are listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A001163 and A001164. The first graph in this section shows the relative error vs. n, for 1 through all 5 terms listed above. (Bender and Orszag[7] p. 218) gives the asymptotic formula for the coefficients:A2j+1∼(−1)j2(2j)!/(2π)2(j+1)_2j+1∼(-1)^j2(2j)!/(2π)^2(j+1)which shows that it grows superexponentially, and that by ratio test the radius of convergence is zero. The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. the number of terms used As n → ∞, the error in the truncated series is asymptotically equal to the first omitted term. This is an example of an asymptotic expansion. It is not a convergent series; for any particular value of n there are only so many terms of the series that improve accuracy, after which accuracy worsens. This is shown in the next graph, which shows the relative error versus the number of terms in the series, for larger numbers of terms. More precisely, let S(n, t) be the Stirling series to t terms evaluated at n. The graphs show |ln⁡(S(n,t)n!)|,|ln(S(n,t)/n!)|, which, when small, is essentially the relative error. Writing Stirling's series in the form ln⁡(n!)∼nln⁡n−n+12ln⁡(2πn)+112n−1360n3+11260n5−11680n7+⋯,ln(n!)-n+12ln(2)+1/12n-1/360n^3+1/1260n^5-1/1680n^7+⋯, it is known that the error in truncating the series is always of the opposite sign and at most the same magnitude as the first omitted term. More precise bounds, due to Robbins,[8] valid for all positive integers n are 2πn(ne)ne112n+1<n!<2πn(ne)ne112n.√(2)(n/e)^ne^1/12n+1<n!<√(2)(n/e)^ne^1/12n. A looser version of this bound is that n!ennn+12∈(2π,e]n!e^n/n^n+1/2∈(√(2π),e] for all n≥1≥1. Stirling's formula for the gamma
