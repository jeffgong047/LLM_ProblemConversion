orders: In fact, further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace's method. From previous result, we know that Γ(x)∼xxe−xΓ(x)^xe^-x, so we "peel off" this dominant term, then perform a change of variables, to obtain:x−xexΓ(x)=∫Rex(1+t−et)dt^-xe^xΓ(x)=∫_ℝe^x(1+t-e^t)dtNow the function t↦1+t−et↦1+t-e^t is unimodal, with maximum value zero. Locally around zero, it looks like −t2/2-t^2/2, which is why we are able to perform Laplace's method. In order to extend Laplace's method to higher orders, we perform another change of variables by 1+t−et=−τ2/21+t-e^t=-τ^2/2. This equation cannot be solved in closed form, but it can be solved by serial expansion, which gives us t=τ−τ2/6+τ3/36+a4τ4+O(τ5)=τ-τ^2/6+τ^3/36+a_4τ^4+O(τ^5). Now plug back to the equation to obtainx−xexΓ(x)=∫Re−xτ2/2(1−τ/3+τ2/12+4a4τ3+O(τ4))dτ=2π(x−1/2+x−3/2/12)+O(x−5/2)^-xe^xΓ(x)=∫_ℝe^-xτ^2/2(1-τ/3+τ^2/12+4a_4τ^3+O(τ^4))dτ=√(2π)(x^-1/2+x^-3/2/12)+O(x^-5/2)notice how we don't need to actually find a4_4, since it is cancelled out by the integral. Higher orders can be achieved by computing more terms in t=τ+⋯=τ+⋯. Thus we get Stirling's formula to two orders: n!=2πn(ne)n(1+112n+O(1n2)).!=√(2)(n/e)^n(1+1/12n+O(1/n^2)). Complex-analytic
