Approximation for factorials Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial In mathematics, Stirling's approximation (or Stirling's formula) is an approximation for factorials. It is a good approximation, leading to accurate results even for small values of n. It is named after James Stirling, though a related but less precise result was first stated by Abraham de Moivre.[1][2][3] One way of stating the approximation involves the logarithm of the factorial: ln⁡(n!)=nln⁡n−n+O(ln⁡n),ln(n!)=n-n+O(), where the big O notation means that, for all sufficiently large values of n, the difference between ln⁡(n!)ln(n!) and nln⁡n−n-n will be at most proportional to the logarithm. In computer science applications such as the worst-case lower bound for comparison sorting, it is convenient to instead use the binary logarithm, giving the equivalent form log2⁡(n!)=nlog2⁡n−nlog2⁡e+O(log2⁡n).log_2(n!)=nlog_2n-nlog_2e+O(log_2n). The error term in either base can be expressed more precisely as 12log⁡(2πn)+O(1n)12log(2)+O(1n), corresponding to an approximate formula for the factorial itself, n!∼2πn(ne)n.!∼√(2)(n/e)^n. Here the sign ∼∼ means that the two quantities are asymptotic, that is, that their ratio tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. The following version of the bound holds for all n≥1≥1, rather than only asymptotically: 2πn(ne)ne112n+1<n!<2πn(ne)ne112n.√(2) left(n/e)^ne^1/12n+1<n!<√(2) left(n/e)^ne^1/12n.
