History: The formula was first discovered by Abraham de Moivre[2] in the form n!∼[constant]⋅nn+12e−n.!∼[constant]^n+1/2e^-n. De Moivre gave an approximate rational-number expression for the natural logarithm of the constant. Stirling's contribution consisted of showing that the constant is precisely 2π√(2π).[3] See
