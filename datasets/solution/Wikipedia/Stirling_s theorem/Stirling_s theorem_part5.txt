version: A complex-analysis version of this method[4] is to consider 1n!1/n! as a Taylor coefficient of the exponential function ez=∑n=0∞znn!^z=∑_n=0^∞z^n/n!, computed by Cauchy's integral formula as 1n!=12πi∮|z|=rezzn+1dz.1/n!=1/2∮_|z|=re^z/z^n+1 dz. This line integral can then be approximated using the saddle-point method with an appropriate choice of contour radius r=rn=r_n. The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.
