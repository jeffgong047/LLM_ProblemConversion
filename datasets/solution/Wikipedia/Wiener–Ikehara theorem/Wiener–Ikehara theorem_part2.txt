Statement: Let A(x) be a non-negative, monotonic nondecreasing function of x, defined for 0 ≤ x < ∞. Suppose that f(s)=∫0∞A(x)e−xsdx(s)=∫_0^∞A(x)e^-xs dx converges for ℜ(s) > 1 to the function ƒ(s) and that, for some non-negative number c, f(s)−cs−1(s)-c/s-1 has an extension as a continuous function for ℜ(s) ≥ 1. Then the limit as x goes to infinity of e−x A(x) is equal to c. One Particular
