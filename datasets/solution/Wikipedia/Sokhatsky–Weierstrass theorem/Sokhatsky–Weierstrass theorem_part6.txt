function: In theoretical quantum optics, the derivation of a master equation in Lindblad form often requires the following integral function,[1] which is a direct consequence of the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem and is often called the Heitler-function: ∫0∞dτexp⁡(−i(ω±ν)τ)=πδ(ω±ν)−iP(1ω±ν)∫_0^∞dτ exp(-i(ω±ν)τ)=πδ(ω±ν)-i𝒫(1/ω±ν) See
