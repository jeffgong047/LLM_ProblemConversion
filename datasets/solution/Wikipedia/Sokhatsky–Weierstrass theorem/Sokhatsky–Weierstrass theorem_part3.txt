line: See also: Kramers–Kronig relations Especially important is the version for integrals over the real line. limε→0+1x±iε=∓iπδ(x)+P(1x).lim_ε→0^+1/xε=πδ(x)+𝒫(1/x). where δ(x)δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. This should be interpreted as an integral equality, as follows. Let f be a complex-valued function which is defined and continuous on the real line, and let a and b be real constants with a<0<b<0<b. Then limε→0+∫abf(x)x±iεdx=∓iπf(0)+P∫abf(x)xdx,lim_ε→0^+∫_a^bf(x)/xε dx=(0)+𝒫∫_a^bf(x)/x dx, where P𝒫 denotes the Cauchy principal value. (Note that this version makes no use of analyticity.)
