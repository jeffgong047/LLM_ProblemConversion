theorem: Let C be a smooth closed simple curve in the plane, and φφ an analytic function on C. Note that the Cauchy-type integral ϕ(z)=12πi∫Cφ(ζ)dζζ−z,ϕ(z)=1/2∫_Cφ(ζ) dζ/ζ-z, cannot be evaluated for any z on the curve C. However, on the interior and exterior of the curve, the integral produces analytic functions, which will be denoted ϕiϕ_i inside C and ϕeϕ_e outside. The Sokhotski–Plemelj formulas relate the limiting boundary values of these two analytic functions at a point z on C and the Cauchy principal value P𝒫 of the integral: limw→zϕi(w)=12πiP∫Cφ(ζ)dζζ−z+12φ(z),lim_wϕ_i(w)=1/2𝒫∫_Cφ(ζ) dζ/ζ-z+1/2φ(z), limw→zϕe(w)=12πiP∫Cφ(ζ)dζζ−z−12φ(z).lim_wϕ_e(w)=1/2𝒫∫_Cφ(ζ) dζ/ζ-z-1/2φ(z). Subsequent generalizations relax the smoothness requirements on curve C and the function φ. Version for the real
