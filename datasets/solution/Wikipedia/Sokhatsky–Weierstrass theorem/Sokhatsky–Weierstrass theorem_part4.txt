version: A simple proof is as follows. limε→0+∫abf(x)x±iεdx=∓iπlimε→0+∫abεπ(x2+ε2)f(x)dx+limε→0+∫abx2x2+ε2f(x)xdx.lim_ε→0^+∫_a^bf(x)/xε dx=πlim_ε→0^+∫_a^bε/π(x^2+ε^2)f(x) dx+lim_ε→0^+∫_a^bx^2/x^2+ε^2 f(x)/x dx. For the first term, we note that ε⁄π(x2 + ε2) is a nascent delta function, and therefore approaches a Dirac delta function in the limit. Therefore, the first term equals ∓iπ f(0). For the second term, we note that the factor x2⁄(x2 + ε2) approaches 1 for |x| ≫ ε, approaches 0 for |x| ≪ ε, and is exactly symmetric about 0. Therefore, in the limit, it turns the integral into a Cauchy principal value integral. Physics
