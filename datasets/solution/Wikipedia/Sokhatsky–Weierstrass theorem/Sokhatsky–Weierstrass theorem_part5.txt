application: In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, one often has to evaluate integrals of the form ∫−∞∞dE∫0∞dtf(E)exp⁡(−iEt)∫_-∞^∞dE ∫_0^∞dt f(E)exp(-iEt) where E is some energy and t is time. This expression, as written, is undefined (since the time integral does not converge), so it is typically modified by adding a negative real term to -iEt in the exponential, and then taking that to zero, i.e.: limε→0+∫−∞∞dE∫0∞dtf(E)exp⁡(−iEt−εt)=−ilimε→0+∫−∞∞f(E)E−iεdE=πf(0)−iP∫−∞∞f(E)EdE,lim_ε→0^+∫_-∞^∞dE ∫_0^∞dt f(E)exp(-iEt-)=-ilim_ε→0^+∫_-∞^∞f(E)/E-iε dE=(0)-i𝒫∫_-∞^∞f(E)/E dE, where the latter step uses the real version of the theorem.
