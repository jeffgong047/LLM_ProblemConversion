In mathematics, Minkowski's second theorem is a result in the geometry of numbers about the values taken by a norm on a lattice and the volume of its fundamental cell.


Setting[edit]
Let K be a closed convex centrally symmetric body of positive finite volume in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn.  The gauge[1] or distance[2][3] Minkowski functional g attached to K is defined by
g(x)=infλ∈R:x∈λK.(x)=inf{λ∈ℝ:x∈}.
Conversely, given a norm g on Rn we define K to be
K=x∈Rn:g(x)≤1.={x∈ℝ^n:g(x)≤1}.
Let Γ be a lattice in Rn.  The successive minima of K or g on Γ are defined by setting the k-th successive minimum λk to be the infimum of the numbers  λ such that λK contains k linearly-independent vectors of Γ.  We have 0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λn < ∞.

Statement[edit]
The successive minima satisfy[4][5][6]
2nn!vol⁡(Rn/Γ)≤λ1λ2⋯λnvol⁡(K)≤2nvol⁡(Rn/Γ).2^n/n!vol(ℝ^n/Γ)≤λ_1λ_2⋯λ_nvol(K)≤2^nvol(ℝ^n/Γ).

Proof[edit]
A basis of linearly independent lattice vectors  b1, b2, ..., bn can be defined by g(bj) = λj.
The lower bound is proved by considering the convex polytope 2n with vertices at ±bj/ λj, which has an interior enclosed by K and a volume which is 2n/n!λ1 λ2...λn times an integer multiple of a primitive cell of the lattice (as seen by scaling the polytope by λj  along each basis vector to obtain 2n n-simplices with lattice point vectors).
To prove the upper bound, consider functions fj(x) sending points x in K to the centroid of the subset of points in K that can be written as x+∑i=1j−1aibi+∑_i=1^j-1a_ib_i for some real numbers ai_i. Then the coordinate transform x′=h(x)=∑i=1n(λi−λi−1)fi(x)/2'=h(x)=∑_i=1^n(λ_i-λ_i-1)f_i(x)/2 has a Jacobian determinant J=λ1λ2…λn/2n=λ_1λ_2…λ_n/2^n. If p and q are in the interior of  K and p−q=∑i=1kaibi-q=∑_i=1^ka_ib_i(with ak≠0_k≠0) then (h(p)−h(q))=∑i=0kcibi∈λkK(h(p)-h(q))=∑_i=0^kc_ib_i∈λ_kK with ck=λkak/2_k=λ_ka_k/2, where the inclusion in λkKλ_kK (specifically the interior of λkKλ_kK) is due to convexity and symmetry. But lattice points in the interior  of λkKλ_kK are, by definition of λkλ_k, always expressible as a linear combination of b1,b2,…bk−1_1,b_2,_k-1, so any two distinct points of K′=h(K)=x′∣h(x)=x′'=h(K)={x'(x)=x'} cannot be separated by a lattice vector. Therefore, K′' must be enclosed in a primitive cell of the lattice (which has volume vol⁡(Rn/Γ)vol(ℝ^n/Γ)), and consequently vol⁡(K)/J=vol⁡(K′)≤vol⁡(Rn/Γ)vol(K)/J=vol(K')≤vol(ℝ^n/Γ).
