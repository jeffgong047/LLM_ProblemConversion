Setting: Let K be a closed convex centrally symmetric body of positive finite volume in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. The gauge[1] or distance[2][3] Minkowski functional g attached to K is defined by g(x)=infλ∈R:x∈λK.(x)=inf{λ∈ℝ:x∈}. Conversely, given a norm g on Rn we define K to be K=x∈Rn:g(x)≤1.={x∈ℝ^n:g(x)≤1}. Let Γ be a lattice in Rn. The successive minima of K or g on Γ are defined by setting the k-th successive minimum λk to be the infimum of the numbers λ such that λK contains k linearly-independent vectors of Γ. We have 0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λn < ∞.
