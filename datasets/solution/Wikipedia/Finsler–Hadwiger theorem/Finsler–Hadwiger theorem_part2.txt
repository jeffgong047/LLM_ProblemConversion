Statement: To state the theorem, suppose that ABCD and AB'C'D' are two squares with common vertex A. Let E and G be the midpoints of B'D and D'B respectively, and let F and H be the centers of the two squares. Then the theorem states that the quadrilateral EFGH is a square as well.[2] The square EFGH is called the Finslerâ€“Hadwiger square of the two given squares.[3]
