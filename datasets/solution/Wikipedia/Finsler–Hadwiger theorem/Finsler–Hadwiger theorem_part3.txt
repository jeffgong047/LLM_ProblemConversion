Application: Repeated application of the Finsler–Hadwiger theorem can be used to prove Van Aubel's theorem, on the congruence and perpendicularity of segments through centers of four squares constructed on the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral. Each pair of consecutive squares forms an instance of the theorem, and the two pairs of opposite Finsler–Hadwiger squares of those instances form another two instances of the theorem, having the same derived square.[4]
