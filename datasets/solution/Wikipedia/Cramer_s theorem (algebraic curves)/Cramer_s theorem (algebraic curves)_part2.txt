formula: The number of distinct terms (including those with a zero coefficient) in an n-th degree equation in two variables is (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2. This is because the n-th degree terms are xn,xn−1y1,…,yn,^n, x^n-1y^1, …, y^n, numbering n + 1 in total; the (n − 1) degree terms are xn−1,xn−2y1,…,yn−1,^n-1, x^n-2y^1, …, y^n-1, numbering n in total; and so on through the first degree terms x and y,, numbering 2 in total, and the single zero degree term (the constant). The sum of these is (n + 1) + n + (n – 1) + ... + 2 + 1 = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2 terms, each with its own coefficient. However, one of these coefficients is redundant in determining the curve, because we can always divide through the polynomial equation by any one of the coefficients, giving an equivalent equation with one coefficient fixed at 1, and thus [(n + 1)(n + 2) / 2] − 1 = n(n + 3) / 2 remaining coefficients. For example, a fourth degree equation has the general form x4+c1x3y+c2x2y2+c3xy3+c4y4+c5x3+c6x2y+c7xy2+c8y3+c9x2+c10xy+c11y2+c12x+c13y+c14=0,^4+c_1x^3y+c_2x^2y^2+c_3xy^3+c_4y^4+c_5x^3+c_6x^2y+c_7xy^2+c_8y^3+c_9x^2+c_10xy+c_11y^2+c_12x+c_13y+c_14=0, with 4(4+3)/2 = 14 coefficients. Determining an algebraic curve through a set of points consists of determining values for these coefficients in the algebraic equation such that each of the points satisfies the equation. Given n(n + 3) / 2 points (xi, yi), each of these points can be used to create a separate equation by substituting it into the general polynomial equation of degree n, giving n(n + 3) / 2 equations linear in the n(n + 3) / 2 unknown coefficients. If this system is non-degenerate in the sense of having a non-zero determinant, the unknown coefficients are uniquely determined and hence the polynomial equation and its curve are uniquely determined. More than this number of points would be redundant, and fewer would be insufficient to solve the system of equations uniquely for the coefficients. Degenerate
