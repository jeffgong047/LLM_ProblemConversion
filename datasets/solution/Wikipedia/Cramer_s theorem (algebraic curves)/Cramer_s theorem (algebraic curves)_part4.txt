cases: If the curve is required to be in a particular sub-category of n-th degree polynomial equations, then fewer than n(n + 3) / 2 points may be necessary and sufficient to determine a unique curve. For example, three (non-collinear) points determine a circle: the generic circle is given by the equation (x−a)2+(y−b)2=r2(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2 where the center is located at (a, b) and the radius is r. Equivalently, by expanding the squared terms, the generic equation is x2−2ax+y2−2by=k,^2-2ax+y^2-2by=k, where k=r2−a2−b2.=r^2-a^2-b^2. Two restrictions have been imposed here compared to the general conic case of n = 2: the coefficient of the term in xy is restricted to equal 0, and the coefficient of y2 is restricted to equal the coefficient of x2. Thus instead of five points being needed, only 5 – 2 = 3 are needed, coinciding with the 3 parameters a, b, k (equivalently a, b, r) that need to be identified. See
