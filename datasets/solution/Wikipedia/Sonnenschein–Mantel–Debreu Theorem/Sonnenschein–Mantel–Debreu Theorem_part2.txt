statement: There are several possible versions of the theorem that differ in detailed bounds and assumptions. The following version is formulated in the Arrow–Debreu model of economy.[12] For the notation, see the Arrow–Debreu model page. Theorem — Let N be a positive integer. If Z:p∈RN:∑npn=1,∀n,pn>0→RN:{p∈ℝ_N:∑_np_n=1,,p_n>0}→ℝ^N is a continuous function that satisfies Walras's law, then there exists an economy with households indexed by I, with no producers ("pure exchange economy"), and household endowments rii∈I{r^i}_i such that each household satisfies all assumptions in the "Assumptions" section, and Z is the excess demand function for the economy. Similarly, changing Z to a set-valued, closed graph function, we obtain another Theorem — Let N be a positive integer. If Z:p∈RN:∑npn=1,∀n,pn>0→RN:{p∈ℝ_N:∑_np_n=1,,p_n>0}→ℝ^N is a set-valued function with closed graph that satisfies Walras's law, then there exists an economy with households indexed by I, with no producers ("pure exchange economy"), and household endowments rii∈I{r^i}_i such that each household satisfies all assumptions in the "Assumptions" section except the "strict convexity" assumption, and Z is the excess demand function for the economy.
