torus: A manifold Td𝒯^d invariant under the action of a flow ϕtϕ^t is called an invariant d-torus, if there exists a diffeomorphism φ:Td→Tdφ:𝒯^d→𝕋^d into the standard d-torus Td:=S1×S1×⋯×S1⏟d𝕋^d:=𝕊^1×𝕊^1×⋯×𝕊^1_d such that the resulting motion on Td𝕋^d is uniform linear but not static, i.e. dφ/dt=ωdφ/dt=ω，where ω∈Rdω∈ℝ^d is a non-zero constant vector, called the frequency vector. If the frequency vector ωω is: rationally independent (a.k.a. incommensurable, that is k⋅ω≠0k·ω≠0 for all k∈Zd∖0k∈ℤ^d\{0}) and "badly" approximated by rationals, typically in a Diophantine sense: ∃γ,τ>0suchthat|ω⋅k|≥γ‖k‖τ,∀k∈Zd∖0∃ γ,τ>0suchthat|ω·k|≥γ/k^τ,∀ k∈ℤ^d\{0}, then the invariant d-torus Td𝒯^d (d≥2≥2) is called a KAM torus. The d=1=1 case is normally excluded in classical KAM theory because it does not involve small divisors. See
