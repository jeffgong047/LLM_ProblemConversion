summands: Let X1, X2, ..., be independent random variables with E(Xi) = 0, E(Xi2) = σi2 > 0, and E(|Xi|3) = ρi < ∞. Also, let Sn=X1+X2+⋯+Xnσ12+σ22+⋯+σn2_n=X_1+X_2+⋯+X_n√(σ_1^2+σ_2^2+⋯+σ_n^2) be the normalized n-th partial sum. Denote Fn the cdf of Sn, and Φ the cdf of the standard normal distribution. For the sake of convenience denote σ→=(σ1,…,σn),ρ→=(ρ1,…,ρn).σ⃗=(σ_1,…,σ_n),{ρ⃗=(ρ_1,…,ρ_n). In 1941, Andrew C. Berry proved that for all n there exists an absolute constant C1 such that supx∈R|Fn(x)−Φ(x)|≤C1⋅ψ1,(2)sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-Φ(x)|_1·ψ_1, (2) where ψ1=ψ1(σ→,ρ→)=(∑i=1nσi2)−1/2⋅max1≤i≤nρiσi2.ψ_1=ψ_1(σ⃗,ρ⃗)=(∑_i=1^nσ_i^2)^-1/2·max_1ρ_i/σ_i^2. Independently, in 1942, Carl-Gustav Esseen proved that for all n there exists an absolute constant C0 such that supx∈R|Fn(x)−Φ(x)|≤C0⋅ψ0,(3)sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-Φ(x)|_0·ψ_0, (3) where ψ0=ψ0(σ→,ρ→)=(∑i=1nσi2)−3/2⋅∑i=1nρi.ψ_0=ψ_0(σ⃗,ρ⃗)=(∑_i=1^nσ_i^2)^-3/2·∑_i=1^nρ_i. It is easy to make sure that ψ0≤ψ1. Due to this circumstance inequality (3) is conventionally called the Berry–Esseen inequality, and the quantity ψ0 is called the Lyapunov fraction of the third order. Moreover, in the case where the summands X1, ..., Xn have identical distributions ψ0=ψ1=ρ1σ13n,ψ_0=ψ_1=ρ_1/σ_1^3√(n), and thus the bounds stated by inequalities (1), (2) and (3) coincide apart from the constant. Regarding C0, obviously, the lower bound established by Esseen (1956) remains valid: C0≥10+362π=0.4097…._0≥√(10)+3/6√(2π)=0.4097…. The upper bounds for C0 were subsequently lowered from the original estimate 7.59 due to Esseen (1942) to (considering recent results only) 0.9051 due to Zolotarev (1967), 0.7975 due to van Beek (1972), 0.7915 due to Shiganov (1986), 0.6379 and 0.5606 due to Tyurin (2009) and Tyurin (2010). As of 2011[update] the best estimate is 0.5600 obtained by Shevtsova (2010). Multidimensional
