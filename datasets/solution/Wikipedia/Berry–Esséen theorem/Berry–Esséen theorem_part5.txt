version: As with the multidimensional central limit theorem, there is a multidimensional version of the Berry–Esseen theorem.[1][2] Let X1,…,Xn_1,…,X_n be independent Rdℝ^d-valued random vectors each having mean zero. Write Sn=∑i=1nXin_n=∑_i=1^nX_i/√(n) and assume Σn=Cov⁡[Sn]Σ_n=Cov[S_n] is invertible. Let Zn∼N⁡(0,Σ)_n∼N(0,Σ) be a d-dimensional Gaussian with the same mean and covariance matrix as Sn_n. Then for all convex sets U⊆Rd⊆ℝ^d, |Pr[Sn∈U]−Pr[Zn∈U]|≤Cd1/4γn|[S_n]-[Z_n] |^1/4γ_n, where C is a universal constant and γn=∑i=1nE⁡[‖Σn−1/2Xi‖23]γ_n=∑_i=1^nE[Σ_n^-1/2X_i_2^3] (the third power of the L2 norm). The dependency on d1/4^1/4 is conjectured to be optimal, but might not be.[2] See
