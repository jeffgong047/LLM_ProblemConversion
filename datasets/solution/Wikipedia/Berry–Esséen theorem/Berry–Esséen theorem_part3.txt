summands: One version, sacrificing generality somewhat for the sake of clarity, is the following: There exists a positive constant C such that if X1, X2, ..., are i.i.d. random variables with E(X1) = 0, E(X12) = σ2 > 0, and E(|X1|3) = ρ < ∞,[note 1] and if we define Yn=X1+X2+⋯+Xnn_n=X_1+X_2+⋯+X_n the sample mean, with Fn the cumulative distribution function of Ynnσ,Y_n√(n)σ, and Φ the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, then for all x and n, |Fn(x)−Φ(x)|≤Cρσ3n.(1)|F_n(x)-Φ(x)|≤Cρσ^3√(n). (1) Illustration of the difference in cumulative distribution functions alluded to in the theorem. That is: given a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having mean zero and positive variance, if additionally the third absolute moment is finite, then the cumulative distribution functions of the standardized sample mean and the standard normal distribution differ (vertically, on a graph) by no more than the specified amount. Note that the approximation error for all n (and hence the limiting rate of convergence for indefinite n sufficiently large) is bounded by the order of n−1/2. Calculated values of the constant C have decreased markedly over the years, from the original value of 7.59 by Esseen (1942), to 0.7882 by van Beek (1972), then 0.7655 by Shiganov (1986), then 0.7056 by Shevtsova (2007), then 0.7005 by Shevtsova (2008), then 0.5894 by Tyurin (2009), then 0.5129 by Korolev & Shevtsova (2010a), then 0.4785 by Tyurin (2010). The detailed review can be found in the papers Korolev & Shevtsova (2010a) and Korolev & Shevtsova (2010b). The best estimate as of 2012[update], C < 0.4748, follows from the inequality supx∈R|Fn(x)−Φ(x)|≤0.33554(ρ+0.415σ3)σ3n,sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-Φ(x)|≤0.33554(ρ+0.415σ^3)σ^3√(n), due to Shevtsova (2011), since σ3 ≤ ρ and 0.33554 · 1.415 < 0.4748. However, if ρ ≥ 1.286σ3, then the estimate supx∈R|Fn(x)−Φ(x)|≤0.3328(ρ+0.429σ3)σ3n,sup_x∈ℝ|F_n(x)-Φ(x)|≤0.3328(ρ+0.429σ^3)σ^3√(n), which is also proved in Shevtsova (2011), gives an even tighter upper estimate. Esseen (1956) proved that the constant also satisfies the lower bound C≥10+362π≈0.40973≈12π+0.01079.≥√(10)+3/6√(2π)≈0.40973≈1/√(2π)+0.01079. Non-identically distributed
