Definition: Let (X, d) be a metric space and let Cl(X) denote the collection of all d-closed subsets of X. For a point x ∈ X and a set A ∈ Cl(X), set d(x,A)=infa∈Ad(x,a).(x,A)=inf_ad(x,a). A sequence (or net) of sets Ai ∈ Cl(X) is said to be Wijsman convergent to A ∈ Cl(X) if, for each x ∈ X, d(x,Ai)→d(x,A).(x,A_i)(x,A). Wijsman convergence induces a topology on Cl(X), known as the Wijsman topology.
