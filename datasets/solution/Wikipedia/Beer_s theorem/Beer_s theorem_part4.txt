Properties: The Wijsman topology depends very strongly on the metric d. Even if two metrics are uniformly equivalent, they may generate different Wijsman topologies. Beer's theorem: if (X, d) is a complete, separable metric space, then Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is a Polish space, i.e. it is separable and metrizable with a complete metric. Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is always a Tychonoff space. Moreover, one has the Levi-Lechicki theorem: (X, d) is separable if and only if Cl(X) is either metrizable, first-countable or second-countable. If the pointwise convergence of Wijsman convergence is replaced by uniform convergence (uniformly in x), then one obtains Hausdorff convergence, where the Hausdorff metric is given by dH(A,B)=supx∈X|d(x,A)−d(x,B)|._H(A,B)=sup_x|d(x,A)-d(x,B)|. The Hausdorff and Wijsman topologies on Cl(X) coincide if and only if (X, d) is a totally bounded space. See
