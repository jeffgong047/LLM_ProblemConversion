Gives the average curvature of any closed convex plane curve This article is about the concept in geometry. For the concept in mathematical optimization, see Fenchel's duality theorem. Fenchel's theoremTypeTheoremFieldDifferential geometryStatementA smooth closed space curve has total absolute curvature ≥2π≥2π, with equality if and only if it is a convex plane curveFirst stated byWerner FenchelFirst proof in1929 In differential geometry, Fenchel's theorem is an inequality on the total absolute curvature of a closed smooth space curve, stating that it is always at least 2π2π. Equivalently, the average curvature is at least 2π/L2π/L, where L is the length of the curve. The only curves of this type whose total absolute curvature equals 2π2π and whose average curvature equals 2π/L2π/L are the plane convex curves. The theorem is named after Werner Fenchel, who published it in 1929. The Fenchel theorem is enhanced by the Fáry–Milnor theorem, which says that if a closed smooth simple space curve is nontrivially knotted, then the total absolute curvature is greater than 4π.
