Proof: Given a closed smooth curve α:[0,L]→R3α:[0,L]→ℝ^3 with unit speed, the velocity γ=α˙:[0,L]→S2γ=α̇:[0,L]→𝕊^2 is also a closed smooth curve. The total absolute curvature is its length l(γ)(γ). The curve γγ does not lie in an open hemisphere. If so, then there is v∈S2∈𝕊^2 such that γ⋅v>0γ>0, so 0=(α(1)−α(0))⋅v=∫0Lγ(t)⋅vdt>00=(α(1)-α(0))=∫_0^Lγ(t) dt>0, a contradiction. This also shows that if γγ lies in a closed hemisphere, then γ⋅v≡0γ≡0, so αα is a plane curve. Consider a point γ(T)γ(T) such that curves γ([0,T])γ([0,T]) and γ([T,L])γ([T,L]) have the same length. By rotating the sphere, we may assume γ(0)γ(0) and γ(T)γ(T) are symmetric about the axis through the poles. By the previous paragraph, at least one of the two curves γ([0,T])γ([0,T]) and γ([T,L])γ([T,L]) intersects with the equator at some point p. We denote this curve by γ0γ_0. Then l(γ)=2l(γ0)(γ)=2l(γ_0). We reflect γ0γ_0 across the plane through γ(0)γ(0), γ(T)γ(T), and the north pole, forming a closed curve γ1γ_1 containing antipodal points ±p, with length l(γ1)=2l(γ0)(γ_1)=2l(γ_0). A curve connecting ±p has length at least ππ, which is the length of the great semicircle between ±p. So l(γ1)≥2π(γ_1)≥2π, and if equality holds then γ0γ_0 does not cross the equator. Therefore, l(γ)=2l(γ0)=l(γ1)≥2π(γ)=2l(γ_0)=l(γ_1)≥2π, and if equality holds then γγ lies in a closed hemisphere, and thus αα is a plane curve.
