case: Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space and 1≤p<∞1<∞. Let (fn)n≥1⊆Lp(X,A,μ)(f_n)_n≥1^p(X,𝒜,μ) and f∈Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ). Then, (fn)(f_n) converges to f in Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) if and only if the following holds : The sequence of functions (fn)(f_n) converges in μμ-measure to f ; (fn)(f_n) has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals; For every ε>0ε>0, there exists Xε∈A_ε∈𝒜 such that μ(Xε)<∞μ(X_ε)<∞ and supn≥1∫X∖Xε|fn|pdμ<ε.sup_n≥1∫_X_ε|f_n|^p dμ<ε. When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, the third condition becomes superfluous (one can simply take Xε=X_ε=X) and the first two conditions give the usual form of Lebesgue-Vitali's convergence theorem originally stated for measure spaces with finite measure. In this case, one can show that conditions 1 and 2 imply that the sequence (|fn|p)n≥1(|f_n|^p)_n≥1 is uniformly integrable. Converse of the
