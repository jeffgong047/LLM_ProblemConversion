In real analysis and measure theory, the Vitali convergence theorem, named after the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Vitali, is a generalization of the better-known dominated convergence theorem of Henri Lebesgue. It is a characterization of the convergence in Lp in terms of convergence in measure and a condition related to uniform integrability.


Preliminary definitions[edit]
Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space, i.e. μ:A→[0,∞]μ:𝒜→[0,∞] is a set function such that μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0 and μμ is countably-additive. All functions considered in the sequel will be functions f:X→K:X→𝕂, where K=R𝕂=ℝ or Cℂ. We adopt the following definitions according to Bogachev's terminology.[1]

A set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is called uniformly integrable if limM→+∞supf∈F∫|f|>M|f|dμ=0lim_M→+∞sup_f∈ℱ∫_{|f|>M}|f| dμ=0, i.e  ∀ε>0,∃Mε>0:supf∈F∫|f|≥Mε|f|dμ<ε∀
varepsilon>0,
exists_ε>0:sup_f∈ℱ∫_{|f|_ε}|f| dμ<ε.
A set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is said to have uniformly absolutely continuous integrals if limμ(A)→0supf∈F∫A|f|dμ=0lim_μ(A)→0sup_f∈ℱ∫_A|f| dμ=0, i.e. ∀ε>0,∃δε>0,∀A∈A:μ(A)<δε⇒supf∈F∫A|f|dμ<ε∀
varepsilon>0,
exists
delta_ε>0,
forall∈𝒜:μ(A)<δ_ε⇒sup_f∈ℱ∫_A|f| dμ<ε. This definition is sometimes used as a definition of uniform integrability. However, it differs from the definition of uniform integrability given above.

When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, a set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is uniformly integrable if and only if it is bounded in L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. If, in addition, μμ is atomless, then the uniform integrability is equivalent to the uniform absolute continuity of integrals.

Finite measure case[edit]
Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space with μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞. Let (fn)⊂Lp(X,A,μ)(f_n)^p(X,𝒜,μ) and f be an A𝒜-measurable function. Then, the following are equivalent : 

f∈Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) and (fn)(f_n) converges to f in Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) ;
The sequence of functions (fn)(f_n) converges in μμ-measure to f and (|fn|p)n≥1(|f_n|^p)_n≥1 is uniformly integrable ;

For a proof, see Bogachev's monograph "Measure Theory, Volume I".[1]

Infinite measure case[edit]
Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space and 1≤p<∞1<∞. Let (fn)n≥1⊆Lp(X,A,μ)(f_n)_n≥1^p(X,𝒜,μ) and f∈Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ). Then, (fn)(f_n) converges to f in Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) if and only if the following holds :

The sequence of functions (fn)(f_n) converges in μμ-measure to f ;
(fn)(f_n) has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals;
For every ε>0ε>0, there exists Xε∈A_ε∈𝒜 such that μ(Xε)<∞μ(X_ε)<∞ and  supn≥1∫X∖Xε|fn|pdμ<ε.sup_n≥1∫_X_ε|f_n|^p dμ<ε.
When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, the third condition becomes superfluous (one can simply take Xε=X_ε=X) and the first two conditions give the usual form of Lebesgue-Vitali's convergence theorem originally stated for measure spaces with finite measure. In this case, one can show that conditions 1 and 2 imply that the sequence (|fn|p)n≥1(|f_n|^p)_n≥1 is uniformly integrable.

Converse of the theorem[edit]
Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be measure space. Let (fn)n≥1⊆L1(X,A,μ)(f_n)_n≥1^1(X,𝒜,μ) and assume that limn→∞∫Afndμlim_n→∞∫_Af_n dμ exists for every A∈A∈𝒜. Then, the sequence (fn)(f_n) is bounded in L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. In addition, there exists f∈L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) such that limn→∞∫Afndμ=∫Afdμlim_n→∞∫_Af_n dμ=∫_Af dμ for every A∈A∈𝒜.
When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, this implies that (fn)(f_n) is uniformly integrable.
For a proof, see Bogachev's monograph "Measure Theory, Volume I".[1]
