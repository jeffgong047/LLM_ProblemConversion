definitions: Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space, i.e. μ:A→[0,∞]μ:𝒜→[0,∞] is a set function such that μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0 and μμ is countably-additive. All functions considered in the sequel will be functions f:X→K:X→𝕂, where K=R𝕂=ℝ or Cℂ. We adopt the following definitions according to Bogachev's terminology.[1] A set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is called uniformly integrable if limM→+∞supf∈F∫|f|>M|f|dμ=0lim_M→+∞sup_f∈ℱ∫_{|f|>M}|f| dμ=0, i.e ∀ε>0,∃Mε>0:supf∈F∫|f|≥Mε|f|dμ<ε∀ varepsilon>0, exists_ε>0:sup_f∈ℱ∫_{|f|_ε}|f| dμ<ε. A set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is said to have uniformly absolutely continuous integrals if limμ(A)→0supf∈F∫A|f|dμ=0lim_μ(A)→0sup_f∈ℱ∫_A|f| dμ=0, i.e. ∀ε>0,∃δε>0,∀A∈A:μ(A)<δε⇒supf∈F∫A|f|dμ<ε∀ varepsilon>0, exists delta_ε>0, forall∈𝒜:μ(A)<δ_ε⇒sup_f∈ℱ∫_A|f| dμ<ε. This definition is sometimes used as a definition of uniform integrability. However, it differs from the definition of uniform integrability given above. When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, a set of functions F⊂L1(X,A,μ)ℱ^1(X,𝒜,μ) is uniformly integrable if and only if it is bounded in L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. If, in addition, μμ is atomless, then the uniform integrability is equivalent to the uniform absolute continuity of integrals. Finite measure
