theorem: Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be measure space. Let (fn)n≥1⊆L1(X,A,μ)(f_n)_n≥1^1(X,𝒜,μ) and assume that limn→∞∫Afndμlim_n→∞∫_Af_n dμ exists for every A∈A∈𝒜. Then, the sequence (fn)(f_n) is bounded in L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. In addition, there exists f∈L1(X,A,μ)^1(X,𝒜,μ) such that limn→∞∫Afndμ=∫Afdμlim_n→∞∫_Af_n dμ=∫_Af dμ for every A∈A∈𝒜. When μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞, this implies that (fn)(f_n) is uniformly integrable. For a proof, see Bogachev's monograph "Measure Theory, Volume I".[1]
