case: Let (X,A,μ)(X,𝒜,μ) be a measure space with μ(X)<∞μ(X)<∞. Let (fn)⊂Lp(X,A,μ)(f_n)^p(X,𝒜,μ) and f be an A𝒜-measurable function. Then, the following are equivalent : f∈Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) and (fn)(f_n) converges to f in Lp(X,A,μ)^p(X,𝒜,μ) ; The sequence of functions (fn)(f_n) converges in μμ-measure to f and (|fn|p)n≥1(|f_n|^p)_n≥1 is uniformly integrable ; For a proof, see Bogachev's monograph "Measure Theory, Volume I".[1] Infinite measure
