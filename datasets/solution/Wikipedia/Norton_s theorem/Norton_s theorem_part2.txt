circuit: The original circuitCalculating the equivalent output currentCalculating the equivalent resistanceDesign the Norton equivalent circuit In the example, the total current Itotal is given by: Itotal=15V2kΩ+1kΩ∥(1kΩ+1kΩ)=5.625mA._total=15 V2 kΩ+1 kΩ∥(1 kΩ+1 kΩ)=5.625 mA. The current through the load is then, using the current divider rule: Ino=1kΩ+1kΩ1kΩ+1kΩ+1kΩ⋅Itotal=2/3⋅5.625mA=3.75mA.I_no =1 kΩ+1 kΩ1 kΩ+1 kΩ+1 kΩ_total =2/3·5.625 mA=3.75 mA. And the equivalent resistance looking back into the circuit is: Rno=1kΩ+(2kΩ∥(1kΩ+1kΩ))=2kΩ._no=1 kΩ+(2 kΩ∥(1 kΩ+1 kΩ))=2 kΩ. So the equivalent circuit is a 3.75 mA current source in parallel with a 2 kΩ resistor. Conversion to a Thévenin
