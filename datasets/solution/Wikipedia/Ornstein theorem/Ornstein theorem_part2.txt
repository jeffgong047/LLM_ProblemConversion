Discussion: The theorem is actually a collection of related theorems. The first theorem states that if two different Bernoulli shifts have the same Kolmogorov entropy, then they are isomorphic as dynamical systems. The third theorem extends this result to flows: namely, that there exists a flow Tt_t such that T1_1 is a Bernoulli shift. The fourth theorem states that, for a given fixed entropy, this flow is unique, up to a constant rescaling of time. The fifth theorem states that there is a single, unique flow (up to a constant rescaling of time) that has infinite entropy. The phrase "up to a constant rescaling of time" means simply that if Tt_t and St_t are two Bernoulli flows with the same entropy, then St=Tct_t=T_ct for some constant c. The developments also included proofs that factors of Bernoulli shifts are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts, and gave criteria for a given measure-preserving dynamical system to be isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift. A corollary of these results is a solution to the root problem for Bernoulli shifts: So, for example, given a shift T, there is another shift Tâˆš(T) that is isomorphic to it.
