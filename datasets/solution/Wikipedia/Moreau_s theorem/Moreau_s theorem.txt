In mathematics, Moreau's theorem is a result in convex analysis named after French mathematician Jean-Jacques Moreau. It shows that sufficiently well-behaved convex functionals on Hilbert spaces are differentiable and the derivative is well-approximated by the so-called Yosida approximation, which is defined in terms of the resolvent operator.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let H be a Hilbert space and let φ : H → R ∪ {+∞} be a proper, convex and lower semi-continuous extended real-valued functional on H. Let A stand for ∂φ, the subderivative of φ; for α > 0 let Jα denote the resolvent:

Jα=(id+αA)−1;_α=(id+)^-1;
and let Aα denote the Yosida approximation to A:

Aα=1α(id−Jα)._α=1/α(id-J_α).
For each α > 0 and x ∈ H, let

φα(x)=infy∈H12α‖y−x‖2+φ(y).φ_α(x)=inf_y1/2αy-x^2+φ(y).
Then

φα(x)=α2‖Aαx‖2+φ(Jα(x))φ_α(x)=α/2A_αx^2+φ(J_α(x))
and φα is convex and Fréchet differentiable with derivative dφα = Aα. Also, for each x ∈ H (pointwise), φα(x) converges upwards to φ(x) as α → 0.
