Theorem: Two representations are considered different if their terms are in different order or if the integer being squared (not just the square) is different; to illustrate, these are three of the eight different ways to represent 1: 12+02+02+0202+12+02+02(−1)2+02+02+02.1^2 +0^2+0^2+0^2 0^2 +1^2+0^2+0^2 (-1)^2 +0^2+0^2+0^2. The number of ways to represent n as the sum of four squares is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function), i.e. r4(n)=8∑m|nmifnisodd,24∑m|nmoddmifniseven._4(n)=8∑_m|nm ifnisodd, 24∑_m|nmoddm ifniseven. Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e. r4(n)=8∑m∣n,4∤mm._4(n)=8∑_m,4m. We may also write this as r4(n)=8σ(n)−32σ(n/4)_4(n)=8 σ(n)-32 σ(n/4) where the second term is to be taken as zero if n is not divisible by 4. In particular, for a prime number p we have the explicit formula r4(p) = 8(p + 1).[1] Some values of r4(n) occur infinitely often as r4(n) = r4(2mn) whenever n is even. The values of r4(n) can be arbitrarily large: indeed, r4(n) is infinitely often larger than 8log⁡n.8√().[1]
