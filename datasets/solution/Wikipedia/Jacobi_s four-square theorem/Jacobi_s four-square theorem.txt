How many ways a positive integer can be represented as the sum of four squares
For other theorems of Jacobi see Jacobi's theorem (disambiguation).
In number theory, Jacobi's four-square theorem gives a formula for the number of ways that a given positive integer n can be represented as the sum of four squares (of integers).


History[edit]
The theorem was proved in 1834 by Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi.

Theorem[edit]
Two representations are considered different if their terms are in different order or if the integer being squared (not just the square) is different; to illustrate, these are three of the eight different ways to represent 1:
12+02+02+0202+12+02+02(−1)2+02+02+02.1^2   +0^2+0^2+0^2
0^2   +1^2+0^2+0^2
(-1)^2   +0^2+0^2+0^2.
The number of ways to represent n as the sum of four squares is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function), i.e.
r4(n)=8∑m|nmifnisodd,24∑m|nmoddmifniseven._4(n)=8∑_m|nm   ifnisodd,
24∑_m|nmoddm   ifniseven.
Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e.
r4(n)=8∑m∣n,4∤mm._4(n)=8∑_m,4m.
We may also write this as
r4(n)=8σ(n)−32σ(n/4)_4(n)=8 σ(n)-32 σ(n/4)
where the second term is to be taken as zero if n is not divisible by 4. In particular, for a prime number p we have the explicit formula r4(p) = 8(p + 1).[1]
Some values of r4(n) occur infinitely often as r4(n) = r4(2mn) whenever n is even. The values of r4(n) can be arbitrarily large: indeed, r4(n) is infinitely often larger than 8log⁡n.8√().[1]

Proof[edit]
The theorem can be proved by elementary means starting with the Jacobi triple product.[2]
The proof shows that the Theta series for the lattice Z4 is a modular form of a certain level, and hence equals a linear combination of Eisenstein series.
