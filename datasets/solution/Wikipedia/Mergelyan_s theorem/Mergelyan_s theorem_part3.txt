History: Mergelyan's theorem is a generalization of the Weierstrass approximation theorem and Runge's theorem. In the case that Câˆ–K is not connected, in the initial approximation problem the polynomials have to be replaced by rational functions. An important step of the solution of this further rational approximation problem was also suggested by Mergelyan in 1952. Further deep results on rational approximation are due to, in particular, A. G. Vitushkin. Weierstrass and Runge's theorems were put forward in 1885, while Mergelyan's theorem dates from 1951. After Weierstrass and Runge, many mathematicians (in particular Walsh, Keldysh, Lavrentyev, Hartogs, and Rosenthal) had been working on the same problem. The method of the proof suggested by Mergelyan is constructive, and remains the only known constructive proof of the result.[citation needed] See
