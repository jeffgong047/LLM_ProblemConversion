Statement: Let K be a compact subset of the complex plane C such that C∖K is connected. Then, every continuous function f : K→→ C, such that the restriction f to int(K) is holomorphic, can be approximated uniformly on K with polynomials. Here, int(K) denotes the interior of K.[1][2] Mergelyan's theorem also holds for open Riemann surfaces If K is a compact set without holes in an open Riemann surface X, then every function in A(K)𝒜(K) can be approximated uniformly on K by functions in O(X)𝒪(X).[2] Mergelyan's theorem does not always hold in higher dimensions (spaces of several complex variables), but it has some consequences.[2]
