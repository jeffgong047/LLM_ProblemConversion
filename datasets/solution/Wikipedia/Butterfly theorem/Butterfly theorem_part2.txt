Proof: Proof of Butterfly theorem A formal proof of the theorem is as follows: Let the perpendiculars XX′ and XX″ be dropped from the point X on the straight lines AM and DM respectively. Similarly, let YY′ and YY″ be dropped from the point Y perpendicular to the straight lines BM and CM respectively. Since △MXX′∼△MYY′,'∼', MXMY=XX′YY′,MX=XX'', △MXX″∼△MYY″,”∼”, MXMY=XX″YY″,MX=XX””, △AXX′∼△CYY″,'∼”, XX′YY″=AXCY,XX'”=AX, △DXX″∼△BYY′,”∼', XX″YY′=DXBY.XX”'=DX. From the preceding equations and the intersecting chords theorem, it can be seen that (MXMY)2=XX′YY′XX″YY″,(MX)^2=XX''XX””, =AX⋅DXCY⋅BY,=AX, =PX⋅QXPY⋅QY,=PX, =(PM−XM)⋅(MQ+XM)(PM+MY)⋅(QM−MY),=(PM-XM)·(MQ+XM)(PM+MY)·(QM-MY), =(PM)2−(MX)2(PM)2−(MY)2,=(PM)^2-(MX)^2(PM)^2-(MY)^2, since PM = MQ. So (MX)2(MY)2=(PM)2−(MX)2(PM)2−(MY)2.(MX)^2(MY)^2=(PM)^2-(MX)^2(PM)^2-(MY)^2. Cross-multiplying in the latter equation, (MX)2⋅(PM)2−(MX)2⋅(MY)2=(MY)2⋅(PM)2−(MX)2⋅(MY)2.(MX)^2·(PM)^2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2=(MY)^2·(PM)^2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2. Cancelling the common term −(MX)2⋅(MY)2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2 from both sides of the resulting equation yields (MX)2⋅(PM)2=(MY)2⋅(PM)2,(MX)^2·(PM)^2=(MY)^2·(PM)^2, hence MX = MY, since MX, MY, and PM are all positive, real numbers. Thus, M is the midpoint of XY. Other proofs exist,[2] including one using projective geometry.[3]
