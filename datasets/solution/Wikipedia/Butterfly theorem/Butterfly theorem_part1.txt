About the midpoint of a chord of a circle, through which two other chords are drawn For the "butterfly lemma" of group theory, see Zassenhaus lemma. Butterfly theorem The butterfly theorem is a classical result in Euclidean geometry, which can be stated as follows:[1]: p. 78 Let M be the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle, through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn; AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y correspondingly. Then M is the midpoint of XY.
