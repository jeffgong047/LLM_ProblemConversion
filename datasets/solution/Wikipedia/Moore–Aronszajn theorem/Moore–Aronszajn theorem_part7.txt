Properties: The following properties of RKHSs may be useful to readers. Let (Xi)i=1p(X_i)_i=1^p be a sequence of sets and (Ki)i=1p(K_i)_i=1^p be a collection of corresponding positive definite functions on (Xi)i=1p.(X_i)_i=1^p. It then follows that K((x1,…,xp),(y1,…,yp))=K1(x1,y1)⋯Kp(xp,yp)((x_1,…,x_p),(y_1,…,y_p))=K_1(x_1,y_1)_p(x_p,y_p) is a kernel on X=X1×⋯×Xp.=X_1×…_p. Let X0⊂X,_0, then the restriction of K to X0×X0_0_0 is also a reproducing kernel. Consider a normalized kernel K such that K(x,x)=1(x,x)=1 for all x∈X. Define a pseudo-metric on X as dK(x,y)=‖Kx−Ky‖H2=2(1−K(x,y))∀x∈X._K(x,y)=K_x-K_y_H^2=2(1-K(x,y)) . By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, K(x,y)2≤K(x,x)K(y,y)=1∀x,y∈X.(x,y)^2(x,x)K(y,y)=1 ,y. This inequality allows us to view K as a measure of similarity between inputs. If x,y∈X,y are similar then K(x,y)(x,y) will be closer to 1 while if x,y∈X,y are dissimilar then K(x,y)(x,y) will be closer to 0. The closure of the span of Kx∣x∈X{K_x} coincides with H.[8] Common
