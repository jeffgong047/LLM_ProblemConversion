Definition: Let X be an arbitrary set and H a Hilbert space of real-valued functions on X, equipped with pointwise addition and pointwise scalar multiplication. The evaluation functional over the Hilbert space of functions H is a linear functional that evaluates each function at a point x, Lx:f↦f(x)∀f∈H._x:f(x). We say that H is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space if, for all x in X, Lx_x is continuous at every f in H or, equivalently, if Lx_x is a bounded operator on H, i.e. there exists some Mx>0_x>0 such that |Lx(f)|:=|f(x)|≤Mx‖f‖H∀f∈H.|L_x(f)|:=|f(x)|_x f_H . (1) Although Mx<∞_x<∞ is assumed for all x∈X, it might still be the case that supxMx=∞sup_xM_x=∞. While property (1) is the weakest condition that ensures both the existence of an inner product and the evaluation of every function in H at every point in the domain, it does not lend itself to easy application in practice. A more intuitive definition of the RKHS can be obtained by observing that this property guarantees that the evaluation functional can be represented by taking the inner product of f with a function Kx_x in H. This function is the so-called reproducing kernel[citation needed] for the Hilbert space H from which the RKHS takes its name. More formally, the Riesz representation theorem implies that for all x in X there exists a unique element Kx_x of H with the reproducing property, f(x)=Lx(f)=⟨f,Kx⟩H∀f∈H.(x)=L_x(f)=,_x⟩_H . (2) Since Kx_x is itself a function defined on X with values in the field Rℝ (or Cℂ in the case of complex Hilbert spaces) and as Kx_x is in H we have that Kx(y)=Ly(Kx)=⟨Kx,Ky⟩H,_x(y)=L_y(K_x)=_x,_y⟩_H, where Ky∈H_y is the element in H associated to Ly_y. This allows us to define the reproducing kernel of H as a function K:X×X→R:X→ℝ by K(x,y)=⟨Kx,Ky⟩H.(x,y)=_x,_y⟩_H. From this definition it is easy to see that K:X×X→R:X→ℝ (or Cℂ in the complex case) is both symmetric (resp. conjugate symmetric) and positive definite, i.e. ∑i,j=1ncicjK(xi,xj)=∑i=1nci⟨Kxi,∑j=1ncjKxj⟩H=⟨∑i=1nciKxi,∑j=1ncjKxj⟩H=‖∑i=1nciKxi‖H2≥0∑_i,j=1^nc_ic_jK(x_i,x_j)=∑_i=1^nc_i_x_i,∑_j=1^nc_jK_x_j⟩_H=⟨∑_i=1^nc_iK_x_i,∑_j=1^nc_jK_x_j⟩_H=∑_i=1^nc_iK_x_i_H^2≥0 for every n∈N,x1,…,xn∈X,andc1,…,cn∈R.∈ℕ,x_1,…,x_n,andc_1,…,c_n∈ℝ.[6] The Moore–Aronszajn theorem (see below) is a sort of converse to this: if a function K satisfies these conditions then there is a Hilbert space of functions on X for which it is a reproducing kernel.
