kernels: We also provide examples of Bergman kernels. Let X be finite and let H consist of all complex-valued functions on X. Then an element of H can be represented as an array of complex numbers. If the usual inner product is used, then Kx is the function whose value is 1 at x and 0 everywhere else, and K(x,y)(x,y) can be thought of as an identity matrix since K(x,y)=1x=y0x≠y(x,y)=1 x=y 0 x In this case, H is isomorphic to Cnℂ^n. The case of X=D=𝔻 (where D𝔻 denotes the unit disc) is more sophisticated. Here the Bergman space H2(D)^2(𝔻) is the space of square-integrable holomorphic functions on D𝔻. It can be shown that the reproducing kernel for H2(D)^2(𝔻) is K(x,y)=1π1(1−xy¯)2.(x,y)=1/π1/(1-xy)^2. Lastly, the space of band limited functions in L2(R)^2(ℝ) with bandwidth 2a2a is a RKHS with reproducing kernel K(x,y)=sin⁡a(x−y)π(x−y).(x,y)=(x-y)/π(x-y). Extension to vector-valued
