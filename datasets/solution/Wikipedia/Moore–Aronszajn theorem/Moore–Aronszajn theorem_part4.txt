theorem: We have seen how a reproducing kernel Hilbert space defines a reproducing kernel function that is both symmetric and positive definite. The Moore–Aronszajn theorem goes in the other direction; it states that every symmetric, positive definite kernel defines a unique reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The theorem first appeared in Aronszajn's Theory of Reproducing Kernels, although he attributes it to E. H. Moore. Theorem. Suppose K is a symmetric, positive definite kernel on a set X. Then there is a unique Hilbert space of functions on X for which K is a reproducing kernel. Proof. For all x in X, define Kx = K(x, ⋅ ). Let H0 be the linear span of {Kx : x ∈ X}. Define an inner product on H0 by ⟨∑j=1nbjKyj,∑i=1maiKxi⟩H0=∑i=1m∑j=1naibjK(yj,xi),⟨∑_j=1^nb_jK_y_j,∑_i=1^ma_iK_x_i⟩_H_0=∑_i=1^m∑_j=1^na_ib_jK(y_j,x_i), which implies K(x,y)=⟨Kx,Ky⟩H0(x,y)=_x,K_y⟩_H_0. The symmetry of this inner product follows from the symmetry of K and the non-degeneracy follows from the fact that K is positive definite. Let H be the completion of H0 with respect to this inner product. Then H consists of functions of the form f(x)=∑i=1∞aiKxi(x)wherelimn→∞supp≥0‖∑i=nn+paiKxi‖H0=0.(x)=∑_i=1^∞a_iK_x_i(x) where lim_n→∞sup_p≥0∑_i=n^n+pa_iK_x_i_H_0=0. Now we can check the reproducing property (2): ⟨f,Kx⟩H=∑i=1∞ai⟨Kxi,Kx⟩H0=∑i=1∞aiK(xi,x)=f(x).,K_x⟩_H=∑_i=1^∞a_i_x_i,K_x⟩_H_0=∑_i=1^∞a_iK(x_i,x)=f(x). To prove uniqueness, let G be another Hilbert space of functions for which K is a reproducing kernel. For every x and y in X, (2) implies that ⟨Kx,Ky⟩H=K(x,y)=⟨Kx,Ky⟩G._x,K_y⟩_H=K(x,y)=_x,K_y⟩_G. By linearity, ⟨⋅,⋅⟩H=⟨⋅,⋅⟩G⟨·,·⟩_H=⟨·,·⟩_G on the span of Kx:x∈X{K_x:x}. Then H⊂G because G is complete and contains H0 and hence contains its completion. Now we need to prove that every element of G is in H. Let f be an element of G. Since H is a closed subspace of G, we can write f=fH+fH⊥=f_H+f_H^ where fH∈H_H and fH⊥∈H⊥_H^^. Now if x∈X then, since K is a reproducing kernel of G and H: f(x)=⟨Kx,f⟩G=⟨Kx,fH⟩G+⟨Kx,fH⊥⟩G=⟨Kx,fH⟩G=⟨Kx,fH⟩H=fH(x),(x)=_x,f⟩_G=_x,f_H⟩_G+_x,f_H^⟩_G=_x,f_H⟩_G=_x,f_H⟩_H=f_H(x), where we have used the fact that Kx_x belongs to H so that its inner product with fH⊥_H^ in G is zero. This shows that f=fH=f_H in G and concludes the proof. Integral operators and Mercer's
