theorem: We may characterize a symmetric positive definite kernel K via the integral operator using Mercer's theorem and obtain an additional view of the RKHS. Let X be a compact space equipped with a strictly positive finite Borel measure μμ and K:X×X→R:X→ℝ a continuous, symmetric, and positive definite function. Define the integral operator TK:L2(X)→L2(X)_K:L_2(X)_2(X) as [TKf](⋅)=∫XK(⋅,t)f(t)dμ(t)[T_Kf](·)=∫_XK(·,t)f(t) dμ(t) where L2(X)_2(X) is the space of square integrable functions with respect to μμ. Mercer's theorem states that the spectral decomposition of the integral operator TK_K of K yields a series representation of K in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of TK_K. This then implies that K is a reproducing kernel so that the corresponding RKHS can be defined in terms of these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We provide the details below. Under these assumptions TK_K is a compact, continuous, self-adjoint, and positive operator. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators implies that there is an at most countable decreasing sequence (σi)i≥0(σ_i)_i≥0 such that limi→∞σi=0lim_i→∞σ_i=0 and TKφi(x)=σiφi(x)_Kφ_i(x)=σ_iφ_i(x), where the φi{φ_i} form an orthonormal basis of L2(X)_2(X). By the positivity of TK,σi>0_K,σ_i>0 for all i.. One can also show that TK_K maps continuously into the space of continuous functions C(X)(X) and therefore we may choose continuous functions as the eigenvectors, that is, φi∈C(X)φ_i(X) for all i.. Then by Mercer's theorem K may be written in terms of the eigenvalues and continuous eigenfunctions as K(x,y)=∑j=1∞σjφj(x)φj(y)(x,y)=∑_j=1^∞σ_j φ_j(x) φ_j(y) for all x,y∈X,y such that limn→∞supu,v|K(u,v)−∑j=1nσjφj(u)φj(v)|=0.lim_n→∞sup_u,v|K(u,v)-∑_j=1^nσ_j φ_j(u) φ_j(v)|=0. This above series representation is referred to as a Mercer kernel or Mercer representation of K. Furthermore, it can be shown that the RKHS H of K is given by H=f∈L2(X)|∑i=1∞⟨f,φi⟩L22σi<∞={f_2(X) | ∑_i=1^∞,φ_i⟩_L_2^2/σ_i<∞} where the inner product of H given by ⟨f,g⟩H=∑i=1∞⟨f,φi⟩L2⟨g,φi⟩L2σi.,g⟩_H=∑_i=1^∞,φ_i⟩_L_2,φ_i⟩_L_2/σ_i. This representation of the RKHS has application in probability and statistics, for example to the Karhunen-Loève representation for stochastic processes and kernel PCA. Feature
