kernels: These are another common class of kernels which satisfy K(x,y)=K(‖x−y‖)(x,y)=K(x-y). Some examples include: Gaussian or squared exponential kernel: K(x,y)=e−‖x−y‖22σ2,σ>0(x,y)=e^-x-y^2/2σ^2, σ>0 Laplacian kernel: K(x,y)=e−‖x−y‖σ,σ>0(x,y)=e^-x-y/σ, σ>0 The squared norm of a function f in the RKHS H with this kernel is:[9] ‖f‖H2=∫R(1σf(x)2+σf′(x)2)dx.f_H^2=∫_ℝ(1/σf(x)^2+'(x)^2)dx.
