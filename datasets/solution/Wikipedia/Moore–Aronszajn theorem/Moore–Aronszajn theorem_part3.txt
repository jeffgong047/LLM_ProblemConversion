Example: The space of bandlimited continuous functions H is a RKHS, as we now show. Formally, fix some cutoff frequency 0<a<∞0<a<∞ and define the Hilbert space H=f∈C(R)∣supp⁡(F)⊂[−a,a]={f(ℝ)|supp(F)⊂[-a,a]} where C(R)(ℝ) is the set of continuous square integrable functions, and F(ω)=∫−∞∞f(t)e−iωtdt(ω)=∫_-∞^∞f(t)e^-i dt is the Fourier transform of f. As the inner product of this Hilbert space, we use ⟨f,g⟩L2=∫−∞∞f(x)⋅g(x)¯dx.,g⟩_L^2=∫_-∞^∞f(x)·g(x) dx. From the Fourier inversion theorem, we have f(x)=12π∫−aaF(ω)eixωdω.(x)=1/2π∫_-a^aF(ω)e^ixω dω. It then follows by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and Plancherel's theorem that, for all x, |f(x)|≤12π∫−aa2a|F(ω)|2dω=1πa2∫−∞∞|F(ω)|2dω=aπ‖f‖L2.|f(x)|≤1/2π√(∫_-a^a2a|F(ω)|^2 dω)=1/π√(a/2∫_-∞^∞|F(ω)|^2 dω)=√(a/π)f_L^2. This inequality shows that the evaluation functional is bounded, proving that H is indeed a RKHS. The kernel function Kx_x in this case is given by Kx(y)=aπsinc⁡(aπ(y−x))=sin⁡(a(y−x))π(y−x)._x(y)=a/πsinc(a/π(y-x))=sin(a(y-x))/π(y-x). The Fourier transform of Kx(y)_x(y) defined above is given by ∫−∞∞Kx(y)e−iωydy=e−iωxifω∈[−a,a],0otherwise,∫_-∞^∞K_x(y)e^-i dy=e^-i ifω∈[-a,a], 0 otherwise, which is a consequence of the time-shifting property of the Fourier transform. Consequently, using Plancherel's theorem, we have ⟨f,Kx⟩L2=∫−∞∞f(y)⋅Kx(y)¯dy=12π∫−aaF(ω)⋅eiωxdω=f(x).,K_x⟩_L^2=∫_-∞^∞f(y)·K_x(y) dy=1/2π∫_-a^aF(ω)^i dω=f(x). Thus we obtain the reproducing property of the kernel. Kx_x in this case is the "bandlimited version" of the Dirac delta function, and that Kx(y)_x(y) converges to δ(y−x)δ(y-x) in the weak sense as the cutoff frequency a tends to infinity. Moore–Aronszajn
