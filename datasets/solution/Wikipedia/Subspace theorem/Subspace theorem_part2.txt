Statement: The subspace theorem states that if L1,...,Ln are linearly independent linear forms in n variables with algebraic coefficients and if ε>0 is any given real number, then the non-zero integer points x with |L1(x)⋯Ln(x)|<|x|−ϵ|L_1(x)_n(x)|<|x|^-ϵ lie in a finite number of proper subspaces of Qn. A quantitative form of the theorem, which determines the number of subspaces containing all solutions, was also obtained by Schmidt, and the theorem was generalised by Schlickewei (1977) to allow more general absolute values on number fields.
