approximation: The following corollary to the subspace theorem is often itself referred to as the subspace theorem. If a1,...,an are algebraic such that 1,a1,...,an are linearly independent over Q and ε>0 is any given real number, then there are only finitely many rational n-tuples (x1/y,...,xn/y) with |ai−xi/y|<y−(1+1/n+ϵ),i=1,…,n.|a_i-x_i/y|<y^-(1+1/n+ϵ),=1,…,n. The specialization n = 1 gives the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem. One may also note that the exponent 1+1/n+ε is best possible by Dirichlet's theorem on diophantine approximation.
