theorem: The result can be considered as a variation of Gabrielov's theorem. This earlier theorem of Andrei Gabrielov dealt with sub-analytic sets, or the language Lan of ordered rings with a function symbol for each proper analytic function on Rm restricted to the closed unit cube [0, 1]m. Gabrielov's theorem states that any formula in this language is equivalent to an existential one, as above.[2] Hence the theory of the real ordered field with restricted analytic functions is model complete.
