Formulations: In terms of model theory, Wilkie's theorem deals with the language Lexp = (+, −, ·, <, 0, 1, ex), the language of ordered rings with an exponential function ex. Suppose φ(x1, ..., xm) is a formula in this language. Then Wilkie's theorem states that there is an integer n ≥ m and polynomials f1, ..., fr ∈ Z[x1, ..., xn, ex1, ..., exn] such that φ(x1, ..., xm) is equivalent to the existential formula ∃xm+1…∃xnf1(x1,…,xn,ex1,…,exn)=⋯=fr(x1,…,xn,ex1,…,exn)=0._m+1…_n f_1(x_1,…,x_n,e^x_1,…,e^x_n)=⋯=f_r(x_1,…,x_n,e^x_1,…,e^x_n)=0. Thus, while this theory does not have full quantifier elimination, formulae can be put in a particularly simple form. This result proves that the theory of the structure Rexp, that is the real ordered field with the exponential function, is model complete.[1] In terms of analytic geometry, the theorem states that any definable set in the above language — in particular the complement of an exponential variety — is in fact a projection of an exponential variety. An exponential variety over a field K is the set of points in Kn where a finite collection of exponential polynomials simultaneously vanish. Wilkie's theorem states that if we have any definable set in an Lexp structure K = (K, +, −, ·, 0, 1, ex), say X ⊂ Km, then there will be an exponential variety in some higher dimension Kn such that the projection of this variety down onto Km will be precisely X.
