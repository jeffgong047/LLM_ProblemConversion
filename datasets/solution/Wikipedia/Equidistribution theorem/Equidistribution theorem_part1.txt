Integer multiples of any irrational mod 1 are uniformly distributed on the circle Illustration of filling the unit interval (horizontal axis) with the first n terms using the equidistribution theorem with four common irrational numbers, for n from 0 to 999 (vertical axis). The 113 distinct bands for π are due to the closeness of its value to the rational number 355/113. Similarly, the 7 distinct groups are due to π being approximately 22/7.(click for detailed view) In mathematics, the equidistribution theorem is the statement that the sequence a, 2a, 3a, ... mod 1 is uniformly distributed on the circle R/Zℝ/ℤ, when a is an irrational number. It is a special case of the ergodic theorem where one takes the normalized angle measure μ=dθ2πμ=dθ/2π.
