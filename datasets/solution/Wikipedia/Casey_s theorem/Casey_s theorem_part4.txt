generalizations: It can be seen that the four circles need not lie inside the big circle. In fact, they may be tangent to it from the outside as well. In that case, the following change should be made:[4] If Oi,Oj O_i,O_j are both tangent from the same side of O O (both in or both out), tij t_ij is the length of the exterior common tangent. If Oi,Oj O_i,O_j are tangent from different sides of O O (one in and one out), tij t_ij is the length of the interior common tangent. The converse of Casey's theorem is also true.[4] That is, if equality holds, the circles are tangent to a common circle.
