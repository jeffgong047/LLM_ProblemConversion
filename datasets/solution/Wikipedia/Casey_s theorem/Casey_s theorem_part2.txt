theorem: t12⋅t34+t14⋅t23−t13⋅t24=0_12_34+t_14_23-t_13_24=0 Let O O be a circle of radius R R. Let O1,O2,O3,O4 O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4 be (in that order) four non-intersecting circles that lie inside O O and tangent to it. Denote by tij t_ij the length of the exterior common bitangent of the circles Oi,Oj O_i,O_j. Then:[1] t12⋅t34+t14⋅t23=t13⋅t24. t_12_34+t_14_23=t_13_24. Note that in the degenerate case, where all four circles reduce to points, this is exactly Ptolemy's theorem.
