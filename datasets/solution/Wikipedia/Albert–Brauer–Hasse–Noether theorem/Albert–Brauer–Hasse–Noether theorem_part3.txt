Applications: Using the theory of Brauer group, one shows that two central simple algebras A and B over an algebraic number field K are isomorphic over K if and only if their completions Av and Bv are isomorphic over the completion Kv for every v. Together with the Grunwald–Wang theorem, the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem implies that every central simple algebra over an algebraic number field is cyclic, i.e. can be obtained by an explicit construction from a cyclic field extension L/K .
