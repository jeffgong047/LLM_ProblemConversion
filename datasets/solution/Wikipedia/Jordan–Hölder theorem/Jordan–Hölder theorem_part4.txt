Example: For a cyclic group of order n, composition series correspond to ordered prime factorizations of n, and in fact yields a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For example, the cyclic group C12_12 has C1◃C2◃C6◃C12,C1◃C2◃C4◃C12,_1_2_6_12, ,C_1_2_4_12, and C1◃C3◃C6◃C12_1_3_6_12 as three different composition series. The sequences of composition factors obtained in the respective cases are C2,C3,C2,C2,C2,C3,_2,C_3,C_2, ,C_2,C_2,C_3, and C3,C2,C2._3,C_2,C_2. For
