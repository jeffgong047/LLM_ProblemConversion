States that the algebra of n by n matrices satisfies a certain identity of degree 2n In algebra, the Amitsur–Levitzki theorem states that the algebra of n × n matrices over a commutative ring satisfies a certain identity of degree 2n. It was proved by Amitsur and Levitsky (1950). In particular matrix rings are polynomial identity rings such that the smallest identity they satisfy has degree exactly 2n.
