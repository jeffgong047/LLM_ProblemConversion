Statement: The standard polynomial of degree n is Sn(x1,…,xn)=∑σ∈Snsgn(σ)xσ(1)⋯xσ(n)_n(x_1,…,x_n)=∑_σ_nsgn(σ)x_σ(1)_σ(n) in non-commuting variables x1, ..., xn, where the sum is taken over all n! elements of the symmetric group Sn. The Amitsur–Levitzki theorem states that for n × n matrices A1, ..., A2n whose entries are taken from a commutative ring then S2n(A1,…,A2n)=0._2n(A_1,…,A_2n)=0.
