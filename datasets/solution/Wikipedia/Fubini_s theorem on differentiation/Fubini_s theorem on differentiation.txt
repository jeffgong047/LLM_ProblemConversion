In mathematics, Fubini's theorem on differentiation, named after Guido Fubini, is a result in real analysis concerning the differentiation of series of monotonic functions. It can be proven by using Fatou's lemma and the properties of null sets.[1]

Statement[edit]
Assume I⊆R⊆ℝ is an interval and that for every natural number k, fk:I→R_k:I→ℝ is an increasing function. If, 

s(x):=∑k=1∞fk(x)(x):=∑_k=1^∞f_k(x)
exists for all x∈I,, then for almost any x∈I,, the derivatives exist and are related as:[1]

s′(x)=∑k=1∞fk′(x).'(x)=∑_k=1^∞f_k'(x).
In general, if we don't suppose fk is increasing for every k, in order to get the same conclusion, we need a stricter condition like uniform convergence of ∑k=1nfk′(x)∑_k=1^nf_k'(x) on I for every n.[2]
