proofs: Animation illustrating the proof on the polynomial x5−x−1^5-x-1 Suppose the minimum of |p(z)| on the whole complex plane is achieved at z0; it was seen at the proof which uses Liouville's theorem that such a number must exist. We can write p(z) as a polynomial in z − z0: there is some natural number k and there are some complex numbers ck, ck + 1, ..., cn such that ck ≠ 0 and: p(z)=p(z0)+ck(z−z0)k+ck+1(z−z0)k+1+⋯+cn(z−z0)n.(z)=p(z_0)+c_k(z-z_0)^k+c_k+1(z-z_0)^k+1+⋯+c_n(z-z_0)^n. If p(z0) is nonzero, it follows that if a is a kth root of −p(z0)/ck and if t is positive and sufficiently small, then |p(z0 + ta)| < |p(z0)|, which is impossible, since |p(z0)| is the minimum of |p| on D. For another topological proof by contradiction, suppose that the polynomial p(z) has no roots, and consequently is never equal to 0. Think of the polynomial as a map from the complex plane into the complex plane. It maps any circle |z| = R into a closed loop, a curve P(R). We will consider what happens to the winding number of P(R) at the extremes when R is very large and when R = 0. When R is a sufficiently large number, then the leading term zn of p(z) dominates all other terms combined; in other words, |zn|>|an−1zn−1+⋯+a0|.|z^n|>|a_n-1z^n-1+⋯+a_0|. When z traverses the circle Reiθ^iθ once counter-clockwise (0≤θ≤2π),(0≤θ≤2π), then zn=Rneinθ^n=R^ne^inθ winds n times counter-clockwise (0≤θ≤2πn)(0≤θ≤2) around the origin (0,0), and P(R) likewise. At the other extreme, with |z| = 0, the curve P(0) is merely the single point p(0), which must be nonzero because p(z) is never zero. Thus p(0) must be distinct from the origin (0,0), which denotes 0 in the complex plane. The winding number of P(0) around the origin (0,0) is thus 0. Now changing R continuously will deform the loop continuously. At some R the winding number must change. But that can only happen if the curve P(R) includes the origin (0,0) for some R. But then for some z on that circle |z| = R we have p(z) = 0, contradicting our original assumption. Therefore, p(z) has at least one zero. Algebraic
