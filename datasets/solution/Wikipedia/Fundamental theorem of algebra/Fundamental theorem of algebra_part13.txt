polynomial: Main article: Properties of polynomial roots While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result, it is of some interest, both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view, to have information on the location of the zeros of a given polynomial. The simpler result in this direction is a bound on the modulus: all zeros ζ of a monic polynomial zn+an−1zn−1+⋯+a1z+a0^n+a_n-1z^n-1+⋯+a_1z+a_0 satisfy an inequality |ζ| ≤ R∞, where R∞:=1+max|a0|,…,|an−1|._∞:=1+max{|a_0|,…,|a_n-1|}. As stated, this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an a priori bound: it says that if there are solutions then they lie inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius R∞. However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any p-norm of the n-vector of coefficients a:=(a0,a1,…,an−1),:=(a_0,a_1,…,a_n-1), that is |ζ| ≤ Rp, where Rp is precisely the q-norm of the 2-vector (1,‖a‖p),(1,a_p), q being the conjugate exponent of p, 1p+1q=1,1p+1q=1, for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by R1:=max1,∑0≤k<n|ak|,_1:=max{1,∑_0<n|a_k|}, Rp:=[1+(∑0≤k<n|ak|p)qp]1q,_p:=[1+(∑_0<n|a_k|^p)^q/p]^1/q, for 1 < p < ∞, and in particular R2:=∑0≤k≤n|ak|2_2:=√(∑_0|a_k|^2) (where we define an to mean 1, which is reasonable since 1 is indeed the n-th coefficient of our polynomial). The case of a generic polynomial of degree n, P(z):=anzn+an−1zn−1+⋯+a1z+a0,(z):=a_nz^n+a_n-1z^n-1+⋯+a_1z+a_0, is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by an ≠ 0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. a0 ≠ 0, bounds from below on the roots ζ follow immediately as bounds from above on 1ζ1ζ, that is, the roots of a0zn+a1zn−1+⋯+an−1z+an._0z^n+a_1z^n-1+⋯+a_n-1z+a_n. Finally, the distance |ζ−ζ0||ζ-ζ_0| from the roots ζ to any point ζ0ζ_0 can be estimated from below and above, seeing ζ−ζ0ζ-ζ_0 as zeros of the polynomial P(z+ζ0)(z+ζ_0), whose coefficients are the Taylor expansion of P(z) at z=ζ0.=ζ_0. Let ζ be a root of the polynomial zn+an−1zn−1+⋯+a1z+a0;^n+a_n-1z^n-1+⋯+a_1z+a_0; in order to prove the inequality |ζ| ≤ Rp we can assume, of course, |ζ| > 1. Writing the equation as −ζn=an−1ζn−1+⋯+a1ζ+a0,-ζ^n=a_n-1ζ^n-1+⋯+a_1ζ+a_0, and using the Hölder's inequality we find |ζ|n≤‖a‖p‖(ζn−1,…,ζ,1)‖q.|ζ|^n≤a_p(ζ^n-1,…,ζ,1)_q. Now, if p = 1, this is |ζ|n≤‖a‖1max|ζ|n−1,…,|ζ|,1=‖a‖1|ζ|n−1,|ζ|^n≤a_1max{|ζ|^n-1,…,|ζ|,1}=a_1|ζ|^n-1, thus |ζ|≤max1,‖a‖1.|ζ|≤max{1,a_1}. In the case 1 < p ≤ ∞, taking into account the summation formula for a geometric progression, we have |ζ|n≤‖a‖p(|ζ|q(n−1)+⋯+|ζ|q+1)1q=‖a‖p(|ζ|qn−1|ζ|q−1)1q≤‖a‖p(|ζ|qn|ζ|q−1)1q,|ζ|^n≤a_p(|ζ|^q(n-1)+⋯+|ζ|^q+1)^1/q=a_p(|ζ|^qn-1/|ζ|^q-1)^1/q≤a_p(|ζ|^qn/|ζ|^q-1)^1/q, thus |ζ|nq≤‖a‖pq|ζ|qn|ζ|q−1|ζ|^nq≤a_p^q|ζ|^qn/|ζ|^q-1 and simplifying, |ζ|q≤1+‖a‖pq.|ζ|^q≤1+a_p^q. Therefore |ζ|≤‖(1,‖a‖p)‖q=Rp|ζ|≤(1,a_p)_q=R_p holds, for all 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. See
