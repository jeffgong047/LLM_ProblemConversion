proofs: Find a closed disk D of radius r centered at the origin such that |p(z)| > |p(0)| whenever |z| ≥ r. The minimum of |p(z)| on D, which must exist since D is compact, is therefore achieved at some point z0 in the interior of D, but not at any point of its boundary. The maximum modulus principle applied to 1/p(z) implies that p(z0) = 0. In other words, z0 is a zero of p(z). A variation of this proof does not require the maximum modulus principle (in fact, a similar argument also gives a proof of the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions). Continuing from before the principle was invoked, if a := p(z0) ≠ 0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z − z0, we can write p(z)=a+ck(z−z0)k+ck+1(z−z0)k+1+⋯+cn(z−z0)n.(z)=a+c_k(z-z_0)^k+c_k+1(z-z_0)^k+1+⋯+c_n(z-z_0)^n. Here, the cj are simply the coefficients of the polynomial z → p(z + z0) after expansion, and k is the index of the first non-zero coefficient following the constant term. For z sufficiently close to z0 this function has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial q(z)=a+ck(z−z0)k(z)=a+c_k(z-z_0)^k. More precisely, the function |p(z)−q(z)(z−z0)k+1|≤M|p(z)-q(z)/(z-z_0)^k+1| for some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0. Therefore, if we define θ0=(arg⁡(a)+π−arg⁡(ck))/kθ_0=((a)+π-(c_k))/k and let z=z0+reiθ0=z_0+re^iθ_0 tracing a circle of radius r > 0 around z, then for any sufficiently small r (so that the bound M holds), we see that |p(z)|≤|q(z)|+rk+1|p(z)−q(z)rk+1|≤|a+(−1)ckrkei(arg⁡(a)−arg⁡(ck))|+Mrk+1=|a|−|ck|rk+Mrk+1|p(z)| ≤|q(z)|+r^k+1|p(z)-q(z)/r^k+1| ≤|a+(-1)c_kr^ke^i((a)-(c_k))|+Mr^k+1 =|a|-|c_k|r^k+Mr^k+1 When r is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |p(z)| is strictly smaller than |a|, contradicting the definition of z0. Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ0 such that if one approaches z0 from that direction one can obtain values p(z) smaller in absolute value than |p(z0)|. Another analytic proof can be obtained along this line of thought observing that, since |p(z)| > |p(0)| outside D, the minimum of |p(z)| on the whole complex plane is achieved at z0. If |p(z0)| > 0, then 1/p is a bounded holomorphic function in the entire complex plane since, for each complex number z, |1/p(z)| ≤ |1/p(z0)|. Applying Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function must be constant, this would imply that 1/p is constant and therefore that p is constant. This gives a contradiction, and hence p(z0) = 0.[13] Yet another analytic proof uses the argument principle. Let R be a positive real number large enough so that every root of p(z) has absolute value smaller than R; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree n has at most n zeros. For each r > R, consider the number 12πi∫c(r)p′(z)p(z)dz,1/2∫_c(r)p'(z)/p(z) dz, where c(r) is the circle centered at 0 with radius r oriented counterclockwise; then the argument principle says that this number is the number N of zeros of p(z) in the open ball centered at 0 with radius r, which, since r > R, is the total number of zeros of p(z). On the other hand, the integral of n/z along c(r) divided by 2πi is equal to n. But the difference between the two numbers is 12πi∫c(r)(p′(z)p(z)−nz)dz=12πi∫c(r)zp′(z)−np(z)zp(z)dz.1/2∫_c(r)(p'(z)/p(z)-n/z)dz=1/2∫_c(r)zp'(z)-np(z)/zp(z) dz. The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most n − 1 and the degree of the denominator is n + 1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as r → +∞. But the number is also equal to N − n and so N = n. Another complex-analytic proof can be given by combining linear algebra with the Cauchy theorem. To establish that every complex polynomial of degree n > 0 has a zero, it suffices to show that every complex square matrix of size n > 0 has a (complex) eigenvalue.[14] The proof of the latter statement is by contradiction. Let A be a complex square matrix of size n > 0 and let In be the unit matrix of the same size. Assume A has no eigenvalues. Consider the resolvent function R(z)=(zIn−A)−1,(z)=(zI_n-A)^-1, which is a meromorphic function on the complex plane with values in the vector space of matrices. The eigenvalues of A are precisely the poles of R(z). Since, by assumption, A has no eigenvalues, the function R(z) is an entire function and Cauchy theorem implies that ∫c(r)R(z)dz=0.∫_c(r)R(z) dz=0. On the other hand, R(z) expanded as a geometric series gives: R(z)=z−1(In−z−1A)−1=z−1∑k=0∞1zkAk⋅(z)=z^-1(I_n-z^-1A)^-1=z^-1∑_k=0^∞1/z^kA^k· This formula is valid outside the closed disc of radius ‖A‖A (the operator norm of A). Let r>‖A‖.>A. Then ∫c(r)R(z)dz=∑k=0∞∫c(r)dzzk+1Ak=2πiIn∫_c(r)R(z)dz=∑_k=0^∞∫_c(r)dz/z^k+1A^k=2_n (in which only the summand k = 0 has a nonzero integral). This is a contradiction, and so A has an eigenvalue. Finally, Rouché's theorem gives perhaps the shortest proof of the theorem. Topological
