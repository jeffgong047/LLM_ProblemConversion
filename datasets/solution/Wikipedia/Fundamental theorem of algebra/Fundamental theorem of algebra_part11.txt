proofs: There exists still another way to approach the fundamental theorem of algebra, due to J. M. Almira and A. Romero: by Riemannian geometric arguments. The main idea here is to prove that the existence of a non-constant polynomial p(z) without zeros implies the existence of a flat Riemannian metric over the sphere S2. This leads to a contradiction since the sphere is not flat. A Riemannian surface (M, g) is said to be flat if its Gaussian curvature, which we denote by Kg, is identically null. Now, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, when applied to the sphere S2, claims that ∫S2Kg=4π,∫_𝐒^2K_g=4π, which proves that the sphere is not flat. Let us now assume that n > 0 and p(z)=a0+a1z+⋯+anzn≠0(z)=a_0+a_1z+⋯+a_nz^n≠0 for each complex number z. Let us define p∗(z)=znp(1z)=a0zn+a1zn−1+⋯+an.^*(z)=z^np(1z)=a_0z^n+a_1z^n-1+⋯+a_n. Obviously, p*(z) ≠ 0 for all z in C. Consider the polynomial f(z) = p(z)p*(z). Then f(z) ≠ 0 for each z in C. Furthermore, f(1w)=p(1w)p∗(1w)=w−2np∗(w)p(w)=w−2nf(w).(1w)=p(1w)p^*(1w)=w^-2np^*(w)p(w)=w^-2nf(w). We can use this functional equation to prove that g, given by g=1|f(w)|2n|dw|2=1/|f(w)|^2/n |dw|^2 for w in C, and g=1|f(1w)|2n|d(1w)|2=1/|f(1w)|^2/n|d(1w)|^2 for w ∈ S2\{0}, is a well defined Riemannian metric over the sphere S2 (which we identify with the extended complex plane C ∪ {∞}). Now, a simple computation shows that ∀w∈C:1|f(w)|1nKg=1nΔlog⁡|f(w)|=1nΔRe(log⁡f(w))=0,∈𝐂: 1/|f(w)|^1/nK_g=1/nΔlog|f(w)|=1/nΔRe((w))=0, since the real part of an analytic function is harmonic. This proves that Kg = 0.
