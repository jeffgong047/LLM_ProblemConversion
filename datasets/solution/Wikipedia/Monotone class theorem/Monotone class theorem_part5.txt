Proof: The following argument originates in Rick Durrett's Probability: Theory and Examples.[1] Proof The assumption Ω∈A,Ω ∈𝒜, (2), and (3) imply that G=A:1A∈H𝒢={A:1_A∈ℋ} is a 𝜆-system. By (1) and the π−𝜆 theorem, σ(A)⊆G.σ(𝒜)⊆𝒢. Statement (2) implies that Hℋ contains all simple functions, and then (3) implies that Hℋ contains all bounded functions measurable with respect to σ(A).σ(𝒜). Results and
