In measure theory and probability, the monotone class theorem connects monotone classes and 𝜎-algebras. The theorem says that the smallest monotone class containing an algebra of sets G is precisely the smallest 𝜎-algebra containing G.. It is used as a type of transfinite induction to prove many other theorems, such as Fubini's theorem.


Definition of a monotone class[edit]
A monotone class is a family (i.e. class) M of sets that is closed under countable monotone unions and also under countable monotone intersections. Explicitly, this means M has the following properties:

if A1,A2,…∈M_1,A_2,… and A1⊆A2⊆⋯_1_2⊆⋯ then ⋃i=1∞Ai∈M,⋃_i=1^∞A_i, and
if B1,B2,…∈M_1,B_2,… and B1⊇B2⊇⋯_1_2⊇⋯ then ⋂i=1∞Bi∈M.⋂_i=1^∞B_i.
Monotone class theorem for sets[edit]

Monotone class theorem for sets — Let G be an algebra of sets and define M(G)(G) to be the smallest monotone class containing G.. Then M(G)(G) is precisely the 𝜎-algebra generated by G; that is σ(G)=M(G).σ(G)=M(G).


Monotone class theorem for functions[edit]

Monotone class theorem for functions — Let A𝒜 be a π-system that contains ΩΩ  and let Hℋ be a collection of functions from ΩΩ to Rℝ with the following properties:

If A∈A∈𝒜 then 1A∈H1_A∈ℋ where 1A1_A denotes the indicator function of A..
If f,g∈H,g∈ℋ and c∈R∈ℝ then f+g+g and cf∈H.∈ℋ.
If fn∈H_n∈ℋ is a sequence of non-negative functions that increase to a bounded function f then f∈H.∈ℋ.
Then Hℋ contains all bounded functions that are measurable with respect to σ(A),σ(𝒜), which is the 𝜎-algebra generated by A.𝒜.


Proof[edit]
The following argument originates in Rick Durrett's Probability: Theory and Examples.[1]

Proof
The assumption Ω∈A,Ω ∈𝒜, (2), and (3) imply that G=A:1A∈H𝒢={A:1_A∈ℋ} is a 𝜆-system. 
By (1) and the π−𝜆 theorem, σ(A)⊆G.σ(𝒜)⊆𝒢. 
Statement (2) implies that Hℋ contains all simple functions, and then (3) implies that Hℋ contains all bounded functions measurable with respect to σ(A).σ(𝒜).


Results and applications[edit]
As a corollary, if G is a ring of sets, then the smallest monotone class containing it coincides with the 𝜎-ring of G..
By invoking this theorem, one can use monotone classes to help verify that a certain collection of subsets is a 𝜎-algebra.
The monotone class theorem for functions can be a powerful tool that allows statements about particularly simple classes of functions to be generalized to arbitrary bounded and measurable functions.
