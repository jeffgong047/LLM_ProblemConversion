applications: As a corollary, if G is a ring of sets, then the smallest monotone class containing it coincides with the 𝜎-ring of G.. By invoking this theorem, one can use monotone classes to help verify that a certain collection of subsets is a 𝜎-algebra. The monotone class theorem for functions can be a powerful tool that allows statements about particularly simple classes of functions to be generalized to arbitrary bounded and measurable functions.
