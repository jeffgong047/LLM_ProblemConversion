In measure theory and probability, the monotone class theorem connects monotone classes and 𝜎-algebras. The theorem says that the smallest monotone class containing an algebra of sets G is precisely the smallest 𝜎-algebra containing G.. It is used as a type of transfinite induction to prove many other theorems, such as Fubini's theorem. Definition of a monotone
