functions: Monotone class theorem for functions — Let A𝒜 be a π-system that contains ΩΩ and let Hℋ be a collection of functions from ΩΩ to Rℝ with the following properties: If A∈A∈𝒜 then 1A∈H1_A∈ℋ where 1A1_A denotes the indicator function of A.. If f,g∈H,g∈ℋ and c∈R∈ℝ then f+g+g and cf∈H.∈ℋ. If fn∈H_n∈ℋ is a sequence of non-negative functions that increase to a bounded function f then f∈H.∈ℋ. Then Hℋ contains all bounded functions that are measurable with respect to σ(A),σ(𝒜), which is the 𝜎-algebra generated by A.𝒜.
