class: A monotone class is a family (i.e. class) M of sets that is closed under countable monotone unions and also under countable monotone intersections. Explicitly, this means M has the following properties: if A1,A2,…∈M_1,A_2,… and A1⊆A2⊆⋯_1_2⊆⋯ then ⋃i=1∞Ai∈M,⋃_i=1^∞A_i, and if B1,B2,…∈M_1,B_2,… and B1⊇B2⊇⋯_1_2⊇⋯ then ⋂i=1∞Bi∈M.⋂_i=1^∞B_i.
