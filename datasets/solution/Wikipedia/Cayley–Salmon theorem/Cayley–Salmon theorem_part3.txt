surface: Most proofs of rationality for cubic surfaces start by finding a line on the surface. (In the context of projective geometry, a line in P3𝐏^3 is isomorphic to P1𝐏^1.) More precisely, Arthur Cayley and George Salmon showed in 1849 that every smooth cubic surface over an algebraically closed field contains exactly 27 lines.[5] This is a distinctive feature of cubics: a smooth quadric (degree 2) surface is covered by a continuous family of lines, while most surfaces of degree at least 4 in P3𝐏^3 contain no lines. Another useful technique for finding the 27 lines involves Schubert calculus which computes the number of lines using the intersection theory of the Grassmannian of lines on P3𝐏^3. As the coefficients of a smooth complex cubic surface are varied, the 27 lines move continuously. As a result, a closed loop in the family of smooth cubic surfaces determines a permutation of the 27 lines. The group of permutations of the 27 lines arising this way is called the monodromy group of the family of cubic surfaces. A remarkable 19th-century discovery was that the monodromy group is neither trivial nor the whole symmetric group S27_27; it is a group of order 51840, acting transitively on the set of lines.[4] This group was gradually recognized (by Élie Cartan (1896), Arthur Coble (1915-17), and Patrick du Val (1936)) as the Weyl group of type E6_6, a group generated by reflections on a 6-dimensional real vector space, related to the Lie group E6_6 of dimension 78.[4] The same group of order 51840 can be described in combinatorial terms, as the automorphism group of the graph of the 27 lines, with a vertex for each line and an edge whenever two lines meet.[6] This graph was analyzed in the 19th century using subgraphs such as the Schläfli double six configuration. The complementary graph (with an edge whenever two lines are disjoint) is known as the Schläfli graph. The Schläfli graph Many problems about cubic surfaces can be solved using the combinatorics of the E6_6 root system. For example, the 27 lines can be identified with the weights of the fundamental representation of the Lie group E6_6. The possible sets of singularities that can occur on a cubic surface can be described in terms of subsystems of the E6_6 root system.[7] One explanation for this connection is that the E6_6 lattice arises as the orthogonal complement to the anticanonical class −KX-K_X in the Picard group Pic⁡(X)≅Z7Pic(X)≅𝐙^7, with its intersection form (coming from the intersection theory of curves on a surface). For a smooth complex cubic surface, the Picard lattice can also be identified with the cohomology group H2(X,Z)^2(X,𝐙). An Eckardt point is a point where 3 of the 27 lines meet. Most cubic surfaces have no Eckardt point, but such points occur on a codimension-1 subset of the family of all smooth cubic surfaces.[8] Given an identification between a cubic surface on X and the blow-up of P2𝐏^2 at 6 points in general position, the 27 lines on X can be viewed as: the 6 exceptional curves created by blowing up, the birational transforms of the 15 lines through pairs of the 6 points in P2𝐏^2, and the birational transforms of the 6 conics containing all but one of the 6 points.[9] A given cubic surface can be viewed as a blow-up of P2𝐏^2 in more than one way (in fact, in 72 different ways), and so a description as a blow-up does not reveal the symmetry among all 27 of the lines. The relation between cubic surfaces and the E6_6 root system generalizes to a relation between all del Pezzo surfaces and root systems. This is one of many ADE classifications in mathematics. Pursuing these analogies, Vera Serganova and Alexei Skorobogatov gave a direct geometric relation between cubic surfaces and the Lie group E6_6.[10] In physics, the 27 lines can be identified with the 27 possible charges of M-theory on a six-dimensional torus (6 momenta; 15 membranes; 6 fivebranes) and the group E6 then naturally acts as the U-duality group. This map between del Pezzo surfaces and M-theory on tori is known as mysterious duality. Special cubic
