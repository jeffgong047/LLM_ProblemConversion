field: A smooth cubic surface X over a field k which is not algebraically closed need not be rational over k. As an extreme case, there are smooth cubic surfaces over the rational numbers Q (or the p-adic numbers Qp𝐐_p) with no rational points, in which case X is certainly not rational.[17] If X(k) is nonempty, then X is at least unirational over k, by Beniamino Segre and János Kollár.[18] For k infinite, unirationality implies that the set of k-rational points is Zariski dense in X. The absolute Galois group of k permutes the 27 lines of X over the algebraic closure k¯k of k (through some subgroup of the Weyl group of E6_6). If some orbit of this action consists of disjoint lines, then X is the blow-up of a "simpler" del Pezzo surface over k at a closed point. Otherwise, X has Picard number 1. (The Picard group of X is a subgroup of the geometric Picard group Pic⁡(Xk¯)≅Z7Pic(X_k)≅𝐙^7.) In the latter case, Segre showed that X is never rational. More strongly, Yuri Manin proved a birational rigidity statement: two smooth cubic surfaces with Picard number 1 over a perfect field k are birational if and only if they are isomorphic.[19] For example, these results give many cubic surfaces over Q that are unirational but not rational.
