surfaces: In contrast to the complex case, the space of smooth cubic surfaces over the real numbers is not connected in the classical topology (based on the topology of R). Its connected components (in other words, the classification of smooth real cubic surfaces up to isotopy) were determined by Ludwig Schläfli (1863), Felix Klein (1865), and H. G. Zeuthen (1875).[12] Namely, there are 5 isotopy classes of smooth real cubic surfaces X in P3𝐏^3, distinguished by the topology of the space of real points X(R)(𝐑). The space of real points is diffeomorphic to either W7,W5,W3,W1_7,W_5,W_3,W_1, or the disjoint union of W1_1 and the 2-sphere, where Wr_r denotes the connected sum of r copies of the real projective plane RP2𝐑𝐏^2. Correspondingly, the number of real lines contained in X is 27, 15, 7, 3, or 3. A smooth real cubic surface is rational over R if and only if its space of real points is connected, hence in the first four of the previous five cases.[13] The average number of real lines on X is 62−36√(2)-3[14] when the defining polynomial for X is sampled at random from the Gaussian ensemble induced by the Bombieri inner product.
