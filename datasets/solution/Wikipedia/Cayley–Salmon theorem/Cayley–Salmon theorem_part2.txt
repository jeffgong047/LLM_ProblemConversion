surfaces: A central feature of smooth cubic surfaces X over an algebraically closed field is that they are all rational, as shown by Alfred Clebsch in 1866.[1] That is, there is a one-to-one correspondence defined by rational functions between the projective plane P2𝐏^2 minus a lower-dimensional subset and X minus a lower-dimensional subset. More generally, every irreducible cubic surface (possibly singular) over an algebraically closed field is rational unless it is the projective cone over a cubic curve.[2] In this respect, cubic surfaces are much simpler than smooth surfaces of degree at least 4 in P3𝐏^3, which are never rational. In characteristic zero, smooth surfaces of degree at least 4 in P3𝐏^3 are not even uniruled.[3] More strongly, Clebsch showed that every smooth cubic surface in P3𝐏^3 over an algebraically closed field is isomorphic to the blow-up of P2𝐏^2 at 6 points.[4] As a result, every smooth cubic surface over the complex numbers is diffeomorphic to the connected sum CP2#6(−CP2)𝐂𝐏^2#6(-𝐂𝐏^2), where the minus sign refers to a change of orientation. Conversely, the blow-up of P2𝐏^2 at 6 points is isomorphic to a cubic surface if and only if the points are in general position, meaning that no three points lie on a line and all 6 do not lie on a conic. As a complex manifold (or an algebraic variety), the surface depends on the arrangement of those 6 points. 27 lines on a cubic
