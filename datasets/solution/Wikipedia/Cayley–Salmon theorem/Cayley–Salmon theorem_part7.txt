curves: The lines on a cubic surface X over an algebraically closed field can be described intrinsically, without reference to the embedding of X in P3𝐏^3: they are exactly the (−1)-curves on X, meaning the curves isomorphic to P1𝐏^1 that have self-intersection −1. Also, the classes of lines in the Picard lattice of X (or equivalently the divisor class group) are exactly the elements u of Pic(X) such that u2=−1^2=-1 and −KX⋅u=1-K_X=1. (This uses that the restriction of the hyperplane line bundle O(1) on P3𝐏^3 to X is the anticanonical line bundle −KX-K_X, by the adjunction formula.) For any projective variety X, the cone of curves means the convex cone spanned by all curves in X (in the real vector space N1(X)_1(X) of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence, or in the homology group H2(X,R)_2(X,𝐑) if the base field is the complex numbers). For a cubic surface, the cone of curves is spanned by the 27 lines.[16] In particular, it is a rational polyhedral cone in N1(X)≅R7_1(X)≅𝐑^7 with a large symmetry group, the Weyl group of E6_6. There is a similar description of the cone of curves for any del Pezzo surface. Cubic surfaces over a
