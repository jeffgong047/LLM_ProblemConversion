surfaces: The smooth complex cubic surface in P3𝐏^3 with the largest automorphism group is the Fermat cubic surface, defined by x3+y3+z3+w3=0.^3+y^3+z^3+w^3=0. Its automorphism group is an extension 33:S43^3:S_4, of order 648.[11] The next most symmetric smooth cubic surface is the Clebsch surface, which can be defined in P4𝐏^4 by the two equations x0+x1+x2+x3+x4=x03+x13+x23+x33+x43=0._0+x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3+x_4^3=0. Its automorphism group is the symmetric group S5_5, of order 120. After a complex linear change of coordinates, the Clebsch surface can also be defined by the equation x2y+y2z+z2w+w2x=0^2y+y^2z+z^2w+w^2x=0 in P3𝐏^3. Cayley's nodal cubic surface Among singular complex cubic surfaces, Cayley's nodal cubic surface is the unique surface with the maximal number of nodes, 4: wxy+xyz+yzw+zwx=0.+xyz+yzw+zwx=0. Its automorphism group is S4_4, of order 24. Real cubic
