theorems: Let F𝔽 be a finite field and fjj=1r⊆F[X1,…,Xn]{f_j}_j=1^r⊆𝔽[X_1,…,X_n] be a set of polynomials such that the number of variables satisfies n>∑j=1rdj>∑_j=1^rd_j where dj_j is the total degree of fj_j. The theorems are statements about the solutions of the following system of polynomial equations fj(x1,…,xn)=0forj=1,…,r._j(x_1,…,x_n)=0 for j=1,…,r. The Chevalley–Warning theorem states that the number of common solutions (a1,…,an)∈Fn(a_1,…,a_n)∈𝔽^n is divisible by the characteristic p of F𝔽. Or in other words, the cardinality of the vanishing set of fjj=1r{f_j}_j=1^r is 00 modulo p. The Chevalley theorem states that if the system has the trivial solution (0,…,0)∈Fn(0,…,0)∈𝔽^n, that is, if the polynomials have no constant terms, then the system also has a non-trivial solution (a1,…,an)∈Fn∖(0,…,0)(a_1,…,a_n)∈𝔽^n\{(0,…,0)}. Chevalley's theorem is an immediate consequence of the Chevalley–Warning theorem since p is at least 2. Both theorems are best possible in the sense that, given any n, the list fj=xj,j=1,…,n_j=x_j,j=1,…,n has total degree n and only the trivial solution. Alternatively, using just one polynomial, we can take f1 to be the degree n polynomial given by the norm of x1a1 + ... + xnan where the elements a form a basis of the finite field of order pn. Warning proved another theorem, known as Warning's second theorem, which states that if the system of polynomial equations has the trivial solution, then it has at least qn−d^n-d solutions where q is the size of the finite field and d:=d1+⋯+dr:=d_1+…+d_r. Chevalley's theorem also follows directly from this. Proof of Warning's
