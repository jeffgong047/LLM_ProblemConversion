theorem: The Ax–Katz theorem, named after James Ax and Nicholas Katz, determines more accurately a power qb^b of the cardinality q of F𝔽 dividing the number of solutions; here, if d is the largest of the dj_j, then the exponent b can be taken as the ceiling function of n−∑jdjd.n-∑_jd_j/d. The Ax–Katz result has an interpretation in étale cohomology as a divisibility result for the (reciprocals of) the zeroes and poles of the local zeta-function. Namely, the same power of q divides each of these algebraic integers. See
