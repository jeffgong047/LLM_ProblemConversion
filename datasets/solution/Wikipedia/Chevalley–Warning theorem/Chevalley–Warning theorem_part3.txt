theorem: Remark: If i<q−1<q-1 then ∑x∈Fxi=0∑_x∈𝔽x^i=0 so the sum over Fn𝔽^n of any polynomial in x1,…,xn_1,…,x_n of degree less than n(q−1)(q-1) also vanishes. The total number of common solutions modulo p of f1,…,fr=0_1,…,f_r=0 is equal to ∑x∈Fn(1−f1q−1(x))⋅…⋅(1−frq−1(x))∑_x∈𝔽^n(1-f_1^q-1(x))·…·(1-f_r^q-1(x)) because each term is 1 for a solution and 0 otherwise. If the sum of the degrees of the polynomials fi_i is less than n then this vanishes by the remark above. Artin's
