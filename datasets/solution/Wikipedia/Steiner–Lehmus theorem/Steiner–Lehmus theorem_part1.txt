Every triangle with two angle bisectors of equal lengths is isosceles |AE|=|BD|,α=β,γ=δ|AE|=|BD|, α=β, γ=δ ⟹△ABCisisoscelesisisosceles The Steiner–Lehmus theorem, a theorem in elementary geometry, was formulated by C. L. Lehmus and subsequently proved by Jakob Steiner. It states: Every triangle with two angle bisectors of equal lengths is isosceles. The theorem was first mentioned in 1840 in a letter by C. L. Lehmus to C. Sturm, in which he asked for a purely geometric proof. Sturm passed the request on to other mathematicians and Steiner was among the first to provide a solution. The theorem became a rather popular topic in elementary geometry ever since with a somewhat regular publication of articles on it.[1][2][3] Direct
