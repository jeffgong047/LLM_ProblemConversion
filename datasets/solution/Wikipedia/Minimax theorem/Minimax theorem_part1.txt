Not to be confused with Min-max theorem. Gives conditions that guarantee the max–min inequality is also an equality In the mathematical area of game theory, a minimax theorem is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the max–min inequality is also an equality. The first theorem in this sense is von Neumann's minimax theorem about zero-sum games published in 1928,[1] which was considered the starting point of game theory. Von Neumann is quoted as saying "As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games ... without that theorem ... I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved".[2] Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.[3][4]The function f(x, y) = y2 − x2 is concave-convex. Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states: Let X⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n and Y⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m be compact convex sets. If f:X×Y→R:X→ℝ is a continuous function that is concave-convex, i.e. f(⋅,y):X→R(·,y):X→ℝ is concave for fixed y, and f(x,⋅):Y→R(x,·):Y→ℝ is convex for fixed x. Then we have that maxx∈Xminy∈Yf(x,y)=miny∈Ymaxx∈Xf(x,y).max_xmin_yf(x,y)=min_ymax_xf(x,y). Special case: Bilinear
