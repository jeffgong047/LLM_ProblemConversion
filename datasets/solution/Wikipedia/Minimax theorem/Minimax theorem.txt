Not to be confused with Min-max theorem.
Gives conditions that guarantee the max–min inequality is also an equality
In the mathematical area of game theory, a minimax theorem is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the max–min inequality is also an equality. 
The first theorem in this sense is von Neumann's minimax theorem about zero-sum games published in 1928,[1] which was considered the starting point of game theory. Von Neumann is quoted as saying "As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games ... without that theorem ... I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved".[2]

Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.[3][4]The function f(x, y) = y2 − x2 is concave-convex.
Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:
Let X⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n and Y⊂Rm⊂ℝ^m be compact convex sets. If f:X×Y→R:X→ℝ is a continuous function that is concave-convex, i.e.

f(⋅,y):X→R(·,y):X→ℝ is concave for fixed y, and
f(x,⋅):Y→R(x,·):Y→ℝ is convex for fixed x.
Then we have that

maxx∈Xminy∈Yf(x,y)=miny∈Ymaxx∈Xf(x,y).max_xmin_yf(x,y)=min_ymax_xf(x,y).
Special case: Bilinear function[edit]
The theorem holds in particular if f(x,y)(x,y) is a linear function in both of its arguments (and therefore is bilinear) since a linear function is both concave and convex. Thus, if f(x,y)=xTAy(x,y)=x^𝖳Ay for a finite matrix A∈Rn×m∈ℝ^n, we have:

maxx∈Xminy∈YxTAy=miny∈Ymaxx∈XxTAy.max_xmin_yx^𝖳Ay=min_ymax_xx^𝖳Ay.
The bilinear special case is particularly important for zero-sum games, when the strategy set of each player consists of lotteries over actions (mixed strategies), and payoffs are induced by expected value. In the above formulation, A is the payoff matrix.
