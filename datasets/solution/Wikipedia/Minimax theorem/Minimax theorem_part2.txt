function: The theorem holds in particular if f(x,y)(x,y) is a linear function in both of its arguments (and therefore is bilinear) since a linear function is both concave and convex. Thus, if f(x,y)=xTAy(x,y)=x^𝖳Ay for a finite matrix A∈Rn×m∈ℝ^n, we have: maxx∈Xminy∈YxTAy=miny∈Ymaxx∈XxTAy.max_xmin_yx^𝖳Ay=min_ymax_xx^𝖳Ay. The bilinear special case is particularly important for zero-sum games, when the strategy set of each player consists of lotteries over actions (mixed strategies), and payoffs are induced by expected value. In the above formulation, A is the payoff matrix. See
