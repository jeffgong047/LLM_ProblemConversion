Statement: Suppose that L is a division ring. The Jacobsonâ€“Bourbaki theorem states that there is a natural 1:1 correspondence between: Division rings K in L of finite index n (in other words L is a finite-dimensional left vector space over K). Unital K-algebras of finite dimension n (as K-vector spaces) contained in the ring of endomorphisms of the additive group of K. The sub division ring and the corresponding subalgebra are each other's commutants. Jacobson (1956, Chapter 7.2) gave an extension to sub division rings that might have infinite index, which correspond to closed subalgebras in the finite topology.
