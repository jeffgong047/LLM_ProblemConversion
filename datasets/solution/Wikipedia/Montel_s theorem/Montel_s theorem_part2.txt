normal: The first, and simpler, version of the theorem states that a family of holomorphic functions defined on an open subset of the complex numbers is normal if and only if it is locally uniformly bounded. This theorem has the following formally stronger corollary. Suppose that Fℱ is a family of meromorphic functions on an open set D. If z0∈D_0 is such that Fℱ is not normal at z0_0, and U⊂D is a neighborhood of z0_0, then ⋃f∈Ff(U)⋃_f∈ℱf(U) is dense in the complex plane. Functions omitting two
