Proofs: The first version of Montel's theorem is a direct consequence of Marty's Theorem (which states that a family is normal if and only if the spherical derivatives are locally bounded) and Cauchy's integral formula.[1] This theorem has also been called the Stieltjes–Osgood theorem, after Thomas Joannes Stieltjes and William Fogg Osgood.[2] The Corollary stated above is deduced as follows. Suppose that all the functions in Fℱ omit the same neighborhood of the point z1_1. By postcomposing with the map z↦1z−z1↦1/z-z_1 we obtain a uniformly bounded family, which is normal by the first version of the theorem. The second version of Montel's theorem can be deduced from the first by using the fact that there exists a holomorphic universal covering from the unit disk to the twice punctured plane C∖a,bℂ∖{a,b}. (Such a covering is given by the elliptic modular function). This version of Montel's theorem can be also derived from Picard's theorem, by using Zalcman's lemma. Relationship to theorems for entire
