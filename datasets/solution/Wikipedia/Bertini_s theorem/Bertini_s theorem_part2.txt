varieties: Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety over an algebraically closed field, embedded in a projective space Pn𝐏^n. Let |H||H| denote the complete system of hyperplane divisors in Pn𝐏^n. Recall that it is the dual space (Pn)⋆(𝐏^n)^⋆ of Pn𝐏^n and is isomorphic to Pn𝐏^n. The theorem of Bertini states that the set of hyperplanes not containing X and with smooth intersection with X contains an open dense subset of the total system of divisors |H||H|. The set itself is open if X is projective. If dim⁡(X)≥2(X)≥2, then these intersections (called hyperplane sections of X) are connected, hence irreducible. The theorem hence asserts that a general hyperplane section not equal to X is smooth, that is: the property of smoothness is generic. Over an arbitrary field k, there is a dense open subset of the dual space (Pn)⋆(𝐏^n)^⋆ whose rational points define hyperplanes smooth hyperplane sections of X. When k is infinite, this open subset then has infinitely many rational points and there are infinitely many smooth hyperplane sections in X. Over a finite field, the above open subset may not contain rational points and in general there is no hyperplanes with smooth intersection with X. However, if we take hypersurfaces of sufficiently big degrees, then the theorem of Bertini holds.[3] Outline of a
