Generalizations: The theorem of Bertini has been generalized in various ways. For example, a result due to Steven Kleiman asserts the following (cf. Kleiman's theorem): for a connected algebraic group G, and any homogeneous G-variety X, and two varieties Y and Z mapping to X, let Yσ be the variety obtained by letting σ ∈ G act on Y. Then, there is an open dense subscheme H of G such that for σ ∈ H, Yσ×XZ^σ×_XZ is either empty or purely of the (expected) dimension dim Y + dim Z − dim X. If, in addition, Y and Z are smooth and the base field has characteristic zero, then H may be taken such that Yσ×XZ^σ×_XZ is smooth for all σ∈Hσ, as well. The above theorem of Bertini is the special case where X=Pn=ℙ^n is expressed as the quotient of SLn by the parabolic subgroup of upper triangular matrices, Z is a subvariety and Y is a hyperplane.[5] Theorem of Bertini has also been generalized to discrete valuation domains or finite fields, or for étale coverings of X. The theorem is often used for induction steps. See
