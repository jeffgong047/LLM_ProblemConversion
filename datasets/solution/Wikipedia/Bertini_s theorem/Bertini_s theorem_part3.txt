proof: We consider the subfibration of the product variety X×|H|×|H| with fiber above x∈X the linear system of hyperplanes that intersect X non-transversally at x. The rank of the fibration in the product is one less than the codimension of X⊂Pn⊂𝐏^n, so that the total space has lesser dimension than n and so its projection is contained in a divisor of the complete system |H||H|.
