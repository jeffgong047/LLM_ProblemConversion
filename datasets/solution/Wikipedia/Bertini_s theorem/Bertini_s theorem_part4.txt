statement: Over any infinite field k of characteristic 0, if X is a smooth quasi-projective k-variety, a general member of a linear system of divisors on X is smooth away from the base locus of the system. For clarification, this means that given a linear system f:X→Pn:X→𝐏^n, the preimage f−1(H)^-1(H) of a hyperplane H is smooth -- outside the base locus of f -- for all hyperplanes H in some dense open subset of the dual projective space (Pn)⋆(𝐏^n)^⋆. This theorem also holds in characteristic p>0 when the linear system f is unramified. [4]
