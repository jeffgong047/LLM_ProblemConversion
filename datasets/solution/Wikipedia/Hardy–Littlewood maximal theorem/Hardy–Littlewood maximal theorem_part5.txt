Applications: Some applications of the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Inequality include proving the following results: Lebesgue differentiation theorem Rademacher differentiation theorem Fatou's theorem on nontangential convergence. Fractional integration theorem Here we use a standard trick involving the maximal function to give a quick proof of Lebesgue differentiation theorem. (But remember that in the proof of the maximal theorem, we used the Vitali covering lemma.) Let f ∈ L1(Rn) and Ωf(x)=limsupr→0fr(x)−liminfr→0fr(x)(x)=lim sup_r→0f_r(x)-lim inf_r→0f_r(x) where fr(x)=1|B(x,r)|∫B(x,r)f(y)dy._r(x)=1/|B(x,r)|∫_B(x,r)f(y)dy. We write f = h + g where h is continuous and has compact support and g ∈ L1(Rn) with norm that can be made arbitrary small. Then Ωf≤Ωg+Ωh=Ωg≤+= by continuity. Now, Ωg ≤ 2Mg and so, by the theorem, we have: |Ωg>ε|≤2Mε‖g‖1|{>ε}|≤2 M/εg_1 Now, we can let ‖g‖1→0g_1→0 and conclude Ωf = 0 almost everywhere; that is, limr→0fr(x)lim_r→0f_r(x) exists for almost all x. It remains to show the limit actually equals f(x). But this is easy: it is known that ‖fr−f‖1→0f_r-f_1→0 (approximation of the identity) and thus there is a subsequence frk→f_r_k almost everywhere. By the uniqueness of limit, fr → f almost everywhere then.
