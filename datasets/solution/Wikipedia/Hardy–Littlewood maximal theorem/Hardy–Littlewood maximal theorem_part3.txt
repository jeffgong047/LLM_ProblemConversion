inequality: This theorem of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood states that M is bounded as a sublinear operator from Lp(Rd) to itself for p > 1. That is, if f ∈ Lp(Rd) then the maximal function Mf is weak L1-bounded and Mf ∈ Lp(Rd). Before stating the theorem more precisely, for simplicity, let {f > t} denote the set {x | f(x) > t}. Now we have: Theorem (Weak Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1, there is a constant Cd > 0 such that for all λ > 0 and f ∈ L1(Rd), we have: |Mf>λ|<Cdλ‖f‖L1(Rd).|{Mf>λ}|<C_d/λ‖_L^1(𝐑^d). With the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality in hand, the following strong-type estimate is an immediate consequence of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem: Theorem (Strong Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1, 1 < p ≤ ∞, and f ∈ Lp(Rd), there is a constant Cp,d > 0 such that ‖Mf‖Lp(Rd)≤Cp,d‖f‖Lp(Rd).‖_L^p(𝐑^d)_p,d‖_L^p(𝐑^d). In the strong type estimate the best bounds for Cp,d are unknown.[1] However subsequently Elias M. Stein used the Calderón-Zygmund method of rotations to prove the following: Theorem (Dimension Independence). For 1 < p ≤ ∞ one can pick Cp,d = Cp independent of d.[1][2]
