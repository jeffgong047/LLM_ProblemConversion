Definition: The operator takes a locally integrable function f : Rd → C and returns another function Mf. For any point x ∈ Rd, the function Mf returns the maximum of a set of reals, namely the set of average values of f for all the balls B(x, r) of any radius r at x. Formally, Mf(x)=supr>01|B(x,r)|∫B(x,r)|f(y)|dy(x)=sup_r>01/|B(x,r)|∫_B(x,r)|f(y)| dy where |E| denotes the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure of a subset E ⊂ Rd. The averages are jointly continuous in x and r, therefore the maximal function Mf, being the supremum over r > 0, is measurable. It is not obvious that Mf is finite almost everywhere. This is a corollary of the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality. Hardy–Littlewood maximal
