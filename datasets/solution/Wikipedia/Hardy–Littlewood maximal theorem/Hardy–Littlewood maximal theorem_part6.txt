Discussion: It is still unknown what the smallest constants Cp,d and Cd are in the above inequalities. However, a result of Elias Stein about spherical maximal functions can be used to show that, for 1 < p < ∞, we can remove the dependence of Cp,d on the dimension, that is, Cp,d = Cp for some constant Cp > 0 only depending on p. It is unknown whether there is a weak bound that is independent of dimension. There are several common variants of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator which replace the averages over centered balls with averages over different families of sets. For instance, one can define the uncentered HL maximal operator (using the notation of Stein-Shakarchi) f∗(x)=supx∈Bx1|Bx|∫Bx|f(y)|dy^*(x)=sup_x_x1/|B_x|∫_B_x|f(y)|dy where the balls Bx are required to merely contain x, rather than be centered at x. There is also the dyadic HL maximal operator MΔf(x)=supx∈Qx1|Qx|∫Qx|f(y)|dy_Δf(x)=sup_x_x1/|Q_x|∫_Q_x|f(y)|dy where Qx ranges over all dyadic cubes containing the point x. Both of these operators satisfy the HL maximal inequality. See
