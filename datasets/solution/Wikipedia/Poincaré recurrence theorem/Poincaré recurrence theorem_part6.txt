2: The following is a topological version of this theorem: If X is a second-countable Hausdorff space and ΣΣ contains the Borel sigma-algebra, then the set of recurrent points of f has full measure. That is, almost every point is recurrent. More generally, the theorem applies to conservative systems, and not just to measure-preserving dynamical systems. Roughly speaking, one can say that conservative systems are precisely those to which the recurrence theorem applies. Quantum mechanical
