1: For any E∈Σ∈Σ, the set of those points x of E for which there exists N∈N∈ℕ such that fn(x)∉E^n(x) for all n>N>N has zero measure. In other words, almost every point of E returns to E. In fact, almost every point returns infinitely often; i.e. μ(x∈E:thereexistsNsuchthatfn(x)∉Eforalln>N)=0.μ({x:thereexistsNsuchthatf^n(x)foralln>N})=0. Theorem
