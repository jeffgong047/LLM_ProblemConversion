version: For time-independent quantum mechanical systems with discrete energy eigenstates, a similar theorem holds. For every ε>0ε>0 and T0>0_0>0 there exists a time T larger than T0_0, such that ||ψ(T)⟩−|ψ(0)⟩|<ε||ψ(T)⟩-|ψ(0)⟩|<ε, where |ψ(t)⟩|ψ(t)⟩ denotes the state vector of the system at time t.[7][8][9] The essential elements of the proof are as follows. The system evolves in time according to: |ψ(t)⟩=∑n=0∞cnexp⁡(−iEnt)|ϕn⟩|ψ(t)⟩=∑_n=0^∞c_nexp(-iE_nt)|ϕ_n⟩ where the En_n are the energy eigenvalues (we use natural units, so ℏ=1ħ=1 ), and the |ϕn⟩|ϕ_n⟩ are the energy eigenstates. The squared norm of the difference of the state vector at time T and time zero, can be written as: ||ψ(T)⟩−|ψ(0)⟩|2=2∑n=0∞|cn|2[1−cos⁡(EnT)]||ψ(T)⟩-|ψ(0)⟩|^2=2∑_n=0^∞|c_n|^2[1-cos(E_nT)] We can truncate the summation at some n = N independent of T, because ∑n=N+1∞|cn|2[1−cos⁡(EnT)]≤2∑n=N+1∞|cn|2∑_n=N+1^∞|c_n|^2[1-cos(E_nT)]≤2∑_n=N+1^∞|c_n|^2 which can be made arbitrarily small by increasing N, as the summation ∑n=0∞|cn|2∑_n=0^∞|c_n|^2, being the squared norm of the initial state, converges to 1. The finite sum ∑n=0N|cn|2[1−cos⁡(EnT)]∑_n=0^N|c_n|^2[1-cos(E_nT)] can be made arbitrarily small for specific choices of the time T, according to the following construction. Choose an arbitrary δ>0δ>0, and then choose T such that there are integers kn_n that satisfies |EnT−2πkn|<δ|E_nT-2_n|<δ, for all numbers 0≤n≤N0. For this specific choice of T, 1−cos⁡(EnT)<δ22.1-cos(E_nT)<δ^2/2. As such, we have: 2∑n=0N|cn|2[1−cos⁡(EnT)]<δ2∑n=0N|cn|2<δ22∑_n=0^N|c_n|^2[1-cos(E_nT)]<δ^2∑_n=0^N|c_n|^2<δ^2. The state vector |ψ(T)⟩|ψ(T)⟩ thus returns arbitrarily close to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩|ψ(0)⟩. See
