R2: Let Δ denote the collection of dyadic squares, that is, Δ=[i2k,(i+1)2k]×[j2k,(j+1)2k]:i,j,k∈Z,Δ={[i2^k,(i+1)2^k]×[j2^k,(j+1)2^k]:i,j,k∈ℤ}, where Zℤ denotes the set of integers. For a set E⊆R2⊆ℝ^2, define β(E)=diamE+∑Q∈ΔβE(3Q)2ℓ(Q)β(E)=diamE+∑_Q∈Δβ_E(3Q)^2ℓ(Q) where diam E is the diameter of E and 3Q3Q is the square with same center as Q with side length 3ℓ(Q)3ℓ(Q). Then Peter Jones's[1] analyst's traveling salesman theorem may be stated as follows: There is a number C > 0 such that whenever E is a set with such that β(E) < ∞, E can be contained in a curve with length no more than Cβ(E). Conversely (and substantially more difficult to prove), if Γ is a rectifiable curve, then β(Γ) < CH1(Γ). Generalizations and Menger
