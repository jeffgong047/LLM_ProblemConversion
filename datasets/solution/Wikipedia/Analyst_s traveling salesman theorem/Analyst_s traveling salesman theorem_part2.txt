β-numbers: A rectifiable curve has tangents at almost all of its points, where in this case "almost all" means all but a subset whose one-dimensional Hausdorff measure is zero. Accordingly, if a set is contained in a rectifiable curve, the set must look flat when zooming in on almost all of its points. This suggests that testing us whether a set could be contained in a rectifiable curve must somehow incorporate information about how flat it is when one zooms in on its points at different scales. This discussion motivates the definition of the following quantity, for a plane set E⊂R2⊂ℝ^2: βE(Q)=1ℓ(Q)infδ:β_E(Q)=1/ℓ(Q)inf{δ:there is a line L so that for every x∈E∩Q,, dist(x,L)<δ,(x,L)<δ}, where E is the set that is to be contained in a rectifiable curve, Q is any square, ℓ(Q)ℓ(Q) is the side length of Q, and dist(x,L)(x,L) measures the distance from x to the line L. Intuitively, 2βE(Q)ℓ(Q)2β_E(Q)ℓ(Q) is the width of the smallest rectangle containing the portion of E inside Q, and hence βE(Q)β_E(Q) gives a scale invariant notion of flatness.
