space: The Traveling Salesman Theorem was shown to hold in general Euclidean spaces by Kate Okikiolu,[2] that is, the same theorem above holds for sets E⊆Rd⊆ℝ^d, d > 1, where Δ is now the collection of dyadic cubes in Rdℝ^d defined in a similar way as dyadic squares. In her proof, the constant C grows exponentially with the dimension d. With some slight modifications to the definition of β(E), Raanan Schul[3] showed Traveling Salesman Theorem also holds for sets E that lie in any Hilbert Space, and in particular, implies the theorems of Jones and Okikiolu, where now the constant C is independent of dimension. (In particular, this involves using β-numbers of balls instead of cubes). Menger curvature and metric
