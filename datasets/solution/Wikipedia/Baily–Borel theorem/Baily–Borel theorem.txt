In mathematics, the Baily–Borel compactification is a compactification of a quotient of a Hermitian symmetric space by an arithmetic group, introduced by  Walter L. Baily and Armand Borel (1964, 1966).

Example[edit]
If C is the quotient of the upper half plane by a congruence subgroup of SL2(Z), then the Baily–Borel compactification of C is formed by adding a finite number of cusps to it.
