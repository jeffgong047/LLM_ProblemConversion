theorem: The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem is the following characterization of spaces that are the continuous image of curves: A non-empty Hausdorff topological space is a continuous image of the unit interval if and only if it is a compact, connected, locally connected, second-countable space. Spaces that are the continuous image of a unit interval are sometimes called Peano spaces. In many formulations of the Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem, second-countable is replaced by metrizable. These two formulations are equivalent. In one direction a compact Hausdorff space is a normal space and, by the Urysohn metrization theorem, second-countable then implies metrizable. Conversely, a compact metric space is second-countable. Kleinian
