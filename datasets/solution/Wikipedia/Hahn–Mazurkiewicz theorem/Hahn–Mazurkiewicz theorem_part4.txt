curve: Let C𝒞 denote the Cantor space 2N2^ℕ. We start with a continuous function h from the Cantor space C𝒞 onto the entire unit interval [0,1][0, 1]. (The restriction of the Cantor function to the Cantor set is an example of such a function.) From it, we get a continuous function H from the topological product C×C𝒞 × 𝒞 onto the entire unit square [0,1]×[0,1][0, 1] × [0, 1] by setting H(x,y)=(h(x),h(y)).(x,y)=(h(x),h(y)). Since the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the product C×C𝒞×𝒞, there is a continuous bijection g from the Cantor set onto C×C𝒞 × 𝒞. The composition f of H and g is a continuous function mapping the Cantor set onto the entire unit square. (Alternatively, we could use the theorem that every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set to get the function f.) Finally, one can extend f to a continuous function F whose domain is the entire unit interval [0,1][0, 1]. This can be done either by using the Tietze extension theorem on each of the components of f, or by simply extending f "linearly" (that is, on each of the deleted open interval (a,b)(a, b) in the construction of the Cantor set, we define the extension part of F on (a,b)(a, b) to be the line segment within the unit square joining the values f(a)(a) and f(b)(b)).
