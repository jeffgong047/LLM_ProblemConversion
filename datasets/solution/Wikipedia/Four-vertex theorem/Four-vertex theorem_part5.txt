Converse: The converse to the four-vertex theorem states that any continuous, real-valued function of the circle that has at least two local maxima and two local minima is the curvature function of a simple, closed plane curve. The converse was proved for strictly positive functions in 1971 by Herman Gluck as a special case of a general theorem on pre-assigning the curvature of n-spheres.[9] The full converse to the four-vertex theorem was proved by Bj√∂rn Dahlberg [de] shortly before his death in January 1998, and published posthumously.[10] Dahlberg's proof uses a winding number argument which is in some ways reminiscent of the standard topological proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.[11] Application to
