variations: There are several discrete versions of the four-vertex theorem, both for convex and non-convex polygons.[12] Here are some of them: (Bilinski) The sequence of angles of a convex equilateral polygon with at least four vertices has at least four extrema. The sequence of side lengths of a convex equiangular polygon with at least four sides has at least four extrema. (Musin) A circle circumscribed around three consecutive vertices of a polygon with at least four vertices is called extremal if it contains all remaining vertices of the polygon, or has none of them in its interior. Such a convex polygon is generic if it has no four vertices on the same circle. Then every generic convex polygon with at least four vertices has at least four extremal circles. (Legendreâ€“Cauchy) Two convex n-gons with equal corresponding side length have either zero or at least 4 sign changes in the cyclic sequence of the corresponding angle differences. (A.D. Alexandrov) Two convex n-gons with parallel corresponding sides and equal area have either zero or at least 4 sign changes in the cyclic sequence of the corresponding side lengths differences. Some of these variations are stronger than the other, and all of them imply the (usual) four-vertex theorem by a limit argument. Generalizations to space
