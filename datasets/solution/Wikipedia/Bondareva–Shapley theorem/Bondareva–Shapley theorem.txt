The Bondareva–Shapley theorem, in game theory, describes a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the core of a cooperative game in characteristic function form. Specifically, the game's core is non-empty if and only if the game is balanced. The Bondareva–Shapley theorem implies that market games and convex games have non-empty cores. The theorem was formulated independently by Olga Bondareva and Lloyd Shapley in the 1960s.

Theorem[edit]
Let the pair ⟨N,v⟩,v⟩ be a cooperative game in characteristic function form, where N is the set of players and where the value function v:2N→R:2^N→ℝ is defined on N's power set (the set of all subsets of N).
The core of ⟨N,v⟩,v⟩ is non-empty if and only if for every function α:2N∖∅→[0,1]α:2^N∖{∅}→[0,1] where 
∀i∈N:∑S∈2N:i∈Sα(S)=1:∑_S∈2^N: iα(S)=1
the following condition holds: 

∑S∈2N∖∅α(S)v(S)≤v(N).∑_S∈2^N∖{∅}α(S)v(S)(N).
