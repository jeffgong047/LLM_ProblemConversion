Theorem: Let the pair ⟨N,v⟩,v⟩ be a cooperative game in characteristic function form, where N is the set of players and where the value function v:2N→R:2^N→ℝ is defined on N's power set (the set of all subsets of N). The core of ⟨N,v⟩,v⟩ is non-empty if and only if for every function α:2N∖∅→[0,1]α:2^N∖{∅}→[0,1] where ∀i∈N:∑S∈2N:i∈Sα(S)=1:∑_S∈2^N: iα(S)=1 the following condition holds: ∑S∈2N∖∅α(S)v(S)≤v(N).∑_S∈2^N∖{∅}α(S)v(S)(N).
