decomposability: Consider two equidecomposable polygons P and Q. The minimum number n of pieces required to compose one polygon Q from another polygon P is denoted by σ(P,Q). Depending on the polygons, it is possible to estimate upper and lower bounds for σ(P,Q). For instance, Alfred Tarski proved that if P is convex and the diameters of P and Q are respectively given by d(P) and d(Q), then[3] σ(P,Q)≥d(P)d(Q).σ(P,Q)≥d(P)/d(Q). If Px is a rectangle of sides a · x and a · (1/x) and Q is a rectangle of size a, then Px and Q are equidecomposable for every x > 0. An upper bound for σ(Px,Q) is given by[3] σ(Px,Q)≤2+⌈x2−1⌉,forx≥1.σ(P_x,Q)≤2+⌈√(x^2-1)⌉, forx≥1. Since σ(Px,Q) = σ(P(1/x),Q), we also have that σ(P1x,Q)≤2+⌈1−x2x⌉,forx≤1.σ(P_1/x,Q)≤2+⌈√(1-x^2)/x⌉, forx≤1.
