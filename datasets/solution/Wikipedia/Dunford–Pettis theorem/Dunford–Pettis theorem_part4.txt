integrability: One consequence of uniformly integrability of a class C𝒞 of random variables is that family of laws or distributions P∘|X|−1(⋅):X∈C{P∘|X|^-1(·):X∈𝒞} is tight. That is, for each δ>0δ>0, there exists a>0>0 such that P(|X|>a)≤δ(|X|>a)≤δ for all X∈C∈𝒞.[8] This however, does not mean that the family of measures VC:=μX:A↦∫A|X|dP,X∈C𝒱_𝒞:={μ_X:A↦∫_A|X| dP, X∈𝒞} is tight. (In any case, tightness would require a topology on ΩΩ in order to be defined.) Uniform absolute
