theorems: In the following we use the probabilistic framework, but regardless of the finiteness of the measure, by adding the boundedness condition on the chosen subset of L1(μ)^1(μ). Dunford–Pettis theorem[13][14]A class[clarification needed] of random variables Xn⊂L1(μ)_n^1(μ) is uniformly integrable if and only if it is relatively compact for the weak topology σ(L1,L∞)σ(L^1,L^∞).[clarification needed][citation needed] de la Vallée-Poussin theorem[15][16]The family Xαα∈A⊂L1(μ){X_α}_α∈A^1(μ) is uniformly integrable if and only if there exists a non-negative increasing convex function G(t)(t) such that limt→∞G(t)t=∞andsupαE⁡(G(|Xα|))<∞.lim_t→∞G(t)/t=∞andsup_αE(G(|X_α|))<∞.
