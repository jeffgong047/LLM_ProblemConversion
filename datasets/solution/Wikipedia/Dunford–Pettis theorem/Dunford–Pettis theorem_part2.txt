definition: Uniform integrability is an extension to the notion of a family of functions being dominated in L1_1 which is central in dominated convergence. Several textbooks on real analysis and measure theory use the following definition:[1][2] Definition A: Let (X,M,μ)(X,𝔐,μ) be a positive measure space. A set Φ⊂L1(μ)Φ^1(μ) is called uniformly integrable if supf∈Φ‖f‖L1(μ)<∞sup_f∈Φf_L_1(μ)<∞, and to each ε>0ε>0 there corresponds a δ>0δ>0 such that ∫E|f|dμ<ε∫_E|f| dμ<ε whenever f∈Φ∈Φ and μ(E)<δ.μ(E)<δ. Definition A is rather restrictive for infinite measure spaces. A more general definition[3] of uniform integrability that works well in general measures spaces was introduced by G. A. Hunt. Definition H: Let (X,M,μ)(X,𝔐,μ) be a positive measure space. A set Φ⊂L1(μ)Φ^1(μ) is called uniformly integrable if and only if infg∈L+1(μ)supf∈Φ∫|f|>g|f|dμ=0inf_g_+^1(μ)sup_f∈Φ∫_{|f|>g}|f| dμ=0 where L+1(μ)=g∈L1(μ):g≥0_+^1(μ)={g^1(μ):g≥0}. For finite measure spaces the following result[4] follows from Definition H: Theorem 1: If (X,M,μ)(X,𝔐,μ) is a (positive) finite measure space, then a set Φ⊂L1(μ)Φ^1(μ) is uniformly integrable[clarification needed] if and only if infa≥0supf∈Φ∫|f|>a|f|dμ=0inf_a≥0sup_f∈Φ∫_{|f|>a}|f| dμ=0 Many textbooks in probability present Theorem 1 as the definition of uniform integrability in Probability spaces. When the space (X,M,μ)(X,𝔐,μ) is σσ-finite, Definition H yields the following equivalency: Theorem 2: Let (X,M,μ)(X,𝔐,μ) be a σσ-finite measure space, and h∈L1(μ)^1(μ) be such that h>0>0 almost surely. A set Φ⊂L1(μ)Φ^1(μ) is uniformly integrable[clarification needed] if and only if supf∈Φ‖f‖L1(μ)<∞sup_f∈Φf_L_1(μ)<∞, and for any ε>0ε>0, there exits δ>0δ>0 such that supf∈Φ∫A|f|dμ<εsup_f∈Φ∫_A|f| dμ<ε whenever ∫Ahdμ<δ∫_Ah dμ<δ. In particular, the equivalence of Definitions A and H for finite measures follows immediately from Theorem 2; for this case, the statement in Definition A is obtained by taking h≡1≡1 in Theorem 2.
