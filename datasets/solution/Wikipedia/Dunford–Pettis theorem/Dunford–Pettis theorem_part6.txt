corollaries: The following results apply to the probabilistic definition.[12] Definition 1 could be rewritten by taking the limits as limK→∞supX∈CE⁡(|X|I|X|≥K)=0.lim_K→∞sup_X∈𝒞E(|X| I_|X|)=0. A non-UI sequence. Let Ω=[0,1]⊂RΩ=[0,1]⊂ℝ, and define Xn(ω)=n,ω∈(0,1/n),0,otherwise._n(ω)=n, ω∈(0,1/n), 0, otherwise. Clearly Xn∈L1_n^1, and indeed E⁡(|Xn|)=1,E(|X_n|)=1 for all n. However, E⁡(|Xn|I|Xn|≥K)=1foralln≥K,E(|X_n|I_{|X_n|})=1{foralln, and comparing with definition 1, it is seen that the sequence is not uniformly integrable. Non-UI sequence of RVs. The area under the strip is always equal to 1, but Xn→0_n→0 pointwise. By using Definition 2 in the above example, it can be seen that the first clause is satisfied as L1^1 norm of all Xn_ns are 1 i.e., bounded. But the second clause does not hold as given any δδ positive, there is an interval (0,1/n)(0,1/n) with measure less than δδ and E[|Xm|:(0,1/n)]=1[|X_m|:(0,1/n)]=1 for all m≥n. If X is a UI random variable, by splitting E⁡(|X|)=E⁡(|X|I|X|≥K)+E⁡(|X|I|X|<K)E(|X|)=E(|X|I_{|X|})+E(|X|I_{|X|<K}) and bounding each of the two, it can be seen that a uniformly integrable random variable is always bounded in L1^1. If any sequence of random variables Xn_n is dominated by an integrable, non-negative Y: that is, for all ω and n, |Xn(ω)|≤Y(ω),Y(ω)≥0,E⁡(Y)<∞,|X_n(ω)|(ω),(ω)≥0, operatornameE(Y)<∞, then the class C𝒞 of random variables Xn{X_n} is uniformly integrable. A class of random variables bounded in Lp^p (p>1>1) is uniformly integrable. Relevant
