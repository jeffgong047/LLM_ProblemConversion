continuity: There is another notion of uniformity, slightly different than uniform integrability, which also has many applications in probability and measure theory, and which does not require random variables to have a finite integral[9] Definition: Suppose (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,P) is a probability space. A classed C𝒞 of random variables is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to P if for any ε>0ε>0, there is δ>0δ>0 such that E[|X|IA]<ε[|X|I_A]<ε whenever P(A)<δ(A)<δ. It is equivalent to uniform integrability if the measure is finite and has no atoms. The term "uniform absolute continuity" is not standard,[citation needed] but is used by some authors.[10][11] Related
