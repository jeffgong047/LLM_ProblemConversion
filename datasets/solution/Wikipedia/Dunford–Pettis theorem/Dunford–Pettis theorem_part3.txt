definition: In the theory of probability, Definition A or the statement of Theorem 1 are often presented as definitions of uniform integrability using the notation expectation of random variables.,[5][6][7] that is, 1. A class C𝒞 of random variables is called uniformly integrable if: There exists a finite M such that, for every X in C𝒞, E⁡(|X|)≤ME(|X|) and For every ε>0ε>0 there exists δ>0δ>0 such that, for every measurable A such that P(A)≤δ(A)≤δ and every X in C𝒞, E⁡(|X|IA)≤εE(|X|I_A)≤ε. or alternatively 2. A class C𝒞 of random variables is called uniformly integrable (UI) if for every ε>0ε>0 there exists K∈[0,∞)∈[0,∞) such that E⁡(|X|I|X|≥K)≤εforallX∈CE(|X|I_|X|)≤ε{forallX∈𝒞, where I|X|≥K_|X| is the indicator function I|X|≥K=1if|X|≥K,0if|X|<K._|X|=1 if|X|, 0 if|X|<K..
