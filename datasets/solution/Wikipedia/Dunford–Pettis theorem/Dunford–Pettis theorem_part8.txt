variables: Main article: Convergence of random variables A sequence Xn{X_n} converges to X in the L1_1 norm if and only if it converges in measure to X and it is uniformly integrable. In probability terms, a sequence of random variables converging in probability also converge in the mean if and only if they are uniformly integrable.[17] This is a generalization of Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, see Vitali convergence theorem.
