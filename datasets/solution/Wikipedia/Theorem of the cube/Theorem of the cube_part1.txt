In mathematics, the theorem of the cube is a condition for a line bundle over a product of three complete varieties to be trivial. It was a principle discovered, in the context of linear equivalence, by the Italian school of algebraic geometry. The final version of the theorem of the cube was first published by Lang (1959), who credited it to Andr√© Weil. A discussion of the history has been given by Kleiman (2005). A treatment by means of sheaf cohomology, and description in terms of the Picard functor, was given by Mumford (2008).
