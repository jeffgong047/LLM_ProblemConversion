geometry: The Cartan–Hadamard theorem in conventional Riemannian geometry asserts that the universal covering space of a connected complete Riemannian manifold of non-positive sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to Rn. In fact, for complete manifolds of non-positive curvature, the exponential map based at any point of the manifold is a covering map. The theorem holds also for Hilbert manifolds in the sense that the exponential map of a non-positively curved geodesically complete connected manifold is a covering map (McAlpin 1965; Lang 1999, IX, §3). Completeness here is understood in the sense that the exponential map is defined on the whole tangent space of a point. Metric
