spaces: The assumption of non-positive curvature can be weakened (Alexander & Bishop 1990), although with a correspondingly weaker conclusion. Call a metric space X convex if, for any two constant speed minimizing geodesics a(t) and b(t), the function t↦d(a(t),b(t))(a(t),b(t)) is a convex function of t. A metric space is then locally convex if every point has a neighborhood that is convex in this sense. The Cartan–Hadamard theorem for locally convex spaces states: If X is a locally convex complete connected metric space, then the universal cover of X is a convex geodesic space with respect to the induced length metric d. In particular, the universal covering of such a space is contractible. The convexity of the distance function along a pair of geodesics is a well-known consequence of non-positive curvature of a metric space, but it is not equivalent (Ballmann 1990).
