geometry: In metric geometry, the Cartan–Hadamard theorem is the statement that the universal cover of a connected non-positively curved complete metric space X is a Hadamard space. In particular, if X is simply connected then it is a geodesic space in the sense that any two points are connected by a unique minimizing geodesic, and hence contractible. A metric space X is said to be non-positively curved if every point p has a neighborhood U in which any two points are joined by a geodesic, and for any point z in U and constant speed geodesic γ in U, one has d(z,γ(1/2))2≤12d(z,γ(0))2+12d(z,γ(1))2−14d(γ(0),γ(1))2.(z,γ(1/2))^2≤1/2d(z,γ(0))^2+1/2d(z,γ(1))^2-1/4d(γ(0),γ(1))^2. This inequality may be usefully thought of in terms of a geodesic triangle Δ = zγ(0)γ(1). The left-hand side is the square distance from the vertex z to the midpoint of the opposite side. The right-hand side represents the square distance from the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side in a Euclidean triangle having the same side lengths as Δ. This condition, called the CAT(0) condition is an abstract form of Toponogov's triangle comparison theorem. Generalization to locally convex
