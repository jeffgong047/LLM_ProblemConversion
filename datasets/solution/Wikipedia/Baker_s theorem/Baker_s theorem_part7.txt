proof: By definition Φ(l,…,l)=0Φ(l,…,l)=0 can be written as: ∑λ1=0L⋯∑λn=0Lp(λ1,…,λn)α1λ1l⋯αnλnl=0.∑_λ_1=0^L⋯∑_λ_n=0^Lp(λ_1,…,λ_n)α_1^λ_1l⋯α_n^λ_nl=0. Therefore as l varies we have a system of (L + 1)n homogeneous linear equations in the (L + 1)n unknowns which by assumption has a non-zero solution, which in turn implies the determinant of the matrix of coefficients must vanish. However this matrix is a Vandermonde matrix and the formula for the determinant of such a matrix forces an equality between two of the values: α1λ1⋯αnλnα_1^λ_1⋯α_n^λ_n so α1,…,αnα_1,…,α_n are multiplicatively dependent. Taking logs shows that 2πi,log⁡α1,…,log⁡αn2,logα_1,…,logα_n are linearly dependent over the rationals. Extensions and
