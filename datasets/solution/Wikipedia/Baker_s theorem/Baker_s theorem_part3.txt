Statement: With the above notation, Baker's theorem is a nonhomogeneous generalization of the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem. Specifically it states: Baker's Theorem ‚Äî If Œª1,‚Ä¶,Œªn‚ààLŒª_1,‚Ä¶,Œª_n‚ààùïÉ are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then for any algebraic numbers Œ≤0,‚Ä¶,Œ≤n,Œ≤_0,‚Ä¶,Œ≤_n, not all zero, we have |Œ≤0+Œ≤1Œª1+‚ãØ+Œ≤nŒªn|>H‚àíC|Œ≤_0+Œ≤_1Œª_1+‚ãØ+Œ≤_nŒª_n|>H^-C where H is the maximum of the heights of Œ≤iŒ≤_i and C is an effectively computable number depending on n, ŒªiŒª_i and the maximum d of the degrees of Œ≤i.Œ≤_i. (If Œ≤0 is nonzero then the assumption that ŒªiŒª_i are linearly independent can be dropped.) In particular this number is nonzero, so 1 and ŒªiŒª_i are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. Just as the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem is equivalent to the statement about the transcendence of numbers of the form ab, so too Baker's theorem implies the transcendence of numbers of the form a1b1‚ãØanbn,_1^b_1_n^b_n, where the bi are all algebraic, irrational, and 1, b1, ‚Ä¶, bn are linearly independent over the rationals, and the ai are all algebraic and not 0 or 1. Baker (1977) also gave several versions with explicit constants. For example, if exp‚Å°(Œªj)=Œ±jexp(Œª_j)=Œ±_j has height at most Aj‚â•4_j‚â•4 and all the numbers Œ≤jŒ≤_j have height at most B‚â•4‚â•4 then the linear form Œõ=Œ≤0+Œ≤1Œª1+‚ãØ+Œ≤nŒªnŒõ=Œ≤_0+Œ≤_1Œª_1+‚ãØ+Œ≤_nŒª_n is either 0 or satisfies log‚Å°|Œõ|>(16nd)200nŒ©(log‚Å°Œ©‚àílog‚Å°log‚Å°An)(log‚Å°B+log‚Å°Œ©)log|Œõ|>(16nd)^200nŒ©(logŒ©-log_n)(+logŒ©) where Œ©=log‚Å°A1log‚Å°A2‚ãØlog‚Å°AnŒ©=_1_2‚ãØ_n and the field generated by Œ±iŒ±_i and Œ≤iŒ≤_i over the rationals has degree at most d. In the special case when Œ≤0 = 0 and all the Œ≤jŒ≤_j are rational integers, the rightmost term log Œ© can be deleted. An explicit result by Baker and W√ºstholz for a linear form Œõ with integer coefficients yields a lower bound of the form log‚Å°|Œõ|>‚àíCh(Œ±1)h(Œ±2)‚ãØh(Œ±n)log‚Å°(max|Œ≤1|,‚Ä¶,|Œ≤n|),log|Œõ|>-Ch(Œ±_1)h(Œ±_2)(Œ±_n)log(max{|Œ≤_1|,‚Ä¶,|Œ≤_n|}), where C=18(n+1)!nn+1(32d)n+2log‚Å°(2nd),=18(n+1)!n^n+1(32d)^n+2log(2nd), and d is the degree of the number field generated by the Œ±i.Œ±_i.
