History: To simplify notation, let L𝕃 be the set of logarithms to the base e of nonzero algebraic numbers, that is L=λ∈C:eλ∈Q¯,𝕃={λ∈ℂ:^λ∈ℚ}, where Cℂ denotes the set of complex numbers and Q¯ℚ denotes the algebraic numbers (the algebraic completion of the rational numbers Qℚ). Using this notation, several results in transcendental number theory become much easier to state. For example the Hermite–Lindemann theorem becomes the statement that any nonzero element of L𝕃 is transcendental. In 1934, Alexander Gelfond and Theodor Schneider independently proved the Gelfond–Schneider theorem. This result is usually stated as: if a is algebraic and not equal to 0 or 1, and if b is algebraic and irrational, then ab^b is transcendental. The exponential function is multi-valued for complex exponents, and this applies to all of its values, which in most cases constitute infinitely many numbers. Equivalently, though, it says that if λ1,λ2∈Lλ_1,λ_2∈𝕃 are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. So if λ1,λ2∈Lλ_1,λ_2∈𝕃 and λ2λ_2 is not zero, then the quotient λ1/λ2λ_1/λ_2 is either a rational number or transcendental. It cannot be an algebraic irrational number like 2√(2). Although proving this result of "rational linear independence implies algebraic linear independence" for two elements of L𝕃 was sufficient for his and Schneider's result, Gelfond felt that it was crucial to extend this result to arbitrarily many elements of L.𝕃. Indeed, from Gel'fond (1960, p. 177): …one may assume … that the most pressing problem in the theory of transcendental numbers is the investigation of the measures of transcendence of finite sets of logarithms of algebraic numbers. This problem was solved fourteen years later by Alan Baker and has since had numerous applications not only to transcendence theory but in algebraic number theory and the study of Diophantine equations as well. Baker received the Fields medal in 1970 for both this work and his applications of it to Diophantine equations.
