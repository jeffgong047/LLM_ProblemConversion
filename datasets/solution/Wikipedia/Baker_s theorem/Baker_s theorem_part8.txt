generalizations: Baker (1966) in fact gave a quantitative version of the theorem, giving effective lower bounds for the linear form in logarithms. This is done by a similar argument, except statements about something being zero are replaced by statements giving a small upper bound for it, and so on. Baker (1967a) showed how to eliminate the assumption about 2πi in the theorem. This requires a modification of the final step of the proof. One shows that many derivatives of the function ϕ(z)=Φ(z,…,z)ϕ(z)=Φ(z,…,z) vanish at z = 0, by an argument similar to the one above. But these equations for the first (L+1)n derivatives again give a homogeneous set of linear equations for the coefficients p, so the determinant is zero, and is again a Vandermonde determinant, this time for the numbers λ1 log α1 + ⋯ + λn log αn. So two of these expressions must be the same which shows that log α1,…,log αn are linearly dependent over the rationals. Baker (1967b) gave an inhomogeneous version of the theorem, showing that β0+β1log⁡α1+⋯+βnlog⁡αnβ_0+β_1logα_1+⋯+β_nlogα_n is nonzero for nonzero algebraic numbers β0, …, βn, α1, …, αn, and moreover giving an effective lower bound for it. The proof is similar to the homogeneous case: one can assume that β0+β1log⁡α1+⋯+βn−1log⁡αn−1=log⁡αnβ_0+β_1logα_1+⋯+β_n-1logα_n-1=logα_n and one inserts an extra variable z0 into Φ as follows: Φ(z0,…,zn−1)=∑λ0=0L⋯∑λn=0Lp(λ0,…,λn)z0λ0eλnβ0z0α1(λ1+λnβ1)z1⋯αn−1(λn−1+λnβn−1)zn−1Φ(z_0,…,z_n-1)=∑_λ_0=0^L⋯∑_λ_n=0^Lp(λ_0,…,λ_n)z_0^λ_0e^λ_nβ_0z_0α_1^(λ_1+λ_nβ_1)z_1⋯α_n-1^(λ_n-1+λ_nβ_n-1)z_n-1
