function: The next step is to show that Φ vanishes to slightly smaller order at many more points of the form z1=⋯=zn−1=l_1=⋯=z_n-1=l for integers l. This idea was Baker's key innovation: previous work on this problem involved trying to increase the number of derivatives that vanish while keeping the number of points fixed, which does not seem to work in the multivariable case. This is done by combining two ideas; First one shows that the derivatives at these points are quite small, by using the fact that many derivatives of Φ vanish at many nearby points. Then one shows that derivatives of Φ at this point are given by algebraic integers times known constants. If an algebraic integer has all its conjugates bounded by a known constant, then it cannot be too small unless it is zero, because the product of all conjugates of a nonzero algebraic integer is at least 1 in absolute value. Combining these two ideas implies that Φ vanishes to slightly smaller order at many more points z1=⋯=zn−1=l._1=⋯=z_n-1=l. This part of the argument requires that Φ does not increase too rapidly; the growth of Φ depends on the size of L, so requires a bound on the size of L, which turns out to be roughly that L must be somewhat smaller than M. More precisely, Baker showed that since Φ vanishes to order M at h consecutive integers, it also vanishes to order M/2 at h1+1/8n consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, …. Repeating this argument J times shows that Φ vanishes to order M/2J at h1+J/8n points, provided that h is sufficiently large and L is somewhat smaller than M/2J. One then takes J large enough that: h1+J8n>(L+1)n.^1+J/8n>(L+1)^n. (J larger than about 16n will do if h2 > L) so that: ∀l∈1,2,…,(L+1)n:Φ(l,…,l)=0.∈{1,2,…,(L+1)^n}: Φ(l,…,l)=0. Completion of the
