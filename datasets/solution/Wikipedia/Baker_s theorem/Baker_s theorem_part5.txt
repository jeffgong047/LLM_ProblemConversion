function: Assume there is a relation β1log⁡α1+⋯+βn−1log⁡αn−1=log⁡αnβ_1logα_1+⋯+β_n-1logα_n-1=logα_n for algebraic numbers α1, …, αn, β1, …, βn−1. The function Φ is of the form Φ(z1,…,zn−1)=∑λ1=0L⋯∑λn=0Lp(λ1,…,λn)α1(λ1+λnβ1)z1⋯αn−1(λn−1+λnβn−1)zn−1Φ(z_1,…,z_n-1)=∑_λ_1=0^L⋯∑_λ_n=0^Lp(λ_1,…,λ_n)α_1^(λ_1+λ_nβ_1)z_1⋯α_n-1^(λ_n-1+λ_nβ_n-1)z_n-1 The integer coefficients p are chosen so that they are not all zero and Φ and its derivatives of order at most some constant M vanish at z1=⋯=zn−1=l,_1=⋯=z_n-1=l, for integers l with 0≤l≤h0 for some constant h. This is possible because these conditions are homogeneous linear equations in the coefficients p, which have a non-zero solution provided the number of unknown variables p is larger than the number of equations. The linear relation between the logs of the α's is needed to cut down the number of linear equations that have to be satisfied. Moreover, using Siegel's lemma, the sizes of the coefficients p can be chosen to be not too large. The constants L, h, and M have to be carefully adjusted so that the next part of the proof works, and are subject to some constraints, which are roughly: L must be somewhat smaller than M to make the argument about extra zeros below work. A small power of h must be larger than L to make the final step of the proof work. Ln must be larger than about Mn−1h in order that it is possible to solve for the coefficients p. The constraints can be satisfied by taking h to be sufficiently large, M to be some fixed power of h, and L to be a slightly smaller power of h. Baker took M to be about h2 and L to be about h2−1/2n. The linear relation between the logarithms of the α's is used to reduce L slightly; roughly speaking, without it the condition Ln must be larger than about Mn−1h would become Ln must be larger than about Mnh, which is incompatible with the condition that L is somewhat smaller than M.
