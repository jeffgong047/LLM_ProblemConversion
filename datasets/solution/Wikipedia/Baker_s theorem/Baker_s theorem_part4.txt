method: Baker's proof of his theorem is an extension of the argument given by Gel'fond (1960, chapter III, section 4). The main ideas of the proof are illustrated by the proof of the following qualitative version of the theorem of Baker (1966) described by Serre (1971): If the numbers 2πi,log⁡a1,…,log⁡an2,_1,…,_n are linearly independent over the rational numbers, for nonzero algebraic numbers a1,…,an,_1,…,a_n, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. The precise quantitative version of Baker's theory can be proved by replacing the conditions that things are zero by conditions that things are sufficiently small throughout the proof. The main idea of Baker's proof is to construct an auxiliary function Φ(z1,…,zn−1)Φ(z_1,…,z_n-1) of several variables that vanishes to high order at many points of the form z1=⋯=zn−1=l,_1=⋯=z_n-1=l, then repeatedly show that it vanishes to lower order at even more points of this form. Finally the fact that it vanishes (to order 1) at enough points of this form implies using Vandermonde determinants that there is a multiplicative relation between the numbers ai.
