spaces: Let A be a linear operator defined on a linear subspace D(A) of the reflexive Banach space X. Then A generates a contraction semigroup if and only if[2] A is dissipative, and A − λ0I is surjective for some λ0> 0, where I denotes the identity operator. Note that the conditions that D(A) is dense and that A is closed are dropped in comparison to the non-reflexive case. This is because in the reflexive case they follow from the other two conditions. Dissipativity of the
