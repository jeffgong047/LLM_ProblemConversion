semigroups: Let A be a linear operator defined on a linear subspace D(A) of the Banach space X. Then A generates a quasi contraction semigroup if and only if D(A) is dense in X, A is closed, A is quasidissipative, i.e. there exists a ω ≥ 0 such that A − ωI is dissipative, and A − λ0I is surjective for some λ0 > ω, where I denotes the identity operator.
