theorem: Let A be a linear operator defined on a linear subspace D(A) of the Banach space X. Then A generates a contraction semigroup if and only if[1] D(A) is dense in X, A is dissipative, and A − λ0I is surjective for some λ0> 0, where I denotes the identity operator. An operator satisfying the last two conditions is called maximally dissipative. Variants of the
