adjoint: Let A be a linear operator defined on a dense linear subspace D(A) of the reflexive Banach space X. Then A generates a contraction semigroup if and only if[3] A is closed and both A and its adjoint operator Aâˆ— are dissipative. In case that X is not reflexive, then this condition for A to generate a contraction semigroup is still sufficient, but not necessary.[4] Quasicontraction
