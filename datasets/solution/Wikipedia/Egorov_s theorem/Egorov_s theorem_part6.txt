Proof: Fix ε>0ε>0. For natural numbers n and k, define the set En,k by the union En,k=⋃m≥nx∈A||fm(x)−f(x)|≥1k._n,k=⋃_m{x | |f_m(x)-f(x)|≥1/k}. These sets get smaller as n increases, meaning that En+1,k is always a subset of En,k, because the first union involves fewer sets. A point x, for which the sequence (fm(x)) converges to f(x), cannot be in every En,k for a fixed k, because fm(x) has to stay closer to f(x) than 1/k eventually. Hence by the assumption of μ-almost everywhere pointwise convergence on A, μ(⋂n∈NEn,k)=0μ(⋂_n∈ℕE_n,k)=0 for every k. Since A is of finite measure, we have continuity from above; hence there exists, for each k, some natural number nk such that μ(Enk,k)<ε2k.μ(E_n_k,k)<ε/2^k. For x in this set we consider the speed of approach into the 1/k-neighbourhood of f(x) as too slow. Define B=⋃k∈NEnk,k=⋃_k∈ℕE_n_k,k as the set of all those points x in A, for which the speed of approach into at least one of these 1/k-neighbourhoods of f(x) is too slow. On the set difference A∖B we therefore have uniform convergence. Explicitly, for any ϵϵ, let 1k<ϵ1/k<ϵ, then for any n>nk>n_k, we have |fn−f|<ϵ|f_n-f|<ϵ on all of A∖B. Appealing to the sigma additivity of μ and using the geometric series, we get μ(B)≤∑k∈Nμ(Enk,k)<∑k∈Nε2k=ε.μ(B)≤∑_k∈ℕμ(E_n_k,k)<∑_k∈ℕε/2^k=ε.
