Statement: Let (M,d) denote a separable metric space and (X,Σ) a measurable space: consider a measurable set A and a class A𝔄 containing A and its measurable subsets such that their countable in unions and intersections belong to the same class. Suppose there exists a non-negative measure μ such that μ(A) exists and μ(∩An)=limμ(An)μ(_n)=limμ(A_n) if A1⊃A2⊃⋯_1_2⊃⋯ with An∈A_n∈𝔄 for all n μ(∪An)=limμ(An)μ(_n)=limμ(A_n) if A1⊂A2⊂⋯_1_2⊂⋯ with ∪An∈A_n∈𝔄. If (fn) is a sequence of M-valued measurable functions converging μ-almost everywhere on A∈A∈𝔄 to a limit function f, then there exists a subset A′ of A such that 0 < μ(A) − μ(A′) < ε and where the convergence is also uniform.
