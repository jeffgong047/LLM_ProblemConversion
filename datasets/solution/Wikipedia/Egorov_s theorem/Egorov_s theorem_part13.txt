Proof: Consider the indexed family of sets whose index set is the set of natural numbers m∈N,∈ℕ, defined as follows: A0,m=x∈A|d(fn(x),f(x))≤1∀n≥m_0,m={x|d(f_n(x),f(x))≤1 foralln} Obviously A0,1⊆A0,2⊆A0,3⊆…_0,1_0,2_0,3⊆… and A=⋃m∈NA0,m=⋃_m∈ℕA_0,m therefore there is a natural number m0 such that putting A0,m0=A0 the following relation holds true: 0≤μ(A)−μ(A0)≤ε0≤μ(A)-μ(A_0)≤ε Using A0 it is possible to define the following indexed family A1,m=x∈A0|d(fm(x),f(x))≤12∀n≥m_1,m={x_0|d(f_m(x),f(x))≤1/2 foralln.} satisfying the following two relationships, analogous to the previously found ones, i.e. A1,1⊆A1,2⊆A1,3⊆…_1,1_1,2_1,3⊆… and A0=⋃m∈NA1,m_0=⋃_m∈ℕA_1,m This fact enable us to define the set A1,m1=A1, where m1 is a surely existing natural number such that 0≤μ(A)−μ(A1)≤ε0≤μ(A)-μ(A_1)≤ε By iterating the shown construction, another indexed family of set {An} is defined such that it has the following properties: A0⊇A1⊇A2⊇⋯_0_1_2⊇⋯ 0≤μ(A)−μ(Am)≤ε0≤μ(A)-μ(A_m)≤ε for all m∈N∈ℕ for each m∈N∈ℕ there exists km such that for all n≥km_m then d(fn(x),f(x))≤2−m(f_n(x),f(x))≤2^-m for all x∈Am_m and finally putting A′=⋃n∈NAn'=⋃_n∈ℕA_n the thesis is easily proved.
