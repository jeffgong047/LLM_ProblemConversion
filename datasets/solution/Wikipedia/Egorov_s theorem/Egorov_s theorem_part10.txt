Proof: It is sufficient to consider the case in which the set A is itself of finite μ-measure: using this hypothesis and the standard Severini–Egorov theorem, it is possible to define by mathematical induction a sequence of sets {Ak}k=1,2,... such that μ(A∖⋃k=1NAk)≤1Nμ(A∖⋃_k=1^NA_k)≤1/N and such that (fn) converges to f uniformly on each set Ak for each k. Choosing H=A∖⋃k=1∞Ak=A∖⋃_k=1^∞A_k then obviously μ(H) = 0 and the theorem is proved. Korovkin's
