counterexample: The hypothesis μ(A) < ∞ is necessary. To see this, it is simple to construct a counterexample when μ is the Lebesgue measure: consider the sequence of real-valued indicator functions fn(x)=1[n,n+1](x),n∈N,x∈R,_n(x)=1_[n,n+1](x),∈ℕ,∈ℝ, defined on the real line. This sequence converges pointwise to the zero function everywhere but does not converge uniformly on R∖Bℝ for any set B of finite measure: a counterexample in the general n-dimensional real vector space Rnℝ^n can be constructed as shown by Cafiero (1959, p. 302). The separability of the metric space is needed to make sure that for M-valued, measurable functions f and g, the distance d(f(x), g(x)) is again a measurable real-valued function of x.
