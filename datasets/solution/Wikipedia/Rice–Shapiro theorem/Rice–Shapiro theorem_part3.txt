topology: For any finite unary function θθ on integers, let C(θ)(θ) denote the 'frustum' of all partial-recursive functions that are defined, and agree with θθ, on θθ's domain. Equip the set of all partial-recursive functions with the topology generated by these frusta as base. Note that for every frustum C, Ix(C)(C) is recursively enumerable. More generally it holds for every set A of partial-recursive functions: Ix(A)(A) is recursively enumerable iff A is a recursively enumerable union of frusta.
