statement: Let A be a set of partial-recursive unary functions on the domain of natural numbers such that the set Ix(A):=n∣φn∈A(A):={n|φ_n} is recursively enumerable, where φnφ_n denotes the n-th partial-recursive function in a Gödel numbering. Then for any unary partial-recursive function ψψ, we have: ψ∈A⇔∃ψ⇔∃ a finite function θ⊆ψθ⊆ψ such that θ∈A.θ. In the given statement, a finite function is a function with a finite domain x1,x2,...,xm_1,x_2,...,x_m and θ⊆ψθ⊆ψ means that for every x∈x1,x2,...,xm∈{x_1,x_2,...,x_m} it holds that ψ(x)ψ(x) is defined and equal to θ(x)θ(x).
