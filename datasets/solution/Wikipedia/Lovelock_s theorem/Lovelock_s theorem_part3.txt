Consequences: Lovelock's theorem means that if we want to modify the Einstein field equations, then we have five options.[1] Add other fields rather than the metric tensor; Use more or fewer than four spacetime dimensions; Add more than second order derivatives of the metric; Non-locality, e.g. for example the inverse d'Alembertian; Emergence â€“ the idea that the field equations don't come from the action.
