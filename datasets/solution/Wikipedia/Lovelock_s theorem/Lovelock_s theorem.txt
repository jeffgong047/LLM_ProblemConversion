Lovelock's theorem of general relativity says that from a local gravitational action which contains only second derivatives of the four-dimensional spacetime metric, then the only possible equations of motion are the Einstein field equations.[1][2][3]  The theorem was described by British physicist David Lovelock in 1971.


Statement[edit]
In four dimensional spacetime, any tensor Aμν^μν whose components  are functions of the metric tensor gμν^μν and its first and second derivatives (but linear in the second derivatives of gμν^μν), and also symmetric and divergence-free,  
is necessarily of the form

Aμν=aGμν+bgμν^μν=aG^μν+bg^μν
where a and b are constant numbers and Gμν^μν is the Einstein tensor.[3]
The only possible second-order Euler–Lagrange expression obtainable in a four-dimensional space from a scalar density of the form L=L(gμν)ℒ=ℒ(g_μν) is[1]
Eμν=α−g[Rμν−12gμνR]+λ−ggμν^μν=α√(-g)[R^μν-1/2g^μνR]+λ√(-g)g^μν

Consequences[edit]
Lovelock's theorem means that if we want to modify the Einstein field equations, then we have five options.[1]

Add other fields rather than the metric tensor;
Use more or fewer than four spacetime dimensions;
Add more than second order derivatives of the metric;
Non-locality, e.g. for example the inverse d'Alembertian;
Emergence – the idea that the field equations don't come from the action.
