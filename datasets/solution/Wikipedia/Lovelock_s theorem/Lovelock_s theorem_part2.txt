Statement: In four dimensional spacetime, any tensor Aμν^μν whose components are functions of the metric tensor gμν^μν and its first and second derivatives (but linear in the second derivatives of gμν^μν), and also symmetric and divergence-free, is necessarily of the form Aμν=aGμν+bgμν^μν=aG^μν+bg^μν where a and b are constant numbers and Gμν^μν is the Einstein tensor.[3] The only possible second-order Euler–Lagrange expression obtainable in a four-dimensional space from a scalar density of the form L=L(gμν)ℒ=ℒ(g_μν) is[1] Eμν=α−g[Rμν−12gμνR]+λ−ggμν^μν=α√(-g)[R^μν-1/2g^μνR]+λ√(-g)g^μν
