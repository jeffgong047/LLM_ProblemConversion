Statement: Choi's theorem. Let Φ:Cn×n→Cm×mΦ:ℂ^n→ℂ^m be a linear map. The following are equivalent: (i) Φ is n-positive (i.e. (idn⊗Φ)(A)∈Cn×n⊗Cm×m(id_n⊗Φ)(A)∈ℂ^n⊗ℂ^m is positive whenever A∈Cn×n⊗Cn×n∈ℂ^n⊗ℂ^n is positive). (ii) The matrix with operator entries CΦ=(idn⊗Φ)(∑ijEij⊗Eij)=∑ijEij⊗Φ(Eij)∈Cnm×nm_Φ=(id_n⊗Φ)(∑_ijE_ij_ij)=∑_ijE_ij⊗Φ(E_ij)∈ℂ^nm is positive, where Eij∈Cn×n_ij∈ℂ^n is the matrix with 1 in the ij-th entry and 0s elsewhere. (The matrix CΦ is sometimes called the Choi matrix of Φ.) (iii) Φ is completely positive.
