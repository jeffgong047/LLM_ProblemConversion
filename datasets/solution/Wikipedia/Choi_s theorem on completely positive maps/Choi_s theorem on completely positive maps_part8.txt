operators: In the context of quantum information theory, the operators {Vi} are called the Kraus operators (after Karl Kraus) of Φ. Notice, given a completely positive Φ, its Kraus operators need not be unique. For example, any "square root" factorization of the Choi matrix CΦ = B∗B gives a set of Kraus operators. Let B∗=[b1,…,bnm],^*=[b_1,…,b_nm], where bi*'s are the row vectors of B, then CΦ=∑i=1nmbibi∗._Φ=∑_i=1^nmb_ib_i^*. The corresponding Kraus operators can be obtained by exactly the same argument from the proof. When the Kraus operators are obtained from the eigenvector decomposition of the Choi matrix, because the eigenvectors form an orthogonal set, the corresponding Kraus operators are also orthogonal in the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product. This is not true in general for Kraus operators obtained from square root factorizations. (Positive semidefinite matrices do not generally have a unique square-root factorizations.) If two sets of Kraus operators {Ai}1nm and {Bi}1nm represent the same completely positive map Φ, then there exists a unitary operator matrix Uijij∈Cnm2×nm2suchthatAi=∑j=1UijBj.{U_ij}_ij∈ℂ^nm^2^2 suchthat_i=∑_j=1U_ijB_j. This can be viewed as a special case of the result relating two minimal Stinespring representations. Alternatively, there is an isometry scalar matrix {uij}ij ∈ Cnm × nm such that Ai=∑j=1uijBj._i=∑_j=1u_ijB_j. This follows from the fact that for two square matrices M and N, M M* = N N* if and only if M = N U for some unitary U. Completely copositive
