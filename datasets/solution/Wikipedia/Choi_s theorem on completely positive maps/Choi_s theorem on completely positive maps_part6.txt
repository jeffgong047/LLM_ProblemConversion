(iii): This mainly involves chasing the different ways of looking at Cnm×nm: Cnm×nm≅Cnm⊗(Cnm)∗≅Cn⊗Cm⊗(Cn⊗Cm)∗≅Cn⊗(Cn)∗⊗Cm⊗(Cm)∗≅Cn×n⊗Cm×m.ℂ^nm≅ℂ^nm⊗(ℂ^nm)^*≅ℂ^n⊗ℂ^m⊗(ℂ^n⊗ℂ^m)^*≅ℂ^n⊗(ℂ^n)^*⊗ℂ^m⊗(ℂ^m)^*≅ℂ^n⊗ℂ^m. Let the eigenvector decomposition of CΦ be CΦ=∑i=1nmλivivi∗,_Φ=∑_i=1^nmλ_iv_iv_i^*, where the vectors vi_i lie in Cnm . By assumption, each eigenvalue λiλ_i is non-negative so we can absorb the eigenvalues in the eigenvectors and redefine vi_i so that CΦ=∑i=1nmvivi∗. C_Φ=∑_i=1^nmv_iv_i^*. The vector space Cnm can be viewed as the direct sum ⊕i=1nCm⊕_i=1^nℂ^m compatibly with the above identification Cnm≅Cn⊗Cmℂ^nm≅ℂ^n⊗ℂ^m and the standard basis of Cn. If Pk ∈ Cm × nm is projection onto the k-th copy of Cm, then Pk* ∈ Cnm×m is the inclusion of Cm as the k-th summand of the direct sum and Φ(Ekl)=Pk⋅CΦ⋅Pl∗=∑i=1nmPkvi(Plvi)∗. Φ(E_kl)=P_k_Φ_l^*=∑_i=1^nmP_kv_i(P_lv_i)^*. Now if the operators Vi ∈ Cm×n are defined on the k-th standard basis vector ek of Cn by Viek=Pkvi, V_ie_k=P_kv_i, then Φ(Ekl)=∑i=1nmPkvi(Plvi)∗=∑i=1nmViekel∗Vi∗=∑i=1nmViEklVi∗.Φ(E_kl)=∑_i=1^nmP_kv_i(P_lv_i)^*=∑_i=1^nmV_ie_ke_l^*V_i^*=∑_i=1^nmV_iE_klV_i^*. Extending by linearity gives us Φ(A)=∑i=1nmViAVi∗Φ(A)=∑_i=1^nmV_iAV_i^* for any A ∈ Cn×n. Any map of this form is manifestly completely positive: the map A→ViAVi∗_iAV_i^* is completely positive, and the sum (across i) of completely positive operators is again completely positive. Thus ΦΦ is completely positive, the desired result. The above is essentially Choi's original proof. Alternative proofs have also been known.
