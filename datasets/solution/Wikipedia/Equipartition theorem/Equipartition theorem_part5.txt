oscillators: Equipartition applies to potential energies as well as kinetic energies: important examples include harmonic oscillators such as a spring, which has a quadratic potential energy Hpot=12aq2,_pot=12aq^2, where the constant a describes the stiffness of the spring and q is the deviation from equilibrium. If such a one-dimensional system has mass m, then its kinetic energy Hkin is Hkin=12mv2=p22m,_kin=1/2mv^2=p^2/2m, where v and p = mv denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator. Combining these terms yields the total energy[9] H=Hkin+Hpot=p22m+12aq2.=H_kin+H_pot=p^2/2m+1/2aq^2. Equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium, the oscillator has average energy ⟨H⟩=⟨Hkin⟩+⟨Hpot⟩=12kBT+12kBT=kBT,⟩=_kin⟩+_pot⟩=12k_BT+12k_BT=k_BT, where the angular brackets ⟨…⟩⟨…⟩ denote the average of the enclosed quantity,[10] This result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator, such as a pendulum, a vibrating molecule or a passive electronic oscillator. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy kBT and hence contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This can be used to derive the formula for Johnson–Nyquist noise[11] and the Dulong–Petit law of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition. Figure 3. Atoms in a crystal can vibrate about their equilibrium positions in the lattice. Such vibrations account largely for the heat capacity of crystalline dielectrics; with metals, electrons also contribute to the heat capacity. Specific heat capacity of
