oscillators: See also: Anharmonic oscillator An anharmonic oscillator (in contrast to a simple harmonic oscillator) is one in which the potential energy is not quadratic in the extension q (the generalized position which measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium). Such oscillators provide a complementary point of view on the equipartition theorem.[38][39] Simple examples are provided by potential energy functions of the form Hpot=Cqs,_pot=Cq^s, where C and s are arbitrary real constants. In these cases, the law of equipartition predicts that kBT=⟨q∂Hpot∂q⟩=⟨q⋅sCqs−1⟩=⟨sCqs⟩=s⟨Hpot⟩._BT=_pot/⟩=^s-1⟩=^s⟩=s_pot⟩. Thus, the average potential energy equals kBT/s, not kBT/2 as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where s = 2). More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a Taylor expansion in the extension q: Hpot=∑n=2∞Cnqn_pot=∑_n=2^∞C_nq^n for non-negative integers n. There is no n = 1 term, because at the equilibrium point, there is no net force and so the first derivative of the energy is zero. The n = 0 term need not be included, since the energy at the equilibrium position may be set to zero by convention. In this case, the law of equipartition predicts that[38] kBT=⟨q∂Hpot∂q⟩=∑n=2∞⟨q⋅nCnqn−1⟩=∑n=2∞nCn⟨qn⟩._BT=_pot/⟩=∑_n=2^∞_nq^n-1⟩=∑_n=2^∞nC_n^n⟩. In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula ⟨Hpot⟩=12kBT−∑n=3∞(n−22)Cn⟨qn⟩_pot⟩=1/2k_BT-∑_n=3^∞(n-2/2)C_n^n⟩ does not allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.
