ensemble: In the canonical ensemble, the system is in thermal equilibrium with an infinite heat bath at temperature T (in kelvins).[6][34] The probability of each state in phase space is given by its Boltzmann factor times a normalization factor N𝒩, which is chosen so that the probabilities sum to one N∫e−βH(p,q)dΓ=1,𝒩^-(p,q)dΓ=1, where β = 1/(kBT). Using Integration by parts for a phase-space variable xk the above can be written as N∫e−βH(p,q)dΓ=N∫d[xke−βH(p,q)]dΓk−N∫xk∂e−βH(p,q)∂xkdΓ,𝒩^-(p,q)dΓ=𝒩[x_ke^-(p,q)]dΓ_k-𝒩_k^-(p,q)/_kdΓ, where dΓk = dΓ/dxk, i.e., the first integration is not carried out over xk. Performing the first integral between two limits a and b and simplifying the second integral yields the equation N∫[e−βH(p,q)xk]xk=axk=bdΓk+N∫e−βH(p,q)xkβ∂H∂xkdΓ=1,𝒩∫[e^-(p,q)x_k]_x_k=a^x_k=bdΓ_k+𝒩^-(p,q)x_kβ/_kdΓ=1, The first term is usually zero, either because xk is zero at the limits, or because the energy goes to infinity at those limits. In that case, the equipartition theorem for the canonical ensemble follows immediately N∫e−βH(p,q)xk∂H∂xkdΓ=⟨xk∂H∂xk⟩=1β=kBT.𝒩^-(p,q)x_k/_k dΓ=_k/_k⟩=1/β=k_BT. Here, the averaging symbolized by ⟨…⟩⟨…⟩ is the ensemble average taken over the canonical ensemble. The microcanonical
