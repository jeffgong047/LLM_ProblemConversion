formation: The same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for star formation in giant molecular clouds.[45] A local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity. Such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem—or, equivalently, the virial theorem—is no longer valid, i.e., when the gravitational potential energy exceeds twice the kinetic energy 3GM25R>3NkBT.3GM^2/5R>3Nk_BT. Assuming a constant density ρ for the cloud M=43πR3ρ=4/3^3ρ yields a minimum mass for stellar contraction, the Jeans mass MJ MJ2=(5kBTGmp)3(34πρ)._J^2=(5k_BT/Gm_p)^3(3/4πρ). Substituting the values typically observed in such clouds (T = 150 K, ρ = 2×10−16 g/cm3) gives an estimated minimum mass of 17 solar masses, which is consistent with observed star formation. This effect is also known as the Jeans instability, after the British physicist James Hopwood Jeans who published it in 1902.[46]
