motion: Figure 7. Example Brownian motion of a particle in three dimensions. The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the Brownian motion of a particle from the Langevin equation.[6] According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass m with velocity v is governed by Newton's second law dvdt=1mF=−vτ+1mFrnd,d𝐯/dt=1/m𝐅=-𝐯/τ+1/m𝐅_rnd, where Frnd is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the time constant τ reflects the drag force that opposes the particle's motion through the solution. The drag force is often written Fdrag = −γv; therefore, the time constant τ equals m/γ. The dot product of this equation with the position vector r, after averaging, yields the equation ⟨r⋅dvdt⟩+1τ⟨r⋅v⟩=0⟨𝐫·d𝐯/dt⟩+1/τ⟨𝐫·𝐯⟩=0 for Brownian motion (since the random force Frnd is uncorrelated with the position r). Using the mathematical identities ddt(r⋅r)=ddt(r2)=2(r⋅v)d/dt(𝐫·𝐫)=d/dt(r^2)=2(𝐫·𝐯) and ddt(r⋅v)=v2+r⋅dvdt,d/dt(𝐫·𝐯)=v^2+𝐫·d𝐯/dt, the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into d2dt2⟨r2⟩+1τddt⟨r2⟩=2⟨v2⟩=6mkBT,d^2/dt^2^2⟩+1/τd/dt^2⟩=2^2⟩=6/mk_BT, where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy: ⟨Hkin⟩=⟨p22m⟩=⟨12mv2⟩=32kBT._kin⟩=⟨p^2/2m⟩=⟨12mv^2⟩=32k_BT. The above differential equation for ⟨r2⟩^2⟩ (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly: ⟨r2⟩=6kBTτ2m(e−t/τ−1+tτ).^2⟩=6k_BTτ^2/m(e^-t/τ-1+t/τ). On small time scales, with t ≪ τ, the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the Taylor series of the exponential function, the squared distance grows approximately quadratically: ⟨r2⟩≈3kBTmt2=⟨v2⟩t2.^2⟩≈3k_BT/mt^2=^2^2. However, on long time scales, with t ≫ τ, the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only linearly: ⟨r2⟩≈6kBTτmt=6kBTtγ.^2⟩≈6k_BTτ/mt=6k_BTt/γ. This describes the diffusion of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way. Stellar
