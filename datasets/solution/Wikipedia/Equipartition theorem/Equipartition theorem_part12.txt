law: See also: Ideal gas and Ideal gas law Ideal gases provide an important application of the equipartition theorem. As well as providing the formula ⟨Hkin⟩=12m⟨px2+py2+pz2⟩=12(⟨px∂Hkin∂px⟩+⟨py∂Hkin∂py⟩+⟨pz∂Hkin∂pz⟩)=32kBT^kin⟩ =1/2m_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2⟩ =1/2(_x^kin/_x⟩+_y^kin/_y⟩+_z^kin/_z⟩)=3/2k_BT for the average kinetic energy per particle, the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the ideal gas law from classical mechanics.[6] If q = (qx, qy, qz) and p = (px, py, pz) denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and F is the net force on that particle, then ⟨q⋅F⟩=⟨qxdpxdt⟩+⟨qydpydt⟩+⟨qzdpzdt⟩=−⟨qx∂H∂qx⟩−⟨qy∂H∂qy⟩−⟨qz∂H∂qz⟩=−3kBT,⟨𝐪·𝐅⟩ =_xdp_x/dt⟩+_ydp_y/dt⟩+_zdp_z/dt⟩ =-_x/_x⟩-_y/_y⟩-_z/_z⟩=-3k_BT, where the first equality is Newton's second law, and the second line uses Hamilton's equations and the equipartition formula. Summing over a system of N particles yields 3NkBT=−⟨∑k=1Nqk⋅Fk⟩.3Nk_BT=-⟨∑_k=1^N𝐪_k·𝐅_k⟩. Figure 5. The kinetic energy of a particular molecule can fluctuate wildly, but the equipartition theorem allows its average energy to be calculated at any temperature. Equipartition also provides a derivation of the ideal gas law, an equation that relates the pressure, volume and temperature of the gas. (In this diagram five of the molecules have been colored red to track their motion; this coloration has no other significance.) By Newton's third law and the ideal gas assumption, the net force on the system is the force applied by the walls of their container, and this force is given by the pressure P of the gas. Hence −⟨∑k=1Nqk⋅Fk⟩=P∮surfaceq⋅dS,-⟨∑_k=1^N𝐪_k·𝐅_k⟩=P∮_surface𝐪𝐒, where dS is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the divergence of the position vector q is ∇⋅q=∂qx∂qx+∂qy∂qy+∂qz∂qz=3,∇·𝐪=_x/_x+_y/_y+_z/_z=3, the divergence theorem implies that P∮surfaceq⋅dS=P∫volume(∇⋅q)dV=3PV,∮_surface𝐪·𝐝𝐒=P∫_volume(∇·𝐪) dV=3PV, where dV is an infinitesimal volume within the container and V is the total volume of the container. Putting these equalities together yields 3NkBT=−⟨∑k=1Nqk⋅Fk⟩=3PV,3Nk_BT=-⟨∑_k=1^N𝐪_k·𝐅_k⟩=3PV, which immediately implies the ideal gas law for N particles: PV=NkBT=nRT,=Nk_BT=nRT, where n = N/NA is the number of moles of gas and R = NAkB is the gas constant. Although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal-gas law and the internal energy, the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the partition function.[36] Diatomic
