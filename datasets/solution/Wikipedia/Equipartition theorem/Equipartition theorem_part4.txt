solution: See also: Angular velocity and Rotational diffusion A similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with principal moments of inertia I1, I2 and I3. According to classical mechanics, the rotational energy of such a molecule is given by Hrot=12(I1ω12+I2ω22+I3ω32),_rot=12(I_1ω_1^2+I_2ω_2^2+I_3ω_3^2), where ω1, ω2, and ω3 are the principal components of the angular velocity. By exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case, equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is 3/2kBT. Similarly, the equipartition theorem allows the average (more precisely, the root mean square) angular speed of the molecules to be calculated.[6] The tumbling of rigid molecules—that is, the random rotations of molecules in solution—plays a key role in the relaxations observed by nuclear magnetic resonance, particularly protein NMR and residual dipolar couplings.[7] Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as fluorescence anisotropy, flow birefringence and dielectric spectroscopy.[8] Potential energy and harmonic
