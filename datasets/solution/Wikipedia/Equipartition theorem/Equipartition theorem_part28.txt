effects: See also: Ultraviolet catastrophe, History of quantum mechanics, and Identical particles The law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy kBT is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth continuum, which is required in the derivations of the equipartition theorem above.[6][10] Historically, the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain specific heats and black-body radiation were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.[12] Figure 10. Log–log plot of the average energy of a quantum mechanical oscillator (shown in red) as a function of temperature. For comparison, the value predicted by the equipartition theorem is shown in black. At high temperatures, the two agree nearly perfectly, but at low temperatures when kBT ≪ hν, the quantum mechanical value decreases much more rapidly. This resolves the problem of the ultraviolet catastrophe: for a given temperature, the energy in the high-frequency modes (where hν ≫ kBT) is almost zero. To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case. Neglecting the irrelevant zero-point energy term, its quantum energy levels are given by En = nhν, where h is the Planck constant, ν is the fundamental frequency of the oscillator, and n is an integer. The probability of a given energy level being populated in the canonical ensemble is given by its Boltzmann factor P(En)=e−nβhνZ,(E_n)=e^-nν/Z, where β = 1/kBT and the denominator Z is the partition function, here a geometric series Z=∑n=0∞e−nβhν=11−e−βhν.=∑_n=0^∞e^-nν=1/1-e^-ν. Its average energy is given by ⟨H⟩=∑n=0∞EnP(En)=1Z∑n=0∞nhνe−nβhν=−1Z∂Z∂β=−∂log⁡Z∂β.⟩=∑_n=0^∞E_nP(E_n)=1/Z∑_n=0^∞nhν^-nν=-1/Z/∂β=-∂/∂β. Substituting the formula for Z gives the final result[10] ⟨H⟩=hνe−βhν1−e−βhν.⟩=hνe^-ν/1-e^-ν. At high temperatures, when the thermal energy kBT is much greater than the spacing hν between energy levels, the exponential argument βhν is much less than one and the average energy becomes kBT, in agreement with the equipartition theorem (Figure 10). However, at low temperatures, when hν ≫ kBT, the average energy goes to zero—the higher-frequency energy levels are "frozen out" (Figure 10). As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy kBT (roughly 0.025 eV) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10 eV). Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy. This reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein, among others, to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of black-body radiation.[52] The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container.[52][53] However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of black-body radiation, which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.[52] Other, more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition, such as identical particles and continuous symmetries. The effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures. For example, the valence electrons in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few electronvolts, which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins. Such a state, in which the density is high enough that the Pauli exclusion principle invalidates the classical approach, is called a degenerate fermion gas. Such gases are important for the structure of white dwarf and neutron stars.[citation needed] At low temperatures, a fermionic analogue of the Bose–Einstein condensate (in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state) can form; such superfluid electrons are responsible[dubious – discuss] for superconductivity.
