proofs: General derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many statistical mechanics textbooks, both for the microcanonical ensemble[6][10] and for the canonical ensemble.[6][34] They involve taking averages over the phase space of the system, which is a symplectic manifold. To explain these derivations, the following notation is introduced. First, the phase space is described in terms of generalized position coordinates qj together with their conjugate momenta pj. The quantities qj completely describe the configuration of the system, while the quantities (qj,pj) together completely describe its state. Secondly, the infinitesimal volume dΓ=∏idqidpiΓ=∏_idq_i dp_i of the phase space is introduced and used to define the volume Σ(E, ΔE) of the portion of phase space where the energy H of the system lies between two limits, E and E + ΔE: Σ(E,ΔE)=∫H∈[E,E+ΔE]dΓ.Σ(E,)=∫_H∈[E,E+]dΓ. In this expression, ΔE is assumed to be very small, ΔE ≪ E. Similarly, Ω(E) is defined to be the total volume of phase space where the energy is less than E: Ω(E)=∫H<EdΓ.Ω(E)=∫_H<EdΓ. Since ΔE is very small, the following integrations are equivalent ∫H∈[E,E+ΔE]…dΓ=ΔE∂∂E∫H<E…dΓ,∫_H∈[E,E+]Γ=∂/∫_H<EΓ, where the ellipses represent the integrand. From this, it follows that Σ is proportional to ΔE Σ(E,ΔE)=ΔE∂Ω∂E=ΔEρ(E),Σ(E,)={∂Ω/= rho(E), where ρ(E) is the density of states. By the usual definitions of statistical mechanics, the entropy S equals kB log Ω(E), and the temperature T is defined by 1T=∂S∂E=kB∂log⁡Ω∂E=kB1Ω∂Ω∂E.1/T=/=k_B∂logΩ/=k_B1/Ω ∂Ω/. The canonical
