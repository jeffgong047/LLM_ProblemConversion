gases: See also: Virial expansion and Virial coefficient In an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions. The equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of "non-ideal gases" in which the particles also interact with one another through conservative forces whose potential U(r) depends only on the distance r between the particles.[6] This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a spherically symmetric distribution. It is then customary to introduce a radial distribution function g(r) such that the probability density of finding another particle at a distance r from the given particle is equal to 4πr2ρg(r), where ρ = N/V is the mean density of the gas.[37] It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is ⟨hpot⟩=∫0∞4πr2ρU(r)g(r)dr._pot⟩=∫_0^∞4^2(r)g(r) dr. The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore ⟨Hpot⟩=12N⟨hpot⟩_pot⟩=12N_pot⟩, where N is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor 1⁄2 is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice. Adding kinetic and potential energies, then applying equipartition, yields the energy equation H=⟨Hkin⟩+⟨Hpot⟩=32NkBT+2πNρ∫0∞r2U(r)g(r)dr.=_kin⟩+_pot⟩=3/2Nk_BT+2ρ∫_0^∞r^2U(r)g(r) dr. A similar argument,[6] can be used to derive the pressure equation 3NkBT=3PV+2πNρ∫0∞r3U′(r)g(r)dr.3Nk_BT=3PV+2ρ∫_0^∞r^3U'(r)g(r) dr. Anharmonic
