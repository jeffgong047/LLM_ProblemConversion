function: More generally, the equipartition theorem states that any degree of freedom x which appears in the total energy H only as a simple quadratic term Ax2, where A is a constant, has an average energy of 1⁄2kBT in thermal equilibrium. In this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the partition function Z(β), where β = 1/(kBT) is the canonical inverse temperature.[48] Integration over the variable x yields a factor Zx=∫−∞∞dxe−βAx2=πβA,_x=∫_-∞^∞dx^-^2=√(π/), in the formula for Z. The mean energy associated with this factor is given by ⟨Hx⟩=−∂log⁡Zx∂β=12β=12kBT_x⟩=-∂_x/∂β=1/2β=1/2k_BT as stated by the equipartition theorem. General
