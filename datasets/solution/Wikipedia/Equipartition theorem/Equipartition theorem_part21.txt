distribution: The original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that, in any physical system in thermal equilibrium, every particle has exactly the same average translational kinetic energy, 3/2kBT.[47] However, this is true only for ideal gas, and the same result can be derived from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. First, we choose to consider only the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocity of the z-component f(vz)=m2πkBTe−mvz22kBT(v_z)=√(m2_BT) e^-mv_z^2/2k_BT with this equation, we can calculate the mean square velocity of the z-component ⟨vz2⟩=∫−∞∞f(vz)vz2dvz=kBTm⟨v_z^2⟩=∫_-∞^∞f(v_z)v_z^2dv_z=k_BTm Since different components of velocity are independent of each other, the average translational kinetic energy is given by ⟨Ek⟩=32m⟨vz2⟩=32kBT_k⟩=32m⟨v_z^2⟩=32k_BT Notice, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Boltzmann distribution, which the former can be derived from the latter by assuming the energy of a particle is equal to its translational kinetic energy. As stated by the equipartition theorem. The same result can also be obtained by averaging the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state.[36] Quadratic energies and the partition
