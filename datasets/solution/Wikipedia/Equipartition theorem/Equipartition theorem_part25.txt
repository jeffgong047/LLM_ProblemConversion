ensemble: In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from the rest of the world, or at least very weakly coupled to it.[10] Hence, its total energy is effectively constant; to be definite, we say that the total energy H is confined between E and E+dE. For a given energy E and spread dE, there is a region of phase space Σ in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of phase space is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble. Given these definitions, the equipartition average of phase-space variables xm (which could be either qk or pk) and xn is given by ⟨xm∂H∂xn⟩=1Σ∫H∈[E,E+ΔE]xm∂H∂xndΓ=ΔEΣ∂∂E∫H<Exm∂H∂xndΓ=1ρ∂∂E∫H<Exm∂(H−E)∂xndΓ,_m/_n⟩ =1/Σ ∫_H∈[E,E+]x_m/_n dΓ =/Σ ∂/∫_H<Ex_m/_n dΓ =1/ρ ∂/∫_H<Ex_m∂(H-E)/_n dΓ, where the last equality follows because E is a constant that does not depend on xn. Integrating by parts yields the relation ∫H<Exm∂(H−E)∂xndΓ=∫H<E∂∂xn(xm(H−E))dΓ−∫H<Eδmn(H−E)dΓ=δmn∫H<E(E−H)dΓ,∫_H<Ex_m∂(H-E)/_n dΓ =∫_H<E∂/_n(x_m(H-E)) dΓ-∫_H<Eδ_mn(H-E)dΓ =δ_mn∫_H<E(E-H) dΓ, since the first term on the right hand side of the first line is zero (it can be rewritten as an integral of H − E on the hypersurface where H = E). Substitution of this result into the previous equation yields ⟨xm∂H∂xn⟩=δmn1ρ∂∂E∫H<E(E−H)dΓ=δmn1ρ∫H<EdΓ=δmnΩρ._m/_n⟩=δ_mn1/ρ ∂/∫_H<E(E-H) dΓ=δ_mn1/ρ ∫_H<E dΓ=δ_mnΩ/ρ. Since ρ=∂Ω∂Eρ=∂Ω/ the equipartition theorem follows: ⟨xm∂H∂xn⟩=δmn(1Ω∂Ω∂E)−1=δmn(∂log⁡Ω∂E)−1=δmnkBT._m/_n⟩=δ_mn(1/Ω∂Ω/)^-1=δ_mn(∂logΩ/)^-1=δ_mnk_BT. Thus, we have derived the general formulation of the equipartition theorem ⟨xm∂H∂xn⟩=δmnkBT,_m/_n⟩=δ_mnk_BT, which was so useful in the applications described above.
