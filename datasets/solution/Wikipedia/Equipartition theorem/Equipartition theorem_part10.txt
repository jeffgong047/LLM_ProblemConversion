theorem: See also: Virial theorem, Generalized coordinates, and Hamiltonian mechanics The general equipartition theorem is an extension of the virial theorem (proposed in 1870[35]), which states that ⟨∑kqk∂H∂qk⟩=⟨∑kpk∂H∂pk⟩=⟨∑kpkdqkdt⟩=−⟨∑kqkdpkdt⟩,⟨∑_kq_k/_k⟩=⟨∑_kp_k/_k⟩=⟨∑_kp_kdq_k/dt⟩=-⟨∑_kq_kdp_k/dt⟩, where t denotes time.[9] Two key differences are that the virial theorem relates summed rather than individual averages to each other, and it does not connect them to the temperature T. Another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over phase space.
