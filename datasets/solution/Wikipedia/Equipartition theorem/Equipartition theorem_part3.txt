gases: See also: Ideal gas The (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass m, velocity v is given by Hkin=12m|v|2=12m(vx2+vy2+vz2),_kin=12m|ùêØ|^2=12m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2), where vx, vy and vz are the Cartesian components of the velocity v. Here, H is short for Hamiltonian, and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the Hamiltonian formalism plays a central role in the most general form of the equipartition theorem. Since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute 1‚ÅÑ2kBT to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is 3/2kBT, as in the example of noble gases above. More generally, in a monatomic ideal gas the total energy consists purely of (translational) kinetic energy: by assumption, the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another. Equipartition therefore predicts that the total energy of an ideal gas of N particles is 3/2 N kB T. It follows that the heat capacity of the gas is 3/2 N kB and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a mole of such gas particles is 3/2NAkB = 3/2R, where NA is the Avogadro constant and R is the gas constant. Since R ‚âà 2 cal/(mol¬∑K), equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3 cal/(mol¬∑K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment when compared to monatomic gases.[4] The mean kinetic energy also allows the root mean square speed vrms of the gas particles to be calculated: vrms=‚ü®v2‚ü©=3kBTm=3RTM,_rms=‚àö(^2‚ü©)=‚àö(3k_BT/m)=‚àö(3RT/M), where M = NAm is the mass of a mole of gas particles. This result is useful for many applications such as Graham's law of effusion, which provides a method for enriching uranium.[5] Rotational energy and molecular tumbling in
