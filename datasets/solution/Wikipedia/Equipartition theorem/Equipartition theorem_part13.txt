gases: See also: Two-body problem, Rigid rotor, and Harmonic oscillator A diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses, m1 and m2, joined by a spring of stiffness a, which is called the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation.[20] The classical energy of this system is H=|p1|22m1+|p2|22m2+12aq2,=|ùê©_1|^2/2m_1+|ùê©_2|^2/2m_2+1/2aq^2, where p1 and p2 are the momenta of the two atoms, and q is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value. Every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and, thus, should contribute 1‚ÅÑ2kBT to the total average energy, and 1‚ÅÑ2kB to the heat capacity. Therefore, the heat capacity of a gas of N diatomic molecules is predicted to be 7N¬∑1‚ÅÑ2kB: the momenta p1 and p2 contribute three degrees of freedom each, and the extension q contributes the seventh. It follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be 7/2NAkB = 7/2R and, thus, the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7 cal/(mol¬∑K). However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5 cal/(mol¬∑K)[24] and fall to 3 cal/(mol¬∑K) at very low temperatures.[25] This disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule, since adding more degrees of freedom can only increase the predicted specific heat, not decrease it.[26] This discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a quantum theory of matter.

At the heart of this nebula there is a rapidly rotating neutron star which has about one and a half times the mass of the Sun but is only 25 km across. The equipartition theorem is useful in predicting the properties of such neutron stars. Extreme relativistic ideal
