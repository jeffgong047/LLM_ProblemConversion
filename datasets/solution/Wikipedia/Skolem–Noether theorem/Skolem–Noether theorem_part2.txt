Statement: In a general formulation, let A and B be simple unitary rings, and let k be the center of B. The center k is a field since given x nonzero in k, the simplicity of B implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal BxB = (x) is the whole of B, and hence that x is a unit. If the dimension of B over k is finite, i.e. if B is a central simple algebra of finite dimension, and A is also a k-algebra, then given k-algebra homomorphisms f, g : A → B, there exists a unit b in B such that for all a in A[1][2] g(a) = b · f(a) · b−1. In particular, every automorphism of a central simple k-algebra is an inner automorphism.[3][4]
