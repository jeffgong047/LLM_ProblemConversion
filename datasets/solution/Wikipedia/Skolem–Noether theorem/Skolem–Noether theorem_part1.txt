In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the Skolemâ€“Noether theorem characterizes the automorphisms of simple rings. It is a fundamental result in the theory of central simple algebras. The theorem was first published by Thoralf Skolem in 1927 in his paper Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme (German: On the theory of associative number systems) and later rediscovered by Emmy Noether.
