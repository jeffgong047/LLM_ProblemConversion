formula: The Tutte–Berge formula says that the size of a maximum matching of a graph G=(V,E)=(V,E) equals minU⊆V(|U|−odd⁡(G−U)+|V|)/2min_U(|U|-odd(G-U)+|V|)/2. Equivalently, the number of unmatched vertices in a maximum matching equals maxU⊆V(odd⁡(G−U)−|U|)max_U(odd(G-U)-|U|). This formula follows from Tutte's theorem, together with the observation that G has a matching of size k if and only if the graph G(k)^(k) obtained by adding |V|−2k|V|-2k new vertices, each joined to every original vertex of G, has a perfect matching. Since any set X which separates G(k)^(k) into more than |X||X| components must contain all the new vertices, (*) is satisfied for G(k)^(k) if and only if k≤minU⊆V(|U|−odd⁡(G−U)+|V|)/2≤min_U(|U|-odd(G-U)+|V|)/2.
