Characterization of graphs with perfect matchings Not to be confused with Tutte homotopy theorem or Tutte's spring theorem. Example of a graph and one of its perfect matching (in red). In the mathematical discipline of graph theory the Tutte theorem, named after William Thomas Tutte, is a characterization of finite undirected graphs with perfect matchings. It is a generalization of Hall's marriage theorem from bipartite to arbitrary graphs.[clarification needed] It is a special case of the Tutteâ€“Berge formula.
