graphs: The extremal number ex(n; H) is defined to be the maximum number of edges in a graph with n vertices not containing a subgraph isomorphic to H; see the Forbidden subgraph problem for more examples of problems involving the extremal number. Turán's theorem says that ex(n; Kr) = tr − 1(n), the number of edges of the Turán graph T(n, r − 1), and that the Turán graph is the unique such extremal graph. The Erdős–Stone theorem extends this result to H = Kr(t), the complete r-partite graph with t vertices in each class, which is the graph obtained by taking Kr and replacing each vertex with t independent vertices: ex(n;Kr(t))=(r−2r−1+o(1))(n2).(n;K_r(t))=(r-2/r-1+o(1))n2.
