Theorem in extremal graph theory In extremal graph theory, the Erdős–Stone theorem is an asymptotic result generalising Turán's theorem to bound the number of edges in an H-free graph for a non-complete graph H. It is named after Paul Erdős and Arthur Stone, who proved it in 1946,[1] and it has been described as the “fundamental theorem of extremal graph theory”.[2] Statement for Turán
