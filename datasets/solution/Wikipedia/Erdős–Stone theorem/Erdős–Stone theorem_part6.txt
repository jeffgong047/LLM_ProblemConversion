results: Several versions of the theorem have been proved that more precisely characterise the relation of n, r, t and the o(1) term. Define the notation[3] sr,ε(n) (for 0 < ε < 1/(2(r − 1))) to be the greatest t such that every graph of order n and size (r−22(r−1)+ε)n2(r-2/2(r-1)+ε)n^2 contains a Kr(t). Erdős and Stone proved that sr,ε(n)≥(log⁡⋯log⏟r−1n)1/2_r,ε(n)≥(log⋯log_r-1 n)^1/2 for n sufficiently large. The correct order of sr,ε(n) in terms of n was found by Bollobás and Erdős:[4] for any given r and ε there are constants c1(r, ε) and c2(r, ε) such that c1(r, ε) log n < sr,ε(n) < c2(r, ε) log n. Chvátal and Szemerédi[5] then determined the nature of the dependence on r and ε, up to a constant: 1500log⁡(1/ε)log⁡n<sr,ε(n)<5log⁡(1/ε)log⁡n1/500log(1/ε)<s_r,ε(n)<5/log(1/ε) for sufficiently large n.
