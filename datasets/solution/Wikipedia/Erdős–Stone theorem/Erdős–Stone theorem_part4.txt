density: Another way of describing the Erdős–Stone theorem is using the Turán density of a graph H, which is defined by π(H)=limn→∞ex(n;H)(n2)π(H)=lim_n→∞ex(n;H)/n2. This determines the extremal number ex(n;H)ex(n;H) up to an additive o(n2)(n^2) error term. It can also be thought of as follows: given a sequence of graphs G1,G2,…_1,G_2,…, each not containing H, such that the number of vertices goes to infinity, the Turán density is the maximum possible limit of their edge densities. The Erdős–Stone theorem determines the Turán density for all graphs, showing that any graph H with chromatic number r>2>2 has a Turán density of π(H)=r−2r−1.π(H)=r-2/r-1.
