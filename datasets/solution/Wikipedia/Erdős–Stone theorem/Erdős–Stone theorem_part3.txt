graphs: If H is an arbitrary graph whose chromatic number is r > 2, then H is contained in Kr(t) whenever t is at least as large as the largest color class in an r-coloring of H, but it is not contained in the Turán graph T(n,r − 1), as this graph and therefore each of its subgraphs can be colored with r − 1 colors. It follows that the extremal number for H is at least as large as the number of edges in T(n,r − 1), and at most equal to the extremal function for Kr(t); that is, ex(n;H)=(r−2r−1+o(1))(n2).(n;H)=(r-2/r-1+o(1))n2. For bipartite graphs H, however, the theorem does not give a tight bound on the extremal function. It is known that, when H is bipartite, ex(n; H) = o(n2), and for general bipartite graphs little more is known. See Zarankiewicz problem for more on the extremal functions of bipartite graphs. Turán
