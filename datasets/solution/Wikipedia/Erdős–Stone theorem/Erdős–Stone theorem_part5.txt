Proof: One proof of the Erdős–Stone theorem uses an extension of the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem to hypergraphs, as well as the supersaturation theorem, by creating a corresponding hypergraph for every graph that is Kr(t)_r(t)-free and showing that the hypergraph has some bounded number of edges. The Kővári–Sós–Turán says, among other things, that the extremal number of K2(t)_2(t), the complete bipartite graph with t vertices in each part, is at most ex(K2(t);n)≤Cn2−1/tex(K_2(t);n)^2-1/t for a constant C. This can be extended to hypergraphs: defining Ks,…,s(r)_s,…,s^(r) to be the r-partite r-graph with s vertices in each part, then ex(Ks,…,s(r),n)≤Cnr−s1−rex(K_s,…,s^(r),n)^r-s^1-r for some constant C.[citation needed] Now, for a given graph H=Kr(t)=K_r(t) with r>1,s≥1>1,s≥1, and some graph G with n vertices that does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to H, we define the r-graph F with the same vertices as G and a hyperedge between vertices in F if they form a clique in G. Note that if F contains a copy of Ks,…,s(r)_s,…,s^(r), then the original graph G contains a copy of H, as every pair of vertices in distinct parts must have an edge. Thus, F contains no copies of Ks,…,s(r)_s,…,s^(r), and so it has o(nr)(n^r) hyperedges, indicating that there are o(nr)(n^r) copies of Kr_r in G. By supersaturation, this means that the edge density of G is within o(1)(1) of the Turán density of Kr_r, which is r−2r−1r-2/r-1 by Turán's theorem; thus, the edge density is bounded above by r−2r−1+o(1)r-2/r-1+o(1). On the other hand, we can achieve this bound by taking the Turán graph T(n,r−1)(n,r-1), which contains no copies of Kr(t)_r(t) but has (r−2r−1−o(1))(n2)(r-2/r-1-o(1))n2 edges, showing that this value is the maximum and concluding the proof.
