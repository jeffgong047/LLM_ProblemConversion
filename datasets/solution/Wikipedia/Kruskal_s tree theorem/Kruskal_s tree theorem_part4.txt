work: For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has order one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR0,[1] thus giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably impredicative proof.[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π11-CA0, but by adding a "gap condition"[3] to the definition of the order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem unprovable in this system.[4][5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π11-CA0. Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).[citation needed] Weak tree
