Notes: ^ a Friedman originally denoted this function by TR[n]. ^ b n(k) is defined as the length of the longest possible sequence that can be constructed with a k-letter alphabet such that no block of letters xi,...,x2i is a subsequence of any later block xj,...,x2j.[9] n(1)=3,n(2)=11,andn(3)>2↑7197158386(1)=3,n(2)=11, and n(3)>2↑^7197158386. ^ c A(x) taking one argument, is defined as A(x, x), where A(k, n), taking two arguments, is a particular version of Ackermann's function defined as: A(1, n) = 2n, A(k+1, 1) = A(k, 1), A(k+1, n+1) = A(k, A(k+1, n)).
