function: Suppose that P(n) is the statement: There is some m such that if T1,...,Tm is a finite sequence of unlabeled rooted trees where Ti has i + n vertices, then Ti ≤ Tj for some i < j. All the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and Kőnig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true, but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement "P(n) is true for all n".[6] Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n, far faster than any primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for example.[citation needed] The least m for which P(n) holds similarly grows extremely quickly with n. Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have the following: There is a sequence T1,...,Tm of unlabeled rooted trees, where each Ti has at most i + n vertices, such that Ti ≤ Tj does not hold for any i < j ≤ m. It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960, tree(4) > Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than treetreetreetreetree8(7)(7)(7)(7)(7)tree^tree^tree^tree^tree^8(7)(7)(7)(7)(7). To differentiate the two functions, TREE with all letters capitalized is the big TREE function; tree with all letters in lowercase is the weak tree function. TREE
