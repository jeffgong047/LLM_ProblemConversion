function: A sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue < red < green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence. By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing function.[7] For a positive integer n, take TREE(n)[a] to be the largest m so that we have the following: There is a sequence T1,...,Tm of rooted trees labelled from a set of n labels, where each Ti has at most i vertices, such that Ti ≤ Tj does not hold for any i < j ≤ m. The TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3) explodes to a value that is so big that many other "large" combinatorial constants, such as Friedman's n(4), nn(5)(5), and Graham's number,[b] are extremely small by comparison. A lower bound for n(4), and hence an extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is AA(187196)(1).[c][8] Graham's number, for example, is much smaller than the lower bound AA(187196)(1). It is approximately g3↑1871963_3↑^1871963, where gx is Graham's function. See
