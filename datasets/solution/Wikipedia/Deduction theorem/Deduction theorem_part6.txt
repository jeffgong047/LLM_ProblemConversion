theorem: We prove the deduction theorem in a Hilbert-style deductive system of propositional calculus.[7] Let ΔΔ be a set of formulas and A and B formulas, such that Δ∪A⊢BΔ∪{A}. We want to prove that Δ⊢A→BΔ. Since Δ∪A⊢BΔ∪{A}, there is a proof of B from Δ∪AΔ∪{A}. We prove the theorem by induction on the proof length n; thus the induction hypothesis is that for any ΔΔ, A and B such that there is a proof of B from Δ∪AΔ∪{A} of length up to n, Δ⊢A→BΔ holds. If n = 1 then B is member of the set of formulas Δ∪AΔ∪{A}. Thus either B=A=A, in which case A→B is simply A→A, which is derivable by substitution from p → p, which is derivable from the axioms, and hence also Δ⊢A→BΔ, or B is in ΔΔ, in which case Δ⊢BΔ; it follows from axiom p → (q → p) with substitution that Δ⊢B→(A→B)Δ→(A) and hence by modus ponens that Δ⊢A→BΔ. Now let us assume the induction hypothesis for proofs of length up to n, and let B be a formula provable from Δ∪AΔ∪{A} with a proof of length n+1. Then there are two possibilities: B is member of the set of formulas Δ∪AΔ∪{A}; in this case we proceed as for n=1. B is arrived at by using modus ponens. Then there is a formula C such that Δ∪AΔ∪{A} proves C and C→B, and modus ponens is then used to prove B. The proofs of C and C→B are with at most n steps, and by the induction hypothesis we have Δ⊢A→CΔ and Δ⊢A→(C→B)Δ→(C). By the axiom (p → (q → r)) → ((p → q) → (p → r)) with substitution it follows that Δ⊢(A→(C→B))→((A→C)→(A→B))Δ⊢(A→(C))→((A)→(A)), and by using modus ponens twice we have Δ⊢A→BΔ. Thus in all cases the theorem holds also for n+1, and by induction the deduction theorem is proven. The deduction theorem in predicate
