Result about 4 points on a line which cannot be derived from Euclid's postulates
Not to be confused with Pasch's axiom regarding a line through a triangle.
In geometry, Pasch's theorem, stated in 1882 by the German mathematician Moritz Pasch,[1] is a result in plane geometry which cannot be derived from Euclid's postulates.


Statement[edit]
The statement is as follows: 
Pasch's theorem — Given points a, b, c, and d on a line, if it is known that the points are ordered as (a, b, c) and (b, c, d), then it is also true that (a, b, d).[2]

 [Here, for example, (a, b, c) means that point b lies between points a and c.]

^ Coxeter (1969, p. 179) states the result in 12.274 but does not refer to it specifically as Pasch's theorem.
