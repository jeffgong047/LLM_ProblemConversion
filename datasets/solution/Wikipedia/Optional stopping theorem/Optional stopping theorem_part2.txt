Statement: A discrete-time version of the theorem is given below, with Nℕ0 denoting the set of natural integers, including zero. Let X = (Xt)t∈Nℕ0 be a discrete-time martingale and τ a stopping time with values in Nℕ0 ∪ {∞}, both with respect to a filtration (Ft)t∈Nℕ0. Assume that one of the following three conditions holds: (a) The stopping time τ is almost surely bounded, i.e., there exists a constant c ∈ Nℕ such that τ ≤ c a.s. (b) The stopping time τ has finite expectation and the conditional expectations of the absolute value of the martingale increments are almost surely bounded, more precisely, E[τ]<∞𝔼[τ]<∞ and there exists a constant c such that E[|Xt+1−Xt||Ft]≤c𝔼[|X_t+1-X_t| | ℱ_t] almost surely on the event {τ > t} for all t ∈ Nℕ0. (c) There exists a constant c such that |Xt∧τ| ≤ c a.s. for all t ∈ Nℕ0 where ∧ denotes the minimum operator. Then Xτ is an almost surely well defined random variable and E[Xτ]=E[X0].𝔼[X_τ]=𝔼[X_0]. Similarly, if the stochastic process X = (Xt)t∈Nℕ0 is a submartingale or a supermartingale and one of the above conditions holds, then E[Xτ]≥E[X0],𝔼[X_τ]≥𝔼[X_0], for a submartingale, and E[Xτ]≤E[X0],𝔼[X_τ]≤𝔼[X_0], for a supermartingale.
