inequality: Let A = K⟨x1, ..., xn⟩ be the free algebra over a field K in n = d + 1 non-commuting variables xi. Let J be the 2-sided ideal of A generated by homogeneous elements fj of A of degree dj with 2 ≤ d1 ≤ d2 ≤ ... where dj tends to infinity. Let ri be the number of dj equal to i. Let B=A/J, a graded algebra. Let bj = dim Bj. The fundamental inequality of Golod and Shafarevich states that bj≥nbj−1−∑i=2jbj−iri._j_j-1-∑_i=2^jb_j-ir_i. As a consequence: B is infinite-dimensional if ri ≤ d2/4 for all i
