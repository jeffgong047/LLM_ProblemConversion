statement: The principal axis theorem concerns quadratic forms in Rn, which are homogeneous polynomials of degree 2. Any quadratic form may be represented as Q(x)=xTAx(𝐱)=𝐱^A𝐱 where A is a symmetric matrix. The first part of the theorem is contained in the following statements guaranteed by the spectral theorem: The eigenvalues of A are real. A is diagonalizable, and the eigenspaces of A are mutually orthogonal. In particular, A is orthogonally diagonalizable, since one may take a basis of each eigenspace and apply the Gram-Schmidt process separately within the eigenspace to obtain an orthonormal eigenbasis. For the second part, suppose that the eigenvalues of A are λ1, ..., λn (possibly repeated according to their algebraic multiplicities) and the corresponding orthonormal eigenbasis is u1, ..., un. Then, c=[u1,…,un]Tx,𝐜=[𝐮_1,…,𝐮_n]^𝐱, and Q(x)=λ1c12+λ2c22+⋯+λncn2,(𝐱)=λ_1c_1^2+λ_2c_2^2+…+λ_nc_n^2, where ci is the i-th entry of c . Furthermore, The i-th principal axis is the line determined by equating cj =0 for all j=1,…,i−1,i+1,…,n=1,…,i-1,i+1,…,n. The i-th principal axis is the span of the vector ui . See
