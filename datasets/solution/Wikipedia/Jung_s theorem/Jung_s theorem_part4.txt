spaces: For any bounded set S in any metric space, d/2≤r≤d/2. The first inequality is implied by the triangle inequality for the center of the ball and the two diametral points, and the second inequality follows since a ball of radius d centered at any point of S will contain all of S. Both these inequalities are tight: In a uniform metric space, that is, a space in which all distances are equal, r=d=d. At the other end of the spectrum, in an injective metric space such as the Manhattan distance in the plane, r=d/2=d/2: any two closed balls of radius d/2/2 centered at points of S have a non-empty intersection, therefore all such balls have a common intersection, and a radius d/2/2 ball centered at a point of this intersection contains all of S. Versions of Jung's theorem for various non-Euclidean geometries are also known (see e.g. Dekster 1995, 1997).
