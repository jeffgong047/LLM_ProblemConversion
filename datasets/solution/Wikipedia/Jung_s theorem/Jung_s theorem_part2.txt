Statement: Consider a compact set K⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n and let d=maxp,q∈K‖p−q‖2=max_p,q ∈ Kp-q_2 be the diameter of K, that is, the largest Euclidean distance between any two of its points. Jung's theorem states that there exists a closed ball with radius r≤dn2(n+1)√(n/2(n+1)) that contains K. The boundary case of equality is attained by the regular n-simplex. Jung's theorem in the
