plane: The most common case of Jung's theorem is in the plane, that is, when n = 2. In this case the theorem states that there exists a circle enclosing all points whose radius satisfies r≤d3,≤d/√(3), and this bound is as tight as possible since when K is an equilateral triangle (or its three vertices) one has r=d3.=d/√(3).
