Rays: A ray is a family of geodesic light-like curves. That is tangent vector field la^a is null and geodesic: lala=0_al^a=0 and lb∇bla=0^b∇_bl^a=0. At each point, there is a (nonunique) 2D spatial slice of the tangent space orthogonal to la^a. It is spanned by a complex null vector ma^a and its complex conjugate m¯am̅^a. If the metric is time positive, then the metric projected on the slice is g ab=−mam¯b−m¯ambg̃^ab=-m^am̅^b-m̅^am^b. Goldberg and Sachs considered the projection of the gradient on this slice. Aab=g apg bq∇plq=zm¯amb+z¯mam¯b+σ¯mamb+σm¯am¯b.^ab=g̃^apg̃^bq∇_pl_q=zm̅^am^b+z̅m^am̅^b+σ̅m^am^b+σm̅^am̅^b. A ray is shear-free if σ=0σ=0. Intuitively, this means a small shadow cast by the ray will preserve its shape. The shadow may rotate and grow/shrink, but it will not be distorted. The
