Theorem: A vacuum metric, Rab=0_ab=0, is algebraically special if and only if it contains a shear-free null geodesic congruence; the tangent vector obeys k[aCb]ijckikj=0_[aC_b]ijck^ik^j=0.[1] This is the theorem originally stated by Goldberg and Sachs. While they stated it in terms of tangent vectors and the Weyl tensor, the proof is much simpler in terms of spinors. The Newman-Penrose field equations[2] give a natural framework for investigating Petrov classifications, since instead of proving k[aCb]ijckikj=0_[aC_b]ijck^ik^j=0, one can just prove Ψ0=Ψ1=0Ψ_0=Ψ_1=0. For these proofs, assume we have a spin frame with oA^A having its flagpole aligned with the shear-free ray la^a. Proof that a shear-free ray implies algebraic specialty: If a ray is geodesic and shear-free, then ε+ε¯=κ=σ=0ε+ε̅=κ=σ=0. A complex rotation oA→eiθoA^A^iθo^A does not affect la^a and can set ε=0ε=0 to simplify calculations. The first useful NP equation is Dσ−δκ=0σ-δκ=0, which immediately gives Ψ0=0Ψ_0=0. To show that Ψ1=0Ψ_1=0, apply the commutator δD−Dδ-Dδ to it. The Bianchi identity gives the needed formulae: DΨ1=4ρΨ1Ψ_1=4ρΨ_1 and δΨ1=(2β+4τ)Ψ1δΨ_1=(2β+4τ)Ψ_1.[3] Working through the algebra of this commutator will show Ψ12=0Ψ_1^2=0, which completes this part of the proof. Proof that algebraic specialty implies a shear-free ray: Suppose oA_A is a degenerate factor of ΨABCDΨ_ABCD. While this degeneracy could be n-fold (n=2..4) and the proof will be functionally the same, take it to be a 2-fold degeneracy. Then the projection oBoCoDΨABCD=0^Bo^Co^DΨ_ABCD=0. The Bianchi identity in a vacuum spacetime is ∇AA′ΨABCD=0∇^AA'Ψ_ABCD=0, so applying a derivative to the projection will give oAoB∇AA′oB=0_Ao_B∇^AA'o^B=0, which is equivalent to κ=σ=0.κ=σ=0. The congruence is therefore shear-free and almost geodesic: Dla=(ε+ε¯)la_a=(ε+ε̅)l_a. A suitable rescaling of oA^A exists which will make this congruence geodesic, and thus a shear-free ray. The shear of a vector field is invariant under rescaling, so it will remain shear-free. Importance and
