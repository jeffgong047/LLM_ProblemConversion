Examples: In Petrov type D spacetimes, there are two algebraic degeneracies. By the Goldberg-Sachs theorem there are then two shear-free rays which point along these degenerate directions. Since the Newman-Penrose equations are written in a basis with two real null vectors, there is a natural basis which simplifies the field equations. Examples of such vacuum spacetimes are the Schwarzschild metric and the Kerr metric, which describes a nonrotating and a rotating black hole, respectively. It is precisely this algebraic simplification which makes solving for the Kerr metric possible by hand. In the Schwarzschild case with time-symmetric coordinates, the two shear-free rays are lμ∂μ=±(1−2Mr)−1∂t+∂r.^μ∂_μ=±(1-2M/r)^-1∂_t+∂_r. Under the coordinate transformation (t,r,θ,φ)→(t∓r∗,r,θ,φ)(t,r,θ,φ)→(t^*,r,θ,φ) where r∗^* is the tortoise coordinate, this simplifies to lμ∂μ=∂r^μ∂_μ=∂_r. Linearised
