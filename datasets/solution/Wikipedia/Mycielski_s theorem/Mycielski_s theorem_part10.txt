number: Assigning distinct colors to distinct vertices always yields a proper coloring, so 1≤χ(G)≤n.1≤χ(G). The only graphs that can be 1-colored are edgeless graphs. A complete graph Kn_n of n vertices requires χ(Kn)=nχ(K_n)=n colors. In an optimal coloring there must be at least one of the graph's m edges between every pair of color classes, so χ(G)(χ(G)−1)≤2m.χ(G)(χ(G)-1)≤2m. More generally a family Fℱ of graphs is χχ-bounded if there is some function c such that the graphs G in Fℱ can be colored with at most c(ω(G))(ω(G)) colors, for the family of the perfect graphs this function is c(ω(G))=ω(G)(ω(G))=ω(G). The 2-colorable graphs are exactly the bipartite graphs, including trees and forests. By the four color theorem, every planar graph can be 4-colored. A greedy coloring shows that every graph can be colored with one more color than the maximum vertex degree, χ(G)≤Δ(G)+1.χ(G)≤Δ(G)+1. Complete graphs have χ(G)=nχ(G)=n and Δ(G)=n−1Δ(G)=n-1, and odd cycles have χ(G)=3χ(G)=3 and Δ(G)=2Δ(G)=2, so for these graphs this bound is best possible. In all other cases, the bound can be slightly improved; Brooks' theorem[4] states that Brooks' theorem: χ(G)≤Δ(G)χ(G)≤Δ(G) for a connected, simple graph G, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.
