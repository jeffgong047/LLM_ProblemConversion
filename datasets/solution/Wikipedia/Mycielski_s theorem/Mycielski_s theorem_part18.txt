algorithms: Brute-force search for a k-coloring considers each of the kn^n assignments of k colors to n vertices and checks for each if it is legal. To compute the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial, this procedure is used for every k=1,…,n−1=1,…,n-1, impractical for all but the smallest input graphs. Using dynamic programming and a bound on the number of maximal independent sets, k-colorability can be decided in time and space O(2.4423n)(2.4423^n).[11] Using the principle of inclusion–exclusion and Yates's algorithm for the fast zeta transform, k-colorability can be decided in time O(2nn)(2^nn)[10][12][13][14] for any k. Faster algorithms are known for 3- and 4-colorability, which can be decided in time O(1.3289n)(1.3289^n)[15] and O(1.7272n)(1.7272^n),[16] respectively. Exponentially faster algorithms are also known for 5- and 6-colorability, as well as for restricted families of graphs, including sparse graphs.[17]
