number: Several lower bounds for the chromatic bounds have been discovered over the years: If G contains a clique of size k, then at least k colors are needed to color that clique; in other words, the chromatic number is at least the clique number: χ(G)≥ω(G).χ(G)≥ω(G). For perfect graphs this bound is tight. Finding cliques is known as the clique problem. Hoffman's bound: Let W be a real symmetric matrix such that Wi,j=0_i,j=0 whenever (i,j)(i,j) is not an edge in G. Define χW(G)=1−λmax(W)λmin(W)χ_W(G)=1-λ_max(W)λ_min(W), where λmax(W),λmin(W)λ_max(W),λ_min(W) are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of W. Define χH(G)=maxWχW(G)χ_H(G)=max_Wχ_W(G), with W as above. Then: χH(G)≤χ(G).χ_H(G)≤χ(G). Vector chromatic number: Let W be a positive semi-definite matrix such that Wi,j≤−1k−1_i,j≤-1k-1 whenever (i,j)(i,j) is an edge in G. Define χV(G)χ_V(G) to be the least k for which such a matrix W exists. Then χV(G)≤χ(G).χ_V(G)≤χ(G). Lovász number: The Lovász number of a complementary graph is also a lower bound on the chromatic number: ϑ(G¯)≤χ(G).ϑ(G̅)≤χ(G). Fractional chromatic number: The fractional chromatic number of a graph is a lower bound on the chromatic number as well: χf(G)≤χ(G).χ_f(G)≤χ(G). These bounds are ordered as follows: χH(G)≤χV(G)≤ϑ(G¯)≤χf(G)≤χ(G).χ_H(G)≤χ_V(G)≤ϑ(G̅)≤χ_f(G)≤χ(G). Graphs with high chromatic
