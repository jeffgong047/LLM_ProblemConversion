problems: As stated above, ω(G)≤χ(G)≤Δ(G)+1.ω(G)≤χ(G)≤Δ(G)+1. A conjecture of Reed from 1998 is that the value is essentially closer to the lower bound, χ(G)≤⌈ω(G)+Δ(G)+12⌉.χ(G)≤⌈ω(G)+Δ(G)+1/2⌉. The chromatic number of the plane, where two points are adjacent if they have unit distance, is unknown, although it is one of 5, 6, or 7. Other open problems concerning the chromatic number of graphs include the Hadwiger conjecture stating that every graph with chromatic number k has a complete graph on k vertices as a minor, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture bounding the chromatic number of unions of complete graphs that have at most one vertex in common to each pair, and the Albertson conjecture that among k-chromatic graphs the complete graphs are the ones with smallest crossing number. When Birkhoff and Lewis introduced the chromatic polynomial in their attack on the four-color theorem, they conjectured that for planar graphs G, the polynomial P(G,t)(G,t) has no zeros in the region [4,∞)[4,∞). Although it is known that such a chromatic polynomial has no zeros in the region [5,∞)[5,∞) and that P(G,4)≠0(G,4)≠0, their conjecture is still unresolved. It also remains an unsolved problem to characterize graphs which have the same chromatic polynomial and to determine which polynomials are chromatic.
