index: An edge coloring of G is a vertex coloring of its line graph L(G)(G), and vice versa. Thus, χ′(G)=χ(L(G)).χ'(G)=χ(L(G)). There is a strong relationship between edge colorability and the graph's maximum degree Δ(G)Δ(G). Since all edges incident to the same vertex need their own color, we have χ′(G)≥Δ(G).χ'(G)≥Δ(G). Moreover, Kőnig's theorem: χ′(G)=Δ(G)χ'(G)=Δ(G) if G is bipartite. In general, the relationship is even stronger than what Brooks's theorem gives for vertex coloring: Vizing's Theorem: A graph of maximal degree ΔΔ has edge-chromatic number ΔΔ or Δ+1Δ+1. Other
