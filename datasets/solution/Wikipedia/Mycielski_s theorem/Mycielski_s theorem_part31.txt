colorings: Adjacent-vertex-distinguishing-total coloring A total coloring with the additional restriction that any two adjacent vertices have different color sets Acyclic coloring Every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic B-coloring a coloring of the vertices where each color class contains a vertex that has a neighbor in all other color classes. Circular coloring Motivated by task systems in which production proceeds in a cyclic way Cocoloring An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces an independent set or a clique Complete coloring Every pair of colors appears on at least one edge Defective coloring An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces a bounded degree subgraph. Distinguishing coloring An improper vertex coloring that destroys all the symmetries of the graph Equitable coloring The sizes of color classes differ by at most one Exact coloring Every pair of colors appears on exactly one edge Fractional coloring Vertices may have multiple colors, and on each edge the sum of the color parts of each vertex is not greater than one Hamiltonian coloring Uses the length of the longest path between two vertices, also known as the detour distance Harmonious coloring Every pair of colors appears on at most one edge Incidence coloring Each adjacent incidence of vertex and edge is colored with distinct colors Inherited vertex coloring A set of vertex colorings induced by perfect matchings of edge-colored Graphs. Interval edge coloring A color of edges meeting in a common vertex must be contiguous List coloring Each vertex chooses from a list of colors List edge-coloring Each edge chooses from a list of colors L(h, k)-coloring Difference of colors at adjacent vertices is at least h and difference of colors of vertices at a distance two is at least k. A particular case is L(2,1)-coloring. Oriented coloring Takes into account orientation of edges of the graph Path coloring Models a routing problem in graphs Radio coloring Sum of the distance between the vertices and the difference of their colors is greater than k+1, where k is a positive integer. Rank coloring If two vertices have the same color i, then every path between them contain a vertex with color greater than i Subcoloring An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces a union of cliques Sum coloring The criterion of minimalization is the sum of colors Star coloring Every 2-chromatic subgraph is a disjoint collection of stars Strong coloring Every color appears in every partition of equal size exactly once Strong edge coloring Edges are colored such that each color class induces a matching (equivalent to coloring the square of the line graph) T-coloring Absolute value of the difference between two colors of adjacent vertices must not belong to fixed set T Total coloring Vertices and edges are colored Centered coloring Every connected induced subgraph has a color that is used exactly once Triangle-free edge coloring The edges are colored so that each color class forms a triangle-free subgraph Weak coloring An improper vertex coloring where every non-isolated node has at least one neighbor with a different color Coloring can also be considered for signed graphs and gain graphs.
