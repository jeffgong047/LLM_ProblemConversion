coloring: An unlabeled coloring of a graph is an orbit of a coloring under the action of the automorphism group of the graph. The colors remain labeled; it is the graph that is unlabeled. There is an analogue of the chromatic polynomial which counts the number of unlabeled colorings of a graph from a given finite color set. If we interpret a coloring of a graph on d vertices as a vector in Zdâ„¤^d, the action of an automorphism is a permutation of the coefficients in the coloring vector.
