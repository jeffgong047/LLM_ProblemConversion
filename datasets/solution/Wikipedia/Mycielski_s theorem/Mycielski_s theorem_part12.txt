number: Graphs with large cliques have a high chromatic number, but the opposite is not true. The Grötzsch graph is an example of a 4-chromatic graph without a triangle, and the example can be generalized to the Mycielskians. Theorem (William T. Tutte 1947,[5] Alexander Zykov 1949, Jan Mycielski 1955): There exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number. To prove this, both, Mycielski and Zykov, each gave a construction of an inductively defined family of triangle-free graphs but with arbitrarily large chromatic number.[6] Burling (1965)[7] constructed axis aligned boxes in R3ℝ^3 whose intersection graph is triangle-free and requires arbitrarily many colors to be properly colored. This family of graphs is then called the Burling graphs. The same class of graphs is used for the construction of a family of triangle-free line segments in the plane, given by Pawlik et al. (2014).[8] It shows that the chromatic number of its intersection graph is arbitrarily large as well. Hence, this implies that axis aligned boxes in R3ℝ^3 as well as line segments in R2ℝ^2 are not χ-bounded.[8] From Brooks's theorem, graphs with high chromatic number must have high maximum degree. But colorability is not an entirely local phenomenon: A graph with high girth looks locally like a tree, because all cycles are long, but its chromatic number need not be 2: Theorem (Erdős): There exist graphs of arbitrarily high girth and chromatic number.[9] Bounds on the chromatic
