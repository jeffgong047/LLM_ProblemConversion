properties: A graph has a k-coloring if and only if it has an acyclic orientation for which the longest path has length at most k; this is the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem (Nešetřil & Ossona de Mendez 2012). For planar graphs, vertex colorings are essentially dual to nowhere-zero flows. About infinite graphs, much less is known. The following are two of the few results about infinite graph coloring: If all finite subgraphs of an infinite graph G are k-colorable, then so is G, under the assumption of the axiom of choice. This is the de Bruijn–Erdős theorem of de Bruijn & Erdős (1951). If a graph admits a full n-coloring for every n ≥ n0, it admits an infinite full coloring (Fawcett 1978). Open
