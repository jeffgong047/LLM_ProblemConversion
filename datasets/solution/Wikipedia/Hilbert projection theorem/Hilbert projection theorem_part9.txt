Notes: ^ Because the norm ‖⋅‖:H→R·:H→ℝ is continuous, if limn→∞xnlim_n→∞x_n converges in H then necessarily limn→∞‖xn‖lim_n→∞x_n converges in R.ℝ. But in general, the converse is not guaranteed. However, under this theorem's hypotheses, knowing that limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d in Rℝ is sufficient to conclude that limn→∞cnlim_n→∞c_n converges in H.. ^ Explicitly, this means that given any ϵ>0ϵ>0 there exists some integer N>0>0 such that "the quantity" is ≤ϵ ≤ϵ whenever m,n≥N.,n. Here, "the quantity" refers to the inequality's right hand side 2‖cm‖2+2‖cn‖2−4d22c_m^2+2c_n^2-4d^2 and later in the proof, "the quantity" will also refer to ‖cm−cn‖2c_m-c_n^2 and then ‖cm−cn‖.c_m-c_n. By definition of "Cauchy sequence," (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ is Cauchy in H if and only if "the quantity" ‖cm−cn‖c_m-c_n satisfies this aforementioned condition. ^ Technically, H=K⊕K⊥=K^ means that the addition map K×K⊥→H^ defined by (k,p)↦k+p(k,p)+p is a surjective linear isomorphism and homeomorphism. See the article on complemented subspaces for more details.
