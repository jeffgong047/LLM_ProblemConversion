case: Some intuition for the theorem can be obtained by considering the first order condition of the optimization problem. Consider a finite dimensional real Hilbert space H with a subspace C and a point x.. If m∈C is a minimizer or minimum point of the function N:C→R:C→ℝ defined by N(c):=‖c−x‖(c):=c-x (which is the same as the minimum point of c↦‖c−x‖2↦c-x^2), then derivative must be zero at m.. In matrix derivative notation[1] ∂‖x−c‖2=∂⟨c−x,c−x⟩=2⟨c−x,∂c⟩∂-c‖^2 =∂-x,c-x⟩ =2-x,⟩ Since ∂c is a vector in C that represents an arbitrary tangent direction, it follows that m−x-x must be orthogonal to every vector in C..
