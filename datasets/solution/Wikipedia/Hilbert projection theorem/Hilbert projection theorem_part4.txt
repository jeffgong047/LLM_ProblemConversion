proof: Proof that a minimum point y exists Let δ:=infc∈C‖x−c‖δ:=inf_cx-c be the distance between x and C,, (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ a sequence in C such that the distance squared between x and cn_n is less than or equal to δ2+1/n.δ^2+1/n. Let n and m be two integers, then the following equalities are true: ‖cn−cm‖2=‖cn−x‖2+‖cm−x‖2−2⟨cn−x,cm−x⟩c_n-c_m^2=c_n-x^2+c_m-x^2-2_n-x , c_m-x⟩ and 4‖cn+cm2−x‖2=‖cn−x‖2+‖cm−x‖2+2⟨cn−x,cm−x⟩4c_n+c_m/2-x^2=c_n-x^2+c_m-x^2+2_n-x , c_m-x⟩ Therefore ‖cn−cm‖2=2‖cn−x‖2+2‖cm−x‖2−4‖cn+cm2−x‖2c_n-c_m^2=2c_n-x^2+2c_m-x^2-4c_n+c_m/2-x^2 (This equation is the same as the formula a2=2b2+2c2−4Ma2^2=2b^2+2c^2-4M_a^2 for the length Ma_a of a median in a triangle with sides of length a,b,,b, and c,, where specifically, the triangle's vertices are x,cm,cn,c_m,c_n). By giving an upper bound to the first two terms of the equality and by noticing that the middle of cn_n and cm_m belong to C and has therefore a distance greater than or equal to δδ from x,, it follows that: ‖cn−cm‖2≤2(δ2+1n)+2(δ2+1m)−4δ2=2(1n+1m)c_n-c_m^2 ≤ 2(δ^2+1/n)+2(δ^2+1/m)-4δ^2=2(1/n+1/m) The last inequality proves that (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ is a Cauchy sequence. Since C is complete, the sequence is therefore convergent to a point m∈C,, whose distance from x is minimal. ◼▪ Proof that m is unique Let m1_1 and m2_2 be two minimum points. Then: ‖m2−m1‖2=2‖m1−x‖2+2‖m2−x‖2−4‖m1+m22−x‖2m_2-m_1^2=2m_1-x^2+2m_2-x^2-4m_1+m_2/2-x^2 Since m1+m22m_1+m_2/2 belongs to C,, we have ‖m1+m22−x‖2≥δ2m_1+m_2/2-x^2≥δ^2 and therefore ‖m2−m1‖2≤2δ2+2δ2−4δ2=0.m_2-m_1^2≤2δ^2+2δ^2-4δ^2=0. Hence m1=m2,_1=m_2, which proves uniqueness. ◼▪ Proof of characterization of minimum point when C is a closed vector subspace Assume that C is a closed vector subspace of H.. It must be shown the minimizer m is the unique element in C such that ⟨m−x,c⟩=0-x,c⟩=0 for every c∈C.. Proof that the condition is sufficient: Let z∈C be such that ⟨z−x,c⟩=0-x,c⟩=0 for all c∈C.. If c∈C then c−z∈C-z and so ‖c−x‖2=‖(z−x)+(c−z)‖2=‖z−x‖2+‖c−z‖2+2⟨z−x,c−z⟩=‖z−x‖2+‖c−z‖2c-x^2=(z-x)+(c-z)^2=z-x^2+c-z^2+2-x,c-z⟩=z-x^2+c-z^2 which implies that ‖z−x‖2≤‖c−x‖2.z-x^2≤c-x^2. Because c∈C was arbitrary, this proves that ‖z−x‖=infc∈C‖c−x‖z-x=inf_cc-x and so z is a minimum point. Proof that the condition is necessary: Let m∈C be the minimum point. Let c∈C and t∈R.∈ℝ. Because m+tc∈C,+tc, the minimality of m guarantees that ‖m−x‖≤‖(m+tc)−x‖.m-x≤(m+tc)-x. Thus ‖(m+tc)−x‖2−‖m−x‖2=2t⟨m−x,c⟩+t2‖c‖2(m+tc)-x^2-m-x^2=2t-x,c⟩+t^2c^2 is always non-negative and ⟨m−x,c⟩-x,c⟩ must be a real number. If ⟨m−x,c⟩≠0-x,c⟩≠0 then the map f(t):=2t⟨m−x,c⟩+t2‖c‖2(t):=2t-x,c⟩+t^2c^2 has a minimum at t0:=−⟨m−x,c⟩‖c‖2_0:=--x,c⟩/c^2 and moreover, f(t0)<0,(t_0)<0, which is a contradiction. Thus ⟨m−x,c⟩=0.-x,c⟩=0. ◼▪ Proof by reduction to a special
