Consequences: Proposition — If C is a closed vector subspace of a Hilbert space H then[note 3] H=C⊕C⊥.=C^. Proof[3] Proof that C∩C⊥=0^={0}: If c∈C∩C⊥^ then 0=⟨c,c⟩=‖c‖2,0=⟨ c, c ⟩=c^2, which implies c=0.=0. ◼▪ Proof that C⊥^ is a closed vector subspace of H: Let P:=∏c∈CF:=∏_c𝔽 where F𝔽 is the underlying scalar field of H and define L:H→Ph↦(⟨h,c⟩)c∈C4L: H → P h ↦ (⟨ h, c ⟩)_c which is continuous and linear because this is true of each of its coordinates h↦⟨h,c⟩.↦,c⟩. The set C⊥=L−1(0)=L−1(0)^=L^-1(0)=L^-1({0}) is closed in H because 0{0} is closed in P and L:H→P:H is continuous. The kernel of any linear map is a vector subspace of its domain, which is why C⊥=ker⁡L^= is a vector subspace of H.. ◼▪ Proof that C+C⊥=H+C^=H: Let x∈H.. The Hilbert projection theorem guarantees the existence of a unique m∈C such that ‖x−m‖≤‖x−c‖forallc∈Cx-m≤x-cforallc (or equivalently, for all x−c∈x−C-c-C). Let p:=x−m:=x-m so that x=m+p∈C+p=m+p+p and it remains to show that p∈C⊥.^. The inequality above can be rewritten as: ‖p‖≤‖z‖forallz∈x−C.p≤z forallz-C. Because m∈C and C is a vector space, m+C=C+C=C and C=−C,=-C, which implies that x−C=x+C=p+m+C=p+C.-C=x+C=p+m+C=p+C. The previous inequality thus becomes ‖p‖≤‖z‖forallz∈p+C.p≤z forallz+C. or equivalently, ‖p‖≤‖p+c‖forallc∈C.p≤p+c forallc. But this last statement is true if and only if ⟨p,c⟩=0⟨ p,c ⟩=0 every c∈C.. Thus p∈C⊥.^. ◼▪
