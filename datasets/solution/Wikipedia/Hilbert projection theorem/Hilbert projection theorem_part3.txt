Statement: Hilbert projection theorem — For every vector x in a Hilbert space H and every nonempty closed convex C⊆H,, there exists a unique vector m∈C for which ‖x−m‖-m‖ is equal to δ:=infc∈C‖x−c‖.δ:=inf_cx-c. If the closed subset C is also a vector subspace of H then this minimizer m is the unique element in C such that x−m-m is orthogonal to C.. Detailed elementary
