Properties: Expression as a global minimum The statement and conclusion of the Hilbert projection theorem can be expressed in terms of global minimums of the followings functions. Their notation will also be used to simplify certain statements. Given a non-empty subset C⊆H and some x∈H,, define a function dC,x:C→[0,∞)byc↦‖x−c‖._C,x:C→[0,∞) byc↦x-c. A global minimum point of dC,x,_C,x, if one exists, is any point m in domain⁡dC,x=C domaind_C,x=C such that dC,x(m)≤dC,x(c)forallc∈C,_C,x(m) ≤ d_C,x(c) forallc, in which case dC,x(m)=‖m−x‖_C,x(m)=m-x is equal to the global minimum value of the function dC,x,_C,x, which is: infc∈CdC,x(c)=infc∈C‖x−c‖.inf_cd_C,x(c)=inf_cx-c. Effects of translations and scalings When this global minimum point m exists and is unique then denote it by min(C,x);min(C,x); explicitly, the defining properties of min(C,x)min(C,x) (if it exists) are: min(C,x)∈Cand‖x−min(C,x)‖≤‖x−c‖forallc∈C.min(C,x) and x-min(C,x)≤x-c forallc. The Hilbert projection theorem guarantees that this unique minimum point exists whenever C is a non-empty closed and convex subset of a Hilbert space. However, such a minimum point can also exist in non-convex or non-closed subsets as well; for instance, just as long is C is non-empty, if x∈C then min(C,x)=x.min(C,x)=x. If C⊆H is a non-empty subset, s is any scalar, and x,x0∈H,x_0 are any vectors then min(sC+x0,sx+x0)=smin(C,x)+x0 min(sC+x_0,sx+x_0)=smin(C,x)+x_0 which implies: min(sC,sx)=smin(C,x)min(−C,−x)=−min(C,x)6min (sC,sx) =s min(C,x) min (-C,-x) =- min(C,x) min(C+x0,x+x0)=min(C,x)+x0min(C−x0,x−x0)=min(C,x)−x06min(C+x_0,x+x_0) =min(C,x)+x_0 min(C-x_0,x-x_0) =min(C,x)-x_0 min(C,−x)=min(C+x,0)−xmin(C,0)+x=min(C+x,x)min(C−x,0)=min(C,x)−x6min (C,-x) =min(C+x,0)-x min (C,0) + x =min(C+x,x) min (C-x,0) =min(C,x)-x Examples The following counter-example demonstrates a continuous linear isomorphism A:H→H:H for which min(A(C),A(x))≠A(min(C,x)). min(A(C),A(x))(min(C,x)). Endow H:=R2:=ℝ^2 with the dot product, let x0:=(0,1),_0:=(0,1), and for every real s∈R,∈ℝ, let Ls:=(x,sx):x∈R_s:={(x,sx):x∈ℝ} be the line of slope s through the origin, where it is readily verified that min(Ls,x0)=s1+s2(1,s).min(L_s,x_0)=s/1+s^2(1,s). Pick a real number r≠0≠0 and define A:R2→R2:ℝ^2→ℝ^2 by A(x,y):=(rx,y)(x,y):=(rx,y) (so this map scales the x−-coordinate by r while leaving the y−-coordinate unchanged). Then A:R2→R2:ℝ^2→ℝ^2 is an invertible continuous linear operator that satisfies A(Ls)=Ls/r(L_s)=L_s/r and A(x0)=x0,(x_0)=x_0, so that min(A(Ls),A(x0))=sr2+s2(1,s) min(A(L_s),A(x_0))=s/r^2+s^2(1,s) and A(min(Ls,x0))=s1+s2(r,s).(min(L_s,x_0))=s/1+s^2(r,s). Consequently, if C:=Ls:=L_s with s≠0≠0 and if (r,s)≠(±1,1)(r,s)≠(±1,1) then min(A(C),A(x0))≠A(min(C,x0)). min(A(C),A(x_0))(min(C,x_0)). See
