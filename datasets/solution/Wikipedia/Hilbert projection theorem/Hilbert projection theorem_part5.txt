case: It suffices to prove the theorem in the case of x=0=0 because the general case follows from the statement below by replacing C with C−x.-x. Hilbert projection theorem (case x=0=0)[2] — For every nonempty closed convex subset C⊆H of a Hilbert space H,, there exists a unique vector m∈C such that infc∈C‖c‖=‖m‖.inf_cc=m. Furthermore, letting d:=infc∈C‖c‖,:=inf_cc, if (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ is any sequence in C such that limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d in Rℝ[note 1] then limn→∞cn=mlim_n→∞c_n=m in H.. Proof Let C be as described in this theorem and let d:=infc∈C‖c‖.:=inf_cc. This theorem will follow from the following lemmas. Lemma 1 — If c∙:=(cn)n=1∞_∙:=(c_n)_n=1^∞ is any sequence in C such that limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d in Rℝ then there exists some c∈C such that limn→∞cn=clim_n→∞c_n=c in H.. Furthermore, ‖c‖=d.c=d. Proof of Lemma 1 Vectors involved in the parallelogram law: ‖x+y‖2+‖x−y‖2=2‖x‖2+2‖y‖2.x+y^2+x-y^2=2x^2+2y^2. Because C is convex, if m,n∈N,n∈ℕ then 12(cm+cn)∈C1/2(c_m+c_n) so that by definition of the infimum, d≤‖12(cm+cn)‖,≤1/2(c_m+c_n), which implies that 4d2≤‖cm+cn‖2.4d^2≤c_m+c_n^2. By the parallelogram law, ‖cm+cn‖2+‖cm−cn‖2=2‖cm‖2+2‖cn‖2c_m+c_n^2+c_m-c_n^2=2c_m^2+2c_n^2 where 4d2≤‖cm+cn‖24d^2≤c_m+c_n^2 now implies 4d2+‖cm−cn‖2≤2‖cm‖2+2‖cn‖24d^2+c_m-c_n^2 ≤ 2c_m^2+2c_n^2 and so ‖cm−cn‖2≤2‖cm‖2+2‖cn‖2−4d24c_m-c_n^2 ≤ 2c_m^2+2c_n^2-4d^2 The assumption limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d implies that the right hand side (RHS) of the above inequality can be made arbitrary close to 00 by making m and n sufficiently large.[note 2] The same must consequently also be true of the inequality's left hand side ‖cm−cn‖2c_m-c_n^2 and thus also of ‖cm−cn‖,c_m-c_n, which proves that (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ is a Cauchy sequence in H.. Since H is complete, there exists some c∈H such that limn→∞cn=clim_n→∞c_n=c in H.. Because every cn_n belongs to C,, which is a closed subset of H,, their limit c must also belongs to this closed subset, which proves that c∈C.. Since the norm ‖⋅‖:H→R · :H→ℝ is a continuous function, limn→∞cn=clim_n→∞c_n=c in H implies that limn→∞‖cn‖=‖c‖lim_n→∞c_n=c in R.ℝ. But limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d also holds (by assumption) so that ‖c‖=dc=d (because limits in Rℝ are unique). ◼▪ Lemma 2 — A sequence (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma 1 exists. Proof of Lemma 2 The existence of the sequence follows from the definition of the infimum, as is now shown. The set S:=‖c‖:c∈C:={c:c} is a non-empty subset of non-negative real numbers and d:=infc∈C‖c‖=infS.:=inf_cc=. Let n≥1≥1 be an integer. Because infS<d+1n,<d+1/n, there exists some sn∈S_n such that sn<d+1n._n<d+1/n. Since sn∈S,_n, d=infS≤sn=_n holds (by definition of the infimum). Thus d≤sn<d+1n_n<d+1/n and now the squeeze theorem implies that limn→∞sn=dlim_n→∞s_n=d in R.ℝ. (This first part of the proof works for any non-empty subset of S⊆R⊆ℝ for which d:=infs∈Ss:=inf_ss is finite). For every n∈N,∈ℕ, the fact that sn∈S=‖c‖:c∈C_n={c:c} means that there exists some cn∈C_n such that sn=‖cn‖._n=c_n. The convergence limn→∞sn=dlim_n→∞s_n=d in Rℝ thus becomes limn→∞‖cn‖=dlim_n→∞c_n=d in R.ℝ. ◼▪ Lemma 2 and Lemma 1 together prove that there exists some c∈C such that ‖c‖=d.c=d. Lemma 1 can be used to prove uniqueness as follows. Suppose b∈C is such that ‖b‖=db=d and denote the sequence b,c,b,c,b,c,…,c,b,c,b,c,… by (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ so that the subsequence (c2n)n=1∞(c_2n)_n=1^∞ of even indices is the constant sequence c,c,c,…,c,c,… while the subsequence (c2n−1)n=1∞(c_2n-1)_n=1^∞ of odd indices is the constant sequence b,b,b,….,b,b,…. Because ‖cn‖=dc_n=d for every n∈N,∈ℕ, limn→∞‖cn‖=limn→∞d=dlim_n→∞c_n=lim_n→∞d=d in R,ℝ, which shows that the sequence (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 1. Lemma 1 guarantees the existence of some x∈C such that limn→∞cn=xlim_n→∞c_n=x in H.. Because (cn)n=1∞(c_n)_n=1^∞ converges to x,, so do all of its subsequences. In particular, the subsequence c,c,c,…,c,c,… converges to x,, which implies that x=c=c (because limits in H are unique and this constant subsequence also converges to c). Similarly, x=b=b because the subsequence b,b,b,…,b,b,… converges to both x and b.. Thus b=c,=c, which proves the theorem. ◼▪
