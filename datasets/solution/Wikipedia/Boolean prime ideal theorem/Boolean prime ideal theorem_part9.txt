An easy to read introduction, showing the equivalence of PIT for Boolean algebras and distributive lattices.

The theory in this book often requires choice principles. The notes on various chapters discuss the general relation of the theorems to PIT and MIT for various structures (though mostly lattices) and give pointers to further literature.

Discusses the status of the ultrafilter lemma.

Gives many equivalent statements for the BPI, including prime ideal theorems for other algebraic structures. PITs are considered as special instances of separation lemmas.
