Background: Let X be a separable Hilbert space, and let BV([0, T]; X) denote the normed vector space of all functions f : [0, T] → X with finite total variation over the interval [0, T], equipped with the total variation norm. It is well known that BV([0, T]; X) satisfies the compactness theorem known as Helly's selection theorem: given any sequence of functions (fn)n∈N in BV([0, T]; X) that is uniformly bounded in the total variation norm, there exists a subsequence (fn(k))⊆(fn)⊂BV([0,T];X)(f_n(k))⊆(f_n)⊂BV([0,T];X) and a limit function f ∈ BV([0, T]; X) such that fn(k)(t) converges weakly in X to f(t) for every t ∈ [0, T]. That is, for every continuous linear functional λ ∈ X*, λ(fn(k)(t))→λ(f(t))inRask→∞.λ(f_n(k)(t))→λ(f(t))ℝk→∞. Consider now the Banach space Reg([0, T]; X) of all regulated functions f : [0, T] → X, equipped with the supremum norm. Helly's theorem does not hold for the space Reg([0, T]; X): a counterexample is given by the sequence fn(t)=sin⁡(nt)._n(t)=sin(nt). One may ask, however, if a weaker selection theorem is true, and the Fraňková–Helly selection theorem is such a result. Statement of the Fraňková–Helly selection
