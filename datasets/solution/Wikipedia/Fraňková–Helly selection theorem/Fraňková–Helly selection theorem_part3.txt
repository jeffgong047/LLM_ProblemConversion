theorem: As before, let X be a separable Hilbert space and let Reg([0, T]; X) denote the space of regulated functions f : [0, T] → X, equipped with the supremum norm. Let (fn)n∈N be a sequence in Reg([0, T]; X) satisfying the following condition: for every ε > 0, there exists some Lε > 0 so that each fn may be approximated by a un ∈ BV([0, T]; X) satisfying ‖fn−un‖∞<εf_n-u_n_∞<ε and |un(0)|+Var(un)≤Lε,|u_n(0)|+Var(u_n)_ε, where |-| denotes the norm in X and Var(u) denotes the variation of u, which is defined to be the supremum supΠ∑j=1m|u(tj)−u(tj−1)|sup_Π∑_j=1^m|u(t_j)-u(t_j-1)| over all partitions Π=0=t0<t1<⋯<tm=T,m∈NΠ={0=t_0<t_1<…<t_m=T,m∈𝐍} of [0, T]. Then there exists a subsequence (fn(k))⊆(fn)⊂Reg([0,T];X)(f_n(k))⊆(f_n)⊂Reg([0,T];X) and a limit function f ∈ Reg([0, T]; X) such that fn(k)(t) converges weakly in X to f(t) for every t ∈ [0, T]. That is, for every continuous linear functional λ ∈ X*, λ(fn(k)(t))→λ(f(t))inRask→∞.λ(f_n(k)(t))→λ(f(t))ℝk→∞.
