Statement: Let (M,I)(M,I) be a real analytic EDS. Assume that P⊆M is a connected, k-dimensional, real analytic, regular integral manifold of I with r(P)≥0(P)≥0 (i.e., the tangent spaces TpP_pP are "extendable" to higher dimensional integral elements). Moreover, assume there is a real analytic submanifold R⊆M of codimension r(P)(P) containing P and such that TpR∩H(TpP)_pR(T_pP) has dimension k+1+1 for all p∈P. Then there exists a (locally) unique connected, (k+1)(k+1)-dimensional, real analytic integral manifold X⊆M of I that satisfies P⊆X⊆R. Proof and
