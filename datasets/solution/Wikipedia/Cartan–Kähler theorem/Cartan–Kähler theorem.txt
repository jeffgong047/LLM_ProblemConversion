In mathematics, the Cartan–Kähler theorem is a major result on the integrability conditions for differential systems, in the case of analytic functions, for differential ideals I. It is named for Élie Cartan and Erich Kähler.


Meaning[edit]
It is not true that merely having dI contained in I is sufficient for integrability. There is a problem caused by singular solutions. The theorem computes certain constants that must satisfy an inequality in order that there be a solution.

Statement[edit]
Let (M,I)(M,I) be a real analytic EDS. Assume that P⊆M is a connected, k-dimensional, real analytic, regular integral manifold of I with r(P)≥0(P)≥0 (i.e., the tangent spaces TpP_pP are "extendable" to higher dimensional integral elements).
Moreover, assume there is a real analytic submanifold R⊆M of codimension r(P)(P) containing P and such that TpR∩H(TpP)_pR(T_pP) has dimension k+1+1 for all p∈P.
Then there exists a (locally) unique connected, (k+1)(k+1)-dimensional, real analytic integral manifold X⊆M of I that satisfies P⊆X⊆R.

Proof and assumptions[edit]
The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem is used in the proof, so the analyticity is necessary.
