For instance, the (unnormalized) sinc function, as defined by sinc(z)=sin⁡zzsinc(z)=/z has a singularity at z = 0. This singularity can be removed by defining sinc(0):=1,sinc(0):=1, which is the limit of sinc as z tends to 0. The resulting function is holomorphic. In this case the problem was caused by sinc being given an indeterminate form. Taking a power series expansion for sin⁡(z)zsin(z)/z around the singular point shows that sinc(z)=1z(∑k=0∞(−1)kz2k+1(2k+1)!)=∑k=0∞(−1)kz2k(2k+1)!=1−z23!+z45!−z67!+⋯.sinc(z)=1/z(∑_k=0^∞(-1)^kz^2k+1/(2k+1)!)=∑_k=0^∞(-1)^kz^2k/(2k+1)!=1-z^2/3!+z^4/5!-z^6/7!+⋯. Formally, if U⊂C⊂ℂ is an open subset of the complex plane Cℂ, a∈U a point of U, and f:U∖a→C:U∖{a}→ℂ is a holomorphic function, then a is called a removable singularity for f if there exists a holomorphic function g:U→C:U→ℂ which coincides with f on U∖a∖{a}. We say f is holomorphically extendable over U if such a g exists. Riemann's
