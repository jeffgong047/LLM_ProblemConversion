theorem: Riemann's theorem on removable singularities is as follows: Theorem — Let D⊂C⊂ℂ be an open subset of the complex plane, a∈D a point of D and f a holomorphic function defined on the set D∖a∖{a}. The following are equivalent: f is holomorphically extendable over a. f is continuously extendable over a. There exists a neighborhood of a on which f is bounded. limz→a(z−a)f(z)=0lim_z(z-a)f(z)=0. The implications 1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 4 are trivial. To prove 4 ⇒ 1, we first recall that the holomorphy of a function at a is equivalent to it being analytic at a (proof), i.e. having a power series representation. Define h(z)=(z−a)2f(z)z≠a,0z=a.(z)=(z-a)^2f(z) z, 0 z=a. Clearly, h is holomorphic on D∖a∖{a}, and there exists h′(a)=limz→a(z−a)2f(z)−0z−a=limz→a(z−a)f(z)=0'(a)=lim_z(z-a)^2f(z)-0/z-a=lim_z(z-a)f(z)=0 by 4, hence h is holomorphic on D and has a Taylor series about a: h(z)=c0+c1(z−a)+c2(z−a)2+c3(z−a)3+⋯.(z)=c_0+c_1(z-a)+c_2(z-a)^2+c_3(z-a)^3+⋯ . We have c0 = h(a) = 0 and c1 = h'(a) = 0; therefore h(z)=c2(z−a)2+c3(z−a)3+⋯.(z)=c_2(z-a)^2+c_3(z-a)^3+⋯ . Hence, where z≠a, we have: f(z)=h(z)(z−a)2=c2+c3(z−a)+⋯.(z)=h(z)/(z-a)^2=c_2+c_3(z-a)+⋯ . However, g(z)=c2+c3(z−a)+⋯.(z)=c_2+c_3(z-a)+⋯ . is holomorphic on D, thus an extension of f. Other kinds of
