singularities: Unlike functions of a real variable, holomorphic functions are sufficiently rigid that their isolated singularities can be completely classified. A holomorphic function's singularity is either not really a singularity at all, i.e. a removable singularity, or one of the following two types: In light of Riemann's theorem, given a non-removable singularity, one might ask whether there exists a natural number m such that limz→a(z−a)m+1f(z)=0lim_z(z-a)^m+1f(z)=0. If so, a is called a pole of f and the smallest such m is the order of a. So removable singularities are precisely the poles of order 0. A holomorphic function blows up uniformly near its other poles. If an isolated singularity a of f is neither removable nor a pole, it is called an essential singularity. The Great Picard Theorem shows that such an f maps every punctured open neighborhood U∖a∖{a} to the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of at most one point. See
