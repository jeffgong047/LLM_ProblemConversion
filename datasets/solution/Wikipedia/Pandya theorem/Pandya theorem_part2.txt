Description: Pandya theorem provides a theoretical framework for connecting the energy levels in jj coupling of a nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hole system. It is also referred to as Pandya Transformation or Pandya Relation in literature. It provides a very useful tool for extending shell model calculations across shells, for systems involving both particles and holes. The Pandya transformation, which involves angular momentum re-coupling coefficients (Racah-Coefficient), can be used to deduce one-particle one-hole (ph) matrix elements. By assuming the wave function to be "pure" (no configuration mixing), Pandya transformation could be used to set an upper bound to the contributions of 3-body forces to the energies of nuclear states.
