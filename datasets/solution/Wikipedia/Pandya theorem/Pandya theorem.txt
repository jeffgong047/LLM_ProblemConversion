The Pandya theorem is a good illustration of the richness of information forthcoming from a judicious use of subtle symmetry principles connecting vastly different sectors of nuclear systems. It is a tool for calculations regarding both particles and holes.


Description[edit]
Pandya theorem provides a theoretical framework for connecting the energy levels in jj coupling of a nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hole system. It is also referred to as Pandya Transformation or Pandya Relation in literature. It provides a very useful tool for extending shell model calculations across shells, for systems involving both particles and holes. 
The Pandya transformation, which involves angular momentum re-coupling coefficients (Racah-Coefficient), can be used to deduce one-particle one-hole (ph) matrix elements. By assuming the wave function to be "pure" (no configuration mixing), Pandya transformation could be used to set an upper bound to the contributions of 3-body forces to the energies of nuclear states.

History[edit]
It was first published in 1956 as follows:
Nucleon-Hole Interaction in jj Coupling
S.P. Pandya, Phys. Rev. 103, 956 (1956).
Received 9 May 1956
A theorem connecting the energy levels in jj coupling of a nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hole system is derived, and applied in particular to Cl38 and K40.

Shell model Monte Carlo approaches to nuclear level densities[edit]
Since it is by no means obvious how to extract "pairing correlations" from the realistic shell-model calculations, Pandya transform is applied in such cases. The "pairing Hamiltonian" is an integral part of the residual shell-model interaction. The shell-model Hamiltonian is usually written in the p-p representation, but it also can be transformed to the p-h representation by means of the Pandya transformation. This means that the high-J interaction between pairs can translate into the low-J interaction in the p-h channel. It is only in the mean-field theory that the division into "particle-hole" and "particle-particle" channels appears naturally.

Features[edit]
Some features of the Pandya transformation are as follows:

It relates diagonal and non-diagonal elements.
To calculate any particle-hole element, the particle-particle elements for all spins belonging to the orbitals involved are needed; the same holds for the reverse transformation. Because the experimental information is nearly always incomplete, one can only transform from the theoretical particle-particle elements to particle-hole.
The Pandya transform does not describe the matrix elements that mix one-particle one-hole and two-particle two-hole states. Therefore, only states of rather pure one-particle one-hole structure can be treated.
Pandya theorem establishes a relation between particle-particle and particle-hole spectra. Here one considers the energy levels of two nucleons with one in orbit j and another in orbit j' and relate them to the energy levels of a nucleon hole in orbit j and a nucleus in j. Assuming pure j-j coupling and two-body interaction, Pandya (1956) derived the following relation:
This was successfully tested in the spectra of
Figure 3 shows the results where the discrepancy between the calculated and observed spectra is less than 25 keV.
