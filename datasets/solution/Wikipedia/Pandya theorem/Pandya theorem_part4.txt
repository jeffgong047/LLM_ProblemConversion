densities: Since it is by no means obvious how to extract "pairing correlations" from the realistic shell-model calculations, Pandya transform is applied in such cases. The "pairing Hamiltonian" is an integral part of the residual shell-model interaction. The shell-model Hamiltonian is usually written in the p-p representation, but it also can be transformed to the p-h representation by means of the Pandya transformation. This means that the high-J interaction between pairs can translate into the low-J interaction in the p-h channel. It is only in the mean-field theory that the division into "particle-hole" and "particle-particle" channels appears naturally.
