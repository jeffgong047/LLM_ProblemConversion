Features: Some features of the Pandya transformation are as follows: It relates diagonal and non-diagonal elements. To calculate any particle-hole element, the particle-particle elements for all spins belonging to the orbitals involved are needed; the same holds for the reverse transformation. Because the experimental information is nearly always incomplete, one can only transform from the theoretical particle-particle elements to particle-hole. The Pandya transform does not describe the matrix elements that mix one-particle one-hole and two-particle two-hole states. Therefore, only states of rather pure one-particle one-hole structure can be treated. Pandya theorem establishes a relation between particle-particle and particle-hole spectra. Here one considers the energy levels of two nucleons with one in orbit j and another in orbit j' and relate them to the energy levels of a nucleon hole in orbit j and a nucleus in j. Assuming pure j-j coupling and two-body interaction, Pandya (1956) derived the following relation: This was successfully tested in the spectra of Figure 3 shows the results where the discrepancy between the calculated and observed spectra is less than 25 keV.
