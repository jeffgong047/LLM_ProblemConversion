theorem: The friendship theorem of Paul Erdős, Alfréd Rényi, and Vera T. Sós (1966)[3] states that the finite graphs with the property that every two vertices have exactly one neighbor in common are exactly the friendship graphs. Informally, if a group of people has the property that every pair of people has exactly one friend in common, then there must be one person who is a friend to all the others. However, for infinite graphs, there can be many different graphs with the same cardinality that have this property.[4] A combinatorial proof of the friendship theorem was given by Mertzios and Unger.[5] Another proof was given by Craig Huneke.[6] A formalised proof in Metamath was reported by Alexander van der Vekens in October 2018 on the Metamath mailing list.[7] Labeling and
