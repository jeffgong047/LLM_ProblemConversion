colouring: The friendship graph has chromatic number 3 and chromatic index 2n. Its chromatic polynomial can be deduced from the chromatic polynomial of the cycle graph C3 and is equal to (x−2)n(x−1)nx(x-2)^n(x-1)^nx. The friendship graph Fn is edge-graceful if and only if n is odd. It is graceful if and only if n ≡ 0 (mod 4) or n ≡ 1 (mod 4).[8][9] Every friendship graph is factor-critical. Extremal graph
