theory: According to extremal graph theory, every graph with sufficiently many edges (relative to its number of vertices) must contain a k-fan as a subgraph. More specifically, this is true for an n-vertex graph if the number of edges is ⌊n24⌋+f(k),⌊n^2/4⌋+f(k), where f(k)(k) is k2−k^2-k if k is odd, and f(k)(k) is k2−3k/2^2-3k/2 if k is even. These bounds generalize Turán's theorem on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph, and they are the best possible bounds for this problem, in that for any smaller number of edges there exist graphs that do not contain a k-fan.[10]
