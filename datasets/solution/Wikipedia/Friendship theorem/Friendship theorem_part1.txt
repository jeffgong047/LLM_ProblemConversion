In the mathematical field of graph theory, the friendship graph (or Dutch windmill graph or n-fan) Fn is a planar, undirected graph with 2n + 1 vertices and 3n edges.[1] The friendship graph Fn can be constructed by joining n copies of the cycle graph C3 with a common vertex, which becomes a universal vertex for the graph.[2] By construction, the friendship graph Fn is isomorphic to the windmill graph Wd(3, n). It is unit distance with girth 3, diameter 2 and radius 1. The graph F2 is isomorphic to the butterfly graph. Friendship graphs are generalized by the triangular cactus graphs. Friendship
