Duality between the process of restricting and inducting in representation theory
In mathematics, and in particular representation theory, Frobenius reciprocity is a theorem expressing a duality between the process of restricting and inducting. It can be used to leverage knowledge about representations of a subgroup to find and classify representations of "large" groups that contain them. It is named for Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, the inventor of the representation theory of finite groups.


Statement[edit]
Character theory[edit]
The theorem was originally stated in terms of character theory. Let G be a finite group with a subgroup H, let ResHGRes_H^G denote the restriction of a character, or more generally, class function of G to H, and let IndHGInd_H^G denote the induced class function of a given class function on H. For any finite group A, there is an inner product ⟨−,−⟩A⟨-,-⟩_A on the vector space of class functions A→C→ℂ (described in detail in the article Schur orthogonality relations). Now, for any class functions ψ:H→Cψ:H→ℂ and φ:G→Cφ:G→ℂ, the following equality holds:[1][2]

⟨IndHG⁡ψ,φ⟩G=⟨ψ,ResHG⁡φ⟩H.⟨Ind_H^Gψ,φ⟩_G=⟨ψ,Res_H^Gφ⟩_H.
In other words, IndHGInd_H^G and ResHGRes_H^G are Hermitian adjoint.




Proof of Frobenius reciprocity for class functions



Let ψ:H→Cψ:H→ℂ and φ:G→Cφ:G→ℂ be class functions.
Proof. Every class function can be written as a linear combination of irreducible characters. As ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ is a bilinear form, we can, without loss of generality, assume ψψ and φφ to be characters of irreducible representations of H in W and of G in V,, respectively.
We define ψ(s)=0ψ(s)=0 for all s∈G∖H.. Then we have

⟨Ind(ψ),φ⟩G=1|G|∑t∈GInd(ψ)(t)φ(t−1)=1|G|∑t∈G1|H|∑s∈Gs−1ts∈Hψ(s−1ts)φ(t−1)=1|G|1|H|∑t∈G∑s∈Gψ(s−1ts)φ((s−1ts)−1)=1|G|1|H|∑t∈G∑s∈Gψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Gψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Hψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Hψ(t)Res(φ)(t−1)=⟨ψ,Res(φ)⟩H⟨Ind(ψ),φ⟩_G   =1/|G|∑_tInd(ψ)(t)φ(t^-1)
   =1/|G|∑_t1/|H|∑_s^-1tsψ(s^-1ts)φ(t^-1)
   =1/|G|1/|H|∑_t∑_sψ(s^-1ts)φ((s^-1ts)^-1)
   =1/|G|1/|H|∑_t∑_sψ(t)φ(t^-1)
   =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)φ(t^-1)
   =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)φ(t^-1)
   =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)Res(φ)(t^-1)
   =⟨ψ,Res(φ)⟩_H
In the course of this sequence of equations we used only the definition of induction on class functions and the properties of characters. ◻
Alternative proof. In terms of the group algebra, i.e. by the alternative description of the induced representation, the Frobenius reciprocity is a special case of a general equation for a change of rings:

HomC[H](W,U)=HomC[G](C[G]⊗C[H]W,U).Hom_ℂ[H](W,U)=Hom_ℂ[G](ℂ[G]⊗_ℂ[H]W,U).
This equation is by definition equivalent to [how?]

⟨W,Res(U)⟩H=⟨W,U⟩H=⟨Ind(W),U⟩G.,Res(U)⟩_H=,U⟩_H=⟨Ind(W),U⟩_G.
As this bilinear form tallies the bilinear form on the corresponding characters, the theorem follows without calculation. ◻


Module theory[edit]
See also: Change of rings § Relation between the extension of scalars and the restriction of scalars
As explained in the section Representation theory of finite groups#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra, the theory of the representations of a group G over a field K is, in a certain sense, equivalent to the theory of modules over the group algebra K[G].[3] Therefore, there is a corresponding Frobenius reciprocity theorem for K[G]-modules.
Let G be a group with subgroup H, let M be an H-module, and let N be a G-module. In the language of module theory, the induced module K[G]⊗K[H]M[G]⊗_K[H]M corresponds to the induced representation IndHGInd_H^G, whereas the restriction of scalars K[H]N_K[H]N corresponds to the restriction ResHGRes_H^G. Accordingly, the statement is as follows: The following sets of module homomorphisms are in bijective correspondence:

HomK[G]⁡(K[G]⊗K[H]M,N)≅HomK[H]⁡(M,K[H]N)Hom_K[G](K[G]⊗_K[H]M,N)≅Hom_K[H](M,_K[H]N).[4][5]
As noted below in the section on category theory, this result applies to modules over all rings, not just modules over group algebras.

Category theory[edit]
Let G be a group with a subgroup H, and let ResHG,IndHGRes_H^G,Ind_H^G be defined as above. For any group A and field K let RepAKRep_A^K denote the category of linear representations of A over K. There is a forgetful functor

ResHG:RepG⟶RepH(V,ρ)⟼ResHG⁡(V,ρ)Res_H^G:Rep_G   ⟶Rep_H
(V,ρ)   ⟼Res_H^G(V,ρ)
This functor acts as the identity on morphisms. There is a functor going in the opposite direction:

IndHG:RepH⟶RepG(W,τ)⟼IndHG⁡(W,τ)Ind_H^G:Rep_H   ⟶Rep_G
(W,τ)   ⟼Ind_H^G(W,τ)
These functors form an adjoint pair IndHG⊣ResHGInd_H^G⊣Res_H^G.[6] In the case of finite groups, they are actually both left- and right-adjoint to one another. This adjunction gives rise to a universal property for the induced representation (for details, see Induced representation#Properties).
In the language of module theory, the corresponding adjunction is an instance of the more general relationship between restriction and extension of scalars.
