theory: Let G be a group with a subgroup H, and let ResHG,IndHGRes_H^G,Ind_H^G be defined as above. For any group A and field K let RepAKRep_A^K denote the category of linear representations of A over K. There is a forgetful functor ResHG:RepG⟶RepH(V,ρ)⟼ResHG⁡(V,ρ)Res_H^G:Rep_G ⟶Rep_H (V,ρ) ⟼Res_H^G(V,ρ) This functor acts as the identity on morphisms. There is a functor going in the opposite direction: IndHG:RepH⟶RepG(W,τ)⟼IndHG⁡(W,τ)Ind_H^G:Rep_H ⟶Rep_G (W,τ) ⟼Ind_H^G(W,τ) These functors form an adjoint pair IndHG⊣ResHGInd_H^G⊣Res_H^G.[6] In the case of finite groups, they are actually both left- and right-adjoint to one another. This adjunction gives rise to a universal property for the induced representation (for details, see Induced representation#Properties). In the language of module theory, the corresponding adjunction is an instance of the more general relationship between restriction and extension of scalars. See
