theory: The theorem was originally stated in terms of character theory. Let G be a finite group with a subgroup H, let ResHGRes_H^G denote the restriction of a character, or more generally, class function of G to H, and let IndHGInd_H^G denote the induced class function of a given class function on H. For any finite group A, there is an inner product ⟨−,−⟩A⟨-,-⟩_A on the vector space of class functions A→C→ℂ (described in detail in the article Schur orthogonality relations). Now, for any class functions ψ:H→Cψ:H→ℂ and φ:G→Cφ:G→ℂ, the following equality holds:[1][2] ⟨IndHG⁡ψ,φ⟩G=⟨ψ,ResHG⁡φ⟩H.⟨Ind_H^Gψ,φ⟩_G=⟨ψ,Res_H^Gφ⟩_H. In other words, IndHGInd_H^G and ResHGRes_H^G are Hermitian adjoint. Proof of Frobenius reciprocity for class functions Let ψ:H→Cψ:H→ℂ and φ:G→Cφ:G→ℂ be class functions. Proof. Every class function can be written as a linear combination of irreducible characters. As ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨·,·⟩ is a bilinear form, we can, without loss of generality, assume ψψ and φφ to be characters of irreducible representations of H in W and of G in V,, respectively. We define ψ(s)=0ψ(s)=0 for all s∈G∖H.. Then we have ⟨Ind(ψ),φ⟩G=1|G|∑t∈GInd(ψ)(t)φ(t−1)=1|G|∑t∈G1|H|∑s∈Gs−1ts∈Hψ(s−1ts)φ(t−1)=1|G|1|H|∑t∈G∑s∈Gψ(s−1ts)φ((s−1ts)−1)=1|G|1|H|∑t∈G∑s∈Gψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Gψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Hψ(t)φ(t−1)=1|H|∑t∈Hψ(t)Res(φ)(t−1)=⟨ψ,Res(φ)⟩H⟨Ind(ψ),φ⟩_G =1/|G|∑_tInd(ψ)(t)φ(t^-1) =1/|G|∑_t1/|H|∑_s^-1tsψ(s^-1ts)φ(t^-1) =1/|G|1/|H|∑_t∑_sψ(s^-1ts)φ((s^-1ts)^-1) =1/|G|1/|H|∑_t∑_sψ(t)φ(t^-1) =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)φ(t^-1) =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)φ(t^-1) =1/|H|∑_tψ(t)Res(φ)(t^-1) =⟨ψ,Res(φ)⟩_H In the course of this sequence of equations we used only the definition of induction on class functions and the properties of characters. ◻ Alternative proof. In terms of the group algebra, i.e. by the alternative description of the induced representation, the Frobenius reciprocity is a special case of a general equation for a change of rings: HomC[H](W,U)=HomC[G](C[G]⊗C[H]W,U).Hom_ℂ[H](W,U)=Hom_ℂ[G](ℂ[G]⊗_ℂ[H]W,U). This equation is by definition equivalent to [how?] ⟨W,Res(U)⟩H=⟨W,U⟩H=⟨Ind(W),U⟩G.,Res(U)⟩_H=,U⟩_H=⟨Ind(W),U⟩_G. As this bilinear form tallies the bilinear form on the corresponding characters, the theorem follows without calculation. ◻ Module
