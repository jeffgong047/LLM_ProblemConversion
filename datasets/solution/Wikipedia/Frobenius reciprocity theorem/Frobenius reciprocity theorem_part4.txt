theory: See also: Change of rings § Relation between the extension of scalars and the restriction of scalars As explained in the section Representation theory of finite groups#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra, the theory of the representations of a group G over a field K is, in a certain sense, equivalent to the theory of modules over the group algebra K[G].[3] Therefore, there is a corresponding Frobenius reciprocity theorem for K[G]-modules. Let G be a group with subgroup H, let M be an H-module, and let N be a G-module. In the language of module theory, the induced module K[G]⊗K[H]M[G]⊗_K[H]M corresponds to the induced representation IndHGInd_H^G, whereas the restriction of scalars K[H]N_K[H]N corresponds to the restriction ResHGRes_H^G. Accordingly, the statement is as follows: The following sets of module homomorphisms are in bijective correspondence: HomK[G]⁡(K[G]⊗K[H]M,N)≅HomK[H]⁡(M,K[H]N)Hom_K[G](K[G]⊗_K[H]M,N)≅Hom_K[H](M,_K[H]N).[4][5] As noted below in the section on category theory, this result applies to modules over all rings, not just modules over group algebras.
