History: The theorem is named after Joseph Kruskal and Gyula O. H. Katona, who published it in 1963 and 1968 respectively. According to Le & Römer (2019), it was discovered independently by Kruskal (1963), Katona (1968), Marcel-Paul Schützenberger (1959), Harper (1966), and Clements & Lindström (1969). Donald Knuth (2011) writes that the earliest of these references, by Schützenberger, has an incomplete proof. See
