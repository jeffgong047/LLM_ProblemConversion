hypergraphs: Let A be a set consisting of N distinct i-element subsets of a fixed set U ("the universe") and B be the set of all (i−r)(i-r)-element subsets of the sets in A. Expand N as above. Then the cardinality of B is bounded below as follows: |B|≥(nii−r)+(ni−1i−r−1)+…+(njj−r).|B|≥n_ii-r+n_i-1i-r-1+…+n_jj-r. Lovász' simplified
