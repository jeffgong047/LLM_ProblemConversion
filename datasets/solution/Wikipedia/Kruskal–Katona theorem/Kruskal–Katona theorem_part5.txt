formulation: The following weaker but useful form is due to László Lovász (1993, 13.31b). Let A be a set of i-element subsets of a fixed set U ("the universe") and B be the set of all (i−r)(i-r)-element subsets of the sets in A. If |A|=(xi)|A|=xi then |B|≥(xi−r)|B|≥xi-r. In this formulation, x need not be an integer. The value of the binomial expression is (xi)=x(x−1)…(x−i+1)i!xi=x(x-1)…(x-i+1)/i!. Ingredients of the
