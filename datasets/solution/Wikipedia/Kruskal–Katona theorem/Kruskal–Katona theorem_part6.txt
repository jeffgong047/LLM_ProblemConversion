proof: For every positive i, list all i-element subsets a1 < a2 < … ai of the set N of natural numbers in the colexicographical order. For example, for i = 3, the list begins 123,124,134,234,125,135,235,145,245,345,….123,124,134,234,125,135,235,145,245,345,…. Given a vector f=(f0,f1,...,fd−1)=(f_0,f_1,...,f_d-1) with positive integer components, let Δf be the subset of the power set 2N consisting of the empty set together with the first fi−1_i-1 i-element subsets of N in the list for i = 1, …, d. Then the following conditions are equivalent: Vector f is the f-vector of a simplicial complex Δ. Δf is a simplicial complex. fi(i)≤fi−1,1≤i≤d−1._i^(i)_i-1, 1-1. The difficult implication is 1 ⇒ 2.
