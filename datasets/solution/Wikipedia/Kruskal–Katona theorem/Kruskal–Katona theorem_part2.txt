Statement: Given two positive integers N and i, there is a unique way to expand N as a sum of binomial coefficients as follows: N=(nii)+(ni−1i−1)+…+(njj),ni>ni−1>…>nj≥j≥1.=n_ii+n_i-1i-1+…+n_jj,_i>n_i-1>…>n_j≥1. This expansion can be constructed by applying the greedy algorithm: set ni to be the maximal n such that N≥(ni),≥ni, replace N with the difference, i with i − 1, and repeat until the difference becomes zero. Define N(i−1)=(nii−1)+(ni−1i−2)+…+(njj−1).^(i-1)=n_ii-1+n_i-1i-2+…+n_jj-1. Statement for simplicial
