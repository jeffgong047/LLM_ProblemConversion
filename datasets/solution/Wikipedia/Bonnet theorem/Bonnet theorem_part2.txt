theorem: Any surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a first and second fundamental form, which automatically are interrelated by the Gauss–Codazzi equations. Bonnet's theorem asserts a local converse to this result.[1] Given an open region D in R2, let g and h be symmetric 2-tensors on D, with g additionally required to be positive-definite. If these are smooth and satisfy the Gauss–Codazzi equations, then Bonnet's theorem says that D is covered by open sets which can be smoothly embedded into R3 with first fundamental form g and second fundamental form (relative to one of the two choices of unit normal vector field) h. Furthermore, each of these embeddings is uniquely determined up to a rigid motion of R3. Bonnet's theorem is a corollary of the Frobenius theorem, upon viewing the Gauss–Codazzi equations as a system of first-order partial differential equations for the two coordinate derivatives of the position vector of an embedding, together with the normal vector.[2] General
