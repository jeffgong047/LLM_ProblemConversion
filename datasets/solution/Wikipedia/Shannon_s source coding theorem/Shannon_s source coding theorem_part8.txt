sources: Define typical set Aεn as: Anε=x1n:|−1nlog⁡p(X1,⋯,Xn)−Hn¯(X)|<ε._n^ε={x_1^n left|-1/n(X_1,⋯,X_n)-H_n(X)|<ε}. Then, for given δ > 0, for n large enough, Pr(Aεn) > 1 − δ. Now we just encode the sequences in the typical set, and usual methods in source coding show that the cardinality of this set is smaller than 2n(Hn¯(X)+ε)2^n(H_n(X)+ε). Thus, on an average, Hn(X) + ε bits suffice for encoding with probability greater than 1 − δ, where ε and δ can be made arbitrarily small, by making n larger. See
