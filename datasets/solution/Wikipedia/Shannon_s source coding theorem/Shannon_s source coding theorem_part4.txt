codes: Let Œ£1, Œ£2 denote two finite alphabets and let Œ£‚àó1 and Œ£‚àó2 denote the set of all finite words from those alphabets (respectively). Suppose that X is a random variable taking values in Œ£1 and let f be a uniquely decodable code from Œ£‚àó1 to Œ£‚àó2 where |Œ£2| = a. Let S denote the random variable given by the length of codeword f (X). If f is optimal in the sense that it has the minimal expected word length for X, then (Shannon 1948): H(X)log2‚Å°a‚â§E[S]<H(X)log2‚Å°a+1H(X)/log_2a‚â§ùîº[S]<H(X)/log_2a+1 Where Eùîº denotes the expected value operator.
