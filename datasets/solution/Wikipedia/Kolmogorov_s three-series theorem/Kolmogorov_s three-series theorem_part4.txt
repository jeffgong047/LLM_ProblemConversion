("if"): Condition (i) and Borel–Cantelli give that Xn=Yn_n=Y_n for n large, almost surely. Hence ∑n=1∞Xn∑_n=1^∞X_n converges if and only if ∑n=1∞Yn∑_n=1^∞Y_n converges. Conditions (ii)-(iii) and Kolmogorov's Two-Series Theorem give the almost sure convergence of ∑n=1∞Yn∑_n=1^∞Y_n. Necessity of conditions ("only
