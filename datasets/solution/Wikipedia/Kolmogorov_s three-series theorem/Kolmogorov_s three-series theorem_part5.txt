if"): Suppose that ∑n=1∞Xn∑_n=1^∞X_n converges almost surely. Without condition (i), by Borel–Cantelli there would exist some A>0>0 such that |Xn|≥A{|X_n|} for infinitely many n, almost surely. But then the series would diverge. Therefore, we must have condition (i). We see that condition (iii) implies condition (ii): Kolmogorov's two-series theorem along with condition (i) applied to the case A=1=1 gives the convergence of ∑n=1∞(Yn−E[Yn])∑_n=1^∞(Y_n-𝔼[Y_n]). So given the convergence of ∑n=1∞Yn∑_n=1^∞Y_n, we have ∑n=1∞E[Yn]∑_n=1^∞𝔼[Y_n] converges, so condition (ii) is implied. Thus, it only remains to demonstrate the necessity of condition (iii), and we will have obtained the full result. It is equivalent to check condition (iii) for the series ∑n=1∞Zn=∑n=1∞(Yn−Yn′)∑_n=1^∞Z_n=∑_n=1^∞(Y_n-Y'_n) where for each n, Yn_n and Yn′'_n are IID—that is, to employ the assumption that E[Yn]=0𝔼[Y_n]=0, since Zn_n is a sequence of random variables bounded by 2, converging almost surely, and with var(Zn)=2var(Yn)var(Z_n)=2var(Y_n). So we wish to check that if ∑n=1∞Zn∑_n=1^∞Z_n converges, then ∑n=1∞var(Zn)∑_n=1^∞var(Z_n) converges as well. This is a special case of a more general result from martingale theory with summands equal to the increments of a martingale sequence and the same conditions (E[Zn]=0𝔼[Z_n]=0; the series of the variances is converging; and the summands are bounded).[2][3][4]
