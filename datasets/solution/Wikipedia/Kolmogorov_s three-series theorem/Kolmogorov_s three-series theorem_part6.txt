Example: As an illustration of the theorem, consider the example of the harmonic series with random signs: ∑n=1∞±1n.∑_n=1^∞±1/n. Here, "±±" means that each term 1/n1/n is taken with a random sign that is either 11 or −1-1 with respective probabilities 1/2,1/21/2,/2, and all random signs are chosen independently. Let Xn_n in the theorem denote a random variable that takes the values 1/n1/n and −1/n-1/n with equal probabilities. With A=2=2 the summands of the first two series are identically zero and var(Yn)=n−2^-2. The conditions of the theorem are then satisfied, so it follows that the harmonic series with random signs converges almost surely. On the other hand, the analogous series of (for example) square root reciprocals with random signs, namely ∑n=1∞±1n,∑_n=1^∞±1/√(n), diverges almost surely, since condition (3) in the theorem is not satisfied for any A. Note that this is different from the behavior of the analogous series with alternating signs, ∑n=1∞(−1)n/n∑_n=1^∞(-1)^n/√(n), which does converge.
