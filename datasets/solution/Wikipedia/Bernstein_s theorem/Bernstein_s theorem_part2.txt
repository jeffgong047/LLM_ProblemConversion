functions: Nonnegative functions whose derivative is completely monotone are called Bernstein functions. Every Bernstein function has the Lévy–Khintchine representation: f(t)=a+bt+∫0∞(1−e−tx)μ(dx),(t)=a+bt+∫_0^∞(1-e^-tx)μ(dx), where a,b≥0,b≥0 and μμ is a measure on the positive real half-line such that ∫0∞(1∧x)μ(dx)<∞.∫_0^∞(1)μ(dx)<∞.
