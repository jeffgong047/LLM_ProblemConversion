proof: The Vitali covering lemma is vital to the proof of this theorem; its role lies in proving the estimate for the Hardyâ€“Littlewood maximal function. The theorem also holds if balls are replaced, in the definition of the derivative, by families of sets with diameter tending to zero satisfying the Lebesgue's regularity condition, defined above as family of sets with bounded eccentricity. This follows since the same substitution can be made in the statement of the Vitali covering lemma.
