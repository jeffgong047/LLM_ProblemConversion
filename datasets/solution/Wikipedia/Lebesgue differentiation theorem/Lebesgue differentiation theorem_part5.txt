Discussion: This is an analogue, and a generalization, of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which equates a Riemann integrable function and the derivative of its (indefinite) integral. It is also possible to show a converse – that every differentiable function is equal to the integral of its derivative, but this requires a Henstock–Kurzweil integral in order to be able to integrate an arbitrary derivative. A special case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem is the Lebesgue density theorem, which is equivalent to the differentiation theorem for characteristic functions of measurable sets. The density theorem is usually proved using a simpler method (e.g. see Measure and Category). This theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on Rn instead of Lebesgue measure (a proof can be found in e.g. (Ledrappier & Young 1985)). More generally, it is true of any finite Borel measure on a separable metric space such that at least one of the following holds: the metric space is a Riemannian manifold, the metric space is a locally compact ultrametric space, the measure is doubling. A proof of these results can be found in sections 2.8–2.9 of (Federer 1969). See
