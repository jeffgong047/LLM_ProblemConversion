Statement: For a Lebesgue integrable real or complex-valued function f on Rn, the indefinite integral is a set function which maps a measurable set A to the Lebesgue integral of f⋅1A·1_A, where 1A1_A denotes the characteristic function of the set A. It is usually written A↦∫Afdλ,↦∫_Af mathrmdλ, with λ the n–dimensional Lebesgue measure. The derivative of this integral at x is defined to be limB→x1|B|∫Bfdλ,lim_B1/|B|∫_Bf dλ, where |B| denotes the volume (i.e., the Lebesgue measure) of a ball B centered at x, and B → x means that the diameter of B tends to 0. The Lebesgue differentiation theorem (Lebesgue 1910) states that this derivative exists and is equal to f(x) at almost every point x ∈ Rn.[1] In fact a slightly stronger statement is true. Note that: |1|B|∫Bf(y)dλ(y)−f(x)|=|1|B|∫B(f(y)−f(x))dλ(y)|≤1|B|∫B|f(y)−f(x)|dλ(y).|1/|B|∫_Bf(y) dλ(y)-f(x)|=|1/|B|∫_B(f(y)-f(x)) dλ(y)|≤1/|B|∫_B|f(y)-f(x)| dλ(y). The stronger assertion is that the right hand side tends to zero for almost every point x. The points x for which this is true are called the Lebesgue points of f. A more general version also holds. One may replace the balls B by a family V𝒱 of sets U of bounded eccentricity. This means that there exists some fixed c > 0 such that each set U from the family is contained in a ball B with |U|≥c|B||U| |B|. It is also assumed that every point x ∈ Rn is contained in arbitrarily small sets from V𝒱. When these sets shrink to x, the same result holds: for almost every point x, f(x)=limU→x,U∈V1|U|∫Ufdλ.(x)=lim_U, U∈𝒱1/|U|∫_Uf dλ. The family of cubes is an example of such a family V𝒱, as is the family V𝒱(m) of rectangles in R2 such that the ratio of sides stays between m−1 and m, for some fixed m ≥ 1. If an arbitrary norm is given on Rn, the family of balls for the metric associated to the norm is another example. The one-dimensional case was proved earlier by Lebesgue (1904). If f is integrable on the real line, the function F(x)=∫(−∞,x]f(t)dt(x)=∫_(-∞,x]f(t) dt is almost everywhere differentiable, with F′(x)=f(x).'(x)=f(x). Were F defined by a Riemann integral this would be essentially the fundamental theorem of calculus, but Lebesgue proved that it remains true when using the Lebesgue integral.[2]
