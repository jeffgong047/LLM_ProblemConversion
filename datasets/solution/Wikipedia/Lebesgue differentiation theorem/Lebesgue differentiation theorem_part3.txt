Proof: The theorem in its stronger form—that almost every point is a Lebesgue point of a locally integrable function f—can be proved as a consequence of the weak–L1 estimates for the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function. The proof below follows the standard treatment that can be found in Benedetto & Czaja (2009), Stein & Shakarchi (2005), Wheeden & Zygmund (1977) and Rudin (1987). Since the statement is local in character, f can be assumed to be zero outside some ball of finite radius and hence integrable. It is then sufficient to prove that the set Eα=x∈Rn:limsup|B|→0,x∈B1|B||∫Bf(y)−f(x)dy|>2α_α={x∈𝐑^n:lim sup_|B|→0, x1/|B||∫_Bf(y)-f(x) dy|>2α} has measure 0 for all α > 0. Let ε > 0 be given. Using the density of continuous functions of compact support in L1(Rn), one can find such a function g satisfying ‖f−g‖L1=∫Rn|f(x)−g(x)|dx<ε.f-g_L^1=∫_𝐑^n|f(x)-g(x)| dx<ε. It is then helpful to rewrite the main difference as 1|B|∫Bf(y)dy−f(x)=(1|B|∫B(f(y)−g(y))dy)+(1|B|∫Bg(y)dy−g(x))+(g(x)−f(x)).1/|B|∫_Bf(y) dy-f(x)=(1/|B|∫_B(f(y)-g(y)) dy)+(1/|B|∫_Bg(y) dy-g(x))+(g(x)-f(x)). The first term can be bounded by the value at x of the maximal function for f − g, denoted here by (f−g)∗(x)(f-g)^*(x): 1|B|∫B|f(y)−g(y)|dy≤supr>01|Br(x)|∫Br(x)|f(y)−g(y)|dy=(f−g)∗(x).1/|B|∫_B|f(y)-g(y)| dy≤sup_r>01/|B_r(x)|∫_B_r(x)|f(y)-g(y)| dy=(f-g)^*(x). The second term disappears in the limit since g is a continuous function, and the third term is bounded by |f(x) − g(x)|. For the absolute value of the original difference to be greater than 2α in the limit, at least one of the first or third terms must be greater than α in absolute value. However, the estimate on the Hardy–Littlewood function says that |x:(f−g)∗(x)>α|≤Anα‖f−g‖L1<Anαε,|{x:(f-g)^*(x)>α}|≤A_n/α f-g_L^1<A_n/α ε, for some constant An depending only upon the dimension n. The Markov inequality (also called Tchebyshev's inequality) says that |x:|f(x)−g(x)|>α|≤1α‖f−g‖L1<1αε|{x:|f(x)-g(x)|>α}|≤1/α f-g_L^1<1/α ε whence |Eα|≤An+1αε.|E_α|≤A_n+1/α ε. Since ε was arbitrary, it can be taken to be arbitrarily small, and the theorem follows. Discussion of
