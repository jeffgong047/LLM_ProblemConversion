theorem: Main article: local invariant cycle theorem Let f:X→Y:X be a proper morphism between complex algebraic varieties such that X is smooth. Also, let y0_0 be a regular value of f that is in an open ball B centered at y. Then the restriction map H∗⁡(f−1(y),Q)=H∗⁡(f−1(B),Q)→H∗⁡(f−1(y0),Q)π1,locH^*(f^-1(y),ℚ)=H^*(f^-1(B),ℚ)→H^*(f^-1(y_0),ℚ)^π_1,loc is surjective, where π1,locπ_1,loc is the fundamental group of the intersection of B with the set of regular values of f.[9]
