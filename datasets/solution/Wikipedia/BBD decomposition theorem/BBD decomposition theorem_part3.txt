maps: The first case of the decomposition theorem arises via the hard Lefschetz theorem which gives isomorphisms, for a smooth proper map f:X→Y:X of relative dimension d between two projective varieties[2] −∪ηi:Rd−if∗(Q)→≅Rd+if∗(Q).-∪η^i:R^d-if_*(ℚ)≅→R^d+if_*(ℚ). Here ηη is the fundamental class of a hyperplane section, f∗_* is the direct image (pushforward) and Rnf∗^nf_* is the n-th derived functor of the direct image. This derived functor measures the n-th cohomologies of f−1(U)^-1(U), for U⊂Y. In fact, the particular case when Y is a point, amounts to the isomorphism −∪ηi:Hd−i(X,Q)→≅Hd+i(X,Q).-∪η^i:H^d-i(X,ℚ)≅→H^d+i(X,ℚ). This hard Lefschetz isomorphism induces canonical isomorphisms Rf∗(Q)→≅⨁i=−ddRd+if∗(Q)[−d−i]._*(ℚ)≅→⊕_i=-d^dR^d+if_*(ℚ)[-d-i]. Moreover, the sheaves Rd+if∗Q^d+if_*ℚ appearing in this decomposition are local systems, i.e., locally free sheaves of Q-vector spaces, which are moreover semisimple, i.e., a direct sum of local systems without nontrivial local subsystems.
