maps: The decomposition theorem generalizes this fact to the case of a proper, but not necessarily smooth map f:X→Y:X between varieties. In a nutshell, the results above remain true when the notion of local systems is replaced by perverse sheaves. The hard Lefschetz theorem above takes the following form:[3][4] there is an isomorphism in the derived category of sheaves on Y: pH−i(Rf∗Q)≅pH+i(Rf∗Q),^pH^-i(Rf_*ℚ)≅^pH^+i(Rf_*ℚ), where Rf∗_* is the total derived functor of f∗_* and pHi^pH^i is the i-th truncation with respect to the perverse t-structure. Moreover, there is an isomorphism Rf∗ICX∙≅⨁ipHi(Rf∗ICX∙)[−i]._*IC_X^∙≅⊕_i^pH^i(Rf_*IC_X^∙)[-i]. where the summands are semi-simple perverse-sheaves, meaning they are direct sums of push-forwards of intersection cohomology sheaves.[5] If X is not smooth, then the above results remain true when Q[dim⁡X]ℚ[] is replaced by the intersection cohomology complex IC.[3]
