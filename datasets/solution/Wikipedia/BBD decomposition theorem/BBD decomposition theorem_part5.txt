Proofs: The decomposition theorem was first proved by Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne.[6] Their proof is based on the usage of weights on l-adic sheaves in positive characteristic. A different proof using mixed Hodge modules was given by Saito. A more geometric proof, based on the notion of semismall maps was given by de Cataldo and Migliorini.[7] For semismall maps, the decomposition theorem also applies to Chow motives.[8] Applications of the
