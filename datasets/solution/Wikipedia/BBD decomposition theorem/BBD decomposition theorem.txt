In mathematics, especially algebraic geometry, the decomposition theorem of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne or BBD decomposition theorem is a set of results concerning the cohomology of algebraic varieties. It was originally conjectured by Gelfand and MacPherson.[1]


Statement[edit]
Decomposition for smooth proper maps[edit]
The first case of the decomposition theorem arises via the hard Lefschetz theorem which gives isomorphisms, for a smooth proper map f:X→Y:X of relative dimension d between two projective varieties[2]

−∪ηi:Rd−if∗(Q)→≅Rd+if∗(Q).-∪η^i:R^d-if_*(ℚ)≅→R^d+if_*(ℚ).
Here ηη is the fundamental class of a hyperplane section, f∗_* is the direct image (pushforward) and Rnf∗^nf_* is the n-th derived functor of the direct image. This derived functor measures the n-th cohomologies of f−1(U)^-1(U), for U⊂Y.
In fact, the particular case when Y is a point, amounts to the isomorphism

−∪ηi:Hd−i(X,Q)→≅Hd+i(X,Q).-∪η^i:H^d-i(X,ℚ)≅→H^d+i(X,ℚ).
This hard Lefschetz isomorphism induces canonical isomorphisms

Rf∗(Q)→≅⨁i=−ddRd+if∗(Q)[−d−i]._*(ℚ)≅→⊕_i=-d^dR^d+if_*(ℚ)[-d-i].
Moreover, the sheaves Rd+if∗Q^d+if_*ℚ appearing in this decomposition are local systems, i.e., locally free sheaves of Q-vector spaces, which are moreover semisimple, i.e., a direct sum of local systems without nontrivial local subsystems.

Decomposition for proper maps[edit]
The decomposition theorem generalizes this fact to the case of a proper, but not necessarily smooth map f:X→Y:X between varieties. In a nutshell, the results above remain true when the notion of local systems is replaced by perverse sheaves.
The hard Lefschetz theorem above takes the following form:[3][4] there is an isomorphism in the derived category of sheaves on Y:

pH−i(Rf∗Q)≅pH+i(Rf∗Q),^pH^-i(Rf_*ℚ)≅^pH^+i(Rf_*ℚ),
where Rf∗_* is the total derived functor of f∗_* and pHi^pH^i is the i-th truncation with respect to the perverse t-structure.
Moreover, there is an isomorphism

Rf∗ICX∙≅⨁ipHi(Rf∗ICX∙)[−i]._*IC_X^∙≅⊕_i^pH^i(Rf_*IC_X^∙)[-i].
where the summands are semi-simple perverse-sheaves, meaning they are direct sums of push-forwards of intersection cohomology sheaves.[5]
If X is not smooth, then the above results remain true when Q[dim⁡X]ℚ[] is replaced by the intersection cohomology complex IC.[3]

Proofs[edit]
The decomposition theorem was first proved by Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne.[6] Their proof is based on the usage of weights on l-adic sheaves in positive characteristic. A different proof using mixed Hodge modules was given by Saito. A more geometric proof, based on the notion of semismall maps was given by de Cataldo and Migliorini.[7]
For semismall maps, the decomposition theorem also applies to Chow motives.[8]

Applications of the theorem[edit]
Cohomology of a Rational Lefschetz Pencil[edit]
Consider a rational morphism f:X→P1:X→ℙ^1 from a smooth quasi-projective variety given by [f1(x):f2(x)][f_1(x):f_2(x)]. If we set the vanishing locus of f1,f2_1,f_2 as Y then there is an induced morphism X =BlY(X)→P1X̃=Bl_Y(X)→ℙ^1. We can compute the cohomology of X from the intersection cohomology of BlY(X)_Y(X) and subtracting off the cohomology from the blowup along Y. This can be done using the perverse spectral sequence

E2l,m=Hl(P1;pHm(ICX ∙(Q))⇒IHl+m(X ;Q)≅Hl+m(X;Q)_2^l,m=H^l(ℙ^1;^𝔭ℋ^m(IC_X̃^∙(ℚ))^l+m(X̃;ℚ)^l+m(X;ℚ)
Local invariant cycle theorem[edit]
Main article: local invariant cycle theorem
Let f:X→Y:X be a proper morphism between complex algebraic varieties such that X is smooth. Also, let y0_0 be a regular value of f that is in an open ball B centered at y. Then the restriction map

H∗⁡(f−1(y),Q)=H∗⁡(f−1(B),Q)→H∗⁡(f−1(y0),Q)π1,locH^*(f^-1(y),ℚ)=H^*(f^-1(B),ℚ)→H^*(f^-1(y_0),ℚ)^π_1,loc
is surjective, where π1,locπ_1,loc is the fundamental group of the intersection of B with the set of regular values of f.[9]
