Pencil: Consider a rational morphism f:X→P1:X→ℙ^1 from a smooth quasi-projective variety given by [f1(x):f2(x)][f_1(x):f_2(x)]. If we set the vanishing locus of f1,f2_1,f_2 as Y then there is an induced morphism X =BlY(X)→P1X̃=Bl_Y(X)→ℙ^1. We can compute the cohomology of X from the intersection cohomology of BlY(X)_Y(X) and subtracting off the cohomology from the blowup along Y. This can be done using the perverse spectral sequence E2l,m=Hl(P1;pHm(ICX ∙(Q))⇒IHl+m(X ;Q)≅Hl+m(X;Q)_2^l,m=H^l(ℙ^1;^𝔭ℋ^m(IC_X̃^∙(ℚ))^l+m(X̃;ℚ)^l+m(X;ℚ) Local invariant cycle
