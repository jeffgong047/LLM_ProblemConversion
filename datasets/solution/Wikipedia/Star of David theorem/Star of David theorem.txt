Mathematical result on arithmetic properties of binomial coefficients
The Star of David theorem (the rows of the Pascal triangle are shown as columns here).
The Star of David theorem is a mathematical result on arithmetic properties of binomial coefficients.  It was discovered by Henry W. Gould in 1972.


Statement[edit]
The greatest common divisors of the binomial coefficients forming each of the two triangles in the Star of David shape in Pascal's triangle are equal:

gcd(n−1k−1),(nk+1),(n+1k)=gcd(n−1k),(nk−1),(n+1k+1).   {n-1k-1,nk+1,n+1k}
=   {n-1k,nk-1,n+1k+1}.

For n=9, k=3 or n=9, k=6, the element 84 is surrounded by, in sequence, the elements 28, 56, 126, 210, 120, 36. Taking alternating values, we have gcd(28, 126, 120) = 2 = gcd(56, 210, 36).
The element 36 is surrounded by the sequence 8, 28, 84, 120, 45, 9, and taking alternating values we have gcd(8, 84, 45) = 1 = gcd(28, 120, 9).

Generalization[edit]
The above greatest common divisor also equals gcd((n−1k−2),(n−1k−1),(n−1k),(n−1k+1)).(n-1-2,n-1-1,n-1,n-1+1).[1] Thus in the above example for the element 84 (in its rightmost appearance), we also have gcd(70, 56, 28, 8) = 2. This result in turn has further generalizations.

Related results[edit]
The two sets of three numbers which the Star of David theorem says have equal greatest common divisors also have equal products.[1] For example, again observing that the element 84 is surrounded by, in sequence, the elements 28, 56, 126, 210, 120, 36, and again taking alternating values, we have 28×126×120 = 26×33×5×72 = 56×210×36. This result can be confirmed by writing out each binomial coefficient in factorial form, using

(ab)=a!(a−b)!b!.a=a!/(a-b)!b!.
