Examples: Rows 8, 9, and 10 of Pascal's triangle are 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1 1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1 1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1 For n=9, k=3 or n=9, k=6, the element 84 is surrounded by, in sequence, the elements 28, 56, 126, 210, 120, 36. Taking alternating values, we have gcd(28, 126, 120) = 2 = gcd(56, 210, 36). The element 36 is surrounded by the sequence 8, 28, 84, 120, 45, 9, and taking alternating values we have gcd(8, 84, 45) = 1 = gcd(28, 120, 9).
