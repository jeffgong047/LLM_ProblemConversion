results: The two sets of three numbers which the Star of David theorem says have equal greatest common divisors also have equal products.[1] For example, again observing that the element 84 is surrounded by, in sequence, the elements 28, 56, 126, 210, 120, 36, and again taking alternating values, we have 28×126×120 = 26×33×5×72 = 56×210×36. This result can be confirmed by writing out each binomial coefficient in factorial form, using (ab)=a!(a−b)!b!.a=a!/(a-b)!b!. See
