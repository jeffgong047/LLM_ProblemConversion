theorem: Although it has implications in algebraic geometry, the theorem is a local result and is stated in its most primitive form for commutative rings. If A is a ring and f is a nonzero element of A, then we can form two derived rings: the localization at f, Af, and the completion at Af, Â; both are A-algebras. In the following we assume that f is a non-zero divisor. Geometrically, A is viewed as a scheme X = Spec A and f as a divisor (f) on Spec A; then Af is its complement Df = Spec Af, the principal open set determined by f, while Â is an "infinitesimal neighborhood" D = Spec Â of (f). The intersection of Df and Spec Â is a "punctured infinitesimal neighborhood" D0 about (f), equal to Spec Â ⊗A Af = Spec Âf. Suppose now that we have an A-module M; geometrically, M is a sheaf on Spec A, and we can restrict it to both the principal open set Df and the infinitesimal neighborhood Spec Â, yielding an Af-module F and an Â-module G. Algebraically, F=M⊗AAf=MfG=M⊗AA^.=M⊗_AA_f=M_f=M⊗_AÂ. (Despite the notational temptation to write G=M^=M, meaning the completion of the A-module M at the ideal Af, unless A is noetherian and M is finitely-generated, the two are not in fact equal. This phenomenon is the main reason that the theorem bears the names of Beauville and Laszlo; in the noetherian, finitely-generated case, it is, as noted by the authors, a special case of Grothendieck's faithfully flat descent.) F and G can both be further restricted to the punctured neighborhood D0, and since both restrictions are ultimately derived from M, they are isomorphic: we have an isomorphism ϕ:Gf→∼F⊗AfA^f=F⊗AA^.ϕ_fF⊗_A_fÂ_f=F⊗_AÂ. Now consider the converse situation: we have a ring A and an element f, and two modules: an Af-module F and an Â-module G, together with an isomorphism φ as above. Geometrically, we are given a scheme X and both an open set Df and a "small" neighborhood D of its closed complement (f); on Df and D we are given two sheaves which agree on the intersection D0 = Df ∩ D. If D were an open set in the Zariski topology we could glue the sheaves; the content of the Beauville–Laszlo theorem is that, under one technical assumption on f, the same is true for the infinitesimal neighborhood D as well. Theorem: Given A, f, F, G, and φ as above, if G has no f-torsion, then there exist an A-module M and isomorphisms α:Mf→∼Fβ:M⊗AA^→∼Gα_fF β⊗_AÂG consistent with the isomorphism φ: φ is equal to the composition Gf=G⊗AAf→β−1⊗1M⊗AA^⊗AAf=Mf⊗AA^→α⊗1F⊗AA^._f=G⊗_AA_fM⊗_AÂ⊗_AA_f=M_f⊗_AÂF⊗_AÂ. The technical condition that G has no f-torsion is referred to by the authors as "f-regularity". In fact, one can state a stronger version of this theorem. Let M(A) be the category of A-modules (whose morphisms are A-module homomorphisms) and let Mf(A) be the full subcategory of f-regular modules. In this notation, we obtain a commutative diagram of categories (note Mf(Af) = M(Af)): Mf(A)⟶Mf(A^)↓↓M(Af)⟶M(A^f)[ 𝐌_f(A) ⟶ 𝐌_f(Â); ↓ ↓; 𝐌(A_f) ⟶ 𝐌(Â_f) ] in which the arrows are the base-change maps; for example, the top horizontal arrow acts on objects by M → M ⊗A Â. Theorem: The above diagram is a cartesian diagram of categories. Global
