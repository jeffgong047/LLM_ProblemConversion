version: In geometric language, the Beauville–Laszlo theorem allows one to glue sheaves on a one-dimensional affine scheme over an infinitesimal neighborhood of a point. Since sheaves have a "local character" and since any scheme is locally affine, the theorem admits a global statement of the same nature. The version of this statement that the authors found noteworthy concerns vector bundles: Theorem: Let X be an algebraic curve over a field k, x a k-rational smooth point on X with infinitesimal neighborhood D = Spec k[[t]], R a k-algebra, and r a positive integer. Then the category Vectr(XR) of rank-r vector bundles on the curve XR = X ×Spec k Spec R fits into a cartesian diagram: Vectr(XR)⟶Vectr(DR)↓↓Vectr((X∖x)R)⟶Vectr(DR0)[ 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭_r(X_R) ⟶ 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭_r(D_R); ↓ ↓; 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭_r((X)_R) ⟶ 𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭_r(D_R^0) ] This entails a corollary stated in the paper: Corollary: With the same setup, denote by Triv(XR) the set of triples (E, τ, σ), where E is a vector bundle on XR, τ is a trivialization of E over (X \ x)R (i.e., an isomorphism with the trivial bundle O(X - x)R), and σ a trivialization over DR. Then the maps in the above diagram furnish a bijection between Triv(XR) and GLr(R((t))) (where R((t)) is the formal Laurent series ring). The corollary follows from the theorem in that the triple is associated with the unique matrix which, viewed as a "transition function" over D0R between the trivial bundles over (X \ x)R and over DR, allows gluing them to form E, with the natural trivializations of the glued bundle then being identified with σ and τ. The importance of this corollary is that it shows that the affine Grassmannian may be formed either from the data of bundles over an infinitesimal disk, or bundles on an entire algebraic curve.
