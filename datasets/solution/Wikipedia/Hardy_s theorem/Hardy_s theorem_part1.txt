In mathematics, Hardy's theorem is a result in complex analysis describing the behavior of holomorphic functions. Let f be a holomorphic function on the open ball centered at zero and radius R in the complex plane, and assume that f is not a constant function. If one defines I(r)=12π∫02π|f(reiθ)|dθ(r)=1/2π∫_0^2π|f(re^iθ)| dθ for 0<r<R,0<r<R, then this function is strictly increasing and is a convex function of log⁡r. See
