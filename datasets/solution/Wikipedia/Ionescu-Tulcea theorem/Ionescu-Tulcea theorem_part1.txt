Probability theorem Not to be confused with: the Ionescu-Tulceaâ€“Marinescu ergodic theorem. In the mathematical theory of probability, the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem, sometimes called the Ionesco Tulcea extension theorem, deals with the existence of probability measures for probabilistic events consisting of a countably infinite number of individual probabilistic events. In particular, the individual events may be independent or dependent with respect to each other. Thus, the statement goes beyond the mere existence of countable product measures. The theorem was proved by Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea in 1949.[1][2] Statement of the
