theorem: Suppose that (Ω0,A0,P0)(Ω_0,𝒜_0,P_0) is a probability space and (Ωi,Ai)(Ω_i,𝒜_i) for i∈N∈ℕ is a sequence of measurable spaces. For each i∈N∈ℕ let κi:(Ωi−1,Ai−1)→(Ωi,Ai)κ_i(Ω^i-1,𝒜^i-1)→(Ω_i,𝒜_i) be the Markov kernel derived from (Ωi−1,Ai−1)(Ω^i-1,𝒜^i-1) and (Ωi,Ai),(Ω_i,𝒜_i),, where Ωi:=∏k=0iΩkandAi:=⨂k=0iAk.Ω^i:=∏_k=0^iΩ_kand𝒜^i:=⊗_k=0^i𝒜_k. Then there exists a sequence of probability measures Pi:=P0⊗⨂k=1iκk_i:=P_0⊗⊗_k=1^iκ_k defined on the product space for the sequence (Ωi,Ai)(Ω^i,𝒜^i), i∈N,∈ℕ, and there exists a uniquely defined probability measure P on (∏k=0∞Ωk,⨂k=0∞Ak)(∏_k=0^∞Ω_k,⊗_k=0^∞𝒜_k), so that Pi(A)=P(A×∏k=i+1∞Ωk)_i(A)=P(A×∏_k=i+1^∞Ω_k) is satisfied for each A∈Ai∈𝒜^i and i∈N∈ℕ. (The measure P has conditional probabilities equal to the stochastic kernels.)[3]
