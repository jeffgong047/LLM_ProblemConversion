In the mathematical theory of conformal mappings, the area theorem
gives an inequality satisfied by
the power series coefficients of certain conformal mappings.
The theorem is called by that name, not because of its implications, but rather because the proof uses
the notion of area.


Statement[edit]
Suppose that f is analytic and injective in the punctured
open unit disk
D∖0𝔻∖{0} and has the power series representation

f(z)=1z+∑n=0∞anzn,z∈D∖0,(z)=1/z+∑_n=0^∞a_nz^n,∈𝔻∖{0},
then the coefficients an_n satisfy

∑n=0∞n|an|2≤1.∑_n=0^∞n|a_n|^2≤1.
Proof[edit]
The idea of the proof is to look at the area uncovered by the image of f.
Define for r∈(0,1)∈(0,1)

γr(θ):=f(re−iθ),θ∈[0,2π].γ_r(θ):=f(r e^-iθ),    θ∈[0,2π].
Then γrγ_r is a simple closed curve in the plane.
Let Dr_r denote the unique bounded connected component of
C∖γr([0,2π])ℂ∖γ_r([0,2π]). The existence and
uniqueness of Dr_r follows from Jordan's curve theorem.
If D is a domain in the plane whose boundary
is a smooth simple closed curve γγ,
then

area(D)=∫γxdy=−∫γydx,area(D)=∫_γx dy=-∫_γy dx ,
provided that γγ is positively oriented
around D.
This follows easily, for example, from Green's theorem.
As we will soon see, γrγ_r is positively oriented around
Dr_r (and that is the reason for the minus sign in the
definition of γrγ_r). After applying the chain rule
and the formula for γrγ_r, the above expressions for
the area give

area(Dr)=∫02πℜ(f(re−iθ))ℑ(−ire−iθf′(re−iθ))dθ=−∫02πℑ(f(re−iθ))ℜ(−ire−iθf′(re−iθ))dθ.area(D_r)=∫_0^2π(f(re^-iθ)) (-i r e^-iθ f'(re^-iθ)) dθ=-∫_0^2π(f(re^-iθ)) (-i r e^-iθ f'(re^-iθ))dθ.
Therefore, the area of Dr_r also equals to the average of the two expressions on the right
hand side. After simplification, this yields

area(Dr)=−12ℜ∫02πf(re−iθ)re−iθf′(re−iθ)¯dθ,area(D_r)=-1/2 ∫_0^2πf(r e^-iθ) r e^-iθ f'(r e^-iθ) dθ,
where z¯z denotes complex conjugation. We set a−1=1_-1=1 and use the power series
expansion for f, to get

area(Dr)=−12ℜ∫02π∑n=−1∞∑m=−1∞mrn+manam¯ei(m−n)θdθ.area(D_r)=-1/2 ∫_0^2π∑_n=-1^∞∑_m=-1^∞m r^n+m a_n a_m e^i (m-n) θ dθ .
(Since ∫02π∑n=−1∞∑m=−1∞mrn+m|an||am|dθ<∞,∫_0^2π∑_n=-1^∞∑_m=-1^∞m r^n+m |a_n| |a_m| dθ<∞ , the rearrangement of the terms is justified.)
Now note that ∫02πei(m−n)θdθ∫_0^2πe^i (m-n) θ dθ is 2π2π if n=m=m
and is zero otherwise. Therefore, we get

area(Dr)=−π∑n=−1∞nr2n|an|2.area(D_r)=-π∑_n=-1^∞n r^2n |a_n|^2.
The area of Dr_r is clearly positive. Therefore, the right hand side
is positive. Since a−1=1_-1=1, by letting r→1→1, the
theorem now follows.
It only remains to justify the claim that γrγ_r is positively oriented
around Dr_r. Let r′' satisfy r<r′<1<r'<1, and set
z0=f(r′)_0=f(r'), say. For very small s>0>0, we may write the
expression for the winding number of γsγ_s around z0_0,
and verify that it is equal to 11. Since, γtγ_t does
not pass through z0_0 when t≠r′'
(as f is injective), the invariance
of the winding number under homotopy in the complement of z0_0
implies that the winding number of
γrγ_r around z0_0 is also 11.
This implies that z0∈Dr_0_r and that γrγ_r
is positively oriented around Dr_r, as required.

Uses[edit]
The inequalities satisfied by power series coefficients of conformal
mappings were of considerable interest to mathematicians prior to
the solution of the Bieberbach conjecture. The area theorem
is a central tool in this context. Moreover, the area theorem is often
used in order to prove the Koebe 1/4 theorem, which is very
useful in the study of the geometry of conformal mappings.
