Proof: The idea of the proof is to look at the area uncovered by the image of f. Define for r∈(0,1)∈(0,1) γr(θ):=f(re−iθ),θ∈[0,2π].γ_r(θ):=f(r e^-iθ), θ∈[0,2π]. Then γrγ_r is a simple closed curve in the plane. Let Dr_r denote the unique bounded connected component of C∖γr([0,2π])ℂ∖γ_r([0,2π]). The existence and uniqueness of Dr_r follows from Jordan's curve theorem. If D is a domain in the plane whose boundary is a smooth simple closed curve γγ, then area(D)=∫γxdy=−∫γydx,area(D)=∫_γx dy=-∫_γy dx , provided that γγ is positively oriented around D. This follows easily, for example, from Green's theorem. As we will soon see, γrγ_r is positively oriented around Dr_r (and that is the reason for the minus sign in the definition of γrγ_r). After applying the chain rule and the formula for γrγ_r, the above expressions for the area give area(Dr)=∫02πℜ(f(re−iθ))ℑ(−ire−iθf′(re−iθ))dθ=−∫02πℑ(f(re−iθ))ℜ(−ire−iθf′(re−iθ))dθ.area(D_r)=∫_0^2π(f(re^-iθ)) (-i r e^-iθ f'(re^-iθ)) dθ=-∫_0^2π(f(re^-iθ)) (-i r e^-iθ f'(re^-iθ))dθ. Therefore, the area of Dr_r also equals to the average of the two expressions on the right hand side. After simplification, this yields area(Dr)=−12ℜ∫02πf(re−iθ)re−iθf′(re−iθ)¯dθ,area(D_r)=-1/2 ∫_0^2πf(r e^-iθ) r e^-iθ f'(r e^-iθ) dθ, where z¯z denotes complex conjugation. We set a−1=1_-1=1 and use the power series expansion for f, to get area(Dr)=−12ℜ∫02π∑n=−1∞∑m=−1∞mrn+manam¯ei(m−n)θdθ.area(D_r)=-1/2 ∫_0^2π∑_n=-1^∞∑_m=-1^∞m r^n+m a_n a_m e^i (m-n) θ dθ . (Since ∫02π∑n=−1∞∑m=−1∞mrn+m|an||am|dθ<∞,∫_0^2π∑_n=-1^∞∑_m=-1^∞m r^n+m |a_n| |a_m| dθ<∞ , the rearrangement of the terms is justified.) Now note that ∫02πei(m−n)θdθ∫_0^2πe^i (m-n) θ dθ is 2π2π if n=m=m and is zero otherwise. Therefore, we get area(Dr)=−π∑n=−1∞nr2n|an|2.area(D_r)=-π∑_n=-1^∞n r^2n |a_n|^2. The area of Dr_r is clearly positive. Therefore, the right hand side is positive. Since a−1=1_-1=1, by letting r→1→1, the theorem now follows. It only remains to justify the claim that γrγ_r is positively oriented around Dr_r. Let r′' satisfy r<r′<1<r'<1, and set z0=f(r′)_0=f(r'), say. For very small s>0>0, we may write the expression for the winding number of γsγ_s around z0_0, and verify that it is equal to 11. Since, γtγ_t does not pass through z0_0 when t≠r′' (as f is injective), the invariance of the winding number under homotopy in the complement of z0_0 implies that the winding number of γrγ_r around z0_0 is also 11. This implies that z0∈Dr_0_r and that γrγ_r is positively oriented around Dr_r, as required.
