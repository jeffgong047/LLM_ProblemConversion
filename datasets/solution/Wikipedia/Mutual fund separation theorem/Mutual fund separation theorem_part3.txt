asset: To see two-fund separation in a context in which no risk-free asset is available, using matrix algebra, let σ2σ^2 be the variance of the portfolio return, let μμ be the level of expected return on the portfolio that portfolio return variance is to be minimized contingent upon, let r be the vector of expected returns on the available assets, let X be the vector of amounts to be placed in the available assets, let W be the amount of wealth that is to be allocated in the portfolio, and let 11 be a vector of ones. Then the problem of minimizing the portfolio return variance subject to a given level of expected portfolio return can be stated as Minimize σ2σ^2 subject to XTr=μ^Tr=μ and XT1=W^T1=W where the superscript T^T denotes the transpose of a matrix. The portfolio return variance in the objective function can be written as σ2=XTVX,σ^2=X^TVX, where V is the positive definite covariance matrix of the individual assets' returns. The Lagrangian for this constrained optimization problem (whose second-order conditions can be shown to be satisfied) is L=XTVX+2λ(μ−XTr)+2η(W−XT1),=X^TVX+2λ(μ-X^Tr)+2η(W-X^T1), with Lagrange multipliers λλ and ηη. This can be solved for the optimal vector X of asset quantities by equating to zero the derivatives with respect to X, λλ, and ηη, provisionally solving the first-order condition for X in terms of λλ and ηη, substituting into the other first-order conditions, solving for λλ and ηη in terms of the model parameters, and substituting back into the provisional solution for X. The result is Xopt=WΔ[(rTV−1r)V−11−(1TV−1r)V−1r]+μΔ[(1TV−11)V−1r−(rTV−11)V−11]^opt=W/Δ[(r^TV^-1r)V^-11-(1^TV^-1r)V^-1r]+μ/Δ[(1^TV^-11)V^-1r-(r^TV^-11)V^-11] where Δ=(rTV−1r)(1TV−11)−(rTV−11)2>0.Δ=(r^TV^-1r)(1^TV^-11)-(r^TV^-11)^2>0. For simplicity this can be written more compactly as Xopt=αW+βμ^opt=+βμ where αα and ββ are parameter vectors based on the underlying model parameters. Now consider two benchmark efficient portfolios constructed at benchmark expected returns μ1μ_1 and μ2μ_2 and thus given by X1opt=αW+βμ1_1^opt=+βμ_1 and X2opt=αW+βμ2._2^opt=+βμ_2. The optimal portfolio at arbitrary μ3μ_3 can then be written as a weighted average of X1opt_1^opt and X2opt_2^opt as follows: X3opt=αW+βμ3=μ3−μ2μ1−μ2X1opt+μ1−μ3μ1−μ2X2opt._3^opt=+βμ_3=μ_3-μ_2/μ_1-μ_2X_1^opt+μ_1-μ_3/μ_1-μ_2X_2^opt. This equation proves the two-fund separation theorem for mean-variance analysis. For a geometric interpretation, see the Markowitz bullet. One risk-free
