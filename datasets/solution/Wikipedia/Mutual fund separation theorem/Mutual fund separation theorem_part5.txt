analysis: If investors have hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) (including the power utility function, logarithmic function and the exponential utility function), separation theorems can be obtained without the use of mean-variance analysis. For example, David Cass and Joseph Stiglitz[4] showed in 1970 that two-fund monetary separation applies if all investors have HARA utility with the same exponent as each other.[5]: ch.4 More recently, in the dynamic portfolio optimization model of Çanakoğlu and Özekici,[6] the investor's level of initial wealth (the distinguishing feature of investors) does not affect the optimal composition of the risky part of the portfolio. A similar result is given by Schmedders.[7]
