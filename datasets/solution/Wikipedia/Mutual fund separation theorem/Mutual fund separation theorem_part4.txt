asset: If a risk-free asset is available, then again a two-fund separation theorem applies; but in this case one of the "funds" can be chosen to be a very simple fund containing only the risk-free asset, and the other fund can be chosen to be one which contains zero holdings of the risk-free asset. (With the risk-free asset referred to as "money", this form of the theorem is referred to as the monetary separation theorem.) Thus mean-variance efficient portfolios can be formed simply as a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and holdings of a particular efficient fund that contains only risky assets. The derivation above does not apply, however, since with a risk-free asset the above covariance matrix of all asset returns, V, would have one row and one column of zeroes and thus would not be invertible. Instead, the problem can be set up as Minimize σ2σ^2 subject to (W−XT1)rf+XTr=μ,(W-X^T1)r_f+X^Tr=μ, where rf_f is the known return on the risk-free asset, X is now the vector of quantities to be held in the risky assets, and r is the vector of expected returns on the risky assets. The left side of the last equation is the expected return on the portfolio, since (W−XT1)(W-X^T1) is the quantity held in the risk-free asset, thus incorporating the asset adding-up constraint that in the earlier problem required the inclusion of a separate Lagrangian constraint. The objective function can be written as σ2=XTVXσ^2=X^TVX, where now V is the covariance matrix of the risky assets only. This optimization problem can be shown to yield the optimal vector of risky asset holdings Xopt=(μ−Wrf)(r−1rf)TV−1(r−1rf)V−1(r−1rf).^opt=(μ-Wr_f)/(r-1r_f)^TV^-1(r-1r_f)V^-1(r-1r_f). Of course this equals a zero vector if μ=Wrfμ=Wr_f, the risk-free portfolio's return, in which case all wealth is held in the risk-free asset. It can be shown that the portfolio with exactly zero holdings of the risk-free asset occurs at μ=WrTV−1(r−1rf)1TV−1(r−1rf)μ=Wr^TV^-1(r-1r_f)1^TV^-1(r-1r_f) and is given by X∗=W1TV−1(r−1rf)V−1(r−1rf).^*=W/1^TV^-1(r-1r_f)V^-1(r-1r_f). It can also be shown (analogously to the demonstration in the above two-mutual-fund case) that every portfolio's risky asset vector (that is, Xopt^opt for every value of μμ) can be formed as a weighted combination of the latter vector and the zero vector.
