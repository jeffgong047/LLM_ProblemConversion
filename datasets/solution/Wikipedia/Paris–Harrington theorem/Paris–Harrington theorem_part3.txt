theorem: Roughly speaking, Jeff Paris and Leo Harrington (1977) showed that the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is unprovable in Peano arithmetic by showing that in Peano arithmetic it implies the consistency of Peano arithmetic itself. Since Peano arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, this shows that Peano arithmetic cannot prove the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem. The combinatorial principle can be proven assuming induction up to ε0ε_0 for a relevant classes of formulas. Alternatively, it can be proven assuming the reflection principle, for the arithmetic theory, for Σ10Σ_1^0-sentences. The reflection principle also implies the consistency of Peano arithmetic. It is provable in second-order arithmetic (or the far stronger Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory) and so is true in the standard model. The smallest number N that satisfies the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is then a computable function of n, m, k, but grows extremely fast. In particular it is not primitive recursive, but it is also far faster-growing than standard examples of non-primitive recursive functions such as the Ackermann function. It dominates every computable function provably total in Peano arithmetic,[1] which includes functions such as the Ackermann function. See
