Method: If φ(s)φ(s) is analytic in the strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b, and if it tends to zero uniformly as ℑ(s)→±∞(s)→±∞ for any real value c between a and b, with its integral along such a line converging absolutely, then if f(x)=M−1φ=12πi∫c−i∞c+i∞x−sφ(s)ds(x)={ℳ^-1φ}=1/2∫_c-i∞^c+i∞x^-sφ(s) ds we have that φ(s)=Mf=∫0∞xs−1f(x)dx.φ(s)={ℳf}=∫_0^∞x^s-1f(x) dx. Conversely, suppose f(x)(x) is piecewise continuous on the positive real numbers, taking a value halfway between the limit values at any jump discontinuities, and suppose the integral φ(s)=∫0∞xs−1f(x)dxφ(s)=∫_0^∞x^s-1f(x) dx is absolutely convergent when a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b. Then f is recoverable via the inverse Mellin transform from its Mellin transform φφ. These results can be obtained by relating the Mellin transform to the Fourier transform by a change of variables and then applying an appropriate version of the Fourier inversion theorem.[1] Boundedness
