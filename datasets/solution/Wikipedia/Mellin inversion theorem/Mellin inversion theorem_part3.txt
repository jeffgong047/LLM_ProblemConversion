condition: The boundedness condition on φ(s)φ(s) can be strengthened if f(x)(x) is continuous. If φ(s)φ(s) is analytic in the strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b, and if |φ(s)|<K|s|−2|φ(s)|<K|s|^-2, where K is a positive constant, then f(x)(x) as defined by the inversion integral exists and is continuous; moreover the Mellin transform of f is φφ for at least a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b. On the other hand, if we are willing to accept an original f which is a generalized function, we may relax the boundedness condition on φφ to simply make it of polynomial growth in any closed strip contained in the open strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b. We may also define a Banach space version of this theorem. If we call by Lν,p(R+)_ν,p(R^+) the weighted Lp space of complex valued functions f on the positive reals such that ‖f‖=(∫0∞|xνf(x)|pdxx)1/p<∞f=(∫_0^∞|x^νf(x)|^p dx/x)^1/p<∞ where ν and p are fixed real numbers with p>1>1, then if f(x)(x) is in Lν,p(R+)_ν,p(R^+) with 1<p≤21<p≤2, then φ(s)φ(s) belongs to Lν,q(R+)_ν,q(R^+) with q=p/(p−1)=p/(p-1) and f(x)=12πi∫ν−i∞ν+i∞x−sφ(s)ds.(x)=1/2∫_ν-i∞^ν+i∞x^-sφ(s) ds. Here functions, identical everywhere except on a set of measure zero, are identified. Since the two-sided Laplace transform can be defined as Bf(s)=Mf(−ln⁡x)(s){ℬf}(s)={ℳf(-)}(s) these theorems can be immediately applied to it also. See
