In mathematics, the Mellin inversion formula (named after Hjalmar Mellin) tells us conditions under
which the inverse Mellin transform, or equivalently the inverse two-sided Laplace transform, are defined and recover the transformed function.


Method[edit]
If φ(s)φ(s) is analytic in the strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b,
and if it tends to zero uniformly as  ℑ(s)→±∞(s)→±∞ for any real value c between a and b, with its integral along such a line converging absolutely, then if

f(x)=M−1φ=12πi∫c−i∞c+i∞x−sφ(s)ds(x)={ℳ^-1φ}=1/2∫_c-i∞^c+i∞x^-sφ(s) ds
we have that

φ(s)=Mf=∫0∞xs−1f(x)dx.φ(s)={ℳf}=∫_0^∞x^s-1f(x) dx.
Conversely, suppose f(x)(x) is piecewise continuous on the positive real numbers, taking a value halfway between the limit values at any jump discontinuities, and suppose the integral

φ(s)=∫0∞xs−1f(x)dxφ(s)=∫_0^∞x^s-1f(x) dx
is absolutely convergent when a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b. Then f is recoverable via the inverse Mellin transform from its Mellin transform φφ. These results can be obtained by relating the Mellin transform to the Fourier transform by a change of variables and then applying an appropriate version of the Fourier inversion theorem.[1]

Boundedness condition[edit]
The boundedness condition on φ(s)φ(s) can be strengthened if 
f(x)(x) is continuous. If φ(s)φ(s) is analytic in the strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b, and if |φ(s)|<K|s|−2|φ(s)|<K|s|^-2, where K is a positive constant, then f(x)(x) as defined by the inversion integral exists and is continuous; moreover the Mellin transform of f is φφ for at least a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b.
On the other hand, if we are willing to accept an original f which is a 
generalized function, we may relax the boundedness condition on 
φφ to
simply make it of polynomial growth in any closed strip contained in the open strip a<ℜ(s)<b<(s)<b.
We may also define a Banach space version of this theorem. If we call by
Lν,p(R+)_ν,p(R^+) the weighted Lp space of complex valued functions f on the positive reals such that

‖f‖=(∫0∞|xνf(x)|pdxx)1/p<∞f=(∫_0^∞|x^νf(x)|^p dx/x)^1/p<∞
where ν and p are fixed real numbers with p>1>1, then if f(x)(x)
is in Lν,p(R+)_ν,p(R^+) with 1<p≤21<p≤2, then
φ(s)φ(s) belongs to Lν,q(R+)_ν,q(R^+) with q=p/(p−1)=p/(p-1) and

f(x)=12πi∫ν−i∞ν+i∞x−sφ(s)ds.(x)=1/2∫_ν-i∞^ν+i∞x^-sφ(s) ds.
Here functions, identical everywhere except on a set of measure zero, are identified.
Since the two-sided Laplace transform can be defined as

Bf(s)=Mf(−ln⁡x)(s){ℬf}(s)={ℳf(-)}(s)
these theorems can be immediately applied to it also.
