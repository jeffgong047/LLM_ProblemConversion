volume: The time evolution of phase space for the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). Here we have taken m=ω=1=ω=1 and are considering the region p,q∈[−1,1],q∈[-1,1]. Consider an N-particle system in three dimensions, and focus on only the evolution of dNd𝒩 particles. Within phase space, these dNd𝒩 particles occupy an infinitesimal volume given by dΓ=∏i=1Nd3pid3qi.dΓ=∏_i=1^Nd^3p_id^3q_i. We want dNdΓd𝒩/dΓ to remain the same throughout time, so that ρ(Γ,t)ρ(Γ,t) is constant along the trajectories of the system. If we allow our particles to evolve by an infinitesimal time step δt, we see that each particle phase space location changes as qi′=qi+qi˙δt,pi′=pi+pi˙δt,q_i'=q_i+q̇_̇i̇, p_i'=p_i+ṗ_̇i̇, where qi˙q̇_̇i̇ and pi˙ṗ_̇i̇ denote dqidtdq_i/dt and dpidtdp_i/dt respectively, and we have only kept terms linear in δt. Extending this to our infinitesimal hypercube dΓdΓ, the side lengths change as dqi′=dqi+∂qi˙∂qidqiδt,dpi′=dpi+∂pi˙∂pidpiδt.dq_i'=dq_i+∂q̇_̇i̇/_idq_i, dp_i'=dp_i+∂ṗ_̇i̇/_idp_i. To find the new infinitesimal phase-space volume dΓ′dΓ', we need the product of the above quantities. To first order in δt, we get the following: dqi′dpi′=dqidpi[1+(∂qi˙∂qi+∂pi˙∂pi)δt]._i'dp_i'=dq_idp_i[1+(∂q̇_̇i̇/_i+∂ṗ_̇i̇/_i)]. So far, we have yet to make any specifications about our system. Let us now specialize to the case of N 33-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillators. That is, each particle in our ensemble can be treated as a simple harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by H=∑i=13N(12mpi2+mω22qi2).=∑_i=1^3N(1/2mp_i^2+mω^2/2q_i^2). By using Hamilton's equations with the above Hamiltonian we find that the term in parentheses above is identically zero, thus yielding dqi′dpi′=dqidpi._i'dp_i'=dq_idp_i. From this we can find the infinitesimal volume of phase space: dΓ′=∏i=1Nd3qi′d3pi′=∏i=1Nd3qid3pi=dΓ.dΓ'=∏_i=1^Nd^3q_i'd^3p_i'=∏_i=1^Nd^3q_id^3p_i=dΓ. Thus we have ultimately found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is unchanged, yielding ρ(Γ′,t+δt)=dNdΓ′=dNdΓ=ρ(Γ,t),ρ(Γ',t+)=d𝒩/dΓ'=d𝒩/dΓ=ρ(Γ,t), demonstrating that Liouville's theorem holds for this system.[13] The question remains of how the phase-space volume actually evolves in time. Above we have shown that the total volume is conserved, but said nothing about what it looks like. For a single particle we can see that its trajectory in phase space is given by the ellipse of constant H. Explicitly, one can solve Hamilton's equations for the system and find qi(t)=Qicos⁡ωt+Pimωsin⁡ωt,pi(t)=Picos⁡ωt−mωQisin⁡ωt,q_i(t) =Q_icos+P_i/mωsin, p_i(t) =P_icos-m_isin, where Qi_i and Pi_i denote the initial position and momentum of the i-th particle. For a system of multiple particles, each one will have a phase-space trajectory that traces out an ellipse corresponding to the particle's energy. The frequency at which the ellipse is traced is given by the ωω in the Hamiltonian, independent of any differences in energy. As a result, a region of phase space will simply rotate about the point (q,p)=(0,0)(𝐪,𝐩)=(0,0) with frequency dependent on ωω.[14] This can be seen in the animation above. Damped harmonic
