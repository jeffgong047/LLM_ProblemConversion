equation: Evolution of an ensemble of classical systems in phase space (top). Each system consists of one massive particle in a one-dimensional potential well (red curve, lower figure). Whereas the motion of an individual member of the ensemble is given by Hamilton's equations, Liouville's equation describes the flow of the whole distribution. The motion is analogous to a dye in an incompressible fluid. The Liouville equation describes the time evolution of the phase space distribution function. Although the equation is usually referred to as the "Liouville equation", Josiah Willard Gibbs was the first to recognize the importance of this equation as the fundamental equation of statistical mechanics.[3][4] It is referred to as the Liouville equation because its derivation for non-canonical systems utilises an identity first derived by Liouville in 1838.[5][6] Consider a Hamiltonian dynamical system with canonical coordinates qi_i and conjugate momenta pi_i, where i=1,…,n=1,…,n. Then the phase space distribution ρ(p,q)ρ(p,q) determines the probability ρ(p,q)dnqdnpρ(p,q) d^nq d^np that the system will be found in the infinitesimal phase space volume dnqdnpd^nq d^np. The Liouville equation governs the evolution of ρ(p,q;t)ρ(p,q;t) in time t: dρdt=∂ρ∂t+∑i=1n(∂ρ∂qiq˙i+∂ρ∂pip˙i)=0.dρ/dt=∂ρ/+∑_i=1^n(∂ρ/_iq̇_i+∂ρ/_iṗ_i)=0. Time derivatives are denoted by dots, and are evaluated according to Hamilton's equations for the system. This equation demonstrates the conservation of density in phase space (which was Gibbs's name for the theorem). Liouville's theorem states that The distribution function is constant along any trajectory in phase space. A proof of Liouville's theorem uses the n-dimensional divergence theorem. This proof is based on the fact that the evolution of ρρ obeys an 2n-dimensional version of the continuity equation: ∂ρ∂t+∑i=1n(∂(ρq˙i)∂qi+∂(ρp˙i)∂pi)=0.∂ρ/+∑_i=1^n(∂(ρq̇_i)/_i+∂(ρṗ_i)/_i)=0. That is, the 3-tuple (ρ,ρq˙i,ρp˙i)(ρ,ρq̇_i,ρṗ_i) is a conserved current. Notice that the difference between this and Liouville's equation are the terms ρ∑i=1n(∂q˙i∂qi+∂p˙i∂pi)=ρ∑i=1n(∂2H∂qi∂pi−∂2H∂pi∂qi)=0,ρ∑_i=1^n(∂q̇_i/_i+∂ṗ_i/_i)=ρ∑_i=1^n(∂^2H/_i _i-∂^2H/_i_i)=0, where H is the Hamiltonian, and Hamilton's equations as well as conservation of the Hamiltonian along the flow have been used. That is, viewing the motion through phase space as a 'fluid flow' of system points, the theorem that the convective derivative of the density, dρ/dtρ/dt, is zero follows from the equation of continuity by noting that the 'velocity field' (p˙,q˙)(ṗ,q̇) in phase space has zero divergence (which follows from Hamilton's relations).[7] Another illustration is to consider the trajectory of a cloud of points through phase space. It is straightforward to show that as the cloud stretches in one coordinate, pi_i for instance, it shrinks in the corresponding qi^i direction so that the product ΔpiΔqi_i ^i remains constant. Other
