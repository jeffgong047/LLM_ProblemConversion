equation: The analog of Liouville equation in quantum mechanics describes the time evolution of a mixed state. Canonical quantization yields a quantum-mechanical version of this theorem, the von Neumann equation. This procedure, often used to devise quantum analogues of classical systems, involves describing a classical system using Hamiltonian mechanics. Classical variables are then re-interpreted as quantum operators, while Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators. In this case, the resulting equation is[10][11] ∂ρ∂t=1iℏ[H,ρ],∂ρ/=1/iħ[H,ρ], where ρ is the density matrix. When applied to the expectation value of an observable, the corresponding equation is given by Ehrenfest's theorem, and takes the form ddt⟨A⟩=−1iℏ⟨[H,A]⟩,d/dt⟩=-1/iħ⟨[H,A]⟩, where A is an observable. Note the sign difference, which follows from the assumption that the operator is stationary and the state is time-dependent. In the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, substituting the Moyal brackets for Poisson brackets in the phase-space analog of the von Neumann equation results in compressibility of the probability fluid, and thus violations of Liouville's theorem incompressibility. This, then, leads to concomitant difficulties in defining meaningful quantum trajectories.[12]
