oscillator: The evolution of phase-space volume for the damped harmonic oscillator. The same values of parameters are used as in the SHO case, with γ=0.5(α=0.25)γ=0.5α=0.25). One of the foundational assumptions of Liouville's theorem is that the system obeys the conservation of energy. In the context of phase space, this is to say that ρρ is constant on phase-space surfaces of constant energy E. If we break this requirement by considering a system in which energy is not conserved, we find that ρρ also fails to be constant. As an example of this, consider again the system of N particles each in a 33-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential, the Hamiltonian for which is given in the previous example. This time, we add the condition that each particle experiences a frictional force. As this is a non-conservative force, we need to extend Hamilton's equations as qi˙=∂H∂pi,pi˙=−∂H∂qi−γpi,q̇_̇i̇ =/_i, ṗ_̇i̇ =-/_i-_i, where γγ is a positive constant dictating the amount of friction. Following a very similar procedure to the undamped harmonic oscillator case, we arrive again at dqi′dpi′=dqidpi[1+(∂qi˙∂qi+∂pi˙∂pi)δt]._i'dp_i'=dq_idp_i[1+(∂q̇_̇i̇/_i+∂ṗ_̇i̇/_i)]. Plugging in our modified Hamilton's equations, we find dqi′dpi′=dqidpi[1+(∂2H∂qi∂pi−∂2H∂pi∂qi−γ)δt],=dqidpi[1−γδt].dq_i'dp_i' =dq_idp_i[1+(∂^2H/_i_i-∂^2H/_i_i-γ)], =dq_idp_i[1-γ]. Calculating our new infinitesimal phase space volume, and keeping only first order in δt we find the following result: dΓ′=∏i=1Nd3qi′d3pi′=[1−γδt]3N∏i=1Nd3qid3pi=dΓ[1−3Nγδt].dΓ'=∏_i=1^Nd^3q_i'd^3p_i'=[1-γ]^3N∏_i=1^Nd^3q_id^3p_i=dΓ[1-3Nγ]. We have found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is no longer constant, and thus the phase-space density is not conserved. As can be seen from the equation as time increases, we expect our phase-space volume to decrease to zero as friction affects the system. As for how the phase-space volume evolves in time, we will still have the constant rotation as in the undamped case. However, the damping will introduce a steady decrease in the radii of each ellipse. Again we can solve for the trajectories explicitly using Hamilton's equations, taking care to use the modified ones above. Letting α≡γ2α≡γ/2 for convenience, we find qi(t)=e−αt[Qicos⁡ω1t+Bisin⁡ω1t]ω1≡ω2−α2,pi(t)=e−αt[Picos⁡ω1t−m(ω1Qi+2αBi)sin⁡ω1t]Bi≡1ω1(Pim+2αQi),q_i(t) =e^-[Q_icosω_1t+B_isinω_1t] ω_1≡√(ω^2-α^2), p_i(t) =e^-[P_icosω_1t-m(ω_1Q_i+2_i)sinω_1t] B_i≡1/ω_1(P_i/m+2_i), where the values Qi_i and Pi_i denote the initial position and momentum of the i-th particle. As the system evolves the total phase-space volume will spiral in to the origin. This can be seen in the figure above.
