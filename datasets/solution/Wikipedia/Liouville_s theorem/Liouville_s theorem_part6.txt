geometry: We can also formulate Liouville's Theorem in terms of symplectic geometry. For a given system, we can consider the phase space (qμ,pμ)(q^μ,p_μ) of a particular Hamiltonian H as a manifold (M,ω)(M,ω) endowed with a symplectic 2-form ω=dpμ∧dqμ.ω=dp_μ^μ. The volume form of our manifold is the top exterior power of the symplectic 2-form, and is just another representation of the measure on the phase space described above. On our phase space symplectic manifold we can define a Hamiltonian vector field generated by a function f(q,p)(q,p) as Xf=∂f∂pμ∂∂qμ−∂f∂qμ∂∂pμ._f=/_μ∂/^μ-/^μ∂/_μ. Specifically, when the generating function is the Hamiltonian itself, f(q,p)=H(q,p)=H, we get XH=∂H∂pμ∂∂qμ−∂H∂qμ∂∂pμ=dqμdt∂∂qμ+dpμdt∂∂pμ=ddt_H=/_μ∂/^μ-/^μ∂/_μ=dq^μ/dt∂/^μ+dp^μ/dt∂/_μ=d/dt where we utilized Hamilton's equations of motion and the definition of the chain rule.[8] In this formalism, Liouville's Theorem states that the Lie derivative of the volume form is zero along the flow generated by XH_H. That is, for (M,ω)(M,ω) a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold, LXH(ωn)=0.ℒ_X_H(ω^n)=0. In fact, the symplectic structure ωω itself is preserved, not only its top exterior power. That is, Liouville's Theorem also gives [9] LXH(ω)=0.ℒ_X_H(ω)=0. Quantum Liouville
