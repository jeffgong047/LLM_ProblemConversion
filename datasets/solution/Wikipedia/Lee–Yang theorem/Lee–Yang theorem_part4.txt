Theorem: The Lee–Yang theorem states that if the Hamiltonian is ferromagnetic and all the measures dμj have the Lee-Yang property, and all the numbers zj have positive real part, then the partition function is non-zero. Z(zj)≠0,∀zj∈H+({z_j})≠0, _j∈ℍ_+ In particular if all the numbers zj are equal to some number z, then all zeros of the partition function (considered as a function of z) are imaginary. In the original Ising model case considered by Lee and Yang, the measures all have support on the 2 point set −1, 1, so the partition function can be considered a function of the variable ρ = eπz. With this change of variable the Lee–Yang theorem says that all zeros ρ lie on the unit circle.
