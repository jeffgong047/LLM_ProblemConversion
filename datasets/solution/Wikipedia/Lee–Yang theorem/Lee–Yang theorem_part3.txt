Preliminaries: Along the formalization in Newman (1974) the Hamiltonian is given by H=−∑JjkSjSk−∑zjSj=-_jkS_jS_k-_jS_j where Sj's are spin variables, zj external field. The system is said to be ferromagnetic if all the coefficients in the interaction term Jjk are non-negative reals. The partition function is given by Z=∫e−Hdμ1(S1)⋯dμN(SN)=^-Hdμ_1(S_1)μ_N(S_N) where each dμj is an even measure on the reals R decreasing at infinity so fast that all Gaussian functions are integrable, i.e. ∫ebS2d|μj(S)|<∞,∀b∈R.^bS^2d|μ_j(S)|<∞, ∈ℝ. A rapidly decreasing measure on the reals is said to have the Lee-Yang property if all zeros of its Fourier transform are real as the following. ∫ehSdμj(S)≠0,∀h∈H+:=z∈C∣ℜ(z)>0^hSdμ_j(S)≠0, ∈ℍ_+:={z∈ℂ|(z)>0}
