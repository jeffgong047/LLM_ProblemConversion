Examples: Some examples of measure with the Lee–Yang property are: The measure of the Ising model, which has support consisting of two points (usually 1 and −1) each with weight 1/2. This is the original case considered by Lee and Yang. The distribution of spin n/2, whose support has n+1 equally spaced points, each of weight 1/(n + 1). This is a generalization of the Ising model case. The density of measure uniformly distributed between −1 and 1. The density exp⁡(−λcosh⁡(S))dSexp(-λcosh(S)) dS The density exp⁡(−λS4−bS2)dSexp(-^4-bS^2) dS for positive λ and real b. This corresponds to the (φ4)2 Euclidean quantum field theory. The density exp⁡(−λS6−aS4−bS2)dSexp(-^6-aS^4-bS^2) dS for positive λ does not always have the Lee-Yang property. If dμ has the Lee-Yang property, so does exp(bS2) dμ for any positive b. If dμ has the Lee-Yang property, so does Q(S) dμ for any even polynomial Q all of whose zeros are imaginary. The convolution of two measures with the Lee-Yang property also has the Lee-Yang property.
