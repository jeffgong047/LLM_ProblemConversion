theorems: The Peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem both assumes more and concludes more. It requires Lipschitz continuity, while the Peano theorem requires only continuity; but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the Peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions. To illustrate, consider the ordinary differential equation y′=|y|12'=|^1/2 on the domain [0,1].[0,1]. According to the Peano theorem, this equation has solutions, but the Picard–Lindelöf theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0. Thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness. It turns out that this ordinary differential equation has two kinds of solutions when starting at y(0)=0(0)=0, either y(x)=0(x)=0 or y(x)=x2/4(x)=x^2/4. The transition between y=0=0 and y=(x−C)2/4=(x-C)^2/4 can happen at any C. The Carathéodory existence theorem is a generalization of the Peano existence theorem with weaker conditions than continuity.
