Theorem: Let D be an open subset of R×Rℝ×ℝ with f:D→R→ℝ a continuous function and y′(x)=f(x,y(x))'(x)=f(x,y(x)) a continuous, explicit first-order differential equation defined on D, then every initial value problem y(x0)=y0(x_0)=y_0 for f with (x0,y0)∈D(x_0,y_0) has a local solution z:I→R→ℝ where I is a neighbourhood of x0_0 in Rℝ, such that z′(x)=f(x,z(x))'(x)=f(x,z(x)) for all x∈I.[3] The solution need not be unique: one and the same initial value (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) may give rise to many different solutions z.
