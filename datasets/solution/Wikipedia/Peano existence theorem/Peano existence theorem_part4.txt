Proof: By replacing y with y−y0-y_0, x with x−x0-x_0, we may assume x0=y0=0_0=y_0=0. As D is open there is a rectangle R=[−x1,x1]×[−y1,y1]⊂D=[-x_1,x_1]×[-y_1,y_1]. Because R is compact and f is continuous, we have supR|f|≤C<∞sup_R|f|<∞ and by the Stone–Weierstrass theorem there exists a sequence of Lipschitz functions fk:R→R_k:R→ℝ converging uniformly to f in R. Without loss of generality, we assume supR|fk|≤2Csup_R|f_k|≤2C for all k. We define Picard iterations yk,n:I=[−x2,x2]→R_k,n:I=[-x_2,x_2]→ℝ as follows, where x2=minx1,y1/(2C)_2=min{x_1,y_1/(2C)}. yk,0(x)≡0_k,0(x)≡0, and yk,n+1(x)=∫0xfk(x′,yk,n(x′))dx′_k,n+1(x)=∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k,n(x')) dx'. They are well-defined by induction: as |yk,n+1(x)|≤|∫0x|fk(x′,yk,n(x′))|dx′|≤|x|supR|fk|≤x2⋅2C≤y1,|y_k,n+1(x)| ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',y_k,n(x'))| dx'| ≤|x|sup_R|f_k| _2·2C_1, (x′,yk,n+1(x′))(x',y_k,n+1(x')) is within the domain of fk_k. We have |yk,n+1(x)−yk,n(x)|≤|∫0x|fk(x′,yk,n(x′))−fk(x′,yk,n−1(x′))|dx′|≤Lk|∫0x|yk,n(x′)−yk,n−1(x′)|dx′|,|y_k,n+1(x)-y_k,n(x)| ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',y_k,n(x'))-f_k(x',y_k,n-1(x'))| dx'| ≤_k|∫_0^x|y_k,n(x')-y_k,n-1(x')| dx'|, where Lk_k is the Lipschitz constant of fk_k. Thus for maximal difference Mk,n(x)=supx′∈[0,x]|yk,n+1(x′)−yk,n(x′)|_k,n(x)=sup_x'∈[0,x]|y_k,n+1(x')-y_k,n(x')|, we have a bound Mk,n(x)≤Lk|∫0xMk,n−1(x′)dx′|_k,n(x)_k|∫_0^xM_k,n-1(x') dx'|, and Mk,0(x)≤|∫0x|fk(x′,0)|dx′|≤|x|supR|fk|≤2C|x|.M_k,0(x) ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',0)| dx'| ≤|x|sup_R|f_k|≤2C|x|. By induction, this implies the bound Mk,n(x)≤2CLkn|x|n+1/(n+1)!_k,n(x)≤2CL_k^n|x|^n+1/(n+1)! which tends to zero as n→∞→∞ for all x∈I. The functions yk,n_k,n are equicontinuous as for −x2≤x<x′≤x2-x_2<x'_2 we have |yk,n+1(x′)−yk,n+1(x)|≤∫xx′|fk(x″,yk,n(x″))|dx″≤|x′−x|supR|fk|≤2C|x′−x|,|y_k,n+1(x')-y_k,n+1(x)| ≤∫_x^x'|f_k(x”,y_k,n(x”))| dx” ≤|x'-x|sup_R|f_k|≤2C|x'-x|, so by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem they are relatively compact. In particular, for each k there is a subsequence (yk,φk(n))n∈N(y_k,φ_k(n))_n∈ℕ converging uniformly to a continuous function yk:I→R_k:I→ℝ. Taking limit n→∞→∞ in |yk,φk(n)(x)−∫0xfk(x′,yk,φk(n)(x′))dx′|=|yk,φk(n)(x)−yk,φk(n)+1(x)|≤Mk,φk(n)(x2)|y_k,φ_k(n)(x)-∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k,φ_k(n)(x')) dx'| =|y_k,φ_k(n)(x)-y_k,φ_k(n)+1(x)| _k,φ_k(n)(x_2) we conclude that yk(x)=∫0xfk(x′,yk(x′))dx′_k(x)=∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k(x')) dx'. The functions yk_k are in the closure of a relatively compact set, so they are themselves relatively compact. Thus there is a subsequence yψ(k)_ψ(k) converging uniformly to a continuous function z:I→R:I→ℝ. Taking limit k→∞→∞ in yψ(k)(x)=∫0xfψ(k)(x′,yψ(k)(x′))dx′_ψ(k)(x)=∫_0^xf_ψ(k)(x',y_ψ(k)(x')) dx' we conclude that z(x)=∫0xf(x′,z(x′))dx′(x)=∫_0^xf(x',z(x')) dx', using the fact that fψ(k)_ψ(k) are equicontinuous by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, z′(x)=f(x,z(x))'(x)=f(x,z(x)) in I. Related
