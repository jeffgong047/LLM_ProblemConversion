Let c(n) be a coloring of the integers {1, ..., 325}. We will find three elements of {1, ..., 325} in arithmetic progression that are the same color. Divide {1, ..., 325} into the 65 blocks {1, ..., 5}, {6, ..., 10}, ... {321, ..., 325}, thus each block is of the form {5b + 1, ..., 5b + 5} for some b in {0, ..., 64}. Since each integer is colored either red or blue, each block is colored in one of 32 different ways. By the pigeonhole principle, there are two blocks among the first 33 blocks that are colored identically. That is, there are two integers b1 and b2, both in {0,...,32}, such that c(5b1 + k) = c(5b2 + k) for all k in {1, ..., 5}. Among the three integers 5b1 + 1, 5b1 + 2, 5b1 + 3, there must be at least two that are of the same color. (The pigeonhole principle again.) Call these 5b1 + a1 and 5b1 + a2, where the ai are in {1,2,3} and a1 < a2. Suppose (without loss of generality) that these two integers are both red. (If they are both blue, just exchange 'red' and 'blue' in what follows.) Let a3 = 2a2 − a1. If 5b1 + a3 is red, then we have found our arithmetic progression: 5b1 + ai are all red. Otherwise, 5b1 + a3 is blue. Since a3 ≤ 5, 5b1 + a3 is in the b1 block, and since the b2 block is colored identically, 5b2 + a3 is also blue. Now let b3 = 2b2 − b1. Then b3 ≤ 64. Consider the integer 5b3 + a3, which must be ≤ 325. What color is it? If it is red, then 5b1 + a1, 5b2 + a2, and 5b3 + a3 form a red arithmetic progression. But if it is blue, then 5b1 + a3, 5b2 + a3, and 5b3 + a3 form a blue arithmetic progression. Either way, we are done. Proof in the case of W(3,
