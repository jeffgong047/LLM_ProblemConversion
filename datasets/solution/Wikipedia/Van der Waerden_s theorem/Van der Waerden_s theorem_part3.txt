problem: It is an open problem to determine the values of W(r, k) for most values of r and k. The proof of the theorem provides only an upper bound. For the case of r = 2 and k = 3, for example, the argument given below shows that it is sufficient to color the integers {1, ..., 325} with two colors to guarantee there will be a single-colored arithmetic progression of length 3. But in fact, the bound of 325 is very loose; the minimum required number of integers is only 9. Any coloring of the integers {1, ..., 9} will have three evenly spaced integers of one color. For r = 3 and k = 3, the bound given by the theorem is 7(2·37 + 1)(2·37·(2·37 + 1) + 1), or approximately 4.22·1014616. But actually, you don't need that many integers to guarantee a single-colored progression of length 3; you only need 27. (And it is possible to color {1, ..., 26} with three colors so that there is no single-colored arithmetic progression of length 3; for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 R R G G R R G B G B B R B R R G R G G B R B B G B G An open problem is the attempt to reduce the general upper bound to any 'reasonable' function. Ronald Graham offered a prize of US$1000 for showing W(2, k) < 2k2.[2] In addition, he offered a US$250 prize for a proof of his conjecture involving more general off-diagonal van der Waerden numbers, stating W(2; 3, k) ≤ kO(1), while mentioning numerical evidence suggests W(2; 3, k) = k2 + o(1). Ben Green disproved this latter conjecture and proved super-polynomial counterexamples to W(2; 3, k) < kr for any r.[3] The best upper bound currently known is due to Timothy Gowers,[4] who establishes W(r,k)≤22r22k+9,(r,k)≤2^2^r^2^2^k+9, by first establishing a similar result for Szemerédi's theorem, which is a stronger version of Van der Waerden's theorem. The previously best-known bound was due to Saharon Shelah and proceeded via first proving a result for the Hales–Jewett theorem, which is another strengthening of Van der Waerden's theorem. The best lower bound currently known for W(2,k)(2,k) is that for all positive εε we have W(2,k)>2k/kε(2,k)>2^k/k^ε, for all sufficiently large k.[5] Proof of Van der Waerden's theorem (in a special
