Example: For example, when r = 2, you have two colors, say red and blue. W(2, 3) is bigger than 8, because you can color the integers from {1, ..., 8} like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 B R R B B R R B and no three integers of the same color form an arithmetic progression. But you can't add a ninth integer to the end without creating such a progression. If you add a red 9, then the red 3, 6, and 9 are in arithmetic progression. Alternatively, if you add a blue 9, then the blue 1, 5, and 9 are in arithmetic progression. In fact, there is no way of coloring 1 through 9 without creating such a progression (it can be proved by considering examples). Therefore, W(2, 3) is 9. Open
