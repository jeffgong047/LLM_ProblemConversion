compression: The proof of the speedup theorem clearly hinges on the capability to compress storage by replacing the alphabet with a larger one. Geffert[4] showed that for nondeterministic single-tape Turing machines of time complexity T(n)â‰¥n2(n)^2 linear speedup can be achieved without increasing the alphabet. Dependence on the shape of
