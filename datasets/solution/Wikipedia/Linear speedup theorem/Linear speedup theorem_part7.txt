storage: Regan[5] considered a property of a computational model called information vicinity. This property is related to the memory structure: a Turing machine has linear vicinity, while a Kolmogorov-Uspenskii machine and other pointer machines have an exponential one. Regan’s thesis is that the existence of linear speedup has to do with having a polynomial information vicinity. The salient point in this claim is that a model with exponential vicinity will not have speedup even if changing the alphabet is allowed (for models with a discrete memory that stores symbols). Regan did not, however, prove any general theorem of this kind. Hühne [6]proved that if we require the speedup to be obtained by an on-line simulation (which is the case for the speedup on ordinary Turing machines), then linear speedup does not exist on machines with tree storage.
