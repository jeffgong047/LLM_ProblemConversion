cocycle: The modular automorphism group of a von Neumann algebra M depends on the choice of state φ. Connes discovered that changing the state does not change the image of the modular automorphism in the outer automorphism group of M. More precisely, given two faithful states φ and ψ of M, we can find unitary elements ut of M for all real t such that σψt(x)=utσϕt(x)ut−1σ^ψ_t(x)=u_tσ^ϕ_t(x)u_t^-1 so that the modular automorphisms differ by inner automorphisms, and moreover ut satisfies the 1-cocycle condition us+t=usσϕs(ut)_s+t=u_sσ^ϕ_s(u_t) In particular, there is a canonical homomorphism from the additive group of reals to the outer automorphism group of M, that is independent of the choice of faithful state.
