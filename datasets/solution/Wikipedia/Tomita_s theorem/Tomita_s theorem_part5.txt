states: The term KMS state comes from the Kubo–Martin–Schwinger condition in quantum statistical mechanics. A KMS state ϕϕ on a von Neumann algebra M with a given 1-parameter group of automorphisms αt is a state fixed by the automorphisms such that for every pair of elements A, B of M there is a bounded continuous function F in the strip 0 ≤ Im(t) ≤ 1, holomorphic in the interior, such that F(t)=ϕ(Aαt(B)),F(t+i)=ϕ(αt(B)A)F(t) =ϕ(Aα_t(B)), F(t+i) =ϕ(α_t(B)A) Takesaki and Winnink showed that any (faithful semi finite normal) state ϕϕ is a KMS state for the 1-parameter group of modular automorphisms σϕ−tσ^ϕ_-t. Moreover, this characterizes the modular automorphisms of ϕϕ. (There is often an extra parameter, denoted by β, used in the theory of KMS states. In the description above this has been normalized to be 1 by rescaling the 1-parameter family of automorphisms.) Structure of type III
