state: Suppose that M is a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space H, and Ω is a cyclic and separating vector of H of norm 1. (Cyclic means that MΩ is dense in H, and separating means that the map from M to MΩ is injective.) We write ϕϕ for the vector state ϕ(x)=(xΩ,Ω)ϕ(x)=(xΩ,Ω) of M, so that H is constructed from ϕϕ using the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction. Since Ω is separating, ϕϕ is faithful. We can define a (not necessarily bounded) antilinear operator S0 on H with dense domain MΩ by setting S0(mΩ)=m∗Ω_0(mΩ)=m^*Ω for all m in M, and similarly we can define a (not necessarily bounded) antilinear operator F0 on H with dense domain M'Ω by setting F0(mΩ)=m∗Ω_0(mΩ)=m^*Ω for m in M′, where M′ is the commutant of M. These operators are closable, and we denote their closures by S and F = S*. They have polar decompositions S=J|S|=JΔ12=Δ−12JF=J|F|=JΔ−12=Δ12JS=J|S| =JΔ^1/2=Δ^-1/2J F=J|F| =JΔ^-1/2=Δ^1/2J where J=J−1=J∗=J^-1=J^* is an antilinear isometry of H called the modular conjugation and Δ=S∗S=FSΔ=S^*S=FS is a positive (hence, self-adjoint) and densely defined operator called the modular operator.
