factors: We have seen above that there is a canonical homomorphism δ from the group of reals to the outer automorphism group of a von Neumann algebra, given by modular automorphisms. The kernel of δ is an important invariant of the algebra. For simplicity assume that the von Neumann algebra is a factor. Then the possibilities for the kernel of δ are: The whole real line. In this case δ is trivial and the factor is type I or II. A proper dense subgroup of the real line. Then the factor is called a factor of type III0. A discrete subgroup generated by some x > 0. Then the factor is called a factor of type IIIλ with 0 < λ = exp(−2π/x) < 1, or sometimes a Powers factor. The trivial group 0. Then the factor is called a factor of type III1. (This is in some sense the generic case.) Left Hilbert
