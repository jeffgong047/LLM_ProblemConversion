Orthogonal functions theorem In the theory of orthogonal functions, Lauricella's theorem provides a condition for checking the closure of a set of orthogonal functions, namely: Theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition that a normal orthogonal set uk{u_k} be closed is that the formal series for each function of a known closed normal orthogonal set vk{v_k} in terms of uk{u_k} converge in the mean to that function. The theorem was proved by Giuseppe Lauricella in 1912.
