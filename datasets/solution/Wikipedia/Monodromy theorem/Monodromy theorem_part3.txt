curve: Analytic continuation along a curve is essentially unique, in the sense that given two analytic continuations (ft,Ut)(f_t,U_t) and (gt,Vt)(g_t,V_t) (0≤t≤1)(0≤1) of (f,U)(f,U) along γ,γ, the functions f1_1 and g1_1 coincide on U1∩V1._1_1. Informally, this says that any two analytic continuations of (f,U)(f,U) along γγ will end up with the same values in a neighborhood of γ(1).γ(1). If the curve γγ is closed (that is, γ(0)=γ(1)γ(0)=γ(1)), one need not have f0_0 equal f1_1 in a neighborhood of γ(0).γ(0). For example, if one starts at a point (a,0)(a,0) with a>0>0 and the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of this point, and one lets γγ be the circle of radius a centered at the origin (traveled counterclockwise from (a,0)(a,0)), then by doing an analytic continuation along this curve one will end up with a value of the logarithm at (a,0)(a,0) which is 2πi2 plus the original value (see the second illustration on the right).
