theorem: Homotopy with fixed endopoints is necessary for the monodromy theorem to hold. As noted earlier, two analytic continuations along the same curve yield the same result at the curve's endpoint. However, given two different curves branching out from the same point around which an analytic function is defined, with the curves reconnecting at the end, it is not true in general that the analytic continuations of that function along the two curves will yield the same value at their common endpoint. Indeed, one can consider, as in the previous section, the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of a point (a,0)(a,0) and the circle centered at the origin and radius a.. Then, it is possible to travel from (a,0)(a,0) to (−a,0)(-a,0) in two ways, counterclockwise, on the upper half-plane arc of this circle, and clockwise, on the lower half-plane arc. The values of the logarithm at (−a,0)(-a,0) obtained by analytic continuation along these two arcs will differ by 2πi.2. If, however, one can continuously deform one of the curves into another while keeping the starting points and ending points fixed, and analytic continuation is possible on each of the intermediate curves, then the analytic continuations along the two curves will yield the same results at their common endpoint. This is called the monodromy theorem and its statement is made precise below. Let U be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point P and f:U→C:U→ℂ be a complex-analytic function. Let Q be another point in the complex plane. If there exists a family of curves γs:[0,1]→Cγ_s:[0,1]→ℂ with s∈[0,1]∈[0,1] such that γs(0)=Pγ_s(0)=P and γs(1)=Qγ_s(1)=Q for all s∈[0,1],∈[0,1], the function (s,t)∈[0,1]×[0,1]→γs(t)∈C(s,t)∈[0,1]×[0,1]→γ_s(t)∈ℂ is continuous, and for each s∈[0,1]∈[0,1] it is possible to do an analytic continuation of f along γs,γ_s, then the analytic continuations of f along γ0γ_0 and γ1γ_1 will yield the same values at Q.. The monodromy theorem makes it possible to extend an analytic function to a larger set via curves connecting a point in the original domain of the function to points in the larger set. The theorem below which states that is also called the monodromy theorem. Let U be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point P and f:U→C:U→ℂ be a complex-analytic function. If W is an open simply-connected set containing U,, and it is possible to perform an analytic continuation of f on any curve contained in W which starts at P,, then f admits a direct analytic continuation to W,, meaning that there exists a complex-analytic function g:W→C:W→ℂ whose restriction to U is f..
