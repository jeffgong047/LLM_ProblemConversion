curve: The definition of analytic continuation along a curve is a bit technical, but the basic idea is that one starts with an analytic function defined around a point, and one extends that function along a curve via analytic functions defined on small overlapping disks covering that curve. Formally, consider a curve (a continuous function) γ:[0,1]→C.γ:[0,1]→ℂ. Let f be an analytic function defined on an open disk U centered at γ(0).γ(0). An analytic continuation of the pair (f,U)(f,U) along γγ is a collection of pairs (ft,Ut)(f_t,U_t) for 0≤t≤10≤1 such that f0=f_0=f and U0=U._0=U. For each t∈[0,1],Ut∈[0,1],U_t is an open disk centered at γ(t)γ(t) and ft:Ut→C_t:U_t→ℂ is an analytic function. For each t∈[0,1]∈[0,1] there exists ε>0ε>0 such that for all t′∈[0,1]'∈[0,1] with |t−t′|<ε|t-t'|<ε one has that γ(t′)∈Utγ(t')_t (which implies that Ut_t and Ut′_t' have a non-empty intersection) and the functions ft_t and ft′_t' coincide on the intersection Ut∩Ut′._t_t'.
