triangle: Main article: Soddy circles of a triangle Any triangle in the plane has three externally tangent circles centered at its vertices. Letting A,B,C,B,C be the three points, a,b,c,b,c be the lengths of the opposite sides, and s=12(a+b+c)=12(a+b+c) be the semiperimeter, these three circles have radii s−a,s−b,s−c-a,s-b,s-c. By Descartes' theorem, two more circles, sometimes called Soddy circles, are tangent to these three circles. They are separated by the incircle, one interior to it and one exterior.[36][37][38] Descartes' theorem can be used to show that the inner Soddy circle's curvature is (4R+r+2s)/Δ(4R+r+2s)/Δ, where ΔΔ is the triangle's area, R is its circumradius, and r is its inradius. The outer Soddy circle has curvature (4R+r−2s)/Δ(4R+r-2s)/Δ.[39] The inner curvature is always positive, but the outer curvature can be positive, negative, or zero. Triangles whose outer circle degenerates to a straight line with curvature zero have been called "Soddyian triangles".[39] Four triangles with vertices at the centers of Soddy circles One of the many proofs of Descartes' theorem is based on this connection to triangle geometry and on Heron's formula for the area of a triangle as a function of its side lengths. If three circles are externally tangent, with radii r1,r2,r3,_1,r_2,r_3, then their centers P1,P2,P3_1,P_2,P_3 form the vertices of a triangle with side lengths r1+r2,_1+r_2, r1+r3,_1+r_3, and r2+r3,_2+r_3, and semiperimeter r1+r2+r3._1+r_2+r_3. By Heron's formula, this triangle △P1P2P3_1P_2P_3 has area r1r2r3(r1+r2+r3).√(r_1r_2r_3(r_1+r_2+r_3)). Now consider the inner Soddy circle with radius r4,_4, centered at point P4_4 inside the triangle. Triangle △P1P2P3_1P_2P_3 can be broken into three smaller triangles △P1P2P4,_1P_2P_4, △P4P2P3,_4P_2P_3, and △P1P4P3,_1P_4P_3, whose areas can be obtained by substituting r4_4 for one of the other radii in the area formula above. The area of the first triangle equals the sum of these three areas: r1r2r3(r1+r2+r3)=r1r2r4(r1+r2+r4)+r1r3r4(r1+r3+r4)+r2r3r4(r2+r3+r4).√(r_1r_2r_3(r_1+r_2+r_3))= √(r_1r_2r_4(r_1+r_2+r_4))+ √(r_1r_3r_4(r_1+r_3+r_4))+ √(r_2r_3r_4(r_2+r_3+r_4)). Careful algebraic manipulation shows that this formula is equivalent to equation (1), Descartes' theorem.[21] Here the outer Soddy center lies outside the triangle This analysis covers all cases in which four circles are externally tangent; one is always the inner Soddy circle of the other three. The cases in which one of the circles is internally tangent to the other three and forms their outer Soddy circle are similar. Again the four centers P1,P2,P3,P4_1,P_2,P_3,P_4 form four triangles, but (letting P4_4 be the center of the outer Soddy circle) the triangle sides incident to P4_4 have lengths that are differences of radii, r4−r1,_4-r_1, r4−r1,_4-r_1, and r4−r3,_4-r_3, rather than sums. P4_4 may lie inside or outside the triangle formed by the other three centers; when it is inside, this triangle's area equals the sum of the other three triangle areas, as above. When it is outside, the quadrilateral formed by the four centers can be subdivided by a diagonal into two triangles, in two different ways, giving an equality between the sum of two triangle areas and the sum of the other two triangle areas. In every case, the area equation reduces to Descartes' theorem. This method does not apply directly to the cases in which one of the circles degenerates to a line, but those can be handled as a limiting case of circles.[21]
