geometry: A special case of Descartes' theorem on the sphere has three circles of radius 60° (k = 1/√3, in blue) for which both circles touching all three (in green) have the same radius (30°, k = √3). Descartes' theorem generalizes to mutually tangent great or small circles in spherical geometry if the curvature of the jth circle is defined as kj=cot⁡ρj,_j=ρ_j, the cotangent of the oriented intrinsic radius ρj.ρ_j. Then:[42][17] (k1+k2+k3+k4)2=2(k12+k22+k32+k42)+4.(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)^2=2(k_1^2+k_2^2+k_3^2+k_4^2)+4. Solving for one of the curvatures in terms of the other three, k4=k1+k2+k3±2k1k2+k2k3+k3k1−1._4=k_1+k_2+k_3±2√(k_1k_2+k_2k_3+k_3k_1-1). As a matrix equation, kTQ−1k=−1.𝐤^𝖳𝐐^-1𝐤=-1. The quantity 1/kj=tan⁡ρj1/k_j=tanρ_j is the "stereographic diameter" of a small circle. This is the Euclidean length of the diameter in the stereographically projected plane when some point on the circle is projected to the origin. For a great circle, such a stereographic projection is a straight line through the origin, so kj=0_j=0.[44] Four generalized circles through the origin of the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane: Circle (blue), horocycle (red), hypercycle (purple), and geodesic (green). The boundary of ideal points is represented with a dashed stroke, and the shaded region is outside the plane. Likewise, the theorem generalizes to mutually tangent circles in hyperbolic geometry if the curvature of the jth cycle is defined as kj=coth⁡ρj,_j=ρ_j, the hyperbolic cotangent of the oriented intrinsic radius ρj.ρ_j. Then:[17][42] (k1+k2+k3+k4)2=2(k12+k22+k32+k42)−4.(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)^2=2(k_1^2+k_2^2+k_3^2+k_4^2)-4. Solving for one of the curvatures in terms of the other three, k4=k1+k2+k3±2k1k2+k2k3+k3k1+1._4=k_1+k_2+k_3±2√(k_1k_2+k_2k_3+k_3k_1+1). As a matrix equation, kTQ−1k=1.𝐤^𝖳𝐐^-1𝐤=1. This formula also holds for mutually tangent configurations in hyperbolic geometry including hypercycles and horocycles, if kj_j is taken to be the reciprocal of the stereographic diameter of the cycle. This is the diameter under stereographic projection (the Poincaré disk model) when one endpoint of the diameter is projected to the origin.[45] Hypercycles do not have a well-defined center or intrinsic radius and horocycles have an ideal point for a center and infinite intrinsic radius, but |kj|>1|k_j|>1 for a hyperbolic circle, |kj|=1|k_j|=1 for a horocycle, |kj|<1|k_j|<1 for a hypercycle, and kj=0_j=0 for a geodesic.[46] Higher
