lines: Descartes' theorem still applies when one of the circles is replaced by a straight line of zero curvature. If one of the three circles is replaced by a straight line tangent to the remaining circles, then its curvature is zero and drops out of equation (1). For instance, if k3=0_3=0, then equation (1) can be factorized as[29] (k1+k2+k4)(k2+k4−k1)⋅(k1+k4−k2)(k1+k2−k4)=0, (√(k_1)+√(k_2)+√(k_4))(√(k_2)+√(k_4)-√(k_1)) ·(√(k_1)+√(k_4)-√(k_2))(√(k_1)+√(k_2)-√(k_4))=0, and equation (2) simplifies to[30] k4=k1+k2±2k1k2._4=k_1+k_2±2√(k_1k_2). Taking the square root of both sides leads to another alternative formulation of this case (with k1≥k2_1_2), k4=k1±k2,√(k_4)=√(k_1)±√(k_2), which has been described as "a sort of demented version of the Pythagorean theorem".[23] If two circles are replaced by lines, the tangency between the two replaced circles becomes a parallelism between their two replacement lines. In this case, with k2=k3=0_2=k_3=0, equation (2) is reduced to the trivial k4=k1._4=k_1. This corresponds to the observation that, for all four curves to remain mutually tangent, the other two circles must be congruent.[17][24] Integer
