dimensions: Soddy's hexlet. Any pair of adjacent green spheres together with the two red spheres and the outer gray sphere satisfy the three-dimensional case of Descartes' theorem. In n-dimensional Euclidean space, the maximum number of mutually tangent hyperspheres is n+2+2. For example, in 3-dimensional space, five spheres can be mutually tangent. The curvatures of the hyperspheres satisfy (∑i=1n+2ki)2=n∑i=1n+2ki2(∑_i=1^n+2k_i)^2=n ∑_i=1^n+2k_i^2 with the case ki=0_i=0 corresponding to a flat hyperplane, generalizing the 2-dimensional version of the theorem.[17][42] Although there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the complex numbers, the relationship between the positions of the centers can be re-expressed as a matrix equation, which also generalizes to n dimensions.[17] In three dimensions, suppose that three mutually tangent spheres are fixed, and a fourth sphere S1_1 is given, tangent to the three fixed spheres. The three-dimensional version of Descartes' theorem can be applied to find a sphere S2_2 tangent to S1_1 and the fixed spheres, then applied again to find a new sphere S3_3 tangent to S2_2 and the fixed spheres, and so on. The result is a cyclic sequence of six spheres each tangent to its neighbors in the sequence and to the three fixed spheres, a configuration called Soddy's hexlet, after Soddy's discovery and publication of it in the form of another poem in 1936.[15][47] Higher-dimensional configurations of mutually tangent hyperspheres in spherical or hyperbolic geometry, with curvatures defined as above, satisfy (∑i=1n+2ki)2=nC+n∑i=1n+2ki2,(∑_i=1^n+2k_i)^2=nC+n ∑_i=1^n+2k_i^2, where C=2=2 in spherical geometry and C=−2=-2 in hyperbolic geometry.[42][17] See
