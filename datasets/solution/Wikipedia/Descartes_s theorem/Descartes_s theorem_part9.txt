circles: Ford circles in the unit interval Main article: Ford circle The special cases of one straight line and integer curvatures combine in the Ford circles. These are an infinite family of circles tangent to the x-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system at its rational points. Each fraction p/q/q (in lowest terms) has a circle tangent to the line at the point (p/q,0)(p/q,0) with curvature 2q22q^2. Three of these curvatures, together with the zero curvature of the axis, meet the conditions of Descartes' theorem whenever the denominators of two of the corresponding fractions sum to the denominator of the third. The two Ford circles for fractions p/q/q and r/s/s (both in lowest terms) are tangent when |psâˆ’qr|=1|ps-qr|=1. When they are tangent, they form a quadruple of tangent circles with the x-axis and with the circle for their mediant (p+r)/(q+s)(p+r)/(q+s).[33] The Ford circles belong to a special Apollonian gasket with root quadruple (0,0,1,1)(0,0,1,1), bounded between two parallel lines, which may be taken as the x-axis and the line y=1=1. This is the only Apollonian gasket containing a straight line, and not bounded within a negative-curvature circle. The Ford circles are the circles in this gasket that are tangent to the x-axis.[31] Geometric
