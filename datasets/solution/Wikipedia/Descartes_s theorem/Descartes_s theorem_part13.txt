configurations: Descartes' theorem can be expressed as a matrix equation and then generalized to other configurations of four oriented circles by changing the matrix. Let k𝐤 be a column vector of the four circle curvatures and let Q𝐐 be a symmetric matrix whose coefficients qi,j_i,j represent the relative orientation between the ith and jth oriented circles at their intersection point: Q=[−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1],Q−1=14[−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1−1].𝐐=[ -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; ], 𝐐^-1=1/4[ -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; -1 -1 -1 -1; ]. Then equation (1) can be rewritten as the matrix equation[17][40] kTQ−1k=0.𝐤^𝖳𝐐^-1𝐤=0. As a generalization of Descartes' theorem, a modified symmetric matrix Q𝐐 can represent any desired configuration of four circles by replacing each coefficient with the inclination qi,j_i,j between two circles, defined as qi,j=ri2+rj2−di,j22rirj,_i,j=r_i^2+r_j^2-d_i,j^2/2r_ir_j, where ri,rj_i,r_j are the respective radii of the circles, and di,j_i,j is the Euclidean distance between their centers.[41][42][43] When the circles intersect, qi,j=cos⁡(θi,j)_i,j=cos(θ_i,j), the cosine of the intersection angle between the circles. The inclination, sometimes called inversive distance, is 11 when the circles are tangent and oriented the same way at their point of tangency, −1-1 when the two circles are tangent and oriented oppositely at the point of tangency, 00 for orthogonal circles, outside the interval [−1,1][-1,1] for non-intersecting circles, and ∞∞ in the limit as one circle degenerates to a point.[40][35] The equation kTQ−1k=0𝐤^𝖳𝐐^-1𝐤=0 is satisfied for any arbitrary configuration of four circles in the plane, provided Q𝐐 is the appropriate matrix of pairwise inclinations.[40] Spherical and hyperbolic
