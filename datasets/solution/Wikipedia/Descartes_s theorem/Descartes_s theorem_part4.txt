centers: To determine a circle completely, not only its radius (or curvature), but also its center must be known. The relevant equation is expressed most clearly if the Cartesian coordinates (x,y)(x,y) are interpreted as a complex number z=x+iy=x+iy. The equation then looks similar to Descartes' theorem and is therefore called the complex Descartes theorem. Given four circles with curvatures ki_i and centers zi_i for i∈1,2,3,4∈{1,2,3,4}, the following equality holds in addition to equation (1): (k1z1+k2z2+k3z3+k4z4)2=2(k12z12+k22z22+k32z32+k42z42).(k_1z_1+k_2z_2+k_3z_3+k_4z_4)^2=2 (k_1^2z_1^2+k_2^2z_2^2+k_3^2z_3^2+k_4^2z_4^2). (3)(3) Once k4_4 has been found using equation (2), one may proceed to calculate z4_4 by solving equation (3) as a quadratic equation, leading to a form similar to equation (2): z4=z1k1+z2k2+z3k3±2k1k2z1z2+k2k3z2z3+k1k3z1z3k4._4=z_1k_1+z_2k_2+z_3k_3±2√(k_1k_2z_1z_2+k_2k_3z_2z_3+k_1k_3z_1z_3)/k_4. Again, in general there are two solutions for z4_4 corresponding to the two solutions for k4_4. The plus/minus sign in the above formula for z4_4 does not necessarily correspond to the plus/minus sign in the formula for k4_4.[17][26][27] Special
