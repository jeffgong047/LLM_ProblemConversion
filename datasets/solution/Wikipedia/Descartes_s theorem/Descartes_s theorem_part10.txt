progression: Main article: Coxeter's loxodromic sequence of tangent circles Coxeter's loxodromic sequence of tangent circles. Each circle is labeled by an integer i, its position in the sequence; it has radius ρi and curvature ρ−i. When the four radii of the circles in Descartes' theorem are assumed to be in a geometric progression with ratio ρρ, the curvatures are also in the same progression (in reverse). Plugging this ratio into the theorem gives the equation 2(1+ρ2+ρ4+ρ6)=(1+ρ+ρ2+ρ3)2,2(1+ρ^2+ρ^4+ρ^6)=(1+ρ+ρ^2+ρ^3)^2, which has only one real solution greater than one, the ratio ρ=φ+φ≈2.89005,ρ=φ+√(φ)≈2.89005 where φφ is the golden ratio. If the same progression is continued in both directions, each consecutive four numbers describe circles obeying Descartes' theorem. The resulting double-ended geometric progression of circles can be arranged into a single spiral pattern of tangent circles, called Coxeter's loxodromic sequence of tangent circles. It was first described, together with analogous constructions in higher dimensions, by H. S. M. Coxeter in 1968.[34][35] Soddy circles of a
