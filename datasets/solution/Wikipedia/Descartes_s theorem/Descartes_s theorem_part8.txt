curvatures: An Apollonian gasket with integer curvatures, generated by four mutually tangent circles with curvatures −10 (the outer circle), 18, 23, and 27 When four tangent circles described by equation (2) all have integer curvatures, the alternative fourth circle described by the second solution to the equation must also have an integer curvature. This is because both solutions differ from an integer by the square root of an integer, and so either solution can only be an integer if this square root, and hence the other solution, is also an integer. Every four integers that satisfy the equation in Descartes' theorem form the curvatures of four tangent circles.[31] Integer quadruples of this type are also closely related to Heronian triangles, triangles with integer sides and area.[32] Starting with any four mutually tangent circles, and repeatedly replacing one of the four with its alternative solution (Vieta jumping), in all possible ways, leads to a system of infinitely many tangent circles called an Apollonian gasket. When the initial four circles have integer curvatures, so does each replacement, and therefore all of the circles in the gasket have integer curvatures. Any four tangent circles with integer curvatures belong to exactly one such gasket, uniquely described by its root quadruple of the largest four largest circles and four smallest curvatures. This quadruple can be found, starting from any other quadruple from the same gasket, by repeatedly replacing the smallest circle by a larger one that solves the same Descartes equation, until no such reduction is possible.[31] A root quadruple is said to be primitive if it has no nontrivial common divisor. Every primitive root quadruple can be found from a factorization of a sum of two squares, n2+m2=de^2+m^2=de, as the quadruple (−n,d+n,e+n,d+e+n−2m)(-n, d+n, e+n, d+e+n-2m). To be primitive, it must satisfy the additional conditions gcd(n,d,e)=1(n,d,e)=1, and −n≤0≤2m≤d≤e-n≤0≤2m. Factorizations of sums of two squares can be obtained using the sum of two squares theorem. Any other integer Apollonian gasket can be formed by multiplying a primitive root quadruple by an arbitrary integer, and any quadruple in one of these gaskets (that is, any integer solution to the Descartes equation) can be formed by reversing the replacement process used to find the root quadruple. For instance, the gasket with root quadruple (−10,18,23,27)(-10,18,23,27), shown in the figure, is generated in this way from the factorized sum of two squares 102+22=8⋅1310^2+2^2=8·13.[31] Ford
