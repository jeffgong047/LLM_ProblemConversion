Statement: Here, as all three circles are tangent to each other at the same point, Descartes' theorem does not apply. Descartes' theorem is most easily stated in terms of the circles' curvatures.[23] The signed curvature (or bend) of a circle is defined as k=±1/r=±1/r, where r is its radius. The larger a circle, the smaller is the magnitude of its curvature, and vice versa. The sign in k=±1/r=±1/r (represented by the ±± symbol) is positive for a circle that is externally tangent to the other circles. For an internally tangent circle like the large red circle, that circumscribes the other circles, the sign is negative. If a straight line is considered a degenerate circle with zero curvature (and thus infinite radius), Descartes' theorem also applies to a line and three circles that are all three mutually tangent (see Generalized circle).[1] For four circles that are tangent to each other at six distinct points, with curvatures ki_i for i=1,…,4=1,…,4, Descartes' theorem says: (k1+k2+k3+k4)2=2(k12+k22+k32+k42).(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)^2=2 (k_1^2+k_2^2+k_3^2+k_4^2). (1)(1) If one of the four curvatures is considered to be a variable, and the rest to be constants, this is a quadratic equation. To find the radius of a fourth circle tangent to three given kissing circles, the quadratic equation can be solved as[13][24] k4=k1+k2+k3±2k1k2+k2k3+k3k1._4=k_1+k_2+k_3±2√(k_1k_2+k_2k_3+k_3k_1). (2)(2) The ±± symbol indicates that in general this equation has two solutions, and any triple of tangent circles has two tangent circles (or degenerate straight lines). Problem-specific criteria may favor one of these two solutions over the other in any given problem.[21] The theorem does not apply to systems of circles with more than two circles tangent to each other at the same point. It requires that the points of tangency be distinct.[8] When more than two circles are tangent at a single point, there can be infinitely many such circles, with arbitrary curvatures; see pencil of circles.[25] Locating the circle
