boundary: Let ΩΩ be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension n with boundary and let αα be a smooth n-differential form that is compactly supported on ΩΩ. First, suppose that αα is compactly supported in the domain of a single, oriented coordinate chart U,φ{U,φ}. In this case, we define the integral of αα over ΩΩ as ∫Ωα=∫φ(U)(φ−1)∗α,∫_Ωα=∫_φ(U)(φ^-1)^*α , i.e., via the pullback of αα to Rnℝ^n. More generally, the integral of αα over ΩΩ is defined as follows: Let ψi{ψ_i} be a partition of unity associated with a locally finite cover Ui,φi{U_i,φ_i} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral ∫Ωα≡∑i∫Uiψiα,∫_Ωα≡∑_i∫_U_iψ_iα , where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to Rnℝ^n as described above. This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity. The generalized Stokes theorem reads: Theorem (Stokes–Cartan) — Let ωω be a smooth (n−1)(n-1)-form with compact support on an oriented, n-dimensional manifold-with-boundary M, where ∂M is given the induced orientation.Then ∫Mdω=∫∂Mω.∫_Mdω=∫_ω. Here d is the exterior derivative, which is defined using the manifold structure only. The right-hand side is sometimes written as ∮∂Ωω∮_∂Ωω to stress the fact that the (n−1)(n-1)-manifold ∂Ω∂Ω has no boundary.[note 1] (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth n-dimensional manifold ΩΩ, application of the theorem twice gives ∫∂(∂Ω)ω=∫Ωd(dω)=0∫_∂(∂Ω)ω=∫_Ωd(dω)=0 for any (n−2)(n-2)-form ωω, which implies that ∂(∂Ω)=∅∂(∂Ω)=∅.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate integral laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent differential formulations (see below). The theorem is often used in situations where ΩΩ is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often Rkℝ^k, on which the form ωω is defined. Topological preliminaries; integration over
