In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus is the special case where the manifold is a line segment, Green’s theorem and Stokes' theorem are the cases of a surface in R2ℝ^2 or R3,ℝ^3, and the divergence theorem is the case of a volume in R3.ℝ^3.[2] Hence, the theorem is sometimes referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Multivariate Calculus.[3] Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form ωω over the boundary ∂Ω∂Ω of some orientable manifold ΩΩ is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative dωω over the whole of ΩΩ, i.e., ∫∂Ωω=∫Ωdω.∫_∂Ωω=∫_Ωdω . Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by Élie Cartan in 1945,[4] following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by Vito Volterra, Édouard Goursat, and Henri Poincaré.[5][6] This modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a classical result that Lord Kelvin communicated to George Stokes in a letter dated July 2, 1850.[7][8][9] Stokes set the theorem as a question on the 1854 Smith's Prize exam, which led to the result bearing his name. It was first published by Hermann Hankel in 1861.[9][10] This classical case relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field FF over a surface (that is, the flux of curlFcurl F) in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over the surface boundary.
