Footnotes: ^ For mathematicians this fact is known, therefore the circle is redundant and often omitted. However, one should keep in mind here that in thermodynamics, where frequently expressions as ∮WdtotalU∮_W{d_totalU} appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path W is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold. That is, in a thermodynamic application, where U is a function of the temperature α1=Tα_1=T, the volume α2=Vα_2=V, and the electrical polarization α3=Pα_3=P of the sample, one has dtotalU=∑i=13∂U∂αidαi,{d_totalU}=∑_i=1^3/∂α_i dα_i , and the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the differential consequences of the integral postulate ∮WdtotalU=!0.∮_W {d_totalU} != 0 . ^ γγ and ΓΓ are both loops, however, ΓΓ is not necessarily a Jordan curve
