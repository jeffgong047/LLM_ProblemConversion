sets: A region (here called D instead of Ω) with piecewise smooth boundary. This is a manifold with corners, so its boundary is not a smooth manifold. The formulation above, in which ΩΩ is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications. For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two x-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners. In such a case, the corner points mean that ΩΩ is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply. Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true. This is because ΩΩ and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a measure zero set). A version of Stokes' theorem that allows for roughness was proved by Whitney.[16] Assume that D is a connected bounded open subset of Rnℝ^n. Call D a standard domain if it satisfies the following property: there exists a subset P of ∂D, open in ∂D, whose complement in ∂D has Hausdorff (n−1)(n-1)-measure zero; and such that every point of P has a generalized normal vector. This is a vector v(x)v(x) such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that v(x)v(x) is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around x, there exists a smooth function f(x2,…,xn)(x_2,…,x_n) such that P is the graph x1=f(x2,…,xn){x_1=f(x_2,…,x_n)} and D is the region x1:x1<f(x2,…,xn){x_1:x_1<f(x_2,…,x_n)}. Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff (n−1)(n-1)-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth (n−1)(n-1)-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side. He then proves that if D is a standard domain in Rnℝ^n, ωω is an (n−1)(n-1)-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on D∪P, smooth on D, integrable on P, and such that dωω is integrable on D, then Stokes' theorem holds, that is, ∫Pω=∫Ddω.∫_Pω=∫_Ddω . The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to geometric measure theory. Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.[17] Special
