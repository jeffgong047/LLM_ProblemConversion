electromagnetism: Two of the four Maxwell equations involve curls of 3-D vector fields, and their differential and integral forms are related by the special 3-dimensional (vector calculus) case of Stokes' theorem. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see Differentiation under the integral sign): Name Differential form Integral form (using three-dimensional Stokes theorem plus relativistic invariance, ∫∂∂t⋯→ddt∫⋯∫∂…→ddt∫⋯) Maxwell–Faraday equation Faraday's law of induction: ∇×E=−∂B∂t∇×𝐄=-∂𝐁/ ∮CE⋅dl=∬S∇×E⋅dA=−∬S∂B∂t⋅dA∮_C𝐄𝐥 =∬_S∇×𝐄𝐀 =-∬_S∂𝐁/𝐀 (with C and S not necessarily stationary) Ampère's law (with Maxwell's extension): ∇×H=J+∂D∂t∇×𝐇=𝐉+∂𝐃/ ∮CH⋅dl=∬S∇×H⋅dA=∬SJ⋅dA+∬S∂D∂t⋅dA∮_C𝐇𝐥 =∬_S∇×𝐇𝐀 =∬_S𝐉𝐀+∬_S∂𝐃/𝐀 (with C and S not necessarily stationary) The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in SI units. In other systems of units, such as CGS or Gaussian units, the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms:[18][19] ∇×E=−1c∂B∂t,∇×H=1c∂D∂t+4πcJ,∇×𝐄 =-1/c∂𝐁/ , ∇×𝐇 =1/c∂𝐃/+4π/c𝐉 , respectively, where c is the speed of light in vacuum.
