theorem: Likewise, the divergence theorem ∫Vol∇⋅FdVol=∮∂VolF⋅dΣ∫_Vol∇·𝐅 d_Vol=∮_∂Vol𝐅Σ is a special case if we identify a vector field with the (n−1)(n-1)-form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case F=fc→F=fc⃗ where c→c⃗ is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives c→⋅∫Vol∇fdVol=c→⋅∮∂VolfdΣ.c⃗·∫_Vol d_Vol=c⃗·∮_∂Volf dΣ . Since this holds for all c→c⃗ we find ∫Vol∇fdVol=∮∂VolfdΣ.∫_Vol d_Vol=∮_∂Volf dΣ . Volume integral of gradient of scalar
