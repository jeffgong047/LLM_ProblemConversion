Introduction: The second fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function f over the interval [a,b][a,b] can be calculated by finding an antiderivative F of f: ∫abf(x)dx=F(b)−F(a).∫_a^bf(x) dx=F(b)-F(a) . Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. By the choice of FF, dFdx=f(x)dF/dx=f(x). In the parlance of differential forms, this is saying that f(x)dx(x) dx is the exterior derivative of the 0-form, i.e. function, F: in other words, that dF=fdx=f dx. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms ωω instead of just 0-forms such as F. A closed interval [a,b][a,b] is a simple example of a one-dimensional manifold with boundary. Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points a and b. Integrating f over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be orientable, and the form has to be compactly supported in order to give a well-defined integral. The two points a and b form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds M with boundary. The boundary ∂M of M is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of M. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, a inherits the opposite orientation as b, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, "integrating" F over two boundary points a, b is taking the difference F(b)−F(a)(b)-F(a). In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral (fdx=dF dx=dF) over a 1-dimensional manifold ([a,b][a,b]) by considering the anti-derivative (F) at the 0-dimensional boundaries (a,b{a,b}), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals (dωω) over n-dimensional manifolds (ΩΩ) by considering the antiderivative (ωω) at the (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional boundaries (∂Ω∂Ω) of the manifold. So the fundamental theorem reads: ∫[a,b]f(x)dx=∫[a,b]dF=∫∂[a,b]F=∫a−∪b+F=F(b)−F(a).∫_[a,b]f(x) dx=∫_[a,b] dF=∫_∂[a,b] F=∫_{a}^-∪{b}^+F=F(b)-F(a) . Formulation for smooth manifolds with
