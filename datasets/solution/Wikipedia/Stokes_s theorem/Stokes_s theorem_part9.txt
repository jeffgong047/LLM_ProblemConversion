case: Main article: Stokes' theorem An illustration of the vector-calculus Stokes theorem, with surface ΣΣ, its boundary ∂Σ∂Σ and the "normal" vector n. This is a (dualized) (1 + 1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about vector fields). This special case is often just referred to as Stokes' theorem in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the curl theorem. The classical Stokes' theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface ΣΣ in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with n=2=2) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, ∂Σ∂Σ, must have positive orientation, meaning that ∂Σ∂Σ points counterclockwise when the surface normal, n, points toward the viewer. One consequence of this theorem is that the field lines of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as: Theorem — Suppose F=(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))F=(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z)) is defined in a region with smooth surface ΣΣ and has continuous first-order partial derivatives. Then ∬Σ((∂R∂y−∂Q∂z)dydz+(∂P∂z−∂R∂x)dzdx+(∂Q∂x−∂P∂y)dxdy)=∮∂Σ(Pdx+Qdy+Rdz),∬_Σ((/-/)dy dz+(/-/)dz dx+(/-/)dx dy)=∮_∂Σ(P dx+Q dy+R dz) , where P,Q,Q and R are the components of FF, and ∂Σ∂Σ is the boundary of the region ΣΣ.
