description: The weight λ gives rise to a character (one-dimensional representation) of the Borel subgroup B, which is denoted χλ. Holomorphic sections of the holomorphic line bundle Lλ over G/B may be described more concretely as holomorphic maps f:G→Cλ:f(gb)=χλ(b−1)f(g):G→ℂ_λ:f(gb)=χ_λ(b^-1)f(g) for all g ∈ G and b ∈ B. The action of G on these sections is given by g⋅f(h)=f(g−1h)(h)=f(g^-1h) for g, h ∈ G.
