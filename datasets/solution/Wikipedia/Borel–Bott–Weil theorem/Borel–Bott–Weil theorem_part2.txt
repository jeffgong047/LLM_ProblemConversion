Formulation: Let G be a semisimple Lie group or algebraic group over Cℂ, and fix a maximal torus T along with a Borel subgroup B which contains T. Let λ be an integral weight of T; λ defines in a natural way a one-dimensional representation Cλ of B, by pulling back the representation on T = B/U, where U is the unipotent radical of B. Since we can think of the projection map G → G/B as a principal B-bundle, for each Cλ we get an associated fiber bundle L−λ on G/B (note the sign), which is obviously a line bundle. Identifying Lλ with its sheaf of holomorphic sections, we consider the sheaf cohomology groups Hi(G/B,Lλ)^i(G/B, L_λ). Since G acts on the total space of the bundle Lλ_λ by bundle automorphisms, this action naturally gives a G-module structure on these groups; and the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem gives an explicit description of these groups as G-modules. We first need to describe the Weyl group action centered at −ρ-ρ. For any integral weight λ and w in the Weyl group W, we set w∗λ:=w(λ+ρ)−ρ*λ:=w(λ+ρ)-ρ , where ρ denotes the half-sum of positive roots of G. It is straightforward to check that this defines a group action, although this action is not linear, unlike the usual Weyl group action. Also, a weight μ is said to be dominant if μ(α∨)≥0μ(α^∨)≥0 for all simple roots α. Let ℓ denote the length function on W. Given an integral weight λ, one of two cases occur: There is no w∈W such that w∗λ*λ is dominant, equivalently, there exists a nonidentity w∈W such that w∗λ=λ*λ=λ; or There is a unique w∈W such that w∗λ*λ is dominant. The theorem states that in the first case, we have Hi(G/B,Lλ)=0^i(G/B, L_λ)=0 for all i; and in the second case, we have Hi(G/B,Lλ)=0^i(G/B, L_λ)=0 for all i≠ℓ(w)≠ℓ(w), while Hℓ(w)(G/B,Lλ)^ℓ(w)(G/B, L_λ) is the dual of the irreducible highest-weight representation of G with highest weight w∗λ*λ. It is worth noting that case (1) above occurs if and only if (λ+ρ)(β∨)=0(λ+ρ)(β^∨)=0 for some positive root β. Also, we obtain the classical Borel–Weil theorem as a special case of this theorem by taking λ to be dominant and w to be the identity element e∈W.
