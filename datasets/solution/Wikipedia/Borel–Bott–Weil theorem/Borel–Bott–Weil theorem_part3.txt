Example: For example, consider G = SL2(C), for which G/B is the Riemann sphere, an integral weight is specified simply by an integer n, and ρ = 1. The line bundle Ln is O(n)𝒪(n), whose sections are the homogeneous polynomials of degree n (i.e. the binary forms). As a representation of G, the sections can be written as Symn(C2)*, and is canonically isomorphic to Symn(C2). This gives us at a stroke the representation theory of sl2(C)𝔰𝔩_2(𝐂): Γ(O(1))Γ(𝒪(1)) is the standard representation, and Γ(O(n))Γ(𝒪(n)) is its nth symmetric power. We even have a unified description of the action of the Lie algebra, derived from its realization as vector fields on the Riemann sphere: if H, X, Y are the standard generators of sl2(C)𝔰𝔩_2(𝐂), then H=x∂∂x−y∂∂y,X=x∂∂y,Y=y∂∂x.H =x∂/-y∂/, X =x∂/, Y =y∂/.
