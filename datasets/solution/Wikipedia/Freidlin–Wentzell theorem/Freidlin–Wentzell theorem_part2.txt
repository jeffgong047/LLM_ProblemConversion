Statement: Let B be a standard Brownian motion on Rd starting at the origin, 0 ∈ Rd, and let Xε be an Rd-valued Itō diffusion solving an Itō stochastic differential equation of the form dXtε=b(Xtε)dt+εdBt,X0ε=0,dX_t^ε=b(X_t^ε) dt+√(ε) dB_t, X_0^ε=0, where the drift vector field b : Rd → Rd is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞, the family of processes (Xε)ε>0 satisfies the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 → R ∪ {+∞} given by I(ω)=12∫0T|ω˙t−b(ωt)|2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^T|ω̇_t-b(ω_t)|^2 dt if ω lies in the Sobolev space H1([0, T]; Rd), and I(ω) = +∞ otherwise. In other words, for every open set G ⊆ C0 and every closed set F ⊆ C0, limsupε↓0(εlog⁡P[Xε∈F])≤−infω∈FI(ω)lim sup_ε↓0(εlog𝐏[X^ε])≤-inf_ωI(ω) and liminfε↓0(εlog⁡P[Xε∈G])≥−infω∈GI(ω).lim inf_ε↓0(εlog𝐏[X^ε])≥-inf_ωI(ω).
