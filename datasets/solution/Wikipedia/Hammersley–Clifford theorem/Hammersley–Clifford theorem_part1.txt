The Hammersley–Clifford theorem is a result in probability theory, mathematical statistics and statistical mechanics that gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which a strictly positive probability distribution (of events in a probability space)[clarification needed] can be represented as events generated by a Markov network (also known as a Markov random field). It is the fundamental theorem of random fields.[1] It states that a probability distribution that has a strictly positive mass or density satisfies one of the Markov properties with respect to an undirected graph G if and only if it is a Gibbs random field, that is, its density can be factorized over the cliques (or complete subgraphs) of the graph. The relationship between Markov and Gibbs random fields was initiated by Roland Dobrushin[2] and Frank Spitzer[3] in the context of statistical mechanics. The theorem is named after John Hammersley and Peter Clifford, who proved the equivalence in an unpublished paper in 1971.[4][5] Simpler proofs using the inclusion–exclusion principle were given independently by Geoffrey Grimmett,[6] Preston[7] and Sherman[8] in 1973, with a further proof by Julian Besag in 1974.[9] Proof
