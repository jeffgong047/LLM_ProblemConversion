outline: A simple Markov network for demonstrating that any Gibbs random field satisfies every Markov property. It is a trivial matter to show that a Gibbs random field satisfies every Markov property. As an example of this fact, see the following: In the image to the right, a Gibbs random field over the provided graph has the form Pr(A,B,C,D,E,F)∝f1(A,B,D)f2(A,C,D)f3(C,D,F)f4(C,E,F)(A,B,C,D,E,F)_1(A,B,D)f_2(A,C,D)f_3(C,D,F)f_4(C,E,F). If variables C and D are fixed, then the global Markov property requires that: A,B⊥E,F|C,D,B,F|C,D (see conditional independence), since C,D,D forms a barrier between A,B,B and E,F,F. With C and D constant, Pr(A,B,E,F|C=c,D=d)∝[f1(A,B,d)f2(A,c,d)]⋅[f3(c,d,F)f4(c,E,F)]=g1(A,B)g2(E,F)(A,B,E,F|C=c,D=d)∝[f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d)]·[f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F)]=g_1(A,B)g_2(E,F) where g1(A,B)=f1(A,B,d)f2(A,c,d)_1(A,B)=f_1(A,B,d)f_2(A,c,d) and g2(E,F)=f3(c,d,F)f4(c,E,F)_2(E,F)=f_3(c,d,F)f_4(c,E,F). This implies that A,B⊥E,F|C,D,B,F|C,D. To establish that every positive probability distribution that satisfies the local Markov property is also a Gibbs random field, the following lemma, which provides a means for combining different factorizations, needs to be proved: Lemma 1 provides a means for combining factorizations as shown in this diagram. Note that in this image, the overlap between sets is ignored. Lemma 1 Let U denote the set of all random variables under consideration, and let Θ,Φ1,Φ2,…,Φn⊆UΘ,Φ_1,Φ_2,…,Φ_n and Ψ1,Ψ2,…,Ψm⊆UΨ_1,Ψ_2,…,Ψ_m denote arbitrary sets of variables. (Here, given an arbitrary set of variables X, X will also denote an arbitrary assignment to the variables from X.) If Pr(U)=f(Θ)∏i=1ngi(Φi)=∏j=1mhj(Ψj)(U)=f(Θ)∏_i=1^ng_i(Φ_i)=∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j) for functions f,g1,g2,…gn,g_1,g_2,_n and h1,h2,…,hm_1,h_2,…,h_m, then there exist functions h1′,h2′,…,hm′'_1,h'_2,…,h'_m and g1′,g2′,…,gn′'_1,g'_2,…,g'_n such that Pr(U)=(∏j=1mhj′(Θ∩Ψj))(∏i=1ngi′(Φi))(U)=(∏_j=1^mh'_j(Θ∩Ψ_j))(∏_i=1^ng'_i(Φ_i)) In other words, ∏j=1mhj(Ψj)∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j) provides a template for further factorization of f(Θ)(Θ). Proof of Lemma 1 In order to use ∏j=1mhj(Ψj)∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j) as a template to further factorize f(Θ)(Θ), all variables outside of ΘΘ need to be fixed. To this end, let θ¯θ̅ be an arbitrary fixed assignment to the variables from U∖Θ∖Θ (the variables not in ΘΘ). For an arbitrary set of variables X, let θ¯[X]θ̅[X] denote the assignment θ¯θ̅ restricted to the variables from X∖Θ∖Θ (the variables from X, excluding the variables from ΘΘ). Moreover, to factorize only f(Θ)(Θ), the other factors g1(Φ1),g2(Φ2),...,gn(Φn)_1(Φ_1),g_2(Φ_2),...,g_n(Φ_n) need to be rendered moot for the variables from ΘΘ. To do this, the factorization Pr(U)=f(Θ)∏i=1ngi(Φi)(U)=f(Θ)∏_i=1^ng_i(Φ_i) will be re-expressed as Pr(U)=(f(Θ)∏i=1ngi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi]))(∏i=1ngi(Φi)gi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi]))(U)=(f(Θ)∏_i=1^ng_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i]))(∏_i=1^ng_i(Φ_i)/g_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i])) For each i=1,2,...,n=1,2,...,n: gi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i]) is gi(Φi)_i(Φ_i) where all variables outside of ΘΘ have been fixed to the values prescribed by θ¯θ̅. Let f′(Θ)=f(Θ)∏i=1ngi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])'(Θ)=f(Θ)∏_i=1^ng_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i]) and gi′(Φi)=gi(Φi)gi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])'_i(Φ_i)=g_i(Φ_i)/g_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i]) for each i=1,2,…,n=1,2,…,n so Pr(U)=f′(Θ)∏i=1ngi′(Φi)=∏j=1mhj(Ψj)(U)=f'(Θ)∏_i=1^ng'_i(Φ_i)=∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j) What is most important is that gi′(Φi)=gi(Φi)gi(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])=1'_i(Φ_i)=g_i(Φ_i)/g_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i])=1 when the values assigned to ΦiΦ_i do not conflict with the values prescribed by θ¯θ̅, making gi′(Φi)'_i(Φ_i) "disappear" when all variables not in ΘΘ are fixed to the values from θ¯θ̅. Fixing all variables not in ΘΘ to the values from θ¯θ̅ gives Pr(Θ,θ¯)=f′(Θ)∏i=1ngi′(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])=∏j=1mhj(Ψj∩Θ,θ¯[Ψj])(Θ,θ̅)=f'(Θ)∏_i=1^ng'_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i])=∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j∩Θ,θ̅[Ψ_j]) Since gi′(Φi∩Θ,θ¯[Φi])=1'_i(Φ_i∩Θ,θ̅[Φ_i])=1, f′(Θ)=∏j=1mhj(Ψj∩Θ,θ¯[Ψj])'(Θ)=∏_j=1^mh_j(Ψ_j∩Θ,θ̅[Ψ_j]) Letting hj′(Θ∩Ψj)=hj(Ψj∩Θ,θ¯[Ψj])'_j(Θ∩Ψ_j)=h_j(Ψ_j∩Θ,θ̅[Ψ_j]) gives: f′(Θ)=∏j=1mhj′(Θ∩Ψj)'(Θ)=∏_j=1^mh'_j(Θ∩Ψ_j) which finally gives: Pr(U)=(∏j=1mhj′(Θ∩Ψj))(∏i=1ngi′(Φi))(U)=(∏_j=1^mh'_j(Θ∩Ψ_j))(∏_i=1^ng'_i(Φ_i)) The clique formed by vertices x1_1, x2_2, and x3_3, is the intersection of x1∪∂x1{x_1}∪_1, x2∪∂x2{x_2}∪_2, and x3∪∂x3{x_3}∪_3. Lemma 1 provides a means of combining two different factorizations of Pr(U)(U). The local Markov property implies that for any random variable x∈U, that there exists factors fx_x and f−x_-x such that: Pr(U)=fx(x,∂x)f−x(U∖x)(U)=f_x(x,)f_-x(U∖{x}) where ∂x are the neighbors of node x. Applying Lemma 1 repeatedly eventually factors Pr(U)(U) into a product of clique potentials (see the image on the right). End of Proof See
