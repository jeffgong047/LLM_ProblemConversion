sketch: Here is a sketch of the proof referred to in one of Terence Tao's lectures.[15] Like most proofs of the PNT, it starts out by reformulating the problem in terms of a less intuitive, but better-behaved, prime-counting function. The idea is to count the primes (or a related set such as the set of prime powers) with weights to arrive at a function with smoother asymptotic behavior. The most common such generalized counting function is the Chebyshev function ψ(x), defined by ψ(x)=∑pisprimepk≤x,log⁡p.ψ(x)=∑_p^k,pisprime . This is sometimes written as ψ(x)=∑n≤xΛ(n),ψ(x)=∑_nΛ(n) , where Λ(n) is the von Mangoldt function, namely Λ(n)=log⁡pifn=pkforsomeprimepandintegerk≥1,0otherwise.Λ(n)= ifn=p^kforsomeprimepandintegerk≥1, 0 otherwise. It is now relatively easy to check that the PNT is equivalent to the claim that limx→∞ψ(x)x=1.lim_x→∞ψ(x)/x=1 . Indeed, this follows from the easy estimates ψ(x)=∑pisprimep≤xlog⁡p⌊log⁡xlog⁡p⌋≤∑pisprimep≤xlog⁡x=π(x)log⁡xψ(x)=∑_ppisprime⌊/⌋≤∑_ppisprime=π(x) and (using big O notation) for any ε > 0, ψ(x)≥∑pisprimex1−ε≤p≤xlog⁡p≥∑pisprimex1−ε≤p≤x(1−ε)log⁡x=(1−ε)(π(x)+O(x1−ε))log⁡x.ψ(x)≥∑_x^1-εpisprime≥∑_x^1-εpisprime(1-ε)=(1-ε)(π(x)+O(x^1-ε)) . The next step is to find a useful representation for ψ(x). Let ζ(s) be the Riemann zeta function. It can be shown that ζ(s) is related to the von Mangoldt function Λ(n), and hence to ψ(x), via the relation −ζ′(s)ζ(s)=∑n=1∞Λ(n)n−s.-ζ'(s)/ζ(s)=∑_n=1^∞Λ(n) n^-s . A delicate analysis of this equation and related properties of the zeta function, using the Mellin transform and Perron's formula, shows that for non-integer x the equation ψ(x)=x−log⁡(2π)−∑ρ:ζ(ρ)=0xρρψ(x)=x - log(2π) -∑_ρ: ζ(ρ)=0x^ρ/ρ holds, where the sum is over all zeros (trivial and nontrivial) of the zeta function. This striking formula is one of the so-called explicit formulas of number theory, and is already suggestive of the result we wish to prove, since the term x (claimed to be the correct asymptotic order of ψ(x)) appears on the right-hand side, followed by (presumably) lower-order asymptotic terms. The next step in the proof involves a study of the zeros of the zeta function. The trivial zeros −2, −4, −6, −8, ... can be handled separately: ∑n=1∞12nx2n=−12log⁡(1−1x2),∑_n=1^∞1/2n x^2n=-1/2log(1-1/x^2), which vanishes for large x. The nontrivial zeros, namely those on the critical strip 0 ≤ Re(s) ≤ 1, can potentially be of an asymptotic order comparable to the main term x if Re(ρ) = 1, so we need to show that all zeros have real part strictly less than 1. Non-vanishing on Re(s) =
