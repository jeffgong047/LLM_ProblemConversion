function: The prime number theorem is an asymptotic result. It gives an ineffective bound on π(x) as a direct consequence of the definition of the limit: for all ε > 0, there is an S such that for all x > S, (1−ε)xlog⁡x<π(x)<(1+ε)xlog⁡x.(1-ε)x/ < π(x) < (1+ε)x/ . However, better bounds on π(x) are known, for instance Pierre Dusart's xlog⁡x(1+1log⁡x)<π(x)<xlog⁡x(1+1log⁡x+2.51(log⁡x)2).x/(1+1/) < π(x) < x/(1+1/+2.51/()^2) . The first inequality holds for all x ≥ 599 and the second one for x ≥ 355991.[33] A weaker but sometimes useful bound for x ≥ 55 is[34] xlog⁡x+2<π(x)<xlog⁡x−4.x/+2 < π(x) < x/-4 . In Pierre Dusart's thesis there are stronger versions of this type of inequality that are valid for larger x. Later in 2010, Dusart proved:[35] xlog⁡x−1<π(x)forx≥5393,andπ(x)<xlog⁡x−1.1forx≥60184.x/-1 < π(x) forx≥5393 ,and π(x) < x/-1.1 forx≥60184 . The proof by de la Vallée Poussin implies the following: For every ε > 0, there is an S such that for all x > S, xlog⁡x−(1−ε)<π(x)<xlog⁡x−(1+ε).x/-(1-ε) < π(x) < x/-(1+ε) .
