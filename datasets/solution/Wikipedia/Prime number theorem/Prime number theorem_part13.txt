number: As a consequence of the prime number theorem, one gets an asymptotic expression for the nth prime number, denoted by pn: pn∼nlog⁡n._n. A better approximation is[36] pnn=log⁡n+log⁡log⁡n−1+log⁡log⁡n−2log⁡n−(log⁡log⁡n)2−6log⁡log⁡n+112(log⁡n)2+o(1(log⁡n)2).p_n/n=+log-1+log-2/-(log)^2-6log+11/2()^2+o(1/()^2). Again considering the 2×1017th prime number 8512677386048191063, this gives an estimate of 8512681315554715386; the first 5 digits match and relative error is about 0.00005%. Rosser's theorem states that pn>nlog⁡n._n>n. This can be improved by the following pair of bounds:[34] [37] log⁡n+log⁡log⁡n−1<pnn<log⁡n+log⁡log⁡nforn≥6.+log-1<p_n/n<+log forn≥6.
