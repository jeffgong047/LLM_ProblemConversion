theorem: D. J. Newman gives a quick proof of the prime number theorem (PNT). The proof is "non-elementary" by virtue of relying on complex analysis, but uses only elementary techniques from a first course in the subject: Cauchy's integral formula, Cauchy's integral theorem and estimates of complex integrals. Here is a brief sketch of this proof. See [14] for the complete details. The proof uses the same preliminaries as in the previous section except instead of the function ψψ, the Chebyshev functionϑ(x)=∑p≤xlog⁡p ϑ(x)=∑_p is used, which is obtained by dropping some of the terms from the series for ψψ. It is easy to show that the PNT is equivalent to limx→∞ϑ(x)/x=1lim_x→∞ϑ(x)/x=1. Likewise instead of −ζ′(s)ζ(s)-ζ'(s)/ζ(s) the function Φ(s)=∑p≤xlog⁡pp−sΦ(s)=∑_p p^-s is used, which is obtained by dropping some terms in the series for −ζ′(s)ζ(s)-ζ'(s)/ζ(s). The functions Φ(s)Φ(s) and −ζ′(s)/ζ(s)-ζ'(s)/ζ(s) differ by a function holomorphic on ℜs=1=1. Since, as was shown in the previous section, ζ(s)ζ(s) has no zeroes on the line ℜs=1=1 , Φ(s)−1s−1Φ(s)-1/s-1 has no singularities on ℜs=1=1. One further piece of information needed in Newman's proof, and which is the key to the estimates in his simple method, is that ϑ(x)/xϑ(x)/x is bounded. This is proved using an ingenious and easy method due to Chebyshev. Integration by parts shows how ϑ(x)ϑ(x) and Φ(s)Φ(s) are related. For ℜs>1>1, Φ(s)=∫1∞x−sdϑ(x)=s∫1∞ϑ(x)x−s−1dx=s∫0∞ϑ(et)e−stdt.Φ(s)=∫_1^∞x^-sdϑ(x)=s∫_1^∞ϑ(x)x^-s-1 dx=s∫_0^∞ϑ(e^t)e^-st dt. Newman's method proves the PNT by showing the integral I=∫0∞(ϑ(et)et−1)dt.=∫_0^∞(ϑ(e^t)/e^t-1) dt. converges, and therefore the integrand goes to zero as t→∞→∞, which is the PNT. In general, the convergence of the improper integral does not imply that the integrand goes to zero at infinity, since it may oscillate, but since ϑϑ is increasing, it is easy to show in this case. To show the convergence of I, for ℜz>0>0 let gT(z)=∫0Tf(t)e−ztdt_T(z)=∫_0^Tf(t)e^-zt dt and g(z)=∫0∞f(t)e−ztdt(z)=∫_0^∞f(t)e^-zt dt where f(t)=ϑ(et)et−1(t)=ϑ(e^t)/e^t-1 then limT→∞gT(z)=g(z)=Φ(s)s−1s−1wherez=s−1lim_T→∞g_T(z)=g(z)=Φ(s)/s-1/s-1 where=s-1 which is equal to a function holomorphic on the line ℜz=0=0 . The convergence of the integral I, and thus the PNT, is proved by showing that limT→∞gT(0)=g(0)lim_T→∞g_T(0)=g(0). This involves change of order of limits since it can be written limT→∞limz→0gT(z)=limz→0limT→∞gT(z)lim_T→∞lim_z→0g_T(z)=lim_z→0lim_T→∞g_T(z) and therefore classified as a Tauberian theorem. The difference g(0)−gT(0)(0)-g_T(0) is expressed using Cauchy's integral formula and then shown to be small for T large by estimating the integrand. Fix R>0>0 and δ>0δ>0 such that g(z)(z) is holomorphic in the region where |z|≤Randℜz≥−δ|z|and≥-δ, and let C be the boundary of this region. Since 0 is in the interior of the region, Cauchy's integral formula gives g(0)−gT(0)=12πi∫C(g(z)−gT(z))dzz=12πi∫C(g(z)−gT(z))F(z)dzz(0)-g_T(0)=1/2∫_C(g(z)-g_T(z))dz/z=1/2∫_C(g(z)-g_T(z))F(z)dz/z where F(z)=ezT(1+z2R2)(z)=e^zT(1+z^2/R^2) is the factor introduced by Newman, which does not change the integral since F is entire and F(0)=1(0)=1. To estimate the integral, break the contour C into two parts, C=C++C−=C_++C_- where C+=C∩z|ℜz>0_+=C∩{z | >0} and C−∩ℜz≤0_-∩{≤0}. Then g(0)−gT(0)=∫C+∫T∞H(t,z)dtdz−∫C−∫0TH(t,z)dtdz+∫C−g(z)F(z)dz2πiz(0)-g_T(0)=∫_C_+∫_T^∞H(t,z)dtdz-∫_C_-∫_0^TH(t,z)dtdz+∫_C_-g(z)F(z)dz/2where H(t,z)=f(t)e−tzF(z)/2πi(t,z)=f(t)e^-tzF(z)/2. Since ϑ(x)/xϑ(x)/x, and hence f(t)(t), is bounded, let B be an upper bound for the absolute value of f(t)(t). This bound together with the estimate |F|≤2exp⁡(Tℜz)|ℜz|/R|F|≤2exp(T)||/R for |z|=R|z|=R gives that the first integral in absolute value is ≤B/R/R. The integrand over C−_- in the second integral is entire, so by Cauchy's integral theorem, the contour C−_- can be modified to a semicircle of radius R in the left half-plane without changing the integral, and the same argument as for the first integral gives the absolute value of the second integral is ≤B/R/R. Finally, letting T→∞→∞ , the third integral goes to zero since ezT^zT and hence F goes to zero on the contour. Combining the two estimates and the limit get limsupT→∞|g(0)−gT(0)|≤2BR.lim sup_T→∞|g(0)-g_T(0)|≤2B/R. This holds for any R so limT→∞gT(0)=g(0)lim_T→∞g_T(0)=g(0), and the PNT follows.
