proofs: In the first half of the twentieth century, some mathematicians (notably G. H. Hardy) believed that there exists a hierarchy of proof methods in mathematics depending on what sorts of numbers (integers, reals, complex) a proof requires, and that the prime number theorem (PNT) is a "deep" theorem by virtue of requiring complex analysis.[24] This belief was somewhat shaken by a proof of the PNT based on Wiener's tauberian theorem, though this could be set aside if Wiener's theorem were deemed to have a "depth" equivalent to that of complex variable methods. In March 1948, Atle Selberg established, by "elementary" means, the asymptotic formula ϑ(x)log⁡(x)+∑p≤xlog⁡(p)ϑ(xp)=2xlog⁡(x)+O(x)ϑ(x)log(x)+∑_plog(p) vartheta(x/p)=2xlog(x)+O(x) where ϑ(x)=∑p≤xlog⁡(p)ϑ(x)=∑_plog(p) for primes p.[11] By July of that year, Selberg and Paul Erdős[12] had each obtained elementary proofs of the PNT, both using Selberg's asymptotic formula as a starting point.[24][25] These proofs effectively laid to rest the notion that the PNT was "deep" in that sense, and showed that technically "elementary" methods were more powerful than had been believed to be the case. On the history of the elementary proofs of the PNT, including the Erdős–Selberg priority dispute, see an article by Dorian Goldfeld.[24] There is some debate about the significance of Erdős and Selberg's result. There is no rigorous and widely accepted definition of the notion of elementary proof in number theory, so it is not clear exactly in what sense their proof is "elementary". Although it does not use complex analysis, it is in fact much more technical than the standard proof of PNT. One possible definition of an "elementary" proof is "one that can be carried out in first-order Peano arithmetic." There are number-theoretic statements (for example, the Paris–Harrington theorem) provable using second order but not first-order methods, but such theorems are rare to date. Erdős and Selberg's proof can certainly be formalized in Peano arithmetic, and in 1994, Charalambos Cornaros and Costas Dimitracopoulos proved that their proof can be formalized in a very weak fragment of PA, namely IΔ0 + exp.[26] However, this does not address the question of whether or not the standard proof of PNT can be formalized in PA.
