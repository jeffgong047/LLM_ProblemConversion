Statement: Graph showing ratio of the prime-counting function π(x) to two of its approximations, x / log x and Li(x). As x increases (note x axis is logarithmic), both ratios tend towards 1. The ratio for x / log x converges from above very slowly, while the ratio for Li(x) converges more quickly from below. Log-log plot showing absolute error of x / log x and Li(x), two approximations to the prime-counting function π(x). Unlike the ratio, the difference between π(x) and x / log x increases without bound as x increases. On the other hand, Li(x) − π(x) switches sign infinitely many times. Let π(x) be the prime-counting function defined to be the number of primes less than or equal to x, for any real number x. For example, π(10) = 4 because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that x / log x is a good approximation to π(x) (where log here means the natural logarithm), in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions π(x) and x / log x as x increases without bound is 1: limx→∞π(x)[xlog⁡(x)]=1,lim_x→∞ π(x) / [x/log(x)] =1, known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. Using asymptotic notation this result can be restated as π(x)∼xlog⁡x.π(x)∼x/. This notation (and the theorem) does not say anything about the limit of the difference of the two functions as x increases without bound. Instead, the theorem states that x / log x approximates π(x) in the sense that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as x increases without bound. The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the nth prime number pn satisfies pn∼nlog⁡(n),_nlog(n), the asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as n increases without bound. For example, the 2×1017th prime number is 8512677386048191063,[4] and (2×1017)log(2×1017) rounds to 7967418752291744388, a relative error of about 6.4%. On the other hand, the following asymptotic relations are logically equivalent:[5] limx→∞π(x)log⁡xx=1,limx→∞π(x)log⁡π(x)x=1.lim_x→∞π(x)/x =1, lim_x→∞π(x)logπ(x)/x =1. As outlined below, the prime number theorem is also equivalent to limx→∞ϑ(x)x=limx→∞ψ(x)x=1,lim_x→∞ϑ(x)/x=lim_x→∞ψ(x)/x=1, where ϑ and ψ are the first and the second Chebyshev functions respectively, and to limx→∞M(x)x=0,lim_x→∞M(x)/x=0,[6] where M(x)=∑n≤xμ(n)(x)=∑_nμ(n) is the Mertens function.
