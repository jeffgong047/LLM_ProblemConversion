race: Plot of the function π(x;4,3)−π(x;4,1) pi(x;4,3)-π(x;4,1)} for n ≤ 30000 Although we have in particular π4,1(x)∼π4,3(x),π_4,1(x)∼π_4,3(x) empirically the primes congruent to 3 are more numerous and are nearly always ahead in this "prime number race"; the first reversal occurs at x = 26861.[31]: 1–2 However Littlewood showed in 1914[31]: 2 that there are infinitely many sign changes for the function π4,1(x)−π4,3(x),π_4,1(x)-π_4,3(x) , so the lead in the race switches back and forth infinitely many times. The phenomenon that π4,3(x) is ahead most of the time is called Chebyshev's bias. The prime number race generalizes to other moduli and is the subject of much research; Pál Turán asked whether it is always the case that π(x;a,c) and π(x;b,c) change places when a and b are coprime to c.[32] Granville and Martin give a thorough exposition and survey.[31] Non-asymptotic bounds on the prime-counting
