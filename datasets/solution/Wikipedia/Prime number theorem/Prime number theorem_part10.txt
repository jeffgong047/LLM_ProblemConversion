progressions: Let πd,a(x) denote the number of primes in the arithmetic progression a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ... that are less than x. Dirichlet and Legendre conjectured, and de la Vallée Poussin proved, that if a and d are coprime, then πd,a(x)∼Li⁡(x)φ(d),π_d,a(x)∼Li(x)/φ(d) where φ is Euler's totient function. In other words, the primes are distributed evenly among the residue classes [a] modulo d with gcd(a, d) = 1 . This is stronger than Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (which only states that there is an infinity of primes in each class) and can be proved using similar methods used by Newman for his proof of the prime number theorem.[29] The Siegel–Walfisz theorem gives a good estimate for the distribution of primes in residue classes. Bennett et al. [30] proved the following estimate that has explicit constants A and B (Theorem 1.3): Let d ≥3≥3 be an integer and let a be an integer that is coprime to d. Then there are positive constants A and B such that |πd,a(x)−Li⁡(x)φ(d)|<Ax(log⁡x)2forallx≥B,|π_d,a(x)-%s/%s operatornameLi(x)} varphi(d)}|<A/)^2} forall where A=1840if3≤d≤104andA=1160ifd>104,=1/40} if 3≤10^4 and=1/60} if>10^4 , and B=8⋅109if3≤d≤105andB=exp⁡(0.03d(log⁡d)3)ifd>105.=8·10^9 if 3≤10^5 and=exp(.03{√(d})logd)^3 if>10^5 Prime number
