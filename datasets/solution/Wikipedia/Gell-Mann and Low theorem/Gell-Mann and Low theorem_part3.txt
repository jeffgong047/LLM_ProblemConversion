theorem: Let |Ψ0⟩|Ψ_0⟩ be an eigenstate of H0_0 with energy E0_0 and let the 'interacting' Hamiltonian be H=H0+gV=H_0+gV, where g is a coupling constant and V the interaction term. We define a Hamiltonian Hϵ=H0+e−ϵ|t|gV_ϵ=H_0+e^-ϵ|t|gV which effectively interpolates between H and H0_0 in the limit ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ and |t|→∞|t|→∞. Let UϵI_ denote the evolution operator in the interaction picture. The Gell-Mann and Low theorem asserts that if the limit as ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ of |Ψϵ(±)⟩=UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩|Ψ_ϵ^(±)⟩=U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩/⟨Ψ_0|U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩ exists, then |Ψϵ(±)⟩|Ψ_ϵ^(±)⟩ are eigenstates of H. Note that when applied to, say, the ground-state, the theorem does not guarantee that the evolved state will be a ground state. In other words, level crossing is not excluded.
