Proof: As in the original paper, the theorem is typically proved making use of Dyson's expansion of the evolution operator. Its validity however extends beyond the scope of perturbation theory as has been demonstrated by Molinari. We follow Molinari's method here. Focus on Hϵ_ϵ and let g=eϵθ=e^ϵθ. From Schrödinger's equation for the time-evolution operator iℏ∂t1Uϵ(t1,t2)=Hϵ(t1)Uϵ(t1,t2)ħ∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=H_ϵ(t_1)U_ϵ(t_1,t_2) and the boundary condition Uϵ(t2,t2)=1_ϵ(t_2,t_2)=1 we can formally write Uϵ(t1,t2)=1+1iℏ∫t2t1dt′(H0+eϵ(θ−|t′|)V)Uϵ(t′,t2)._ϵ(t_1,t_2)=1+1/iħ∫_t_2^t_1dt'(H_0+e^ϵ(θ-|t'|)V)U_ϵ(t',t_2). Focus for the moment on the case 0≥t1≥t20_1_2. Through a change of variables τ=t′+θτ=t'+θ we can write Uϵ(t1,t2)=1+1iℏ∫θ+t2θ+t1dτ(H0+eϵτV)Uϵ(τ−θ,t2)._ϵ(t_1,t_2)=1+1/iħ∫_θ+t_2^θ+t_1dτ(H_0+e^ϵτV)U_ϵ(τ-θ,t_2). We therefore have that ∂θUϵ(t1,t2)=ϵg∂gUϵ(t1,t2)=∂t1Uϵ(t1,t2)+∂t2Uϵ(t1,t2).∂_θU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=∂_gU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)+∂_t_2U_ϵ(t_1,t_2). This result can be combined with the Schrödinger equation and its adjoint −iℏ∂t1Uϵ(t2,t1)=Uϵ(t2,t1)Hϵ(t1)-iħ∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_2,t_1)=U_ϵ(t_2,t_1)H_ϵ(t_1) to obtain iℏϵg∂gUϵ(t1,t2)=Hϵ(t1)Uϵ(t1,t2)−Uϵ(t1,t2)Hϵ(t2).ħ∂_gU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=H_ϵ(t_1)U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)-U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)H_ϵ(t_2). The corresponding equation between HϵI,UϵI_,U_ is the same. It can be obtained by pre-multiplying both sides with eiH0t1/ℏ^iH_0t_1/ħ, post-multiplying with eiH0t2/ℏ^iH_0t_2/ħ and making use of UϵI(t1,t2)=eiH0t1/ℏUϵ(t1,t2)e−iH0t2/ℏ._(t_1,t_2)=e^iH_0t_1/ħU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)e^-iH_0t_2/ħ. The other case we are interested in, namely t2≥t1≥0_2_1≥0 can be treated in an analogous fashion and yields an additional minus sign in front of the commutator (we are not concerned here with the case where t1,2_1,2 have mixed signs). In summary, we obtain (Hϵ,t=0−E0±iℏϵg∂g)UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩=0.(H_ϵ,t=0-E_0ħ∂_g)U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩=0. We proceed for the negative-times case. Abbreviating the various operators for clarity iℏϵg∂g(U|Ψ0⟩)=(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩.ħ∂_g(U|Ψ_0⟩)=(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩. Now using the definition of ΨϵΨ_ϵ we differentiate and eliminate derivatives ∂g(U|Ψ0⟩)∂_g(U|Ψ_0⟩) using the above expression, finding iℏϵg∂g|Ψϵ⟩=1⟨Ψ0|U|Ψ0⟩(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩−U|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|U|Ψ0⟩2⟨Ψ0|(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩=(Hϵ−E0)|Ψϵ⟩−|Ψϵ⟩⟨Ψ0|Hϵ−E0|Ψϵ⟩=[Hϵ−E]|Ψϵ⟩.iħ∂_g|Ψ_ϵ⟩ =1/⟨Ψ_0|U|Ψ_0⟩(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩-U|Ψ_0⟩/⟨Ψ_0|U|Ψ_0⟩^2⟨Ψ_0|(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩ =(H_ϵ-E_0)|Ψ_ϵ⟩-|Ψ_ϵ⟩⟨Ψ_0|H_ϵ-E_0|Ψ_ϵ⟩ =[H_ϵ-E]|Ψ_ϵ⟩. where E=E0+⟨Ψ0|Hϵ−H0|Ψϵ⟩=E_0+⟨Ψ_0|H_ϵ-H_0|Ψ_ϵ⟩. We can now let ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ as by assumption the g∂g|Ψϵ⟩∂_g|Ψ_ϵ⟩ in left hand side is finite. We then clearly see that |Ψϵ⟩|Ψ_ϵ⟩ is an eigenstate of H and the proof is complete.
