History: The theorem was proved first by Gell-Mann and Low in 1951, making use of the Dyson series.[1] In 1969, Klaus Hepp provided an alternative derivation for the case where the original Hamiltonian describes free particles and the interaction is norm bounded.[2] In 1989, G. Nenciu and G. Rasche proved it using the adiabatic theorem.[3] A proof that does not rely on the Dyson expansion was given in 2007 by Luca Guido Molinari.[4] Statement of the
