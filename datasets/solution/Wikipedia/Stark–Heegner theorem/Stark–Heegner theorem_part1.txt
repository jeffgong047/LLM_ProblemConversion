Quadratic imaginary number fields with unique factorisation In number theory, the Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem[1] establishes the complete list of the quadratic imaginary number fields whose rings of integers are unique factorization domains. It solves a special case of Gauss's class number problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields that have a given fixed class number. Let Q denote the set of rational numbers, and let d be a square-free integer. The field Q(√d) is a quadratic extension of Q. The class number of Q(√d) is one if and only if the ring of integers of Q(√d) is a principal ideal domain (or, equivalently, a unique factorization domain). The Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem can then be stated as follows: If d < 0, then the class number of Q(√d) is one if and only if d∈−1,−2,−3,−7,−11,−19,−43,−67,−163.∈{ -1,-2,-3,-7,-11,-19,-43,-67,-163 }. These are known as the Heegner numbers. By replacing d with the discriminant D of Q(√d) this list is often written as:[2] D∈−3,−4,−7,−8,−11,−19,−43,−67,−163.∈{-3,-4,-7,-8,-11,-19,-43,-67,-163}.
