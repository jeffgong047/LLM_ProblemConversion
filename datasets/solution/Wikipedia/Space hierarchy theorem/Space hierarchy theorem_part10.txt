Proof: Savitch's theorem shows that NL⊆SPACE(log2⁡n)𝖭𝖫⊆𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(log^2n), while the space hierarchy theorem shows that SPACE(log2⁡n)⊊SPACE(n)𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(log^2n)⊊𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤(n). The result is this corollary along with the fact that TQBF ∉ NL since TQBF is PSPACE-complete. This could also be proven using the non-deterministic space hierarchy theorem to show that NL ⊊ NPSPACE, and using Savitch's theorem to show that PSPACE = NPSPACE. Corollary
