Statement: Formally, a function f:N⟶N:ℕ⟶ℕ is space-constructible if f(n)≥log⁡n(n)≥log n and there exists a Turing machine which computes the function f(n)(n) in space O(f(n))(f(n)) when starting with an input 1n1^n, where 1n1^n represents a string of n consecutive 1s. Most of the common functions that we work with are space-constructible, including polynomials, exponents, and logarithms. For every space-constructible function f:N⟶N:ℕ⟶ℕ, there exists a language L that is decidable in space O(f(n))(f(n)) but not in space o(f(n))(f(n)).
