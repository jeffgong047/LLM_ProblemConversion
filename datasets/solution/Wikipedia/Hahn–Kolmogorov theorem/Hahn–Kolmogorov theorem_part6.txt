Properties: Arbitrary (possibly uncountable) intersections of rings on ΩΩ are still rings on Ω.Ω. If A is a non-empty subset of the powerset P(Ω)𝒫(Ω) of Ω,Ω, then we define the ring generated by A (noted R(A)(A)) as the intersection of all rings containing A.. It is straightforward to see that the ring generated by A is the smallest ring containing A.. For a semi-ring S,, the set of all finite unions of sets in S is the ring generated by S:: R(S)=A:A=⋃i=1nAi,Ai∈S(S)={A:A=⋃_i=1^nA_i,A_i} (One can show that R(S)(S) is equal to the set of all finite disjoint unions of sets in S). A content μμ defined on a semi-ring S can be extended on the ring generated by S.. Such an extension is unique. The extended content can be written: μ(A)=∑i=1nμ(Ai)μ(A)=∑_i=1^nμ(A_i) for A=⋃i=1nAi,=⋃_i=1^nA_i, with the Ai∈S_i disjoint. In addition, it can be proved that μμ is a pre-measure if and only if the extended content is also a pre-measure, and that any pre-measure on R(S)(S) that extends the pre-measure on S is necessarily of this form.
