theorem: Let R be a ring of sets on X and let μ:R→[0,+∞]μ:R→[0,+∞] be a pre-measure on R,, meaning that for all sets A∈R for which there exists a countable decomposition A=⋃i=1∞Ai=⋃_i=1^∞A_i in disjoint sets A1,A2,…∈R,_1,A_2,…, we have μ(A)=∑i=1∞μ(Ai).μ(A)=∑_i=1^∞μ(A_i). Let σ(R)σ(R) be the σσ-algebra generated by R.. The pre-measure condition is a necessary condition for μμ to be the restriction to R of a measure on σ(R).σ(R). The Carathéodory's extension theorem states that it is also sufficient,[3] that is, there exists a measure μ′:σ(R)→[0,+∞]μ^':σ(R)→[0,+∞] such that μ′μ^' is an extension of μ;μ; that is, μ′|R=μ.μ^'|_R=μ. Moreover, if μμ is σσ-finite then the extension μ′μ^' is unique (and also σσ-finite).[4] Proof
