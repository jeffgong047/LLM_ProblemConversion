rationals: This example is a more detailed variation of the above. The rational closed-open interval is any subset of Qℚ of the form [a,b)[a,b), where a,b∈Q,b∈ℚ. Let X be Q∩[0,1)ℚ∩[0,1) and let Σ0Σ_0 be the algebra of all finite unions of rational closed-open intervals contained in Q∩[0,1)ℚ∩[0,1). It is easy to prove that Σ0Σ_0 is, in fact, an algebra. It is also easy to see that the cardinal of every non-empty set in Σ0Σ_0 is ℵ0ℵ_0. Let μ0μ_0 be the counting set function (##) defined in Σ0Σ_0. It is clear that μ0μ_0 is finitely additive and σσ-additive in Σ0Σ_0. Since every non-empty set in Σ0Σ_0 is infinite, then, for every non-empty set A∈Σ0∈Σ_0, μ0(A)=+∞μ_0(A)=+∞ Now, let ΣΣ be the σσ-algebra generated by Σ0Σ_0. It is easy to see that ΣΣ is the σσ-algebra of all subsets of X, and both ## and 2#2# are measures defined on ΣΣ and both are extensions of μ0μ_0. Note that, in this case, the two extensions are σσ-finite, because X is countable. Via Fubini's
