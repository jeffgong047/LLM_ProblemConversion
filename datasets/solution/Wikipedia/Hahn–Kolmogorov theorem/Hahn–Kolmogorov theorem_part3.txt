Comments: This theorem is remarkable for it allows one to construct a measure by first defining it on a small algebra of sets, where its sigma additivity could be easy to verify, and then this theorem guarantees its extension to a sigma-algebra. The proof of this theorem is not trivial, since it requires extending μ0μ_0 from an algebra of sets to a potentially much bigger sigma-algebra, guaranteeing that the extension is unique (if μ0μ_0 is σσ-finite), and moreover that it does not fail to satisfy the sigma-additivity of the original function.
