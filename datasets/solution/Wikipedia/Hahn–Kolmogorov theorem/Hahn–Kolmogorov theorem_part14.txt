theorem: Another example is closely related to the failure of some forms of Fubini's theorem for spaces that are not σ-finite. Suppose that X is the unit interval with Lebesgue measure and Y is the unit interval with the discrete counting measure. Let the ring R be generated by products A×B where A is Lebesgue measurable and B is any subset, and give this set the measure μ(A)card(B)μ(A)card(B). This has a very large number of different extensions to a measure; for example: The measure of a subset is the sum of the measures of its horizontal sections. This is the smallest possible extension. Here the diagonal has measure 0. The measure of a subset is ∫01n(x)dx∫_0^1n(x)dx where n(x)(x) is the number of points of the subset with given x-coordinate. The diagonal has measure 1. The Carathéodory extension, which is the largest possible extension. Any subset of finite measure is contained in some union of a countable number of horizontal lines. In particular the diagonal has measure infinity. See
