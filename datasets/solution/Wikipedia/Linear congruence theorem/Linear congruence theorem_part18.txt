interpolation: A special case of Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is Lagrange interpolation. For this, consider k monic polynomials of degree one: Pi(X)=X−xi._i(X)=X-x_i. They are pairwise coprime if the xi_i are all different. The remainder of the division by Pi(X)_i(X) of a polynomial P(X)(X) is P(xi)(x_i), by the polynomial remainder theorem. Now, let A1,…,Ak_1,…,A_k be constants (polynomials of degree 0) in K.. Both Lagrange interpolation and Chinese remainder theorem assert the existence of a unique polynomial P(X),(X), of degree less than k such that P(xi)=Ai,(x_i)=A_i, for every i.. Lagrange interpolation formula is exactly the result, in this case, of the above construction of the solution. More precisely, let Q(X)=∏i=1k(X−xi)Qi(X)=Q(X)X−xi.Q(X) =∏_i=1^k(X-x_i) Q_i(X) =Q(X)/X-x_i. The partial fraction decomposition of 1Q(X)1/Q(X) is 1Q(X)=∑i=1k1Qi(xi)(X−xi).1/Q(X)=∑_i=1^k1/Q_i(x_i)(X-x_i). In fact, reducing the right-hand side to a common denominator one gets ∑i=1k1Qi(xi)(X−xi)=1Q(X)∑i=1kQi(X)Qi(xi),∑_i=1^k1/Q_i(x_i)(X-x_i)=1/Q(X)∑_i=1^kQ_i(X)/Q_i(x_i), and the numerator is equal to one, as being a polynomial of degree less than k,, which takes the value one for k different values of X.. Using the above general formula, we get the Lagrange interpolation formula: P(X)=∑i=1kAiQi(X)Qi(xi).(X)=∑_i=1^kA_iQ_i(X)/Q_i(x_i). Hermite
