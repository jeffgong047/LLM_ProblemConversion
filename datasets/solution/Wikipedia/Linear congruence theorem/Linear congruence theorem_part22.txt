idempotents: Let I1,I2,…,Ik_1,I_2,…,I_k be pairwise coprime two-sided ideals with ⋂i=1kIi=0,⋂_i=1^kI_i=0, and φ:R→(R/I1)×⋯×(R/Ik)φ:R→(R/I_1)×⋯×(R/I_k) be the isomorphism defined above. Let fi=(0,…,1,…,0)_i=(0,…,1,…,0) be the element of (R/I1)×⋯×(R/Ik)(R/I_1)×⋯×(R/I_k) whose components are all 0 except the i th which is 1, and ei=φ−1(fi)._i=φ^-1(f_i). The ei_i are central idempotents that are pairwise orthogonal; this means, in particular, that ei2=ei_i^2=e_i and eiej=ejei=0_ie_j=e_je_i=0 for every i and j. Moreover, one has e1+⋯+en=1,_1+⋯+e_n=1, and Ii=R(1−ei)._i=R(1-e_i). In summary, this generalized Chinese remainder theorem is the equivalence between giving pairwise coprime two-sided ideals with a zero intersection, and giving central and pairwise orthogonal idempotents that sum to 1.[19]
