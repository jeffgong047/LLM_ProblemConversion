interpolation: Hermite interpolation is an application of the Chinese remainder theorem for univariate polynomials, which may involve moduli of arbitrary degrees (Lagrange interpolation involves only moduli of degree one). The problem consists of finding a polynomial of the least possible degree, such that the polynomial and its first derivatives take given values at some fixed points. More precisely, let x1,…,xk_1,…,x_k be k elements of the ground field K,, and, for i=1,…,k,=1,…,k, let ai,0,ai,1,…,ai,ri−1_i,0,a_i,1,…,a_i,r_i-1 be the values of the first ri_i derivatives of the sought polynomial at xi_i (including the 0th derivative, which is the value of the polynomial itself). The problem is to find a polynomial P(X)(X) such that its j th derivative takes the value ai,j_i,j at xi,_i, for i=1,…,k=1,…,k and j=0,…,rj.=0,…,r_j. Consider the polynomial Pi(X)=∑j=0ri−1ai,jj!(X−xi)j._i(X)=∑_j=0^r_i-1a_i,j/j!(X-x_i)^j. This is the Taylor polynomial of order ri−1_i-1 at xi_i, of the unknown polynomial P(X).(X). Therefore, we must have P(X)≡Pi(X)(mod(X−xi)ri).(X)_i(X)(X-x_i)^r_i. Conversely, any polynomial P(X)(X) that satisfies these k congruences, in particular verifies, for any i=1,…,k=1,…,k P(X)=Pi(X)+o(X−xi)ri−1(X)=P_i(X)+o(X-x_i)^r_i-1 therefore Pi(X)_i(X) is its Taylor polynomial of order ri−1_i-1 at xi_i, that is, P(X)(X) solves the initial Hermite interpolation problem. The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that there exists exactly one polynomial of degree less than the sum of the ri,_i, which satisfies these k congruences. There are several ways for computing the solution P(X).(X). One may use the method described at the beginning of § Over univariate polynomial rings and Euclidean domains. One may also use the constructions given in § Existence (constructive proof) or § Existence (direct proof). Generalization to non-coprime
