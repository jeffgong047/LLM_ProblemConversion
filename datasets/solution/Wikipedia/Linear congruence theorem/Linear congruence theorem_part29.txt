theorem: Dedekind's theorem on the linear independence of characters. Let M be a monoid and k an integral domain, viewed as a monoid by considering the multiplication on k. Then any finite family ( fi )i∈I of distinct monoid homomorphisms fi : M → k is linearly independent. In other words, every family (αi)i∈I of elements αi ∈ k satisfying ∑i∈Iαifi=0∑_iα_if_i=0 must be equal to the family (0)i∈I. Proof. First assume that k is a field, otherwise, replace the integral domain k by its quotient field, and nothing will change. We can linearly extend the monoid homomorphisms fi : M → k to k-algebra homomorphisms Fi : k[M] → k, where k[M] is the monoid ring of M over k. Then, by linearity, the condition ∑i∈Iαifi=0,∑_iα_if_i=0, yields ∑i∈IαiFi=0.∑_iα_iF_i=0. Next, for i, j ∈ I; i ≠ j the two k-linear maps Fi : k[M] → k and Fj : k[M] → k are not proportional to each other. Otherwise fi and fj would also be proportional, and thus equal since as monoid homomorphisms they satisfy: fi (1) = 1 = fj (1), which contradicts the assumption that they are distinct. Therefore, the kernels Ker Fi and Ker Fj are distinct. Since k[M]/Ker Fi ≅ Fi (k[M]) = k is a field, Ker Fi is a maximal ideal of k[M] for every i in I. Because they are distinct and maximal the ideals Ker Fi and Ker Fj are coprime whenever i ≠ j. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (for general rings) yields an isomorphism: ϕ:k[M]/K→∏i∈Ik[M]/KerFiϕ(x+K)=(x+KerFi)i∈Iϕ:k[M]/K →∏_ik[M]/KerF_i ϕ(x+K) =(x+KerF_i)_i where K=∏i∈IKerFi=⋂i∈IKerFi.=∏_iKerF_i=⋂_iKerF_i. Consequently, the map Φ:k[M]→∏i∈Ik[M]/KerFiΦ(x)=(x+KerFi)i∈IΦ:k[M] →∏_ik[M]/KerF_i Φ(x) =(x+KerF_i)_i is surjective. Under the isomorphisms k[M]/Ker Fi → Fi (k[M]) = k, the map Φ corresponds to: ψ:k[M]→∏i∈Ikψ(x)=[Fi(x)]i∈Iψ:k[M] →∏_ik ψ(x) =[F_i(x)]_i Now, ∑i∈IαiFi=0∑_iα_iF_i=0 yields ∑i∈Iαiui=0∑_iα_iu_i=0 for every vector (ui)i∈I in the image of the map ψ. Since ψ is surjective, this means that ∑i∈Iαiui=0∑_iα_iu_i=0 for every vector (ui)i∈I∈∏i∈Ik.(u_i)_i∈∏_ik. Consequently, (αi)i∈I = (0)i∈I. QED. See
