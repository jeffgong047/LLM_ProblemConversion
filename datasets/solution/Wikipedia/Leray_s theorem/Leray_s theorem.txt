Relates abstract sheaf cohomology with Čech cohomology
In algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, Leray's theorem (so named after Jean Leray) relates abstract sheaf cohomology with Čech cohomology.
Let  Fℱ be a sheaf on a topological space X and  U𝒰 an open cover of X.. If  Fℱ is acyclic on every finite intersection of elements of  U𝒰, then   

Hˇq(U,F)=Hˇq(X,F),Ȟ^q(𝒰,ℱ)=Ȟ^q(X,ℱ),
where  Hˇq(U,F)Ȟ^q(𝒰,ℱ) is the q-th Čech cohomology group of  Fℱ with respect to the open cover U.𝒰.
