Examples: There are several natural constructions that give connected algebraic groups that are neither affine nor complete. If C is a curve with an effective divisor m, then it has an associated generalized Jacobian Jm. This is a commutative algebraic group that maps onto the Jacobian variety J0 of C with affine kernel. So J is an extension of an abelian variety by an affine algebraic group. In general this extension does not split. The reduced connected component of the relative Picard scheme of a proper scheme over a perfect field is an algebraic group, which is in general neither affine nor proper. The connected component of the closed fiber of a Neron model over a discrete valuation ring is an algebraic group, which is in general neither affine nor proper. For analytic groups some of the obvious analogs of Chevalley's theorem fail. For example, the product of the additive group C and any elliptic curve has a dense collection of closed (analytic but not algebraic) subgroups isomorphic to C so there is no unique "maximal affine subgroup", while the product of two copies of the multiplicative group C* is isomorphic (analytically but not algebraically) to a non-split extension of any given elliptic curve by C.
