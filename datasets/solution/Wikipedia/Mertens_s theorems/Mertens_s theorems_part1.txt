For Mertens's theorem on convergence of Cauchy products of series, see Cauchy product § Convergence and Mertens' theorem. This article utilizes technical mathematical notation for logarithms. All instances of log(x) without a subscript base should be interpreted as a natural logarithm, commonly notated as ln(x) or loge(x). This article includes a list of general references, but it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations. Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations.
