Proof: The main step in the proof of Mertens' second theorem is O(n)+nlog⁡n=log⁡n!=∑pk≤n⌊n/pk⌋log⁡p=∑pk≤n(npk+O(1))log⁡p=n∑pk≤nlog⁡ppk+O(n)(n)+n=!=∑_p^k/p^k⌋=∑_p^k(n/p^k+O(1))=n∑_p^k/p^kO(n) where the last equality needs ∑pk≤nlog⁡p=O(n)∑_p^k=O(n) which follows from ∑p∈(n,2n]log⁡p≤log⁡(2nn)=O(n)∑_p∈(n,2n]≤log2n=O(n). Thus, we have proved that ∑pk≤nlog⁡ppk=log⁡n+O(1)∑_p^k/p^k=+O(1). Since the sum over prime powers with k≥2≥2 converges, this implies ∑p≤nlog⁡pp=log⁡n+O(1)∑_p/p=+O(1). A partial summation yields ∑p≤n1p=log⁡log⁡n+M+O(1/log⁡n)∑_p1/p=log+M+O(1/). Changes in
