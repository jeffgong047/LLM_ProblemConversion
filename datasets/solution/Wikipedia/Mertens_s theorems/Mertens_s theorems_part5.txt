sign: In a paper [2] on the growth rate of the sum-of-divisors function published in 1983, Guy Robin proved that in Mertens' 2nd theorem the difference ∑p≤n1p−log⁡log⁡n−M∑_p1/p-log-M changes sign infinitely often, and that in Mertens' 3rd theorem the difference log⁡n∏p≤n(1−1p)−e−γ∏_p(1-1/p)-e^-γ changes sign infinitely often. Robin's results are analogous to Littlewood's famous theorem that the difference π(x) − li(x) changes sign infinitely often. No analog of the Skewes number (an upper bound on the first natural number x for which π(x) > li(x)) is known in the case of Mertens' 2nd and 3rd theorems. Relation to the prime number
