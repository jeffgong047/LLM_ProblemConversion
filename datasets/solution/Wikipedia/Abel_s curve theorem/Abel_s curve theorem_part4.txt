surface: We provide an analytic construction of the Abel-Jacobi map on compact Riemann surfaces. Let M denotes a compact Riemann surface of genus g>0>0. Let a1,...,ag,b1,...,bg{a_1,...,a_g,b_1,...,b_g} be a canonical homology basis on M, and ζ1,...,ζg{ζ_1,...,ζ_g} the dual basis for H1(M)ℋ^1(M), which is a g dimensional complex vector space consists of holomorphic differential forms. Dual basis we mean ∫akζj=δjk∫_a_kζ_j=δ_jk, for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g. We can form a symmetric matrix whose entries are ∫bkζj∫_b_kζ_j, for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g. Let L be the lattice generated by the 2g2g-columns of the g×2g×2g matrix whose entries consists of ∫ckζj∫_c_kζ_j for j,k=1,...,g,k=1,...,g where ck∈ak,bk_k∈{a_k,b_k}. We call J(M)=Cg/L(M)(M)=ℂ^g/L(M) the Jacobian variety of M which is a compact, commutative g-dimensional complex Lie group. We can define a map φ:M→J(M)φ:M(M) by choosing a point P0∈M_0 and setting φ(P)=(∫P0Pζ1,...,∫P0Pζg).φ(P)=(∫_P_0^Pζ_1,...,∫_P_0^Pζ_g). which is a well-defined holomorphic mapping with rank 1 (maximal rank). Then we can naturally extend this to a mapping of divisor classes; If we denote Div(M)Div(M) the divisor class group of M then define a map φ:Div(M)→J(M)φ:Div(M)(M) by setting φ(D)=∑j=1rφ(Pj)−∑j=1sφ(Qj),D=P1⋯Pr/Q1⋯Qs.φ(D)=∑_j=1^rφ(P_j)-∑_j=1^sφ(Q_j),=P_1_r/Q_1_s. Note that if r=s=s then this map is independent of the choice of the base point so we can define the base point independent map φ0:Div(0)(M)→J(M)φ_0:Div^(0)(M)(M) where Div(0)(M)Div^(0)(M) denotes the divisors of degree zero of M. The below Abel's theorem show that the kernel of the map φ0φ_0 is precisely the subgroup of principal divisors. Together with the Jacobi inversion problem, we can say that As a group, J(M)(M) is isomorphic to the group of divisors of degree zero modulo its subgroup of principal divisors. Abel–Jacobi
