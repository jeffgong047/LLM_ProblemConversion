manifold: Let M be a smooth compact manifold. Let π=π1(M)π=π_1(M) be its fundamental group. Let f:π→πab:π→π^ab be its abelianisation map. Let tor=tor⁡(πab)tor=tor(π^ab) be the torsion subgroup of πabπ^ab. Let g:πab→πab/tor:π^ab→π^ab/tor be the quotient by torsion. If M is a surface, πab/torπ^ab/tor is non-canonically isomorphic to Z2gℤ^2g, where g is the genus; more generally, πab/torπ^ab/tor is non-canonically isomorphic to Zbℤ^b, where b is the first Betti number. Let φ=g∘f:π→Zbφ=g:π→ℤ^b be the composite homomorphism. Definition. The cover M¯M̅ of the manifold M corresponding to the subgroup ker⁡(φ)⊂π(φ)⊂π is called the universal (or maximal) free abelian cover. Now assume M has a Riemannian metric. Let E be the space of harmonic 1-forms on M, with dual E∗^* canonically identified with H1(M,R)_1(M,ℝ). By integrating an integral harmonic 1-form along paths from a basepoint x0∈M_0, we obtain a map to the circle R/Z=S1ℝ/ℤ=S^1. Similarly, in order to define a map M→H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R_1(M,ℝ)/H_1(M,ℤ)_ℝ without choosing a basis for cohomology, we argue as follows. Let x be a point in the universal cover M M̃ of M. Thus x is represented by a point of M together with a path c from x0_0 to it. By integrating along the path c, we obtain a linear form on E: h→∫ch.→∫_ch. This gives rise a map M →E∗=H1(M,R),M̃^*=H_1(M,ℝ), which, furthermore, descends to a map A¯M:M¯→E∗c↦(h↦∫ch)A_M:M^* c↦(h↦∫_ch) where M¯M is the universal free abelian cover. Definition. The Jacobi variety (Jacobi torus) of M is the torus J1(M)=H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R._1(M)=H_1(M,ℝ)/H_1(M,ℤ)_ℝ. Definition. The Abel–Jacobi map AM:M→J1(M),_M:M_1(M), is obtained from the map above by passing to quotients. The Abel–Jacobi map is unique up to translations of the Jacobi torus. The map has applications in Systolic geometry. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold shows up in the large time asymptotics of the heat kernel on a periodic manifold (Kotani & Sunada (2000) and Sunada (2012)). In much the same way, one can define a graph-theoretic analogue of Abel–Jacobi map as a piecewise-linear map from a finite graph into a flat torus (or a Cayley graph associated with a finite abelian group), which is closely related to asymptotic behaviors of random walks on crystal lattices, and can be used for design of crystal structures.
