Proof: Suppose U=u1,…,um={u_1,…,u_m} and W=w1,…,wn={w_1,…,w_n}. We wish to show that m≤n, and that after rearranging the wj_j if necessary, the set u1,…,um,wm+1,…,wn{u_1,…,u_m,w_m+1,…,w_n} spans V. We proceed by induction on m. For the base case, suppose m is zero. In this case, the claim holds because there are no vectors ui_i, and the set w1,…,wn{w_1,…,w_n} spans V by hypothesis. For the inductive step, assume the proposition is true for m−1-1. By the inductive hypothesis we may reorder the wi_i so that u1,…,um−1,wm,…,wn{u_1,…,u_m-1,w_m,…,w_n} spans V. Since um∈V_m, there exist coefficients μ1,…,μnμ_1,…,μ_n such that um=∑j=1m−1μjuj+∑j=mnμjwj_m=∑_j=1^m-1μ_ju_j+∑_j=m^nμ_jw_j. At least one of μm,…,μn{μ_m,…,μ_n} must be non-zero, since otherwise this equality would contradict the linear independence of u1,…,um{u_1,…,u_m}; it follows that m≤n. By reordering the μmwm,…,μnwnμ_mw_m,…,μ_nw_n if necessary, we may assume that μmμ_m is nonzero. Therefore, we have wm=1μm(um−∑j=1m−1μjuj−∑j=m+1nμjwj)_m=1/μ_m(u_m-∑_j=1^m-1μ_ju_j-∑_j=m+1^nμ_jw_j). In other words, wm_m is in the span of u1,…,um,wm+1,…,wn{u_1,…,u_m,w_m+1,…,w_n}. Since this span contains each of the vectors u1,…,um−1,wm,wm+1,…,wn_1,…,u_m-1,w_m,w_m+1,…,w_n, by the inductive hypothesis it contains V.
