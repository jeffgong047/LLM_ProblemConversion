theorem: Let μ be an ergodic invariant measure on X and C a cocycle of the dynamical system such that for each t ∈ T, the maps x→log⁡‖C(x,t)‖→logC(x,t) and x→log⁡‖C(x,t)−1‖→logC(x,t)^-1 are L1-integrable with respect to μ. Then for μ-almost all x and each non-zero vector u ∈ Rn the limit λ=limt→∞1tlog⁡‖C(x,t)u‖‖u‖λ=lim_t→∞1logC(x,t)uu exists and assumes, depending on u but not on x, up to n different values. These are the Lyapunov exponents. Further, if λ1 > ... > λm are the different limits then there are subspaces Rn = R1 ⊃ ... ⊃ Rm ⊃ Rm+1 = {0}, depending on x, such that the limit is λi for u ∈ Ri \ Ri+1 and i = 1, ..., m. The values of the Lyapunov exponents are invariant with respect to a wide range of coordinate transformations. Suppose that g : X → X is a one-to-one map such that ∂g/∂x/ and its inverse exist; then the values of the Lyapunov exponents do not change. Additive versus multiplicative ergodic
