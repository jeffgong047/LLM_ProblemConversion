Cocycles: The multiplicative ergodic theorem is stated in terms of matrix cocycles of a dynamical system. The theorem states conditions for the existence of the defining limits and describes the Lyapunov exponents. It does not address the rate of convergence. A cocycle of an autonomous dynamical system X is a map C : X×T → Rn×n satisfying C(x,0)=Inforallx∈X(x,0)=I_n for all x C(x,t+s)=C(x(t),s)C(x,t)forallx∈Xandt,s∈T(x,t+s)=C(x(t),s) C(x,t) for all x and t,s where X and T (with T = Z⁺ or T = R⁺) are the phase space and the time range, respectively, of the dynamical system, and In is the n-dimensional unit matrix. The dimension n of the matrices C is not related to the phase space X.
