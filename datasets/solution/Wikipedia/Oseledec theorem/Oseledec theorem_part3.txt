Examples: A prominent example of a cocycle is given by the matrix Jt in the theory of Lyapunov exponents. In this special case, the dimension n of the matrices is the same as the dimension of the manifold X. For any cocycle C, the determinant det C(x, t) is a one-dimensional cocycle. Statement of the
