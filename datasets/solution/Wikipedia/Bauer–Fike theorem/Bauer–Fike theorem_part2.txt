setup: In what follows we assume that: A ∈ Cn,n is a diagonalizable matrix; V ∈ Cn,n is the non-singular eigenvector matrix such that A = VΛV −1, where Λ is a diagonal matrix. If X ∈ Cn,n is invertible, its condition number in p-norm is denoted by κp(X) and defined by: κp(X)=‖X‖p‖X−1‖p.κ_p(X)=X_pX^-1_p. The Bauer–Fike
