Bound: Both formulations of Bauer–Fike theorem yield an absolute bound. The following corollary is useful whenever a relative bound is needed: Corollary. Suppose A is invertible and that μ is an eigenvalue of A + δA. Then there exists λ ∈ Λ(A) such that: |λ−μ||λ|≤κp(V)‖A−1δA‖p|λ-μ|/|λ|≤κ_p(V)A^-1_p Note. ||A−1δA|| can be formally viewed as the relative variation of A, just as |λ − μ|/|λ| is the relative variation of λ. Proof. Since μ is an eigenvalue of A + δA and det(A) ≠ 0, by multiplying by −A−1 from left we have: −A−1(A+δA)v=−μA−1v.-A^-1(A+)v=-^-1v. If we set: Aa=μA−1,(δA)a=−A−1δA^a=^-1, ()^a=-A^-1 then we have: (Aa+(δA)a−I)v=0(A^a+()^a-I)v=0 which means that 1 is an eigenvalue of Aa + (δA)a, with v as an eigenvector. Now, the eigenvalues of Aa are μ/λi, while it has the same eigenvector matrix as A. Applying the Bauer–Fike theorem to Aa + (δA)a with eigenvalue 1, gives us: minλ∈Λ(A)|μλ−1|=minλ∈Λ(A)|λ−μ||λ|≤κp(V)‖A−1δA‖pmin_λ∈Λ(A)|μ/λ-1|=min_λ∈Λ(A)|λ-μ|/|λ|≤κ_p(V)A^-1_p The Case of Normal
