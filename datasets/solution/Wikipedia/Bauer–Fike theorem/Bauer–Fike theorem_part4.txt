Formulation: The theorem can also be reformulated to better suit numerical methods. In fact, dealing with real eigensystem problems, one often has an exact matrix A, but knows only an approximate eigenvalue-eigenvector couple, (λa, va ) and needs to bound the error. The following version comes in help. Bauer–Fike Theorem (Alternate Formulation). Let (λa, va ) be an approximate eigenvalue-eigenvector couple, and r = Ava − λava. Then there exists λ ∈ Λ(A) such that: |λ−λa|≤κp(V)‖r‖p‖va‖p|λ-λ^a|≤κ_p(V)r_p/v^a_p Proof. We can suppose λa ∉ Λ(A), otherwise take λ = λa and the result is trivially true since κp(V) ≥ 1. So (A − λaI)−1 exists, so we can write: va=(A−λaI)−1r=V(D−λaI)−1V−1rv^a=(A-λ^aI)^-1r=V(D-λ^aI)^-1V^-1r since A is diagonalizable; taking the p-norm of both sides, we obtain: ‖va‖p=‖V(D−λaI)−1V−1r‖p≤‖V‖p‖(D−λaI)−1‖p‖V−1‖p‖r‖p=κp(V)‖(D−λaI)−1‖p‖r‖p.v^a_p=V(D-λ^aI)^-1V^-1r_p≤V_p(D-λ^aI)^-1_pV^-1_pr_p=κ_p(V)(D-λ^aI)^-1_pr_p. However (D−λaI)−1(D-λ^aI)^-1 is a diagonal matrix and its p-norm is easily computed: ‖(D−λaI)−1‖p=max‖x‖p≠0‖(D−λaI)−1x‖p‖x‖p=maxλ∈σ(A)1|λ−λa|=1minλ∈σ(A)|λ−λa|(D-λ^aI)^-1_p=max_x_p≠0(D-λ^aI)^-1x_p/x_p=max_λ∈σ(A)1/|λ-λ^a|=1/min_λ∈σ(A)|λ-λ^a| whence: minλ∈λ(A)|λ−λa|≤κp(V)‖r‖p‖va‖p.min_λ∈λ(A)|λ-λ^a|≤κ_p(V)r_p/v^a_p.
