Matrices: If A is normal, V is a unitary matrix, therefore: ‖V‖2=‖V−1‖2=1,V_2=V^-1_2=1, so that κ2(V) = 1. The Bauer–Fike theorem then becomes: ∃λ∈Λ(A):|λ−μ|≤‖δA‖2∃λ∈Λ(A): |λ-μ|≤_2 Or in alternate formulation: ∃λ∈Λ(A):|λ−λa|≤‖r‖2‖va‖2∃λ∈Λ(A): |λ-λ^a|≤r_2/v^a_2 which obviously remains true if A is a Hermitian matrix. In this case, however, a much stronger result holds, known as the Weyl's theorem on eigenvalues. In the hermitian case one can also restate the Bauer–Fike theorem in the form that the map A ↦ Λ(A) that maps a matrix to its spectrum is a non-expansive function with respect to the Hausdorff distance on the set of compact subsets of C.
