Statement: Let X and Y be Banach spaces, T:D(T)→Y:D(T) a closed linear operator whose domain D(T)(T) is dense in X,, and T′' the transpose of T. The theorem asserts that the following conditions are equivalent: R(T),(T), the range of T,, is closed in Y.. R(T′),(T'), the range of T′,', is closed in X′,', the dual of X.. R(T)=N(T′)⊥=y∈Y:⟨x∗,y⟩=0forallx∗∈N(T′).(T)=N(T')^⊥={y:^*,y⟩=0 forall^*(T')}. R(T′)=N(T)⊥=x∗∈X′:⟨x∗,y⟩=0forally∈N(T).(T')=N(T)^⊥={x^*':^*,y⟩=0 forall(T)}. Where N(T)(T) and N(T′)(T') are the null space of T and T′', respectively.
