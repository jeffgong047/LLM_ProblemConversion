statement: Given arities m and n, for every Turing Machine TMxTM_x of arity m+n+n and for all possible values of inputs y1,…,ym_1,…,y_m, there exists a Turing machine TMkTM_k of arity n, such that ∀z1,…,zn:TMx(y1,…,ym,z1,…,zn)=TMk(z1,…,zn)._1,…,z_n:TM_x(y_1,…,y_m,z_1,…,z_n)=TM_k(z_1,…,z_n). Furthermore, there is a Turing machine S that allows k to be calculated from x and y; it is denoted k=Snm(x,y1,…,ym)=S_n^m(x,y_1,…,y_m). Informally, S finds the Turing Machine TMkTM_k that is the result of hardcoding the values of y into TMxTM_x. The result generalizes to any Turing-complete computing model.
