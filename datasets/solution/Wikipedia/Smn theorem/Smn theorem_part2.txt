Details: The basic form of the theorem applies to functions of two arguments (Nies 2009, p. 6). Given a Gödel numbering φφ of recursive functions, there is a primitive recursive function s of two arguments with the following property: for every Gödel number p of a partial computable function f with two arguments, the expressions φs(p,x)(y)φ_s(p,x)(y) and f(x,y)(x,y) are defined for the same combinations of natural numbers x and y, and their values are equal for any such combination. In other words, the following extensional equality of functions holds for every x: φs(p,x)≃λy.φp(x,y).φ_s(p,x)≃.φ_p(x,y). More generally, for any m, n > 0, there exists a primitive recursive function Snm_n^m of m + 1 arguments that behaves as follows: for every Gödel number p of a partial computable function with m + n arguments, and all values of x1, …, xm: φSnm(p,x1,…,xm)≃λy1,…,yn.φp(x1,…,xm,y1,…,yn).φ_S_n^m(p,x_1,…,x_m)≃_1,…,y_n.φ_p(x_1,…,x_m,y_1,…,y_n). The function s described above can be taken to be S11_1^1. Formal
