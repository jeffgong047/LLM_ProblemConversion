examples: For a finitely generated group G we have e(G)=0(G)=0 if and only if G is finite. For the infinite cyclic group Zℤ we have e(Z)=2.(ℤ)=2. For the free abelian group of rank two Z2ℤ^2 we have e(Z2)=1.(ℤ^2)=1. For a free group F(X)(X) where 1<|X|<∞1<|X|<∞ we have e(F(X))=∞(F(X))=∞. Freudenthal-Hopf
