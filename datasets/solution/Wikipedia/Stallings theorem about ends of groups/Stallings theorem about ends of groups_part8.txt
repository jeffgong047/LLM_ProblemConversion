groups: If G=H∗K=H*K where H and K are nontrivial finitely generated groups then the Cayley graph of G has at least one essential cut and hence e(G)>1(G)>1. Indeed, let X and Y be finite generating sets for H and K accordingly so that S=X∪Y=X is a finite generating set for G and let Γ=Γ(G,S)Γ=Γ(G,S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. Let A consist of the trivial element and all the elements of G whose normal form expressions for G=H∗K=H*K starts with a nontrivial element of H. Thus A∗^* consists of all elements of G whose normal form expressions for G=H∗K=H*K starts with a nontrivial element of K. It is not hard to see that (A,A∗)(A,A^*) is an essential cut in Γ so that e(G)>1(G)>1. A more precise version of this argument shows that for a finitely generated group G: If G=H∗CK=H*_CK is a free product with amalgamation where C is a finite group such that C≠H and C≠K then H and K are finitely generated and e(G)>1(G)>1 . If G=⟨H,t|t−1C1t=C2⟩=,t|t^-1C_1t=C_2⟩ is an HNN-extension where C1_1, C2_2 are isomorphic finite subgroups of H then G is a finitely generated group and e(G)>1(G)>1. Stallings' theorem shows that the converse is also true. Formal statement of Stallings'
