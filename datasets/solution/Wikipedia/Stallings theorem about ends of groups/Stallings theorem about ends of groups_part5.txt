theorems: Hans Freudenthal[3] and independently Heinz Hopf[4] established in the 1940s the following two facts: For any finitely generated group G we have e(G)∈0,1,2,∞(G)∈{0,1,2,∞}. For any finitely generated group G we have e(G)=2(G)=2 if and only if G is virtually infinite cyclic (that is, G contains an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index). Charles T. C. Wall proved in 1967 the following complementary fact:[5] A group G is virtually infinite cyclic if and only if it has a finite normal subgroup W such that G/W/W is either infinite cyclic or infinite dihedral.
