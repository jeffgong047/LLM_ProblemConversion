graphs: Main article: End (graph theory) Let ΓΓ be a connected graph where the degree of every vertex is finite. One can view ΓΓ as a topological space by giving it the natural structure of a one-dimensional cell complex. Then the ends of ΓΓ are the ends of this topological space. A more explicit definition of the number of ends of a graph is presented below for completeness. Let n⩾0⩾0 be a non-negative integer. The graph ΓΓ is said to satisfy e(Γ)⩽n(Γ) if for every finite collection F of edges of ΓΓ the graph Γ−FΓ-F has at most n infinite connected components. By definition, e(Γ)=m(Γ)=m if e(Γ)⩽m(Γ) and if for every 0⩽n<m0<m the statement e(Γ)⩽n(Γ) is false. Thus e(Γ)=m(Γ)=m if m is the smallest nonnegative integer n such that e(Γ)⩽n(Γ). If there does not exist an integer n⩾0⩾0 such that e(Γ)⩽n(Γ), put e(Γ)=∞(Γ)=∞. The number e(Γ)(Γ) is called the number of ends of ΓΓ. Informally, e(Γ)(Γ) is the number of "connected components at infinity" of ΓΓ. If e(Γ)=m<∞(Γ)=m<∞, then for any finite set F of edges of ΓΓ there exists a finite set K of edges of ΓΓ with F⊆K such that Γ−FΓ-F has exactly m infinite connected components. If e(Γ)=∞(Γ)=∞, then for any finite set F of edges of ΓΓ and for any integer n⩾0⩾0 there exists a finite set K of edges of ΓΓ with F⊆K such that Γ−KΓ-K has at least n infinite connected components.
