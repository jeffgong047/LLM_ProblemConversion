theorem: Let G be a finitely generated group. Then e(G)>1(G)>1 if and only if one of the following holds: The group G admits a splitting G=H∗CK=H*_CK as a free product with amalgamation where C is a finite group such that C≠H and C≠K. The group G is an HNN extension G=⟨H,t|t−1C1t=C2⟩=,t|t^-1C_1t=C_2⟩ where and C1_1, C2_2 are isomorphic finite subgroups of H. In the language of Bass–Serre theory this result can be restated as follows: For a finitely generated group G we have e(G)>1(G)>1 if and only if G admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed vertex) action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions. For the case where G is a torsion-free finitely generated group, Stallings' theorem implies that e(G)=∞(G)=∞ if and only if G admits a proper free product decomposition G=A∗B=A*B with both A and B nontrivial.
