groups: Let G be a finitely generated group. Let S⊆G be a finite generating set of G and let Γ(G,S)Γ(G,S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. The number of ends of G is defined as e(G)=e(Γ(G,S))(G)=e(Γ(G,S)). A basic fact in the theory of ends of groups says that e(Γ(G,S))(Γ(G,S)) does not depend on the choice of a finite generating set S of G, so that e(G)(G) is well-defined. Basic facts and
