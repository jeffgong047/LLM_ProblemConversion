sets: Let G be a finitely generated group, S⊆G be a finite generating set of G and let Γ=Γ(G,S)Γ=Γ(G,S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. For a subset A⊆G denote by A∗^* the complement G−A-A of A in G. For a subset A⊆G, the edge boundary or the co-boundary δA of A consists of all (topological) edges of ΓΓ connecting a vertex from A with a vertex from A∗^*. Note that by definition δA=δA∗=^*. An ordered pair (A,A∗)(A,A^*) is called a cut in ΓΓ if δA is finite. A cut (A,A∗)(A,A^*) is called essential if both the sets A and A∗^* are infinite. A subset A⊆G is called almost invariant if for every g∈G the symmetric difference between A and Ag is finite. It is easy to see that (A,A∗)(A,A^*) is a cut if and only if the sets A and A∗^* are almost invariant (equivalently, if and only if the set A is almost invariant). Cuts and
