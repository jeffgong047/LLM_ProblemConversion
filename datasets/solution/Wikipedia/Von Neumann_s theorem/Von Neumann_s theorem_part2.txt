theorem: Let G and H be Hilbert spaces, and let T:dom⁡(T)⊆G→H:dom(T) be an unbounded operator from G into H.. Suppose that T is a closed operator and that T is densely defined, that is, dom⁡(T)dom(T) is dense in G.. Let T∗:dom⁡(T∗)⊆H→G^*:dom(T^*) denote the adjoint of T.. Then T∗T^*T is also densely defined, and it is self-adjoint. That is, (T∗T)∗=T∗T(T^*T)^*=T^*T and the operators on the right- and left-hand sides have the same dense domain in G..[1]
