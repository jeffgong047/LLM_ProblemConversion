theorem: For every n∈N0,∈ℕ_0, there is no non-zero polynomial P∈C[X;Y0,Y1,…,Yn]∈ℂ[X;Y_0,Y_1,…,Y_n] such that ∀z∈C∖Z≤0:P(z;Γ(z),Γ′(z),…,Γ(n)(z))=0,∈ℂ∖ℤ_≤0:(z;Γ(z),Γ'(z),…,Γ^(n)(z))=0, where ΓΓ is the gamma function. ◼ ▪ For example, define P∈C[X;Y0,Y1,Y2]∈ℂ[X;Y_0,Y_1,Y_2] by P=dfX2Y2+XY1+(X2−ν2)Y0. df= X^2Y_2+XY_1+(X^2-ν^2)Y_0. Then the equation P(z;f(z),f′(z),f″(z))=z2f″(z)+zf′(z)+(z2−ν2)f(z)≡0(z;f(z),f'(z),f”(z))=z^2f”(z)+zf'(z)+(z^2-ν^2)f(z)≡0 is called an algebraic differential equation, which, in this case, has the solutions f=Jν=J_ν and f=Yν=Y_ν — the Bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively. Hence, we say that Jν_ν and Yν_ν are differentially algebraic (also algebraically transcendental). Most of the familiar special functions of mathematical physics are differentially algebraic. All algebraic combinations of differentially algebraic functions are differentially algebraic. Furthermore, all compositions of differentially algebraic functions are differentially algebraic. Hölder’s Theorem simply states that the gamma function, ΓΓ, is not differentially algebraic and is therefore transcendentally transcendental.[2]
