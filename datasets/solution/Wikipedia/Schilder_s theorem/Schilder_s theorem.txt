In mathematics, Schilder's theorem is a generalization of the Laplace method from integrals on Rnℝ^n to functional Wiener integration. The theorem is used in the large deviations theory of stochastic processes.  Roughly speaking, out of Schilder's theorem one gets an estimate for the probability that a (scaled-down) sample path of Brownian motion will stray far from the mean path (which is constant with value 0).  This statement is made precise using rate functions.  Schilder's theorem is generalized by the Freidlin–Wentzell theorem for Itō diffusions.


Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) be the Banach space of continuous functions  f:[0,T]⟶Rd:[0,T]⟶𝐑^d such that f(0)=0(0)=0, equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞ and C0∗_0^∗ be the subspace of absolutely continuous functions whose derivative is in L2^2 (the so-called Cameron-Martin space). Define the rate function 

I(ω)=12∫0T‖ω˙(t)‖2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^Tω̇(t)^2 dt
on C0∗_0^∗ and let F:C0→R,G:C0→C:C_0→ℝ,G:C_0→ℂ be two given functions, such that S:=I+F:=I+F (the "action") has a unique minimum Ω∈C0∗Ω_0^∗.
Then under some differentiability and growth assumptions on F,G,G which are detailed in Schilder 1966, one has 

limλ→∞E[exp⁡(−λF(λ−1/2ω))G(λ−1/2ω)]exp⁡(−λS(Ω))=G(Ω)E[exp⁡(−12⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩)]lim_λ→∞𝔼[exp(-(λ^-1/2ω))G(λ^-1/2ω)]/exp(-(Ω))=G(Ω)𝔼[exp(-1/2⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩)]
where E𝔼 denotes expectation with respect to the Wiener measure Pℙ on C0_0 and D(Ω)(Ω) is the Hessian of F at the minimum ΩΩ; ⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩ is meant in the sense of an L2([0,T])^2([0,T]) inner product.

Application to large deviations on the Wiener measure[edit]
Let B be a standard Brownian motion in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd starting at the origin, 0 ∈ Rd; let W denote the law of B, i.e. classical Wiener measure.  For ε > 0, let Wε denote the law of the rescaled process √εB.  Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) of continuous functions  f:[0,T]⟶Rd:[0,T]⟶𝐑^d such that f(0)=0(0)=0, equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞, the probability measures Wε satisfy the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 → R ∪ {+∞} given by

I(ω)=12∫0T|ω˙(t)|2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^T|ω̇(t)|^2 dt
if ω is absolutely continuous, and I(ω) = +∞ otherwise.  In other words, for every open set G ⊆ C0 and every closed set F ⊆ C0,

limsupε↓0εlog⁡Wε(F)≤−infω∈FI(ω)lim sup_ε↓0εlog𝐖_ε(F)≤-inf_ωI(ω)
and

liminfε↓0εlog⁡Wε(G)≥−infω∈GI(ω).lim inf_ε↓0εlog𝐖_ε(G)≥-inf_ωI(ω).
Example[edit]
Taking ε = 1/c2, one can use Schilder's theorem to obtain estimates for the probability that a standard Brownian motion B strays further than c from its starting point over the time interval [0, T], i.e. the probability

W(C0∖Bc(0;‖⋅‖∞))≡P[‖B‖∞>c],𝐖(C_0∖𝐁_c(0;·_∞))≡𝐏[B_∞>c],
as c tends to infinity.  Here Bc(0; ||·||∞) denotes the open ball of radius c about the zero function in C0, taken with respect to the supremum norm.  First note that

‖B‖∞>c⟺εB∈A:=ω∈C0∣|ω(t)|>1forsomet∈[0,T].B_∞>c√(ε)B:={ω_0||ω(t)|>1forsomet∈[0,T]}.
Since the rate function is continuous on A, Schilder's theorem yields

limc→∞log⁡(P[‖B‖∞>c])c2=limε→0εlog⁡(P[εB∈A])=−inf12∫0T|ω˙(t)|2dt|ω∈A=−12∫0T1T2dt=−12T,lim_c→∞log(𝐏[B_∞>c])/c^2   =lim_ε→0εlog(𝐏[√(ε)B])
   =-inf{.1/2∫_0^T|ω̇(t)|^2 dt | ω}
   =-1/2∫_0^T1/T^2 dt
   =-1/2T,
making use of the fact that the infimum over paths in the collection A is attained for ω(t) = t/T .  This result can be heuristically interpreted as saying that, for large c and/or large T

log⁡(P[‖B‖∞>c])c2≈−12TorP[‖B‖∞>c]≈exp⁡(−c22T).log(𝐏[B_∞>c])/c^2≈-1/2T    or    𝐏[B_∞>c]≈exp(-c^2/2T).
In fact, the above probability can be estimated more precisely:  for B a standard Brownian motion in Rn, and any T, c and ε > 0, we have:

P[sup0≤t≤T|εBt|≥c]≤4nexp⁡(−c22nTε).𝐏[sup_0|√(ε)B_t|]≤4nexp(-c^2/2nTε).
