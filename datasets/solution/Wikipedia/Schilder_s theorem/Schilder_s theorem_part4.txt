Example: Taking ε = 1/c2, one can use Schilder's theorem to obtain estimates for the probability that a standard Brownian motion B strays further than c from its starting point over the time interval [0, T], i.e. the probability W(C0∖Bc(0;‖⋅‖∞))≡P[‖B‖∞>c],𝐖(C_0∖𝐁_c(0;·_∞))≡𝐏[B_∞>c], as c tends to infinity. Here Bc(0; ||·||∞) denotes the open ball of radius c about the zero function in C0, taken with respect to the supremum norm. First note that ‖B‖∞>c⟺εB∈A:=ω∈C0∣|ω(t)|>1forsomet∈[0,T].B_∞>c√(ε)B:={ω_0||ω(t)|>1forsomet∈[0,T]}. Since the rate function is continuous on A, Schilder's theorem yields limc→∞log⁡(P[‖B‖∞>c])c2=limε→0εlog⁡(P[εB∈A])=−inf12∫0T|ω˙(t)|2dt|ω∈A=−12∫0T1T2dt=−12T,lim_c→∞log(𝐏[B_∞>c])/c^2 =lim_ε→0εlog(𝐏[√(ε)B]) =-inf{.1/2∫_0^T|ω̇(t)|^2 dt | ω} =-1/2∫_0^T1/T^2 dt =-1/2T, making use of the fact that the infimum over paths in the collection A is attained for ω(t) = t/T . This result can be heuristically interpreted as saying that, for large c and/or large T log⁡(P[‖B‖∞>c])c2≈−12TorP[‖B‖∞>c]≈exp⁡(−c22T).log(𝐏[B_∞>c])/c^2≈-1/2T or 𝐏[B_∞>c]≈exp(-c^2/2T). In fact, the above probability can be estimated more precisely: for B a standard Brownian motion in Rn, and any T, c and ε > 0, we have: P[sup0≤t≤T|εBt|≥c]≤4nexp⁡(−c22nTε).𝐏[sup_0|√(ε)B_t|]≤4nexp(-c^2/2nTε).
