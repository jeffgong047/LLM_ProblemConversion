measure: Let B be a standard Brownian motion in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd starting at the origin, 0 ∈ Rd; let W denote the law of B, i.e. classical Wiener measure. For ε > 0, let Wε denote the law of the rescaled process √εB. Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) of continuous functions f:[0,T]⟶Rd:[0,T]⟶𝐑^d such that f(0)=0(0)=0, equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞, the probability measures Wε satisfy the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 → R ∪ {+∞} given by I(ω)=12∫0T|ω˙(t)|2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^T|ω̇(t)|^2 dt if ω is absolutely continuous, and I(ω) = +∞ otherwise. In other words, for every open set G ⊆ C0 and every closed set F ⊆ C0, limsupε↓0εlog⁡Wε(F)≤−infω∈FI(ω)lim sup_ε↓0εlog𝐖_ε(F)≤-inf_ωI(ω) and liminfε↓0εlog⁡Wε(G)≥−infω∈GI(ω).lim inf_ε↓0εlog𝐖_ε(G)≥-inf_ωI(ω).
