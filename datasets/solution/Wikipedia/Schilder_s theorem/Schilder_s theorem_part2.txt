theorem: Let C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) be the Banach space of continuous functions f:[0,T]⟶Rd:[0,T]⟶𝐑^d such that f(0)=0(0)=0, equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞ and C0∗_0^∗ be the subspace of absolutely continuous functions whose derivative is in L2^2 (the so-called Cameron-Martin space). Define the rate function I(ω)=12∫0T‖ω˙(t)‖2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^Tω̇(t)^2 dt on C0∗_0^∗ and let F:C0→R,G:C0→C:C_0→ℝ,G:C_0→ℂ be two given functions, such that S:=I+F:=I+F (the "action") has a unique minimum Ω∈C0∗Ω_0^∗. Then under some differentiability and growth assumptions on F,G,G which are detailed in Schilder 1966, one has limλ→∞E[exp⁡(−λF(λ−1/2ω))G(λ−1/2ω)]exp⁡(−λS(Ω))=G(Ω)E[exp⁡(−12⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩)]lim_λ→∞𝔼[exp(-(λ^-1/2ω))G(λ^-1/2ω)]/exp(-(Ω))=G(Ω)𝔼[exp(-1/2⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩)] where E𝔼 denotes expectation with respect to the Wiener measure Pℙ on C0_0 and D(Ω)(Ω) is the Hessian of F at the minimum ΩΩ; ⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩⟨ω,D(Ω)ω⟩ is meant in the sense of an L2([0,T])^2([0,T]) inner product.
