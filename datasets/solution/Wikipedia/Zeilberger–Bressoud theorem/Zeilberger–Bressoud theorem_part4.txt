conjecture: Andrews (1975) found a q-analog of Dyson's conjecture, stating that the constant term of ∏1≤i<j≤n(xixj;q)ai(qxjxi;q)aj∏_1<j(x_i/x_j;q)_a_i(qx_j/x_i;q)_a_j is (q;q)a1+⋯+an(q;q)a1⋯(q;q)an.(q;q)_a_1+⋯+a_n/(q;q)_a_1⋯(q;q)_a_n. Here (a;q)n is the q-Pochhammer symbol. This conjecture reduces to Dyson's conjecture for q=1, and was proved by Zeilberger & Bressoud (1985), using a combinatorial approach inspired by previous work of Ira Gessel and Dominique Foata. A shorter proof, using formal Laurent series, was given in 2004 by Ira Gessel and Guoce Xin, and an even shorter proof, using a quantitative form, due to Karasev and Petrov, and independently to Lason, of Noga Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, was given in 2012 by Gyula Karolyi and Zoltan Lorant Nagy. The latter method was extended, in 2013, by Shalosh B. Ekhad and Doron Zeilberger to derive explicit expressions of any specific coefficient, not just the constant term, see http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/qdyson.html, for detailed references.
