integral: When all the values ai are equal to β/2, the constant term in Dyson's conjecture is the value of Dyson's integral 1(2π)n∫02π⋯∫02π∏1≤j<k≤n|eiθj−eiθk|βdθ1⋯dθn.1/(2π)^n∫_0^2π⋯∫_0^2π∏_1<k|e^iθ_j-e^iθ_k|^β dθ_1θ_n. Dyson's integral is a special case of Selberg's integral after a change of variable and has value Γ(1+βn/2)Γ(1+β/2)nΓ(1+/2)/Γ(1+β/2)^n which gives another proof of Dyson's conjecture in this special case. q-Dyson
