conjecture: The Dyson conjecture states that the Laurent polynomial ∏1≤i≠j≤n(1−ti/tj)ai∏_1(1-t_i/t_j)^a_i has constant term (a1+a2+⋯+an)!a1!a2!⋯an!.(a_1+a_2+⋯+a_n)!/a_1!a_2!_n!. The conjecture was first proved independently by Wilson (1962) and Gunson (1962). Good (1970) later found a short proof, by observing that the Laurent polynomials, and therefore their constant terms, satisfy the recursion relations F(a1,…,an)=∑i=1nF(a1,…,ai−1,…,an).(a_1,…,a_n)=∑_i=1^nF(a_1,…,a_i-1,…,a_n). The case n = 3 of Dyson's conjecture follows from the Dixon identity. Sills & Zeilberger (2006) and (Sills 2006) used a computer to find expressions for non-constant coefficients of Dyson's Laurent polynomial. Dyson
