Theorem: In a closed Gordon–Newell network of m queues, with a total population of K individuals, write (k1,k2,…,km)(k_1,k_2,…,k_m) (where ki is the length of queue i) for the state of the network and S(K, m) for the state space S(K,m)=k∈Nmsuchthat∑i=1mki=K.(K,m)={𝐤∈ℕ^msuchthat∑_i=1^mk_i=K}. Then the equilibrium state probability distribution exists and is given by π(k1,k2,…,km)=1G(K)∏i=1m(eiμi)kiπ(k_1,k_2,…,k_m)=1/G(K)∏_i=1^m(e_i/μ_i)^k_i where service times at queue i are exponentially distributed with parameter μi. The normalizing constant G(K) is given by G(K)=∑k∈S(K,m)∏i=1m(eiμi)ki,(K)=∑_𝐤(K,m)∏_i=1^m(e_i/μ_i)^k_i, and ei is the visit ratio, calculated by solving the simultaneous equations ei=∑j=1mejpjifor1≤i≤m._i=∑_j=1^me_jp_jifor1.
