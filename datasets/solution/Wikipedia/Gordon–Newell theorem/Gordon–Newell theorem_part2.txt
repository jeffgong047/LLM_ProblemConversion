network: A network of m interconnected queues is known as a Gordon–Newell network[3] or closed Jackson network[4] if it meets the following conditions: the network is closed (no customers can enter or leave the network), all service times are exponentially distributed and the service discipline at all queues is FCFS, a customer completing service at queue i will move to queue j with probability Pij_ij, with the Pij_ij such that ∑j=1mPij=1∑_j=1^mP_ij=1, the utilization of all of the queues is less than one.
