History: Niven's proof of his theorem appears in his book Irrational Numbers. Earlier, the theorem had been proven by D. H. Lehmer and J. M. H. Olmstead.[2] In his 1933 paper, Lehmer proved the theorem for cosine by proving a more general result. Namely, Lehmer showed that for relatively prime integers k and n with n>2>2, the number 2cos⁡(2πk/n)2cos(2/n) is an algebraic number of degree φ(n)/2φ(n)/2, where φφ denotes Euler's totient function. Because rational numbers have degree 1, we must have φ(n)=2φ(n)=2 and therefore the only possibilities are n==1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Next, he proved a corresponding result for sine using the trigonometric identity sin⁡(θ)=cos⁡(θ−π/2)sin(θ)=cos(θ-π/2).[4] In 1956, Niven extended Lehmer's result to the other trigonometric functions.[2] Other mathematicians have given new proofs in subsequent years.[3] See
