Consequences: A binomial coefficient (mn)mn is divisible by a prime p if and only if at least one of the base p digits of n is greater than the corresponding digit of m. In particular, (mn)mn is odd if and only if the binary digits (bits) in the binary expansion of n are a subset of the bits of m. Variations and
