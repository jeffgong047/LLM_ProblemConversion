Proofs: There are several ways to prove Lucas's theorem. Combinatorial proof Let M be a set with m elements, and divide it into mi cycles of length pi for the various values of i. Then each of these cycles can be rotated separately, so that a group G which is the Cartesian product of cyclic groups Cpi acts on M. It thus also acts on subsets N of size n. Since the number of elements in G is a power of p, the same is true of any of its orbits. Thus in order to compute (mn)mn modulo p, we only need to consider fixed points of this group action. The fixed points are those subsets N that are a union of some of the cycles. More precisely one can show by induction on k-i, that N must have exactly ni cycles of size pi. Thus the number of choices for N is exactly ∏i=0k(mini)(modp)∏_i=0^km_in_ip. Proof based on generating functions This proof is due to Nathan Fine.[2] If p is a prime and n is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ p − 1, then the numerator of the binomial coefficient (pn)=p⋅(p−1)⋯(p−n+1)n⋅(n−1)⋯1pn=p·(p-1)⋯(p-n+1)/n·(n-1)⋯1 is divisible by p but the denominator is not. Hence p divides (pn)pn. In terms of ordinary generating functions, this means that (1+X)p≡1+Xp(modp).(1+X)^p≡1+X^pp. Continuing by induction, we have for every nonnegative integer i that (1+X)pi≡1+Xpi(modp).(1+X)^p^i≡1+X^p^ip. Now let m be a nonnegative integer, and let p be a prime. Write m in base p, so that m=∑i=0kmipi=∑_i=0^km_ip^i for some nonnegative integer k and integers mi with 0 ≤ mi ≤ p-1. Then ∑n=0m(mn)Xn=(1+X)m=∏i=0k((1+X)pi)mi≡∏i=0k(1+Xpi)mi=∏i=0k(∑ni=0mi(mini)Xnipi)=∏i=0k(∑ni=0p−1(mini)Xnipi)=∑n=0m(∏i=0k(mini))Xn(modp),∑_n=0^mmnX^n =(1+X)^m=∏_i=0^k((1+X)^p^i)^m_i ≡∏_i=0^k(1+X^p^i)^m_i=∏_i=0^k(∑_n_i=0^m_im_in_iX^n_ip^i) =∏_i=0^k(∑_n_i=0^p-1m_in_iX^n_ip^i)=∑_n=0^m(∏_i=0^km_in_i)X^np, where in the final product, ni is the ith digit in the base p representation of n. This proves Lucas's theorem.
