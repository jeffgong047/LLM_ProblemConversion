generalizations: Kummer's theorem asserts that the largest integer k such that pk divides the binomial coefficient (mn)mn (or in other words, the valuation of the binomial coefficient with respect to the prime p) is equal to the number of carries that occur when n and m − n are added in the base p. Generalizations of Lucas's theorem to the case of p being a prime power are given by Davis and Webb (1990)[3] and Granville (1997).[4] The q-Lucas theorem is a generalization for the q-binomial coefficients, first proved by J. Désarménien.[5]
