Statement: For non-negative integers m and n and a prime p, the following congruence relation holds: (mn)≡∏i=0k(mini)(modp),mn≡∏_i=0^km_in_ip, where m=mkpk+mk−1pk−1+⋯+m1p+m0,=m_kp^k+m_k-1p^k-1+⋯+m_1p+m_0, and n=nkpk+nk−1pk−1+⋯+n1p+n0=n_kp^k+n_k-1p^k-1+⋯+n_1p+n_0 are the base p expansions of m and n respectively. This uses the convention that (mn)=0mn=0 if m < n.
