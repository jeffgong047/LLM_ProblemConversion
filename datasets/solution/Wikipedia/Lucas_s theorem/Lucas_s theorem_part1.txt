For the theorem in complex analysis, see Gauss–Lucas theorem. In number theory, Lucas's theorem expresses the remainder of division of the binomial coefficient (mn)mn by a prime number p in terms of the base p expansions of the integers m and n. Lucas's theorem first appeared in 1878 in papers by Édouard Lucas.[1]
