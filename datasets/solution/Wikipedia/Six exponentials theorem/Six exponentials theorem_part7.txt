varieties: The exponential function ez uniformizes the exponential map of the multiplicative group Gm. Therefore, we can reformulate the six exponential theorem more abstractly as follows: Let G = Gm × Gm and take u : C → G(C) to be a non-zero complex-analytic group homomorphism. Define L to be the set of complex numbers l for which u(l) is an algebraic point of G. If a minimal generating set of L over Q has more than two elements then the image u(C) is an algebraic subgroup of G(C). (In order to derive the classical statement, set u(z) = (ey1z; ey2z) and note that Qx1 + Qx2 + Qx3 is a subset of L). In this way, the statement of the six exponentials theorem can be generalized to an arbitrary commutative group variety G over the field of algebraic numbers. This generalized six exponential conjecture, however, seems out of scope at the current state of transcendental number theory. For the special but interesting cases G = Gm × E and G = E × E′, where E, E′ are elliptic curves over the field of algebraic numbers, results towards the generalized six exponential conjecture were proven by Aleksander Momot.[9] These results involve the exponential function ez and a Weierstrass function ℘℘ resp. two Weierstrass functions ℘,℘′℘,℘' with algebraic invariants g2,g3,g2′,g3′_2,g_3,g_2',g_3', instead of the two exponential functions ey1z,ey2z^y_1z,e^y_2z in the classical statement. Let G = Gm × E and suppose E is not isogenous to a curve over a real field and that u(C) is not an algebraic subgroup of G(C). Then L is generated over Q either by two elements x1, x2, or three elements x1, x2, x3 which are not all contained in a real line Rc, where c is a non-zero complex number. A similar result is shown for G = E × E′.[10]
