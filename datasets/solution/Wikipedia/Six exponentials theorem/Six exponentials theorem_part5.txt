theorem: Another related result that implies both the six exponentials theorem and the five exponentials theorem is the sharp six exponentials theorem.[5] This theorem is as follows. Let x1, x2, and x3 be complex numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and let y1 and y2 be a pair of complex numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and suppose that βij are six algebraic numbers for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2 such that the following six numbers are algebraic: ex1y1−β11,ex1y2−β12,ex2y1−β21,ex2y2−β22,ex3y1−β31,ex3y2−β32.^x_1y_1-β_11,e^x_1y_2-β_12,e^x_2y_1-β_21,e^x_2y_2-β_22,e^x_3y_1-β_31,e^x_3y_2-β_32. Then xi yj = βij for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2. The six exponentials theorem then follows by setting βij = 0 for every i and j, while the five exponentials theorem follows by setting x3 = γ/x1 and using Baker's theorem to ensure that the xi are linearly independent. There is a sharp version of the five exponentials theorem as well, although it as yet unproven so is known as the sharp five exponentials conjecture.[6] This conjecture implies both the sharp six exponentials theorem and the five exponentials theorem, and is stated as follows. Let x1, x2 and y1, y2 be two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the rational numbers, and let α, β11, β12, β21, β22, and γ be six algebraic numbers with γ ≠ 0 such that the following five numbers are algebraic: ex1y1−β11,ex1y2−β12,ex2y1−β21,ex2y2−β22,e(γx2/x1)−α.^x_1y_1-β_11,e^x_1y_2-β_12,e^x_2y_1-β_21,e^x_2y_2-β_22,e^(_2/x_1)-α. Then xi yj = βij for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2 and γx2 = αx1. A consequence of this conjecture that isn't currently known would be the transcendence of eπ², by setting x1 = y1 = β11 = 1, x2 = y2 = iπ, and all the other values in the statement to be zero.
