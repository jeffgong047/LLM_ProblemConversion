History: A special case of the result where x1, x2, and x3 are logarithms of positive integers, y1 = 1, and y2 is real, was first mentioned in a paper by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erd≈ës from 1944 in which they try to prove that the ratio of consecutive colossally abundant numbers is always prime. They claimed that Carl Ludwig Siegel knew of a proof of this special case, but it is not recorded.[1] Using the special case they manage to prove that the ratio of consecutive colossally abundant numbers is always either a prime or a semiprime. The theorem was first explicitly stated and proved in its complete form independently by Serge Lang[2] and Kanakanahalli Ramachandra[3] in the 1960s. Five exponentials
