theorem: The logical implications between the various problems in this circle. Those in red are as yet unproven while those in blue are known results. The top most result refers to that discussed at Baker's theorem, while the four exponentials conjectures are detailed at the four exponentials conjecture article. A further strengthening of the theorems and conjectures in this area are the strong versions. The strong six exponentials theorem is a result proved by Damien Roy that implies the sharp six exponentials theorem.[7] This result concerns the vector space over the algebraic numbers generated by 1 and all logarithms of algebraic numbers, denoted here as L∗. So L∗ is the set of all complex numbers of the form β0+∑i=1nβilog⁡αi,β_0+∑_i=1^nβ_ilogα_i, for some n ≥ 0, where all the βi and αi are algebraic and every branch of the logarithm is considered. The strong six exponentials theorem then says that if x1, x2, and x3 are complex numbers that are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers, and if y1 and y2 are a pair of complex numbers that are also linearly independent over the algebraic numbers then at least one of the six numbers xi yj for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2 is not in L∗. This is stronger than the standard six exponentials theorem which says that one of these six numbers is not simply the logarithm of an algebraic number. There is also a strong five exponentials conjecture formulated by Michel Waldschmidt.[8] It would imply both the strong six exponentials theorem and the sharp five exponentials conjecture. This conjecture claims that if x1, x2 and y1, y2 are two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the algebraic numbers, then at least one of the following five numbers is not in L∗: x1y1,x1y2,x2y1,x2y2,x1/x2._1y_1, x_1y_2, x_2y_1, x_2y_2, x_1/x_2. All the above conjectures and theorems are consequences of the unproven extension of Baker's theorem, that logarithms of algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers are automatically algebraically independent too. The diagram on the right shows the logical implications between all these results. Generalization to commutative group
