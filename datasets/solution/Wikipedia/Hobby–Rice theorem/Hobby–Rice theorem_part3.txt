division: The theorem was used by Noga Alon in the context of necklace splitting[3] in 1987. Suppose the interval [0,1] is a cake. There are n partners and each of the n functions is a value-density function of one partner. We want to divide the cake into two parts such that all partners agree that the parts have the same value. This fair-division challenge is sometimes referred to as the consensus-halving problem.[4] The Hobbyâ€“Rice theorem implies that this can be done with n cuts.
