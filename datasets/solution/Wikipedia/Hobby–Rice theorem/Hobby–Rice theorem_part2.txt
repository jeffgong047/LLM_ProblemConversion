theorem: Define a partition of the interval [0,1] as a division of the interval into n+1+1 subintervals by as an increasing sequence of n numbers: 0=z0<z1<⋯<zn⏟<zn+1=10=z_0<z_1<…<z_n<z_n+1=1 Define a signed partition as a partition in which each subinterval i has an associated sign δiδ_i: δ1,…,δk+1∈+1,−1δ_1,…,δ_k+1∈{+1,-1} The Hobby–Rice theorem says that for every n continuously integrable functions: g1,…,gn:[0,1]⟶R_1,…,g_n[0,1]⟶ℝ there exists a signed partition of [0,1] such that: ∑i=1n+1δi∫zi−1zigj(z)dz=0for1≤j≤n.∑_i=1^n+1δ_i∫_z_i-1^z_ig_j(z) dz=0for1. (in other words: for each of the n functions, its integral over the positive subintervals equals its integral over the negative subintervals). Application to fair
