mean: Under the conditions of the martingale convergence theorem given above, it is not necessarily true that the supermartingale (Xn)n∈N(X_n)_n∈𝐍 converges in mean (i.e. that limn→∞E⁡[|Xn−X|]=0lim_n→∞E[|X_n-X|]=0). As an example,[2] let (Xn)n∈N(X_n)_n∈𝐍 be a ±1±1 random walk with X0=1_0=1. Let N be the first time when Xn=0_n=0, and let (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 be the stochastic process defined by Yn:=Xmin(N,n)_n:=X_min(N,n). Then N is a stopping time with respect to the martingale (Xn)n∈N(X_n)_n∈𝐍, so (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 is also a martingale, referred to as a stopped martingale. In particular, (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 is a supermartingale which is bounded below, so by the martingale convergence theorem it converges pointwise almost surely to a random variable Y. But if Yn>0_n>0 then Yn+1=Yn±1_n+1=Y_n±1, so Y is almost surely zero. This means that E⁡[Y]=0E[Y]=0. However, E⁡[Yn]=1E[Y_n]=1 for every n≥1≥1, since (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 is a random walk which starts at 11 and subsequently makes mean-zero moves (alternately, note that E⁡[Yn]=E⁡[Y0]=1E[Y_n]=E[Y_0]=1 since (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 is a martingale). Therefore (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈𝐍 cannot converge to Y in mean. Moreover, if (Yn)n∈N(Y_n)_n∈ℕ were to converge in mean to any random variable R, then some subsequence converges to R almost surely. So by the above argument R=0=0 almost surely, which contradicts convergence in mean. Statements for the general
