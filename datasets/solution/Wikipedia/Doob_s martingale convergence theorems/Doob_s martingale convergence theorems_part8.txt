inequality: The following result, called Doob's upcrossing inequality or, sometimes, Doob's upcrossing lemma, is used in proving Doob's martingale convergence theorems.[3] A "gambling" argument shows that for uniformly bounded supermartingales, the number of upcrossings is bounded; the upcrossing lemma generalizes this argument to supermartingales with bounded expectation of their negative parts. Let N be a natural number. Let (Xn)n∈N(X_n)_n∈𝐍 be a supermartingale with respect to a filtration (Fn)n∈N(ℱ_n)_n∈𝐍. Let a, b be two real numbers with a<b<b. Define the random variables (Un)n∈N(U_n)_n∈𝐍 so that Un_n is the maximum number of disjoint intervals [ni1,ni2][n_i_1,n_i_2] with ni2≤n_i_2, such that Xni1<a<b<Xni2_n_i_1<a<b<X_n_i_2. These are called upcrossings with respect to interval [a,b][a,b]. Then (b−a)E⁡[Un]≤E⁡[(Xn−a)−].(b-a)E[U_n]≤E[(X_n-a)^-]. where X−^- is the negative part of X, defined by X−=−min(X,0)^-=-min(X,0).[4][5]
