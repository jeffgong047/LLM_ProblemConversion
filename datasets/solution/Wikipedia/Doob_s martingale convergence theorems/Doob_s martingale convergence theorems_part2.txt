martingales: A common formulation of the martingale convergence theorem for discrete-time martingales is the following. Let X1,X2,X3,…_1,X_2,X_3,… be a supermartingale. Suppose that the supermartingale is bounded in the sense that supt∈NE⁡[Xt−]<∞sup_t∈𝐍E[X_t^-]<∞ where Xt−_t^- is the negative part of Xt_t, defined by Xt−=−min(Xt,0)_t^-=-min(X_t,0). Then the sequence converges almost surely to a random variable X with finite expectation. There is a symmetric statement for submartingales with bounded expectation of the positive part. A supermartingale is a stochastic analogue of a non-increasing sequence, and the condition of the theorem is analogous to the condition in the monotone convergence theorem that the sequence be bounded from below. The condition that the martingale is bounded is essential; for example, an unbiased ±1±1 random walk is a martingale but does not converge. As intuition, there are two reasons why a sequence may fail to converge. It may go off to infinity, or it may oscillate. The boundedness condition prevents the former from happening. The latter is impossible by a "gambling" argument. Specifically, consider a stock market game in which at time t, the stock has price Xt_t. There is no strategy for buying and selling the stock over time, always holding a non-negative amount of stock, which has positive expected profit in this game. The reason is that at each time the expected change in stock price, given all past information, is at most zero (by definition of a supermartingale). But if the prices were to oscillate without converging, then there would be a strategy with positive expected profit: loosely, buy low and sell high. This argument can be made rigorous to prove the result. Proof
