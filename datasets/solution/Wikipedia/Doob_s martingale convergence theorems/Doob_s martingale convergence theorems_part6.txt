theorem: Doob's first martingale convergence theorem provides a sufficient condition for the random variables Nt_t to have a limit as t→+∞→+∞ in a pointwise sense, i.e. for each ωω in the sample space ΩΩ individually. For t≥0≥0, let Nt−=max(−Nt,0)_t^-=max(-N_t,0) and suppose that supt>0E⁡[Nt−]<+∞.sup_t>0E[N_t^-]<+∞. Then the pointwise limit N(ω)=limt→+∞Nt(ω)(ω)=lim_t→+∞N_t(ω) exists and is finite for P𝐏-almost all ω∈Ωω∈Ω.[3] Doob's second martingale convergence
