Lp: Let M:[0,∞)×Ω→R:[0,∞)×Ω→𝐑 be a continuous martingale such that supt>0E⁡[|Mt|p]<+∞sup_t>0E[|M_t|^p]<+∞ for some p>1>1. Then there exists a random variable M∈Lp(Ω,P;R)^p(Ω,𝐏;𝐑) such that Mt→M_t as t→+∞→+∞ both P𝐏-almost surely and in Lp(Ω,P;R)^p(Ω,𝐏;𝐑). The statement for discrete-time martingales is essentially identical, with the obvious difference that the continuity assumption is no longer necessary. Lévy's zero–one
