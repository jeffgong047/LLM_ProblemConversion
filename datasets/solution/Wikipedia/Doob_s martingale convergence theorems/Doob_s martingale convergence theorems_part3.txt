sketch: The proof is simplified by making the (stronger) assumption that the supermartingale is uniformly bounded; that is, there is a constant M such that |Xn|≤M|X_n| always holds. In the event that the sequence X1,X2,…_1,X_2,… does not converge, then liminfXn_n and limsupXn_n differ. If also the sequence is bounded, then there are some real numbers a and b such that a<b<b and the sequence crosses the interval [a,b][a,b] infinitely often. That is, the sequence is eventually less than a, and at a later time exceeds b, and at an even later time is less than a, and so forth ad infinitum. These periods where the sequence starts below a and later exceeds b are called "upcrossings". Consider a stock market game in which at time t, one may buy or sell shares of the stock at price Xt_t. On the one hand, it can be shown from the definition of a supermartingale that for any N∈N∈𝐍 there is no strategy which maintains a non-negative amount of stock and has positive expected profit after playing this game for N steps. On the other hand, if the prices cross a fixed interval [a,b][a,b] very often, then the following strategy seems to do well: buy the stock when the price drops below a, and sell it when the price exceeds b. Indeed, if uN_N is the number of upcrossings in the sequence by time N, then the profit at time N is at least (b−a)uN−2M(b-a)u_N-2M: each upcrossing provides at least b−a-a profit, and if the last action was a "buy", then in the worst case the buying price was a≤M and the current price is −M-M. But any strategy has expected profit at most 00, so necessarily E⁡[uN]≤2Mb−a.E[u_N]≤2M/b-a. By the monotone convergence theorem for expectations, this means that E⁡[limN→∞uN]≤2Mb−a,E[lim_N→∞u_N]≤2M/b-a, so the expected number of upcrossings in the whole sequence is finite. It follows that the infinite-crossing event for interval [a,b][a,b] occurs with probability 00. By a union bound over all rational a and b, with probability 11, no interval exists which is crossed infinitely often. If for all a,b∈Q,b∈𝐐 there are finitely many upcrossings of interval [a,b][a,b], then the limit inferior and limit superior of the sequence must agree, so the sequence must converge. This shows that the martingale converges with probability 11. Failure of convergence in
