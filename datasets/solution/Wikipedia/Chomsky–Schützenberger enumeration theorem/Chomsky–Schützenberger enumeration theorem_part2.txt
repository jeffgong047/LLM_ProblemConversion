Statement: In order to state the theorem, a few notions from algebra and formal language theory are needed. Let Nℕ denote the set of nonnegative integers. A power series over Nℕ is an infinite series of the form f=f(x)=∑k=0∞akxk=a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+⋯=f(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k=a_0+a_1x^1+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+⋯ with coefficients ak_k in Nℕ. The multiplication of two formal power series f and g is defined in the expected way as the convolution of the sequences an_n and bn_n: f(x)⋅g(x)=∑k=0∞(∑i=0kaibk−i)xk.(x)(x)=∑_k=0^∞(∑_i=0^ka_ib_k-i)x^k. In particular, we write f2=f(x)⋅f(x)^2=f(x)(x), f3=f(x)⋅f(x)⋅f(x)^3=f(x)(x)(x), and so on. In analogy to algebraic numbers, a power series f(x)(x) is called algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x), if there exists a finite set of polynomials p0(x),p1(x),p2(x),…,pn(x)_0(x),p_1(x),p_2(x),…,p_n(x) each with rational coefficients such that p0(x)+p1(x)⋅f+p2(x)⋅f2+⋯+pn(x)⋅fn=0._0(x)+p_1(x)+p_2(x)^2+⋯+p_n(x)^n=0. A context-free grammar is said to be unambiguous if every string generated by the grammar admits a unique parse tree or, equivalently, only one leftmost derivation. Having established the necessary notions, the theorem is stated as follows. Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. If L is a context-free language admitting an unambiguous context-free grammar, and ak:=|L∩Σk|_k:=|L capΣ^k| is the number of words of length k in L, then G(x)=∑k=0∞akxk(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k is a power series over Nℕ that is algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x). Proofs of this theorem are given by Kuich & Salomaa (1985), and by Panholzer (2005).
