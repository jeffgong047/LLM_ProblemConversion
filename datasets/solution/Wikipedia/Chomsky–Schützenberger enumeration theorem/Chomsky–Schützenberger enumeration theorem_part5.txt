ambiguity: In classical formal language theory, the theorem can be used to prove that certain context-free languages are inherently ambiguous. For example, the Goldstine language LG_G over the alphabet a,b{a,b} consists of the words an1ban2b⋯anpb^n_1ba^n_2b^n_pb with p≥1≥1, ni>0_i>0 for i∈1,2,…,p∈{1,2,…,p}, and nj≠j_j for some j∈1,2,…,p∈{1,2,…,p}. It is comparably easy to show that the language LG_G is context-free.[2] The harder part is to show that there does not exist an unambiguous grammar that generates LG_G. This can be proved as follows: If gk_k denotes the number of words of length k in LG_G, then for the associated power series holds G(x)=∑k=0∞gkxk=1−x1−2x−1x∑k≥1xk(k+1)/2−1(x)=∑_k=0^∞g_kx^k=1-x/1-2x-1/x∑_k≥1x^k(k+1)/2-1. Using methods from complex analysis, one can prove that this function is not algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x). By the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, one can conclude that LG_G does not admit an unambiguous context-free grammar.[3]
