estimates: The theorem can be used in analytic combinatorics to estimate the number of words of length n generated by a given unambiguous context-free grammar, as n grows large. The following example is given by Gruber, Lee & Shallit (2012): the unambiguous context-free grammar G over the alphabet {0,1} has start symbol S and the following rules S → M | U M → 0M1M | ε U → 0S | 0M1U. To obtain an algebraic representation of the power series G(x)(x) associated with a given context-free grammar G, one transforms the grammar into a system of equations. This is achieved by replacing each occurrence of a terminal symbol by x, each occurrence of ε by the integer '1', each occurrence of '→' by '=', and each occurrence of '|' by '+', respectively. The operation of concatenation at the right-hand-side of each rule corresponds to the multiplication operation in the equations thus obtained. This yields the following system of equations: S = M + U M = M²x² + 1 U = Sx + MUx² In this system of equations, S, M, and U are functions of x, so one could also write S(x)(x), M(x)(x), and U(x)(x). The equation system can be resolved after S, resulting in a single algebraic equation: x(2x−1)S2+(2x−1)S+1=0(2x-1)S^2+(2x-1)S+1=0. This quadratic equation has two solutions for S, one of which is the algebraic power series G(x)(x). By applying methods from complex analysis to this equation, the number an_n of words of length n generated by G can be estimated, as n grows large. In this case, one obtains an∈O(2+ϵ)n_n(2+ϵ)^n but an∉O(2−ϵ)n_n(2-ϵ)^n for each ϵ>0ϵ>0.[1] The following example is from Bassino & Nicaud (2011):S→XYT→aT|TbT|YcYY→YaY|cY|abTaYYa|XX→a|b|c⇒s(z)=x(z)y(z)t(z)=zt(z)+zt(z)2+zy(z)2y(z)=zy(z)2+zy(z)+z4t(z)y(z)2+x(z)x(z)=3z{[ S; T|TbT|YcY; Y|cY|abTaYYa|X; X|b|c ]⇒{[ s(z)=x(z)y(z); t(z)=zt(z)+zt(z)^2+zy(z)^2; y(z)=zy(z)^2+zy(z)+z^4t(z)y(z)^2+x(z); x(z)=3z ]..which simplifies tos(z)8−27(z3−z2)s(z)5+…+59049z10=0(z)^8-27(z^3-z^2)s(z)^5+…+59049z^10=0 Inherent
