Statement: Eberlein–Šmulian theorem: [1] If X is a Banach space and A is a subset of X, then the following statements are equivalent: each sequence of elements of A has a subsequence that is weakly convergent in X each sequence of elements of A has a weak cluster point in X the weak closure of A is weakly compact. A set A can be weakly compact in three different ways: Sequential compactness: Every sequence from A has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in A. Limit point compactness: Every infinite subset of A has a limit point in A. Compactness (or Heine-Borel compactness): Every open cover of A admits a finite subcover. The Eberlein–Šmulian theorem states that the three are equivalent on a weak topology of a Banach space. While this equivalence is true in general for a metric space, the weak topology is not metrizable in infinite dimensional vector spaces, and so the Eberlein–Šmulian theorem is needed.
