Every embedding of a complex line into the complex affine plane extends to an automorphism
In mathematics, the Abhyankar–Moh theorem states that if L is a complex line in the complex affine plane C2ℂ^2, then every embedding of L into C2ℂ^2 extends to an automorphism of the plane. It is named after Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar and Tzuong-Tsieng Moh, who published it in 1975. More generally, the same theorem applies to lines and planes over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and to certain well-behaved subsets of higher-dimensional complex affine spaces.
