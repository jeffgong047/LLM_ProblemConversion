example: x2sin⁡(1x)^2sin(1x) being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0 The limit limx→0x2sin⁡(1x)lim_x→0x^2sin(1x) cannot be determined through the limit law limx→a(f(x)⋅g(x))=limx→af(x)⋅limx→ag(x),lim_x(f(x)(x))=lim_xf(x)·lim_xg(x), because limx→0sin⁡(1x)lim_x→0sin(1x) does not exist. However, by the definition of the sine function, −1≤sin⁡(1x)≤1.-1≤sin(1x)≤1. It follows that −x2≤x2sin⁡(1x)≤x2-x^2^2sin(1x)^2 Since limx→0−x2=limx→0x2=0lim_x→0-x^2=lim_x→0x^2=0, by the squeeze theorem, limx→0x2sin⁡(1x)lim_x→0x^2sin(1x) must also be 0. Second
