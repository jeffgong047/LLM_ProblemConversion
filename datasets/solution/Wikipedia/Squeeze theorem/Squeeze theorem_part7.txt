example: It is possible to show that ddθtan⁡θ=sec2⁡θd/dθtanθ=^2θ by squeezing, as follows. In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is sec2⁡θΔθ2,^2θ Δθ/2, since the radius is sec θ and the arc on the unit circle has length Δθ. Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is sec2⁡(θ+Δθ)Δθ2.^2(θ+Δθ) Δθ/2. What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots. The length of the base of the triangle is tan(θ + Δθ) − tan θ, and the height is 1. The area of the triangle is therefore tan⁡(θ+Δθ)−tan⁡θ2.tan(θ+Δθ)-tanθ/2. From the inequalities sec2⁡θΔθ2≤tan⁡(θ+Δθ)−tan⁡θ2≤sec2⁡(θ+Δθ)Δθ2^2θ Δθ/2≤tan(θ+Δθ)-tanθ/2≤^2(θ+Δθ) Δθ/2 we deduce that sec2⁡θ≤tan⁡(θ+Δθ)−tan⁡θΔθ≤sec2⁡(θ+Δθ),^2θ≤tan(θ+Δθ)-tanθ/Δθ≤^2(θ+Δθ), provided Δθ > 0, and the inequalities are reversed if Δθ < 0. Since the first and third expressions approach sec2θ as Δθ → 0, and the middle expression approaches ddθtan⁡θ,ddθtanθ, the desired result follows. Fourth
