Illustration of the squeeze theorem When a sequence lies between two other converging sequences with the same limit, it also converges to this limit. In calculus, the squeeze theorem (also known as the sandwich theorem, among other names[a]) is a theorem regarding the limit of a function that is trapped between two other functions. The squeeze theorem is used in calculus and mathematical analysis, typically to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known. It was first used geometrically by the mathematicians Archimedes and Eudoxus in an effort to compute π, and was formulated in modern terms by Carl Friedrich Gauss.
