Statement: The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.[1] Theorem — Let I be an interval containing the point a. Let g, f, and h be functions defined on I, except possibly at a itself. Suppose that for every x in I not equal to a, we have g(x)≤f(x)≤h(x)(x)(x)(x) and also suppose that limx→ag(x)=limx→ah(x)=L.lim_xg(x)=lim_xh(x)=L. Then limx→af(x)=L.lim_xf(x)=L. The functions g and h are said to be lower and upper bounds (respectively) of f. Here, a is not required to lie in the interior of I. Indeed, if a is an endpoint of I, then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits. A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if I = (0, ∞), then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as x → ∞. This theorem is also valid for sequences. Let (an), (cn) be two sequences converging to ℓ, and (bn) a sequence. If ∀n≥N,N∈N,N∈ℕ we have an ≤ bn ≤ cn, then (bn) also converges to ℓ.
