example: The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.[3] lim(x,y)→(0,0)x2yx2+y2lim_(x,y)→(0,0)x^2y/x^2+y^2 cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since 0≤x2x2+y2≤1−|y|≤y≤|y|⟹−|y|≤x2yx2+y2≤|y|lim(x,y)→(0,0)−|y|=0lim(x,y)→(0,0)|y|=0⟹0≤lim(x,y)→(0,0)x2yx2+y2≤0[ 0 ≤ x^2/x^2+y^2 ≤ 1; -|y|≤|y| -|y| ≤ x^2y/x^2+y^2 ≤ |y|; lim_(x,y)→(0,0)-|y|=0lim_(x,y)→(0,0) y|=0 0 ≤ lim_(x,y)→(0,0)x^2y/x^2+y^2 ≤ 0 ] therefore, by the squeeze theorem, lim(x,y)→(0,0)x2yx2+y2=0.lim_(x,y)→(0,0)x^2y/x^2+y^2=0.
