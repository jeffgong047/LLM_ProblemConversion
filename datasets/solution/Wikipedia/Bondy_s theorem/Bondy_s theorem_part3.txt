Example: Consider the 4 × 4 matrix [1101010100110110][ 1 1 0 1; 0 1 0 1; 0 0 1 1; 0 1 1 0 ] where all rows are pairwise distinct. If we delete, for example, the first column, the resulting matrix [101101011110][ 1 0 1; 1 0 1; 0 1 1; 1 1 0 ] no longer has this property: the first row is identical to the second row. Nevertheless, by Bondy's theorem we know that we can always find a column that can be deleted without introducing any identical rows. In this case, we can delete the third column: all rows of the 3 × 4 matrix [111011001010][ 1 1 1; 0 1 1; 0 0 1; 0 1 0 ] are distinct. Another possibility would have been deleting the fourth column.
