application: From the perspective of computational learning theory, Bondy's theorem can be rephrased as follows:[4] Let C be a concept class over a finite domain X. Then there exists a subset S of X with the size at most |C| − 1 such that S is a witness set for every concept in C. This implies that every finite concept class C has its teaching dimension bounded by |C| − 1.
