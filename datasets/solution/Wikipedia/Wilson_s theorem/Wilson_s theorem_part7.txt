proof: The result is trivial when p = 2, so assume p is an odd prime, p ≥ 3. Since the residue classes (mod p) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a−1. Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which a ≡ a−1 (mod p) are a ≡ ±1 (mod p) (because the congruence a2 ≡ 1 can have at most two roots (mod p)). Therefore, with the exception of ±1, the factors of (p − 1)! can be arranged in disjoint pairs such that product of each pair is congruent to 1 modulo p. This proves Wilson's theorem. For example, for p = 11, one has 10!=[(1⋅10)]⋅[(2⋅6)(3⋅4)(5⋅9)(7⋅8)]≡[−1]⋅[1⋅1⋅1⋅1]≡−1(mod11).10!=[(1·10)]·[(2·6)(3·4)(5·9)(7·8)]≡[-1]·[1·1·1·1]≡-111. Proof using Fermat's little
