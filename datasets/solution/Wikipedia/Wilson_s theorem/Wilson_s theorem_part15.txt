(January 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Gauss’ generalization of Wilson’s Theorem states that if n is four, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power, then the product of relatively prime integers less than itself add one is divisible by n. It goes further to say that otherwise, the same product subtract one is divisible by n. To state Gauss' Generalization of Wilson's Theorem, we use the Euler's totient function, denoted φ(n)φ(n), which is defined as the number of positive integers less than or equal to n which are also relatively prime with n. Let's call such numbers ai_i, where gcd(ai,n)=1(a_i,n)=1. Gauss proved given an odd prime p and some integer α>0α>0, then ∏k=1φ(n)ak=−1(modn)ifn=4,pα,2pα1(modn)otherwise∏_k=1^φ(n)a_k-̄1̄n̄ ̄ ̄ ̄īf̄n̄=̄4̄,̄ ̄p̄^̄ᾱ,̄ ̄2̄p̄^̄ᾱ ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄1̄n̄ ̄ ̄ ̄ōt̄h̄ēr̄w̄īs̄ē. First, let's note this is the proof for cases n>2>2, since the results are trivial for n=1,2={1,2}. For all ai_i, we know there exist some aj_j, where i≠j and gcd(aj,n)=1(a_j,n)=1, such that aiaj=1_ia_j=1. This allows us to pair each of the elements together with its inverse. We are left now with ai_i being its own inverse. So in other words ai_i is a root of f(x)=x2−1(x)=x^2-1 in Z/nZℤ/nℤ, and f(x)=(x−1)(x+1)(x)=(x-1)(x+1), in the polynomial ring Z/nZ[X]ℤ/nℤ[X]. If ai_i is a root, it follows that n−ai-a_i is also a root. Our objective is to show that the number of roots is divisible by four, unless n=4,n=pα=4,n=p^α, or n=2pα=2p^α. Let's consider n=2=2. Then we notice we have one root since 1≡−1(mod2)1≡-12. Consider n=4=4. Then, it is clear there are two roots, specifically, x≡1(mod4)≡14 and x≡−1(mod4)≡-14. Say n=pα=p^α. It is again clear there are two solutions. We now consider n=2β,β>2=2^β,β>2. If one of the factors of f(x)(x) is divisible by 2, so is the other. Take the factor (x+1)(x+1) to be divisible by 212^1. Then, it follows that there are 4 distinct roots of f(x)(x), namely x≡1(modn)≡1n, x≡1+2β−1(modn)≡1+2^β-1n, x≡−1(modn)≡-1n, and x≡−1−2β−1(modn)≡-1-2^β-1n, when n=2β,β>2=2^β,β>2. Finally, let's look at the general case where n=2βp1γ1p2γ2…pkγk=2^βp_1^γ_1p_2^γ_2_k^γ_k. We find 2 roots of f(x)(x) over each Z/2βZℤ/2^βℤ and Z/prγrZℤ/p_r^γ_rℤ, except when β>2β>2. Using the Chinese remainder theorem, we find that when n is not divisible by 2, we have a total of 2k2^k solutions of f(x)(x). Assuming β=1β=1, in Z/2Zℤ/2ℤ, we have one root, so we still have a total of 2k2^k solutions. When β=2β=2, we have 2 roots in Z/4Zℤ/4ℤ, so there are a total of 2k+12^k+1 roots of f(x)(x). For all cases where β>2β>2, there are 4 roots in Z/2βZℤ/2^βℤ with a total of 2k+22^k+2 solutions. This shows that the number of roots are divisible by 4, unless n=4,n=pα=4,n=p^α, or n=2pα=2p^α. Say ai_i is a root of f(x)(x) in Z/nZℤ/nℤ. Then ai(n−ai)=−ai2=−1_i(n-a_i)=-a_i^2=-1. So, if the number of roots of f(x)(x) is divisible by 4, then we can say the product of the roots if 1. Otherwise, we can say the product is -1. So we can conclude that ∏k=1φ(n)ak=−1(modn)ifn=4,pα,2pα1(modn)otherwise∏_k=1^φ(n)a_k-̄1̄n̄ ̄ ̄ ̄īf̄n̄=̄4̄,̄ ̄p̄^̄ᾱ,̄ ̄2̄p̄^̄ᾱ ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄1̄n̄ ̄ ̄ ̄ōt̄h̄ēr̄w̄īs̄ē.
