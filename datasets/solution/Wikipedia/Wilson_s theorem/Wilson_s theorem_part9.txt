theorems: It is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group Sp_p has exactly (p−1)!(p-1)! elements of order p, namely the p-cycles Cp_p. On the other hand, each Sylow p-subgroup in Sp_p is a copy of Cp_p. Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is np=(p−2)!_p=(p-2)!. The third Sylow theorem implies (p−2)!≡1(modp).(p-2)!≡1p. Multiplying both sides by (p − 1) gives (p−1)!≡p−1≡−1(modp),(p-1)!-1≡-1p, that is, the result.
