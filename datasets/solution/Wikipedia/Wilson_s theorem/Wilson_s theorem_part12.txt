residues: Using Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime p = 2m + 1, we can rearrange the left hand side of 1⋅2⋯(p−1)≡−1(modp)1·2⋯(p-1) equiv­1{p to obtain the equality 1⋅(p−1)⋅2⋅(p−2)⋯m⋅(p−m)≡1⋅(−1)⋅2⋅(−2)⋯m⋅(−m)≡−1(modp).1·(p-1)·2·(p-2)·(p-m) equiv·(-1)·2·(-2)·(-m) equiv­1p. This becomes ∏j=1mj2≡(−1)m+1(modp)∏_j=1^mȷ^2 equiv(-1)^m+1p or (m!)2≡(−1)m+1(modp).(m!)^2≡(-1)^m+1p. We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the number (−1) is a square (quadratic residue) mod p. For this, suppose p = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Then we can take m = 2k above, and we conclude that (m!)2 is congruent to (−1) (mod p). Formulas for
