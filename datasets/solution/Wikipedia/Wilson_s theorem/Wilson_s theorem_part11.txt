tests: In practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (n âˆ’ 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).[citation needed] Used in the other direction, to determine the primality of the successors of large factorials, it is indeed a very fast and effective method. This is of limited utility, however.[citation needed] Quadratic
