History: This theorem was stated by Ibn al-Haytham (c. 1000 AD),[2] and, in the 18th century, by the English mathematician John Wilson.[3] Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771.[4] There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it.[5]
