theorem: Again, the result is trivial for p = 2, so suppose p is an odd prime, p ≥ 3. Consider the polynomial g(x)=(x−1)(x−2)⋯(x−(p−1)).(x)=(x-1)(x-2)⋯(x-(p-1)). g has degree p − 1, leading term xp − 1, and constant term (p − 1)!. Its p − 1 roots are 1, 2, ..., p − 1. Now consider h(x)=xp−1−1.(x)=x^p-1-1. h also has degree p − 1 and leading term xp − 1. Modulo p, Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same p − 1 roots, 1, 2, ..., p − 1. Finally, consider f(x)=g(x)−h(x).(x)=g(x)-h(x). f has degree at most p − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the p − 1 roots 1, 2, ..., p − 1. But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p − 2 roots. Therefore, f must be identically zero (mod p), so its constant term is (p − 1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). This is Wilson's theorem.
