modulus: If n is composite it is divisible by some prime number q, where 2 ≤ q ≤ n − 2. Because q divides n, let n=qk=qk for some integer k. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that (n−1)!(n-1)! were congruent to −1 (mod n) where n is composite. Then (n-1)! would also be congruent to −1 (mod q) as (n−1)!≡−1(modn)(n-1)!≡-1mod) implies that (n−1)!=nm−1=(qk)m−1=q(km)−1(n-1)!=nm-1=(qk)m-1=q(km)-1 for some integer m which shows (n-1)! being congruent to -1 (mod q). But (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q) by the fact that q is a term in (n-1)! making (n-1)! a multiple of q. A contradiction is now reached. In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if n is composite then (n − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod n). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, n = ab, where 2 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 2, then both a and b will appear in the product 1 × 2 × ... × (n − 1) = (n − 1)! and (n − 1)! will be divisible by n. If n has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime q, q > 2. But then 2q < q2 = n, both q and 2q will be factors of (n − 1)!, and again n divides (n − 1)!. Prime
