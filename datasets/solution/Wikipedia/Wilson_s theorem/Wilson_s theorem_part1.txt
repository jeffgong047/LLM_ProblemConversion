Theorem on prime numbers In algebra and number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n. That is (using the notations of modular arithmetic), the factorial (n−1)!=1×2×3×⋯×(n−1)(n-1)!=1×2×3×⋯×(n-1) satisfies (n−1)!≡−1(modn)(n-1)! equiv -1n exactly when n is a prime number. In other words, any number n is a prime number if, and only if, (n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n.[1]
