identity: Another remarkably simple and elegant consequence of the fluctuation theorem is the so-called "nonequilibrium partition identity" (NPI):[8] ⟨exp⁡[−Σ¯tt]⟩=1,forallt.⟨exp[-Σ_t t]⟩=1, forallt. Thus in spite of the Second Law Inequality which might lead you to expect that the average would decay exponentially with time, the exponential probability ratio given by the FT exactly cancels the negative exponential in the average above leading to an average which is unity for all time.
