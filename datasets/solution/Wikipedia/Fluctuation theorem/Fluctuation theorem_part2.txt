Statement: Roughly, the fluctuation theorem relates to the probability distribution of the time-averaged irreversible entropy production, denoted Σ¯tΣ_t. The theorem states that, in systems away from equilibrium over a finite time t, the ratio between the probability that Σ¯tΣ_t takes on a value A and the probability that it takes the opposite value, −A, will be exponential in At. In other words, for a finite non-equilibrium system in a finite time, the FT gives a precise mathematical expression for the probability that entropy will flow in a direction opposite to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Mathematically, the FT is expressed as: Pr(Σ¯t=A)Pr(Σ¯t=−A)=eAt.(Σ_t=A)/(Σ_t=-A)=e^At. This means that as the time or system size increases (since ΣΣ is extensive), the probability of observing an entropy production opposite to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics decreases exponentially. The FT is one of the few expressions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that is valid far from equilibrium. Note that the FT does not state that the second law of thermodynamics is wrong or invalid. The second law of thermodynamics is a statement about macroscopic systems. The FT is more general. It can be applied to both microscopic and macroscopic systems. When applied to macroscopic systems, the FT is equivalent to the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
