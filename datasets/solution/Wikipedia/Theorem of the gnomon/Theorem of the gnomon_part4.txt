extensions: geometrical representation of a division Transferring the ratio of a partition of line segment AB to line segment HG: |AH||HB|=|HP||PG||AH||HB|=|HP||PG| The theorem of the gnomon can be used to construct a new parallelogram or rectangle of equal area to a given parallelogram or rectangle by the means of straightedge and compass constructions. This also allows the representation of a division of two numbers in geometrical terms, an important feature to reformulate geometrical problems in algebraic terms. More precisely, if two numbers are given as lengths of line segments one can construct a third line segment, the length of which matches the quotient of those two numbers (see diagram). Another application is to transfer the ratio of partition of one line segment to another line segment (of different length), thus dividing that other line segment in the same ratio as a given line segment and its partition (see diagram).[1] A𝔸 is the (lower) parallepiped around the diagonal with P and its complements B𝔹, Cℂ and D𝔻 have the same volume: |B|=|C|=|D||𝔹|=|ℂ|=|𝔻| A similar statement can be made in three dimensions for parallelepipeds. In this case you have a point P on the space diagonal of a parallelepiped, and instead of two parallel lines you have three planes through P, each parallel to the faces of the parallelepiped. The three planes partition the parallelepiped into eight smaller parallelepipeds; two of those surround the diagonal and meet at P. Now each of those two parallepipeds around the diagonal has three of the remaining six parallelepipeds attached to it, and those three play the role of the complements and are of equal volume (see diagram).[2] General theorem about nested
