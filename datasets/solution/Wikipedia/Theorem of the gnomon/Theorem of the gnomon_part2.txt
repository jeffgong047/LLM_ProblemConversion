Theorem: In a parallelogram ABCD with a point P on the diagonal AC, the parallel to AD through P intersects the side CD in G and the side AB in H. Similarly the parallel to the side AB through P intersects the side AD in I and the side BC in F. Then the theorem of the gnomon states that the parallelograms HBFP and IPGD have equal areas.[1][2] Gnomon is the name for the L-shaped figure consisting of the two overlapping parallelograms ABFI and AHGD. The parallelograms of equal area HBFP and IPGD are called complements (of the parallelograms on diagonal PFCG and AHPI).[3]
