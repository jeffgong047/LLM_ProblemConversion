Proof: The proof of the theorem is straightforward if one considers the areas of the main parallelogram and the two inner parallelograms around its diagonal: first, the difference between the main parallelogram and the two inner parallelograms is exactly equal to the combined area of the two complements; second, all three of them are bisected by the diagonal. This yields:[4] |IPGD|=|ABCD|2−|AHPI|2−|PFCG|2=|HBFP||IPGD|=|ABCD|/2-|AHPI|/2-|PFCG|/2=|HBFP| Applications and
