parallelograms: general theorem:green area = blue area - red area The theorem of gnomon is special case of a more general statement about nested parallelograms with a common diagonal. For a given parallelogram ABCD consider an arbitrary inner parallelogram AFCE having AC as a diagonal as well. Furthermore there are two uniquely determined parallelograms GFHD and IBJF the sides of which are parallel to the sides of the outer parallelogram and which share the vertex F with the inner parallelogram. Now the difference of the areas of those two parallelograms is equal to area of the inner parallelogram, that is:[2] |AFCE|=|GFHD|âˆ’|IBJF||AFCE|=|GFHD|-|IBJF| This statement yields the theorem of the gnomon if one looks at a degenerate inner parallelogram AFCE whose vertices are all on the diagonal AC. This means in particular for the parallelograms GFHD and IBJF, that their common point F is on the diagonal and that the difference of their areas is zero, which is exactly what the theorem of the gnomon states.
