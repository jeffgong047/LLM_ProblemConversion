Corollaries: The conclusion of the theorem says, in particular, that the diameter of (M,g)(M,g) is finite. The Hopf-Rinow theorem therefore implies that M must be compact, as a closed (and hence compact) ball of radius π/kπ/√(k) in any tangent space is carried onto all of M by the exponential map. As a very particular case, this shows that any complete and noncompact smooth Riemannian manifold which is Einstein must have nonpositive Einstein constant. Consider the smooth universal covering map π:N→M.π:N. One may consider the Riemannian metric π*g on N.. Since ππ is a local diffeomorphism, Myers' theorem applies to the Riemannian manifold (N,π*g) and hence N is compact. This implies that the fundamental group of Mis finite. Cheng's diameter rigidity
