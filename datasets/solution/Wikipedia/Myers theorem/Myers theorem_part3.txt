theorem: The conclusion of Myers' theorem says that for any p,q∈M,,q, one has dg(p,q) ≤ π/√k. In 1975, Shiu-Yuen Cheng proved: Let (M,g)(M,g) be a complete and smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension n. If k is a positive number with Ricg ≥ (n-1)k, and if there exists p and q in M with dg(p,q) = π/√k, then (M,g) is simply-connected and has constant sectional curvature k. See
