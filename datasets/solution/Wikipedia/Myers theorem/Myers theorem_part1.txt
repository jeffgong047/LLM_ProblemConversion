Bounds the length of geodetic segments in Riemannian manifolds based in Ricci curvature Myers's theorem, also known as the Bonnet–Myers theorem, is a celebrated, fundamental theorem in the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry. It was discovered by Sumner Byron Myers in 1941. It asserts the following: Let (M,g)(M,g) be a complete Riemannian manifold of dimension n whose Ricci curvature satisfies Ric⁡(g)≥(n−1)kRic(g)≥(n-1)k for some positive real number k.. Then any two points of M can be joined by a geodesic segment of length at most πk.π/√(k). In the special case of surfaces, this result was proved by Ossian Bonnet in 1855. For a surface, the Gauss, sectional, and Ricci curvatures are all the same, but Bonnet's proof easily generalizes to higher dimensions if one assumes a positive lower bound on the sectional curvature. Myers' key contribution was therefore to show that a Ricci lower bound is all that is needed to reach the same conclusion.
