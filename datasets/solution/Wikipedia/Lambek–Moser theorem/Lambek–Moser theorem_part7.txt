integers: A variation of the theorem applies to partitions of the non-negative integers, rather than to partitions of the positive integers. For this variation, every partition corresponds to a Galois connection of the ordered non-negative integers to themselves. This is a pair of non-decreasing functions (f,f∗)(f,f^*) with the property that, for all x and y, f(x)≤y(x) if and only if x≤f(y)(y). The corresponding functions F and F∗^* are defined slightly less symmetrically by F(n)=f(n)+n(n)=f(n)+n and F∗(n)=f∗(n)+n+1^*(n)=f^*(n)+n+1. For functions defined in this way, the values of F and F∗^* (for non-negative arguments, rather than positive arguments) form a partition of the non-negative integers, and every partition can be constructed in this way.[13] Rayleigh's
