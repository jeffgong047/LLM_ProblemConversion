functions: The two functions f (rightward blue arrows) and f∗^* (leftward red arrows) arising from the partition of positive integers into primes (2, 3, 5, 7, ...) and non-primes (1, 4, 6, 8, ...). Visualization based on a method of Angel.[5] The second part of the Lambek–Moser theorem states that this construction of partitions from inverse functions is universal, in the sense that it can explain any partition of the positive integers into two infinite parts. If S=s1,s2,…=s_1,s_2,… and S∗=s1∗,s2∗,…^*=s_1^*,s_2^*,… are any two complementary increasing sequences of integers, one may construct a pair of functions f and f∗^* from which this partition may be derived using the Lambek–Moser theorem. To do so, define f(n)=sn−n(n)=s_n-n and f∗(n)=sn∗−n^*(n)=s_n^*-n.[3] One of the simplest examples to which this could be applied is the partition of positive integers into even and odd numbers. The functions F(n)(n) and F∗(n)^*(n) should give the nth even or odd number, respectively, so F(n)=2n(n)=2n and F∗(n)=2n−1^*(n)=2n-1. From these are derived the two functions f(n)=F(n)−n=n(n)=F(n)-n=n and f∗(n)=F∗(n)−n=n−1^*(n)=F^*(n)-n=n-1. They form an inverse pair, and the partition generated via the Lambek–Moser theorem from this pair is just the partition of the positive integers into even and odd numbers. Another integer partition, into evil numbers and odious numbers (by the parity of the binary representation) uses almost the same functions, adjusted by the values of the Thue–Morse sequence.[6] Limit
