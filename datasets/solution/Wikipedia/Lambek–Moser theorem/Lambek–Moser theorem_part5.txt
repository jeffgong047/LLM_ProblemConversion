proofs: The theorem was discovered by Leo Moser and Joachim Lambek, who published it in 1954. Moser and Lambek cite the previous work of Samuel Beatty on Beatty sequences as their inspiration, and also cite the work of Viggo Brun and D. H. Lehmer from the early 1930s on methods related to their limiting formula for Fâˆ—^*.[1] Edsger W. Dijkstra has provided a visual proof of the result,[10] and later another proof based on algorithmic reasoning.[11] Yuval Ginosar has provided an intuitive proof based on an analogy of two athletes running in opposite directions around a circular racetrack.[12] Related
