formula: In the same work in which they proved the Lambek–Moser theorem, Lambek and Moser provided a method of going directly from F, the function giving the nth member of a set of positive integers, to F∗^*, the function giving the nth non-member, without going through f and f∗^*. Let F#(n)^#(n) denote the number of values of x for which F(x)≤n(x); this is an approximation to the inverse function of F, but (because it uses ≤≤ in place of <<) offset by one from the type of inverse used to define f∗^* from f. Then, for any n, F∗(n)^*(n) is the limit of the sequence n,n+F#(n),n+F#(n+F#(n)),…,,n+F^#(n),n+F^#(n+F^#(n)),…, meaning that this sequence eventually becomes constant and the value it takes when it does is F∗(n)^*(n).[7] Lambek and Moser used the prime numbers as an example, following earlier work by Viggo Brun and D. H. Lehmer.[8] If π(n)π(n) is the prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to n), then the nth non-prime (1 or a composite number) is given by the limit of the sequence[7] n,n+π(n),n+π(n+π(n)),…,n+π(n),n+π(n+π(n)),… For some other sequences of integers, the corresponding limit converges in a fixed number of steps, and a direct formula for the complementary sequence is possible. In particular, the nth positive integer that is not a kth power can be obtained from the limiting formula as[9] n+⌊n+⌊nk⌋k⌋.+⌊√(n+⌊√(n)⌋)⌋. History and
