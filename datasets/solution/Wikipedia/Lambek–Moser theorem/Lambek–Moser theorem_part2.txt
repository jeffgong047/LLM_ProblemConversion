partitions: The four functions f, f∗^*, F, and F∗^*, for the two Beatty sequences 1, 3, 4, 6, ... and 2, 5, 7, 10, ... . These sequences round down the integer multiples of φφ and φ+1φ+1, where φφ is the golden ratio. Let f be any function from positive integers to non-negative integers that is both non-decreasing (each value in the sequence f(1),f(2),f(3),…(1),f(2),f(3),… is at least as large as any earlier value) and unbounded (it eventually increases past any fixed value). The sequence of its values may skip some numbers, so it might not have an inverse function with the same properties. Instead, define a non-decreasing and unbounded integer function f∗^* that is as close as possible to the inverse in the sense that, for all positive integers n, f(f∗(n))<n≤f(f∗(n)+1).(f^*(n))<n(f^*(n)+1). Equivalently, f∗(n)^*(n) may be defined as the number of values x for which f(x)<n(x)<n. It follows from either of these definitions that f∗∗=f^*^*=f.[3] If the two functions f and f∗^* are plotted as histograms, they form mirror images of each other across the diagonal line x=y=y.[4] From these two functions f and f∗^*, define two more functions F and F∗^*, from positive integers to positive integers, by F(n)=f(n)+nF∗(n)=f∗(n)+nF(n) =f(n)+n F^*(n) =f^*(n)+n Then the first part of the Lambek–Moser theorem states that each positive integer occurs exactly once among the values of either F or F∗^*. That is, the values obtained from F and the values obtained from F∗^* form two complementary sets of positive integers. More strongly, each of these two functions maps its argument n to the nth member of its set in the partition.[3] As an example of the construction of a partition from a function, let f(n)=n2(n)=n^2, the function that squares its argument. Then its inverse is the square root function, whose closest integer approximation (in the sense used for the Lambek–Moser theorem) is f∗(n)=⌊n−1⌋^*(n)=⌊√(n-1)⌋. These two functions give F(n)=n2+n(n)=n^2+n and F∗(n)=⌊n−1⌋+n.^*(n)=⌊√(n-1)⌋+n. For n=1,2,3,…=1,2,3,… the values of F are the pronic numbers 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, ... while the values of F∗^* are 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, .... These two sequences are complementary: each positive integer belongs to exactly one of them.[4] The Lambek–Moser theorem states that this phenomenon is not specific to the pronic numbers, but rather it arises for any choice of f with the appropriate properties.[3] From partitions to
