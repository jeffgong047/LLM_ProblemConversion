theorem: Main article: Beatty sequence Rayleigh's theorem states that for two positive irrational numbers r and s, both greater than one, with 1r+1s=11r+1s=1, the two sequences ⌊i⋅r⌋⌋ and ⌊i⋅s⌋⋯⌋ for i=1,2,3,…=1,2,3,…, obtained by rounding down to an integer the multiples of r and s, are complementary. It can be seen as an instance of the Lambek–Moser theorem with f(n)=⌊rn⌋−n(n)=⌋-n and f∗(n)=⌊sn⌋−n^∗(n)=⌋-n. The condition that r and s be greater than one implies that these two functions are non-decreasing; the derived functions are F(n)=⌊rn⌋(n)=⌋ and F∗(n)=⌊sn⌋.^*(n)=⌋. The sequences of values of F and F∗^* forming the derived partition are known as Beatty sequences, after Samuel Beatty's 1926 rediscovery of Rayleigh's theorem.[14] See
