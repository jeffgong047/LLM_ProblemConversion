Lemma: As a further step, we show that G≈G′' if and only if G+G′+G' is a P𝒫-position. In the forward direction, suppose that G≈G′'. Applying the definition of equivalence with H=G=G, we find that G′+G'+G (which is equal to G+G′+G' by commutativity of addition) is in the same outcome class as G+G+G. But G+G+G must be a P𝒫-position: for every move made in one copy of G, the previous player can respond with the same move in the other copy, and so always make the last move. In the reverse direction, since A=G+G′=G+G' is a P𝒫-position by hypothesis, it follows from the first lemma, G≈G+A+A, that G≈G+(G+G′)+(G+G'). Similarly, since B=G+G=G+G is also a P𝒫-position, it follows from the first lemma in the form G′≈G′+B''+B that G′≈G′+(G+G)''+(G+G). By associativity and commutativity, the right-hand sides of these results are equal. Furthermore, ≈≈ is an equivalence relation because equality is an equivalence relation on outcome classes. Via the transitivity of ≈≈, we can conclude that G≈G′'.
