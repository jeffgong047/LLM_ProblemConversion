Game: Sizes of heaps Moves A B C 1 2 2 Alice takes 1 from A 0 2 2 Bob takes 1 from B 0 1 2 Alice takes 1 from C 0 1 1 Bob takes 1 from B 0 0 1 Alice takes 1 from C 0 0 0 Bob has no moves, so Alice wins At step 6 of the game (when all of the heaps are empty) the position is {}, because Bob has no valid moves to make. We name this position ∗0*0. At step 5, Alice had exactly one option: to remove one object from heap C, leaving Bob with no moves. Since her move leaves Bob in position ∗0*0, her position is written ∗0{*0}. We name this position ∗1*1. At step 4, Bob had two options: remove one from B or remove one from C. Note, however, that it didn't really matter which heap Bob removed the object from: Either way, Alice would be left with exactly one object in exactly one pile. So, using our recursive definition, Bob really only has one move: ∗1*1. Thus, Bob's position is ∗1{*1}. At step 3, Alice had 3 options: remove two from C, remove one from C, or remove one from B. Removing two from C leaves Bob in position ∗1*1. Removing one from C leaves Bob with two piles, each of size one, i.e., position ∗1{*1}, as described in step 4. However, removing 1 from B would leave Bob with two objects in a single pile. His moves would then be ∗0*0 and ∗1*1, so her move would result in the position ∗0,∗1{*0,*1}. We call this position ∗2*2. Alice's position is then the set of all her moves: ∗1,∗1,∗2{*1,{*1},*2}. Following the same recursive logic, at step 2, Bob's position is ∗1,∗1,∗2,∗2.{{*1,{*1},*2},*2}. Finally, at step 1, Alice's position is ∗1,∗1,∗2,∗2,∗1,∗1,∗2,∗1,∗1,∗1,∗1,∗2.{{*1,{*1},*2},{*2,{*1,{*1},*2}},{{*1},{{*1}},{*1,{*1},*2}}}.
