Game: Sizes of heaps Moves A B C A' B' C' 1 2 2 1 1 1 Alice takes 1 from A 0 2 2 1 1 1 Bob takes 1 from A' 0 2 2 0 1 1 Alice takes 1 from B' 0 2 2 0 0 1 Bob takes 1 from C' 0 2 2 0 0 0 Alice takes 2 from B 0 0 2 0 0 0 Bob takes 2 from C 0 0 0 0 0 0 Alice has no moves, so Bob wins. To differentiate between the two games, for the first example game, we'll label its starting position SS, and color it blue: S=∗1,∗1,∗2,∗2,∗1,∗1,∗2,∗1,∗1,∗1,∗1,∗2S={{*1,{*1},*2},{*2,{*1,{*1},*2}},{{*1},{{*1}},{*1,{*1},*2}}} For the second example game, we'll label the starting position S′S' and color it red: S′=∗1.S'={{*1}}. To compute the starting position of the combined game, remember that a player can either make a move in the first game, leaving the second game untouched, or make a move in the second game, leaving the first game untouched. So the combined game's starting position is: S+S′=S+∗1∪S′+∗1,∗1,∗2,S′+∗2,∗1,∗1,∗2,S′+∗1,∗1,∗1,∗1,∗2S+S'={S+{*1}}∪{S'+{*1,{*1},*2},S'+{*2,{*1,{*1},*2}},S'+{{*1},{{*1}},{*1,{*1},*2}}} The explicit formula for adding positions is: S+S′=S+s′∣s′∈S′∪s+S′∣s∈S+S'={S+s'''}∪{s+S'}, which means that addition is both commutative and associative.
