Lemma: As an intermediate step to proving the main theorem, we show that for every position G and every P𝒫-position A, the equivalence G≈A+G+G holds. By the above definition of equivalence, this amounts to showing that G+H+H and A+G+H+G+H share an outcome class for all H. Suppose that G+H+H is a P𝒫-position. Then the previous player has a winning strategy for A+G+H+G+H: respond to moves in A according to their winning strategy for A (which exists by virtue of A being a P𝒫-position), and respond to moves in G+H+H according to their winning strategy for G+H+H (which exists for the analogous reason). So A+G+H+G+H must also be a P𝒫-position. On the other hand, if G+H+H is an N𝒩-position, then A+G+H+G+H is also an N𝒩-position, because the next player has a winning strategy: choose a P𝒫-position from among the G+H+H options, and we conclude from the previous paragraph that adding A to that position is still a P𝒫-position. Thus, in this case, A+G+H+G+H must be a N𝒩-position, just like G+H+H. As these are the only two cases, the lemma holds. Second
