Nimbers: The special names ∗0*0, ∗1*1, and ∗2*2 referenced in our example game are called nimbers. In general, the nimber ∗n*n corresponds to the position in a game of nim where there are exactly n objects in exactly one heap. Formally, nimbers are defined inductively as follows: ∗0*0 is {}, ∗1=∗0*1={*0}, ∗2=∗0,∗1*2={*0,*1} and for all n≥0≥0, ∗(n+1)=∗n∪∗n*(n+1)=*n∪{*n}. While the word nimber comes from the game nim, nimbers can be used to describe the positions of any finite, impartial game, and in fact, the Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every instance of a finite, impartial game can be associated with a single nimber.
