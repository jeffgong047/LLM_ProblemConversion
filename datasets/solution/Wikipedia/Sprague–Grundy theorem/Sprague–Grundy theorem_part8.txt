Equivalence: Positions in impartial games fall into two outcome classes: either the next player (the one whose turn it is) wins (an N𝒩- position), or the previous player wins (a P𝒫- position). So, for example, ∗0*0 is a P𝒫-position, while ∗1*1 is an N𝒩-position. Two positions G and G′' are equivalent if, no matter what position H is added to them, they are always in the same outcome class. Formally, G≈G′' if and only if ∀H, G+H+H is in the same outcome class as G′+H'+H. To use our running examples, notice that in both the first and second games above, we can show that on every turn, Alice has a move that forces Bob into a P𝒫-position. Thus, both SS and S′S' are N𝒩-positions. (Notice that in the combined game, Bob is the player with the N𝒩-positions. In fact, S+S′S+S' is a P𝒫-position, which as we will see in Lemma 2, means S≈S′S≈S'.) First
