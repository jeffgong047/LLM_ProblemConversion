Proof: We prove that all positions are equivalent to a nimber by structural induction. The more specific result, that the given game's initial position must be equivalent to a nimber, shows that the game is itself equivalent to a nimber. Consider a position G=G1,G2,…,Gk={G_1,G_2,…,G_k}. By the induction hypothesis, all of the options are equivalent to nimbers, say Gi≈∗ni_i≈*n_i. So let G′=∗n1,∗n2,…,∗nk'={*n_1,*n_2,…,*n_k}. We will show that G≈∗m≈*m, where m is the mex (minimum exclusion) of the numbers n1,n2,…,nk_1,n_2,…,n_k, that is, the smallest non-negative integer not equal to some ni_i. The first thing we need to note is that G≈G′', by way of the second lemma. If k is zero, the claim is trivially true. Otherwise, consider G+G′+G'. If the next player makes a move to Gi_i in G, then the previous player can move to ∗ni*n_i in G′', and conversely if the next player makes a move in G′'. After this, the position is a P𝒫-position by the lemma's forward implication. Therefore, G+G′+G' is a P𝒫-position, and, citing the lemma's reverse implication, G≈G′'. Now let us show that G′+∗m'+*m is a P𝒫-position, which, using the second lemma once again, means that G′≈∗m'≈*m. We do so by giving an explicit strategy for the previous player. Suppose that G′' and ∗m*m are empty. Then G′+∗m'+*m is the null set, clearly a P𝒫-position. Or consider the case that the next player moves in the component ∗m*m to the option ∗m′*m' where m′<m'<m. Because m was the minimum excluded number, the previous player can move in G′' to ∗m′*m'. And, as shown before, any position plus itself is a P𝒫-position. Finally, suppose instead that the next player moves in the component G′' to the option ∗ni*n_i. If ni<m_i<m then the previous player moves in ∗m*m to ∗ni*n_i; otherwise, if ni>m_i>m, the previous player moves in ∗ni*n_i to ∗m*m; in either case the result is a position plus itself. (It is not possible that ni=m_i=m because m was defined to be different from all the ni_i.) In summary, we have G≈G′' and G′≈∗m'≈*m. By transitivity, we conclude that G≈∗m≈*m, as desired.
