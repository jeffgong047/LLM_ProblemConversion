(May 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The original example was a special case of the problem of product spaces, to which the disintegration theorem applies. When Y is written as a Cartesian product Y=X1×X2=X_1_2 and πi:Y→Xiπ_i:Y_i is the natural projection, then each fibre π1−1(x1)π_1^-1(x_1) can be canonically identified with X2_2 and there exists a Borel family of probability measures μx1x1∈X1{μ_x_1}_x_1_1 in P(X2)𝒫(X_2) (which is (π1)∗(μ)(π_1)_*(μ)-almost everywhere uniquely determined) such that μ=∫X1μx1μ(π1−1(dx1))=∫X1μx1d(π1)∗(μ)(x1),μ=∫_X_1μ_x_1 μ(π_1^-1(dx_1))=∫_X_1μ_x_1 d(π_1)_*(μ)(x_1), which is in particular[clarification needed] ∫X1×X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx1,dx2)=∫X1(∫X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx2|x1))μ(π1−1(dx1))∫_X_1_2f(x_1,x_2) μ(dx_1,dx_2)=∫_X_1(∫_X_2f(x_1,x_2)μ(dx_2|x_1))μ(π_1^-1(dx_1)) and μ(A×B)=∫Aμ(B|x1)μ(π1−1(dx1)).μ(A)=∫_Aμ(B|x_1) μ(π_1^-1(dx_1)). The relation to conditional expectation is given by the identities E⁡(f|π1)(x1)=∫X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx2|x1),E(f|π_1)(x_1)=∫_X_2f(x_1,x_2)μ(dx_2|x_1), μ(A×B|π1)(x1)=1A(x1)⋅μ(B|x1).μ(A|π_1)(x_1)=1_A(x_1)·μ(B|x_1).
