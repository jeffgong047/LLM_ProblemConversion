calculus: The disintegration theorem can also be seen as justifying the use of a "restricted" measure in vector calculus. For instance, in Stokes' theorem as applied to a vector field flowing through a compact surface Σ⊂R3Σ⊂ℝ^3, it is implicit that the "correct" measure on ΣΣ is the disintegration of three-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ3λ^3 on ΣΣ, and that the disintegration of this measure on ∂Σ is the same as the disintegration of λ3λ^3 on ∂Σ∂Σ.[2] Conditional
