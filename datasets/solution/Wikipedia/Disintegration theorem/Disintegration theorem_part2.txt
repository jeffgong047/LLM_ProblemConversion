Motivation: Consider the unit square in the Euclidean plane R2ℝ^2, S=[0,1]×[0,1]=[0,1]×[0,1]. Consider the probability measure μμ defined on S by the restriction of two-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ2λ^2 to S. That is, the probability of an event E⊆S is simply the area of E. We assume E is a measurable subset of S. Consider a one-dimensional subset of S such as the line segment Lx=x×[0,1]_x={x}×[0,1]. Lx_x has μμ-measure zero; every subset of Lx_x is a μμ-null set; since the Lebesgue measure space is a complete measure space, E⊆Lx⟹μ(E)=0._xμ(E)=0. While true, this is somewhat unsatisfying. It would be nice to say that μμ "restricted to" Lx_x is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ1λ^1, rather than the zero measure. The probability of a "two-dimensional" event E could then be obtained as an integral of the one-dimensional probabilities of the vertical "slices" E∩Lx_x: more formally, if μxμ_x denotes one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on Lx_x, then μ(E)=∫[0,1]μx(E∩Lx)dxμ(E)=∫_[0,1]μ_x(E_x) dx for any "nice" E⊆S. The disintegration theorem makes this argument rigorous in the context of measures on metric spaces. Statement of the
