theorem: (Hereafter, P(X)𝒫(X) will denote the collection of Borel probability measures on a topological space (X,T)(X,T).) The assumptions of the theorem are as follows: Let Y and X be two Radon spaces (i.e. a topological space such that every Borel probability measure on it is inner regular, e.g. separably metrizable spaces; in particular, every probability measure on it is outright a Radon measure). Let μ∈P(Y)μ∈𝒫(Y). Let π:Y→Xπ:Y be a Borel-measurable function. Here one should think of ππ as a function to "disintegrate" Y, in the sense of partitioning Y into π−1(x)|x∈X{π^-1(x)}. For example, for the motivating example above, one can define π((a,b))=aπ((a,b))=a, (a,b)∈[0,1]×[0,1](a,b)∈[0,1]×[0,1], which gives that π−1(a)=a×[0,1]π^-1(a)=a×[0,1], a slice we want to capture. Let ν∈P(X)ν∈𝒫(X) be the pushforward measure ν=π∗(μ)=μ∘π−1ν=π_*(μ)=μ∘π^-1. This measure provides the distribution of x (which corresponds to the events π−1(x)π^-1(x)). The conclusion of the theorem: There exists a νν-almost everywhere uniquely determined family of probability measures μxx∈X⊆P(Y){μ_x}_x⊆𝒫(Y), which provides a "disintegration" of μμ into μxx∈X{μ_x}_x, such that: the function x↦μx↦μ_x is Borel measurable, in the sense that x↦μx(B)↦μ_x(B) is a Borel-measurable function for each Borel-measurable set B⊆Y; μxμ_x "lives on" the fiber π−1(x)π^-1(x): for νν-almost all x∈X, μx(Y∖π−1(x))=0,μ_x(Y∖π^-1(x))=0, and so μx(E)=μx(E∩π−1(x))μ_x(E)=μ_x(E∩π^-1(x)); for every Borel-measurable function f:Y→[0,∞]:Y→[0,∞], ∫Yf(y)dμ(y)=∫X∫π−1(x)f(y)dμx(y)dν(x).∫_Yf(y) dμ(y)=∫_X∫_π^-1(x)f(y) dμ_x(y)dν(x). In particular, for any event E⊆Y, taking f to be the indicator function of E,[1] μ(E)=∫Xμx(E)dν(x).μ(E)=∫_Xμ_x(E) dν(x).
