In formal language theory, the Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about representing a given context-free language in terms of two simpler languages. These two simpler languages, namely a regular language and a Dyck language, are combined by means of an intersection and a homomorphism.
A few notions from formal language theory are in order. A context-free language is regular, if it can be described by a regular expression, or, equivalently, if it is accepted by a finite automaton. A homomorphism is based on a function h which maps symbols from an alphabet ΓΓ to words over another alphabet ΣΣ; If the domain of this function is extended to words over ΓΓ in the natural way, by letting h(xy)=h(x)h(y)(xy)=h(x)h(y) for all words x and y, this yields a homomorphism h:Γ∗→Σ∗:Γ^*→Σ^*. A matched alphabet T∪T¯∪T is an alphabet with two equal-sized sets; it is convenient to think of it as a set of parentheses types, where T contains the opening parenthesis symbols, whereas the symbols in T¯T contains the closing parenthesis symbols. For a matched alphabet T∪T¯∪T, the Dyck language DT_T is given by

DT=w∈(T∪T¯)∗∣wisacorrectlynestedsequenceofparentheses._T={ w∈(T∪T)^*isacorrectlynestedsequenceofparentheses }.
Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. A language L over the alphabet ΣΣ is context-free if and only if there exists

a matched alphabet T∪T¯∪T
a regular language R over T∪T¯∪T,
and a homomorphism h:(T∪T¯)∗→Σ∗:(T∪T)^*→Σ^*
such that L=h(DT∩R)=h(D_T).
Proofs of this theorem are found in several textbooks, e.g. Autebert, Berstel & Boasson (1997) or Davis, Sigal & Weyuker (1994).
