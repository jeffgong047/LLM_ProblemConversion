Mathematical theorem In mathematics, Kōmura's theorem is a result on the differentiability of absolutely continuous Banach space-valued functions, and is a substantial generalization of Lebesgue's theorem on the differentiability of the indefinite integral, which is that Φ : [0, T] → R given by Φ(t)=∫0tφ(s)ds,Φ(t)=∫_0^tφ(s) ds, is differentiable at t for almost every 0 < t < T when φ : [0, T] → R lies in the Lp space L1([0, T]; R).
