Generalizations: The Kervaire–Milnor theorem (Kervaire & Milnor 1960) states that if ΣΣ is a characteristic sphere in a smooth compact 4-manifold M, then signature⁡(M)=Σ⋅Σmod16signature(M)=Σ·Σ16. A characteristic sphere is an embedded 2-sphere whose homology class represents the Stiefel–Whitney class w2(M)_2(M). If w2(M)_2(M) vanishes, we can take ΣΣ to be any small sphere, which has self intersection number 0, so Rokhlin's theorem follows. The Freedman–Kirby theorem (Freedman & Kirby 1978) states that if ΣΣ is a characteristic surface in a smooth compact 4-manifold M, then signature⁡(M)=Σ⋅Σ+8Arf⁡(M,Σ)mod16signature(M)=Σ·Σ+8Arf(M,Σ)16. where Arf⁡(M,Σ)Arf(M,Σ) is the Arf invariant of a certain quadratic form on H1(Σ,Z/2Z)_1(Σ,ℤ/2ℤ). This Arf invariant is obviously 0 if ΣΣ is a sphere, so the Kervaire–Milnor theorem is a special case. A generalization of the Freedman-Kirby theorem to topological (rather than smooth) manifolds states that signature⁡(M)=Σ⋅Σ+8Arf⁡(M,Σ)+8ks⁡(M)mod16signature(M)=Σ·Σ+8Arf(M,Σ)+8ks(M)16, where ks⁡(M)ks(M) is the Kirby–Siebenmann invariant of M. The Kirby–Siebenmann invariant of M is 0 if M is smooth. Armand Borel and Friedrich Hirzebruch proved the following theorem: If X is a smooth compact spin manifold of dimension divisible by 4 then the Â genus is an integer, and is even if the dimension of X is 4 mod 8. This can be deduced from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem: Michael Atiyah and Isadore Singer showed that the Â genus is the index of the Atiyah–Singer operator, which is always integral, and is even in dimensions 4 mod 8. For a 4-dimensional manifold, the Hirzebruch signature theorem shows that the signature is −8 times the Â genus, so in dimension 4 this implies Rokhlin's theorem. Ochanine (1980) proved that if X is a compact oriented smooth spin manifold of dimension 4 mod 8, then its signature is divisible by 16.
