Examples: The intersection form on M QM:H2(M,Z)×H2(M,Z)→Z_M^2(M,ℤ)^2(M,ℤ)→ℤ is unimodular on Zℤ by Poincaré duality, and the vanishing of w2(M)_2(M) implies that the intersection form is even. By a theorem of Cahit Arf, any even unimodular lattice has signature divisible by 8, so Rokhlin's theorem forces one extra factor of 2 to divide the signature. A K3 surface is compact, 4 dimensional, and w2(M)_2(M) vanishes, and the signature is −16, so 16 is the best possible number in Rokhlin's theorem. A complex surface in CP3ℂℙ^3 of degree d is spin if and only if d is even. It has signature (4−d2)d/3(4-d^2)d/3, which can be seen from Friedrich Hirzebruch's signature theorem. The case d=4=4 gives back the last example of a K3 surface. Michael Freedman's E8 manifold is a simply connected compact topological manifold with vanishing w2(M)_2(M) and intersection form E8_8 of signature 8. Rokhlin's theorem implies that this manifold has no smooth structure. This manifold shows that Rokhlin's theorem fails for the set of merely topological (rather than smooth) manifolds. If the manifold M is simply connected (or more generally if the first homology group has no 2-torsion), then the vanishing of w2(M)_2(M) is equivalent to the intersection form being even. This is not true in general: an Enriques surface is a compact smooth 4 manifold and has even intersection form II1,9 of signature −8 (not divisible by 16), but the class w2(M)_2(M) does not vanish and is represented by a torsion element in the second cohomology group.
