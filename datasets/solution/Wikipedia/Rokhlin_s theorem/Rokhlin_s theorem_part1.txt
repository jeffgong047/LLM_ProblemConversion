On the intersection form of a smooth, closed 4-manifold with a spin structure In 4-dimensional topology, a branch of mathematics, Rokhlin's theorem states that if a smooth, orientable, closed 4-manifold M has a spin structure (or, equivalently, the second Stiefelâ€“Whitney class w2(M)_2(M) vanishes), then the signature of its intersection form, a quadratic form on the second cohomology group H2(M)^2(M), is divisible by 16. The theorem is named for Vladimir Rokhlin, who proved it in 1952.
