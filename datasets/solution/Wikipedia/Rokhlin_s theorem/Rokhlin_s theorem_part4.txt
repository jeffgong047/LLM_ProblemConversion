invariant: Since Rokhlin's theorem states that the signature of a spin smooth manifold is divisible by 16, the definition of the Rokhlin invariant is deduced as follows: For 3-manifold N and a spin structure s on N, the Rokhlin invariant μ(N,s)μ(N,s) in Z/16Zℤ/16ℤ is defined to be the signature of any smooth compact spin 4-manifold with spin boundary (N,s)(N,s). If N is a spin 3-manifold then it bounds a spin 4-manifold M. The signature of M is divisible by 8, and an easy application of Rokhlin's theorem shows that its value mod 16 depends only on N and not on the choice of M. Homology 3-spheres have a unique spin structure so we can define the Rokhlin invariant of a homology 3-sphere to be the element sign⁡(M)/8sign(M)/8 of Z/2Zℤ/2ℤ, where M any spin 4-manifold bounding the homology sphere. For example, the Poincaré homology sphere bounds a spin 4-manifold with intersection form E8_8, so its Rokhlin invariant is 1. This result has some elementary consequences: the Poincaré homology sphere does not admit a smooth embedding in S4^4, nor does it bound a Mazur manifold. More generally, if N is a spin 3-manifold (for example, any Z/2Zℤ/2ℤ homology sphere), then the signature of any spin 4-manifold M with boundary N is well defined mod 16, and is called the Rokhlin invariant of N. On a topological 3-manifold N, the generalized Rokhlin invariant refers to the function whose domain is the spin structures on N, and which evaluates to the Rokhlin invariant of the pair (N,s)(N,s) where s is a spin structure on N. The Rokhlin invariant of M is equal to half the Casson invariant mod 2. The Casson invariant is viewed as the Z-valued lift of the Rokhlin invariant of integral homology 3-sphere.
