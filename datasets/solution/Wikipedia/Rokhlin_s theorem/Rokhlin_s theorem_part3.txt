Proofs: Rokhlin's theorem can be deduced from the fact that the third stable homotopy group of spheres π3Sπ_3^S is cyclic of order 24; this is Rokhlin's original approach. It can also be deduced from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. See Â genus and Rochlin's theorem. Robion Kirby (1989) gives a geometric proof. The Rokhlin
