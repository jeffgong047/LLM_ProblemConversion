History: Gauss's diary entry related to sum of triangular numbers (1796) The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it, in 1638, without proof, promising to write it in a separate work that never appeared.[1] Joseph Louis Lagrange proved the square case in 1770, which states that every positive number can be represented as a sum of four squares, for example, 7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1.[1] Gauss proved the triangular case in 1796, commemorating the occasion by writing in his diary the line "ΕΥΡΗΚΑ! num = Δ + Δ + Δ",[2] and published a proof in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. For this reason, Gauss's result is sometimes known as the Eureka theorem.[3] The full polygonal number theorem was not resolved until it was finally proven by Cauchy in 1813.[1] The proof of Nathanson (1987) is based on the following lemma due to Cauchy: For odd positive integers a and b such that b2 < 4a and 3a < b2 + 2b + 4 we can find nonnegative integers s, t, u, and v such that a = s2 + t2 + u2 + v2 and b = s + t + u + v.
