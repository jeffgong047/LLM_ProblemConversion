representations: Main article: Jacobi's four-square theorem The number of representations of a natural number n as the sum of four squares of integers is denoted by r4(n). Jacobi's four-square theorem states that this is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function), i.e. r4(n)=8∑m∣nmifnisodd24∑m|nmoddmifniseven._4(n)=8∑_mm ifnisodd 24∑_[ m|n; modd ]m ifniseven. Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e. r4(n)=8∑m:4∤m∣nm._4(n)=8∑_m : 4m. We may also write this as r4(n)=8σ(n)−32σ(n/4),_4(n)=8σ(n)-32σ(n/4) where the second term is to be taken as zero if n is not divisible by 4. In particular, for a prime number p we have the explicit formula r4(p) = 8(p + 1).[13] Some values of r4(n) occur infinitely often as r4(n) = r4(2mn) whenever n is even. The values of r4(n)/n can be arbitrarily large: indeed, r4(n)/n is infinitely often larger than 8√log n.[13]
