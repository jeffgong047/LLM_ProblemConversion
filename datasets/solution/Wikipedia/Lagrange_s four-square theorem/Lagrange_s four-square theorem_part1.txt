Every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares For Lagrange's identity, see Lagrange's identity (disambiguation). For Lagrange's theorem, see Lagrange's theorem (disambiguation). "four-square theorem" and "four square theorem" redirect here. For other uses, see four square (disambiguation). Unlike in three dimensions in which distances between vertices of a polycube with unit edges excludes âˆš7 due to Legendre's three-square theorem, Lagrange's four-square theorem states that the analogue in four dimensions yields square roots of every natural number Lagrange's four-square theorem, also known as Bachet's conjecture, states that every natural number can be represented as a sum of four non-negative integer squares.[1] That is, the squares form an additive basis of order four. p=a2+b2+c2+d2=a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 where the four numbers a,b,c,d,b,c,d are integers. For illustration, 3, 31, and 310 in several ways, can be represented as the sum of four squares as follows: 3=12+12+12+0231=52+22+12+12310=172+42+22+12=162+72+22+12=152+92+22+02=122+112+62+32.3 =1^2+1^2+1^2+0^2 31 =5^2+2^2+1^2+1^2 310 =17^2+4^2+2^2+1^2 =16^2+7^2+2^2+1^2 =15^2+9^2+2^2+0^2 =12^2+11^2+6^2+3^2. This theorem was proven by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1770. It is a special case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem. Historical
