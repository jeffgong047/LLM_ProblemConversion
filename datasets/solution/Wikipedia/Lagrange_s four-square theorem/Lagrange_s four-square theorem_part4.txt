proof: Several very similar modern versions[4][5][6] of Lagrange's proof exist. The proof below is a slightly simplified version, in which the cases for which m is even or odd do not require separate arguments. The classical proof It is sufficient to prove the theorem for every odd prime number p. This immediately follows from Euler's four-square identity (and from the fact that the theorem is true for the numbers 1 and 2). The residues of a2 modulo p are distinct for every a between 0 and (p − 1)/2 (inclusive). To see this, take some a and define c as a2 mod p. a is a root of the polynomial x2 − c over the field Z/pZ. So is p − a (which is different from a). In a field K, any polynomial of degree n has at most n distinct roots (Lagrange's theorem (number theory)), so there are no other a with this property, in particular not among 0 to (p − 1)/2. Similarly, for b taking integral values between 0 and (p − 1)/2 (inclusive), the −b2 − 1 are distinct. By the pigeonhole principle, there are a and b in this range, for which a2 and −b2 − 1 are congruent modulo p, that is for which a2+b2+12+02=np.^2+b^2+1^2+0^2=np. Now let m be the smallest positive integer such that mp is the sum of four squares, x12 + x22 + x32 + x42 (we have just shown that there is some m (namely n) with this property, so there is a least one m, and it is smaller than p). We show by contradiction that m equals 1: supposing it is not the case, we prove the existence of a positive integer r less than m, for which rp is also the sum of four squares (this is in the spirit of the infinite descent[7] method of Fermat). For this purpose, we consider for each xi the yi which is in the same residue class modulo m and between (–m + 1)/2 and m/2 (possibly included). It follows that y12 + y22 + y32 + y42 = mr, for some strictly positive integer r less than m. Finally, another appeal to Euler's four-square identity shows that mpmr = z12 + z22 + z32 + z42. But the fact that each xi is congruent to its corresponding yi implies that all of the zi are divisible by m. Indeed, z1=x1y1+x2y2+x3y3+x4y4≡x12+x22+x32+x42=mp≡0(modm),z2=x1y2−x2y1+x3y4−x4y3≡x1x2−x2x1+x3x4−x4x3=0(modm),z3=x1y3−x2y4−x3y1+x4y2≡x1x3−x2x4−x3x1+x4x2=0(modm),z4=x1y4+x2y3−x3y2−x4y1≡x1x4+x2x3−x3x2−x4x1=0(modm).z_1 =x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3+x_4y_4 _1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2 =mp≡0 m, z_2 =x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_3y_4-x_4y_3 _1x_2-x_2x_1+x_3x_4-x_4x_3 =0 m, z_3 =x_1y_3-x_2y_4-x_3y_1+x_4y_2 _1x_3-x_2x_4-x_3x_1+x_4x_2 =0 m, z_4 =x_1y_4+x_2y_3-x_3y_2-x_4y_1 _1x_4+x_2x_3-x_3x_2-x_4x_1 =0 m. It follows that, for wi = zi/m, w12 + w22 + w32 + w42 = rp, and this is in contradiction with the minimality of m. In the descent above, we must rule out both the case y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = m/2 (which would give r = m and no descent), and also the case y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = 0 (which would give r = 0 rather than strictly positive). For both of those cases, one can check that mp = x12 + x22 + x32 + x42 would be a multiple of m2, contradicting the fact that p is a prime greater than m. Proof using the Hurwitz
