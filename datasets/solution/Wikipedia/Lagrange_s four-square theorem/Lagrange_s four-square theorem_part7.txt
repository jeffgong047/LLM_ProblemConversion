Algorithms: In 1986, Michael O. Rabin and Jeffrey Shallit[11] proposed randomized polynomial-time algorithms for computing a single representation n=x12+x22+x32+x42=x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2 for a given integer n, in expected running time O(log⁡(n)2)O(log(n)^2). It was further improved to O(log⁡(n)2log⁡(log⁡(n))−1)O(log(n)^2log(log(n))^-1) by Paul Pollack and Enrique Treviño in 2018.[12] Number of
