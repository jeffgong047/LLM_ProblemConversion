Generalizations: Lagrange's four-square theorem is a special case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem and Waring's problem. Another possible generalization is the following problem: Given natural numbers a,b,c,d,b,c,d, can we solve n=ax12+bx22+cx32+dx42=ax_1^2+bx_2^2+cx_3^2+dx_4^2 for all positive integers n in integers x1,x2,x3,x4_1,x_2,x_3,x_4? The case a=b=c=d=1=b=c=d=1 is answered in the positive by Lagrange's four-square theorem. The general solution was given by Ramanujan.[9] He proved that if we assume, without loss of generality, that a≤b≤c≤d then there are exactly 54 possible choices for a,b,c,d,b,c,d such that the problem is solvable in integers x1,x2,x3,x4_1,x_2,x_3,x_4 for all n. (Ramanujan listed a 55th possibility a=1,b=2,c=5,d=5=1,b=2,c=5,d=5, but in this case the problem is not solvable if n=15=15.[10])
