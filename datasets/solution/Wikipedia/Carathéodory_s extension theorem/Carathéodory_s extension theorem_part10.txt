sketch: First extend μμ to an outer measure μ∗μ^* on the power set 2X2^X of X by μ∗(T)=inf∑nμ(Sn):T⊆∪nSnwithS1,S2,…∈Rμ^*(T)=inf{∑_nμ(S_n):T⊆∪_nS_nwithS_1,S_2,…} and then restrict it to the set Bℬ of μ∗μ^*-measurable sets (that is, Carathéodory-measurable sets), which is the set of all M⊆X such that μ∗(S)=μ∗(S∩M)+μ∗(S∩Mc)μ^*(S)=μ^*(S)+μ^*(S^c) for every S⊆X.. Bℬ is a σσ-algebra, and μ∗μ^* is σσ-additive on it, by the Caratheodory lemma. It remains to check that Bℬ contains R.. That is, to verify that every set in R is μ∗μ^*-measurable. This is done by basic measure theory techniques of dividing and adding up sets. For uniqueness, take any other extension νν so it remains to show that ν=μ∗.ν=μ^*. By σσ-additivity, uniqueness can be reduced to the case where μ(X)μ(X) is finite, which will now be assumed. Now we could concretely prove ν=μ∗ν=μ^* on σ(R)σ(R) by using the Borel hierarchy of R,, and since ν=μ∗ν=μ^* at the base level, we can use well-ordered induction to reach the level of ω1,ω_1, the level of σ(R).σ(R).
