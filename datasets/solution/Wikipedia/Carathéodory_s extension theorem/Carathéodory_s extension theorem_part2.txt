statement: Several very similar statements of the theorem can be given. A slightly more involved one, based on semi-rings of sets, is given further down below. A shorter, simpler statement is as follows. In this form, it is often called the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem. Let Σ0Σ_0 be an algebra of subsets of a set X.. Consider a set function μ0:Σ0→[0,∞]μ_0:Σ_0→[0,∞] which is finitely additive, meaning that μ0(⋃n=1NAn)=∑n=1Nμ0(An)μ_0(⋃_n=1^NA_n)=∑_n=1^Nμ_0(A_n) for any positive integer N and A1,A2,…,AN_1,A_2,…,A_N disjoint sets in Σ0.Σ_0. Assume that this function satisfies the stronger sigma additivity assumption μ0(⋃n=1∞An)=∑n=1∞μ0(An)μ_0(⋃_n=1^∞A_n)=∑_n=1^∞μ_0(A_n) for any disjoint family An:n∈N{A_n:n∈ℕ} of elements of Σ0Σ_0 such that ∪n=1∞An∈Σ0.∪_n=1^∞A_n∈Σ_0. (Functions μ0μ_0 obeying these two properties are known as pre-measures.) Then, μ0μ_0 extends to a measure defined on the σσ-algebra ΣΣ generated by Σ0Σ_0; that is, there exists a measure μ:Σ→[0,∞]μ:Σ→[0,∞] such that its restriction to Σ0Σ_0 coincides with μ0.μ_0. If μ0μ_0 is σσ-finite, then the extension is unique.
