Example: Think about the subset of P(R)𝒫(ℝ) defined by the set of all half-open intervals [a,b)[a,b) for a and b reals. This is a semi-ring, but not a ring. Stieltjes measures are defined on intervals; the countable additivity on the semi-ring is not too difficult to prove because we only consider countable unions of intervals which are intervals themselves. Proving it for arbitrary countable unions of intervals is accomplished using Caratheodory's theorem. Statement of the
