Definitions: For a given set Ω,Ω, we call a family S𝒮 of subsets of ΩΩ a semi-ring of sets if it has the following properties: ∅∈S∅∈𝒮 For all A,B∈S,,B∈𝒮, we have A∩B∈S∈𝒮 (closed under pairwise intersections) For all A,B∈S,,B∈𝒮, there exists a finite number of disjoint sets Ki∈S,i=1,2,…,n,_i∈𝒮,i=1,2,…,n, such that A∖B=⋃i=1nKi=⋃_i=1^nK_i (relative complements can be written as finite disjoint unions). The first property can be replaced with S≠∅𝒮≠∅ since A∈S⟹A∖A=∅∈S.∈𝒮=∅∈𝒮. With the same notation, we call a family Rℛ of subsets of ΩΩ a ring of sets if it has the following properties: ∅∈R∅∈ℛ For all A,B∈R,,B∈ℛ, we have A∪B∈R∈ℛ (closed under pairwise unions) For all A,B∈R,,B∈ℛ, we have A∖B∈R∈ℛ (closed under relative complements). Thus, any ring on ΩΩ is also a semi-ring. Sometimes, the following constraint is added in the measure theory context: ΩΩ is the disjoint union of a countable family of sets in S.𝒮. A field of sets (respectively, a semi-field) is a ring (respectively, a semi-ring) that also contains ΩΩ as one of its elements.
