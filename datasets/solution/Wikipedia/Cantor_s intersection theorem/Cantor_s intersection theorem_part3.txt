numbers: The theorem in real analysis draws the same conclusion for closed and bounded subsets of the set of real numbers Rℝ. It states that a decreasing nested sequence (Ck)k≥0(C_k)_k≥0 of non-empty, closed and bounded subsets of Rℝ has a non-empty intersection. This version follows from the general topological statement in light of the Heine–Borel theorem, which states that sets of real numbers are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. However, it is typically used as a lemma in proving said theorem, and therefore warrants a separate proof. As an example, if Ck=[0,1/k]_k=[0,1/k], the intersection over (Ck)k≥0(C_k)_k≥0 is 0{0}. On the other hand, both the sequence of open bounded sets Ck=(0,1/k)_k=(0,1/k) and the sequence of unbounded closed sets Ck=[k,∞)_k=[k,∞) have empty intersection. All these sequences are properly nested. This version of the theorem generalizes to Rn𝐑^n, the set of n-element vectors of real numbers, but does not generalize to arbitrary metric spaces. For example, in the space of rational numbers, the sets Ck=[2,2+1/k]=(2,2+1/k)_k=[√(2),√(2)+1/k]=(√(2),√(2)+1/k) are closed and bounded, but their intersection is empty. Note that this contradicts neither the topological statement, as the sets Ck_k are not compact, nor the variant below, as the rational numbers are not complete with respect to the usual metric. A simple corollary of the theorem is that the Cantor set is nonempty, since it is defined as the intersection of a decreasing nested sequence of sets, each of which is defined as the union of a finite number of closed intervals; hence each of these sets is non-empty, closed, and bounded. In fact, the Cantor set contains uncountably many points. Theorem. Let (Ck)k≥0(C_k)_k≥0 be a sequence of non-empty, closed, and bounded subsets of Rℝ satisfying C0⊃C1⊃⋯Cn⊃Cn+1⋯._0_1⊃_n_n+1⋯. Then, ⋂k=0∞Ck≠∅.⋂_k=0^∞C_k≠∅. Proof. Each nonempty, closed, and bounded subset Ck⊂R_k⊂ℝ admits a minimal element xk_k. Since for each k, we have xk+1∈Ck+1⊂Ck_k+1_k+1_k, it follows that xk≤xk+1_k_k+1, so (xk)k≥0(x_k)_k≥0 is an increasing sequence contained in the bounded set C0_0. The monotone convergence theorem for bounded sequences of real numbers now guarantees the existence of a limit point x=limk→∞xk.=lim_k→∞x_k. For fixed k, xj∈Ck_j_k for all j≥k, and since Ck_k is closed and x is a limit point, it follows that x∈Ck_k. Our choice of k is arbitrary, hence x belongs to ⋂k=0∞Ck⋂_k=0^∞C_k and the proof is complete. ∎ Variant in complete metric
