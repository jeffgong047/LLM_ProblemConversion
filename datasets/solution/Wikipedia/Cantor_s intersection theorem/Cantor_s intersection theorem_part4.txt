spaces: In a complete metric space, the following variant of Cantor's intersection theorem holds. Theorem. Suppose that X is a complete metric space, and (Ck)k≥1(C_k)_k≥1 is a sequence of non-empty closed nested subsets of X whose diameters tend to zero: limk→∞diam⁡(Ck)=0,lim_k→∞diam(C_k)=0, where diam⁡(Ck)diam(C_k) is defined by diam⁡(Ck)=supd(x,y)∣x,y∈Ck.diam(C_k)=sup{d(x,y),y_k}. Then the intersection of the Ck_k contains exactly one point: ⋂k=1∞Ck=x⋂_k=1^∞C_k={x} for some x∈X. Proof (sketch). Since the diameters tend to zero, the diameter of the intersection of the Ck_k is zero, so it is either empty or consists of a single point. So it is sufficient to show that it is not empty. Pick an element xk∈Ck_k_k for each k. Since the diameter of Ck_k tends to zero and the Ck_k are nested, the xk_k form a Cauchy sequence. Since the metric space is complete this Cauchy sequence converges to some point x. Since each Ck_k is closed, and x is a limit of a sequence in Ck_k, x must lie in Ck_k. This is true for every k, and therefore the intersection of the Ck_k must contain x. ∎ A converse to this theorem is also true: if X is a metric space with the property that the intersection of any nested family of non-empty closed subsets whose diameters tend to zero is non-empty, then X is a complete metric space. (To prove this, let (xk)k≥1(x_k)_k≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in X, and let Ck_k be the closure of the tail (xj)j≥k(x_j)_j of this sequence.) See
