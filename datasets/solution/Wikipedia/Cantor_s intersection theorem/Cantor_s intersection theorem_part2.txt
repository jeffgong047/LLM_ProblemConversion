statement: Theorem. Let S be a topological space. A decreasing nested sequence of non-empty compact, closed subsets of S has a non-empty intersection. In other words, supposing (Ck)k≥0(C_k)_k≥0 is a sequence of non-empty compact, closed subsets of S satisfying C0⊃C1⊃⋯⊃Cn⊃Cn+1⊃⋯,_0_1⊃⋯_n_n+1⊃⋯, it follows that ⋂k=0∞Ck≠∅.⋂_k=0^∞C_k≠∅. The closedness condition may be omitted in situations where every compact subset of S is closed, for example when S is Hausdorff. Proof. Assume, by way of contradiction, that ⋂k=0∞Ck=∅⋂_k=0^∞C_k=∅. For each k, let Uk=C0∖Ck_k=C_0_k. Since ⋃k=0∞Uk=C0∖⋂k=0∞Ck⋃_k=0^∞U_k=C_0∖⋂_k=0^∞C_k and ⋂k=0∞Ck=∅⋂_k=0^∞C_k=∅, we have ⋃k=0∞Uk=C0⋃_k=0^∞U_k=C_0. Since the Ck_k are closed relative to S and therefore, also closed relative to C0_0, the Uk_k, their set complements in C0_0, are open relative to C0_0. Since C0⊂S_0 is compact and Uk|k≥0{U_k≥0} is an open cover (on C0_0) of C0_0, a finite cover Uk1,Uk2,…,Ukm{U_k_1,U_k_2,…,U_k_m} can be extracted. Let M=max1≤i≤mki=max_1k_i. Then ⋃i=1mUki=UM⋃_i=1^mU_k_i=U_M because U1⊂U2⊂⋯⊂Un⊂Un+1⋯_1_2⊂⋯_n_n+1⋯, by the nesting hypothesis for the collection (Ck)k≥0(C_k)_k≥0. Consequently, C0=⋃i=1mUki=UM_0=⋃_i=1^mU_k_i=U_M. But then CM=C0∖UM=∅_M=C_0_M=∅, a contradiction. ∎ Statement for real
