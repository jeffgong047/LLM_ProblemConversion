In mathematics, Fuchs' theorem, named after Lazarus Fuchs, states that a second-order differential equation of the form
y″+p(x)y′+q(x)y=g(x)”+p(x)y'+q(x)y=g(x)
has a solution expressible by a generalised Frobenius series when p(x)(x), q(x)(x) and g(x)(x) are analytic at x=a=a or a is a regular singular point. That is, any solution to this second-order differential equation can be written as
y=∑n=0∞an(x−a)n+s,a0≠0=∑_n=0^∞a_n(x-a)^n+s,_0≠0
for some positive real s, or
y=y0ln⁡(x−a)+∑n=0∞bn(x−a)n+r,b0≠0=y_0ln(x-a)+∑_n=0^∞b_n(x-a)^n+r,_0≠0
for some positive real r, where y0 is a solution of the first kind.
Its radius of convergence is at least as large as the minimum of the radii of convergence of p(x)(x), q(x)(x) and g(x)(x).
