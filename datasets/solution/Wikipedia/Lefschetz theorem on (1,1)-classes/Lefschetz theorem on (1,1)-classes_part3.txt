functions: Lefschetz's original proof[2] worked on projective surfaces and used normal functions, which were introduced by Poincar√©. Suppose that Ct is a pencil of curves on X. Each of these curves has a Jacobian variety JCt (if a curve is singular, there is an appropriate generalized Jacobian variety). These can be assembled into a family Jùí•, the Jacobian of the pencil, which comes with a projection map œÄ to the base T of the pencil. A normal function is a (holomorphic) section of œÄ. Fix an embedding of X in PN, and choose a pencil of curves Ct on X. For a fixed curve Œì on X, the intersection of Œì and Ct is a divisor p1(t) + ... + pd(t) on Ct, where d is the degree of X. Fix a base point p0 of the pencil. Then the divisor p1(t) + ... + pd(t) ‚àí dp0 is a divisor of degree zero, and consequently it determines a class ŒΩŒì(t) in the Jacobian JCt for all t. The map from t to ŒΩŒì(t) is a normal function. Henri Poincar√© proved that for a general pencil of curves, all normal functions arose as ŒΩŒì(t) for some choice of Œì. Lefschetz proved that any normal function determined a class in H2(X, Z) and that the class of ŒΩŒì is the fundamental class of Œì. Furthermore, he proved that a class in H2(X, Z) is the class of a normal function if and only if it lies in H1,1. Together with Poincar√©'s existence theorem, this proves the theorem on (1,1)-classes. Proof using sheaf
