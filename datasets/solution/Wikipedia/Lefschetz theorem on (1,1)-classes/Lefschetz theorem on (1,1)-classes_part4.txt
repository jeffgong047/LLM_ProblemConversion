cohomology: Because X is a complex manifold, it admits an exponential sheaf sequence[3] 0→Z_⟶2πiOX⟶expOX×→0.0→𝐙2⟶𝒪_Xexp⟶𝒪_X^×→0. Taking sheaf cohomology of this exact sequence gives maps H1(X,OX×)→c1H2(X,Z)→i∗H2(X,OX).^1(X,𝒪_X^×)c_1→H^2(X,𝐙)i_*→H^2(X,𝒪_X). The group Pic X of line bundles on X is isomorphic to H1(X,OX×)^1(X,𝒪_X^×). The first Chern class map is c1 by definition, so it suffices to show that i* is zero. Because X is Kähler, Hodge theory implies that H2(X,OX)≅H0,2(X)^2(X,𝒪_X)^0,2(X). However, i* factors through the map from H2(X, Z) to H2(X, C), and on H2(X, C), i* is the restriction of the projection onto H0,2(X). It follows that it is zero on H2(X, Z) ∩ H1,1(X), and consequently that the cycle class map is surjective.[4]
