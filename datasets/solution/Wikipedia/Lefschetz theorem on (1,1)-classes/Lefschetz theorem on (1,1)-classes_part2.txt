theorem: Let X be a compact Kähler manifold. The first Chern class c1 gives a map from holomorphic line bundles to H2(X, Z). By Hodge theory, the de Rham cohomology group H2(X, C) decomposes as a direct sum H0,2(X) ⊕ H1,1(X) ⊕ H2,0(X), and it can be proven that the image of c1 lies in H1,1(X). The theorem says that the map to H2(X, Z) ∩ H1,1(X) is surjective. In the special case where X is a projective variety, holomorphic line bundles are in bijection with linear equivalences class of divisors, and given a divisor D on X with associated line bundle O(D), the class c1(O(D)) is Poincaré dual to the homology class given by D. Thus, this establishes the usual formulation of the Hodge conjecture for divisors in projective varieties. Proof using normal
