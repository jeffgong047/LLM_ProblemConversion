Results: The fact that the general linear group, GL(n), has the multiplicity-one property was proved by Jacquet & Langlands (1970) for n = 2 and independently by Piatetski-Shapiro (1979) and Shalika (1974) for n > 2 using the uniqueness of the Whittaker model. Multiplicity-one also holds for SL(2), but not for SL(n) for n > 2 (Blasius 1994). Strong multiplicity one
