Concerns the representation theory of an adelic reductive algebraic group.
In the mathematical theory of automorphic representations, a multiplicity-one theorem is a result about the representation theory of an adelic reductive algebraic group. The multiplicity in question is the number of times a given abstract group representation is realised in a certain space, of square-integrable functions, given in a concrete way.
A multiplicity one theorem may also refer to a result about the restriction of a representation of a group G to a subgroup H. In that context, the pair (G, H) is called a strong Gelfand pair. 


Definition[edit]
Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a number field K and let A denote the adeles of K. Let Z denote the centre of G and let ω be a continuous unitary character from Z(K)\Z(A)× to C×. Let L20(G(K)/G(A), ω) denote the space of cusp forms with central character ω on G(A). This space decomposes into a direct sum of Hilbert spaces

L02(G(K)∖G(A),ω)=⨁^(π,Vπ)mπVπ_0^2(G(K)(𝐀),ω)=⊕_(π,V_π)m_πV_π
where the sum is over irreducible subrepresentations and mπ are non-negative integers.
The group of adelic points of G, G(A), is said to satisfy the multiplicity-one property if any smooth irreducible admissible representation of G(A) occurs with multiplicity at most one in the space of cusp forms of central character ω, i.e. mπ is 0 or 1 for all such π.

Results[edit]
The fact that the general linear group, GL(n), has the multiplicity-one property was proved by Jacquet & Langlands (1970) for n = 2 and independently by Piatetski-Shapiro (1979) and Shalika (1974) for n > 2 using the uniqueness of the Whittaker model. Multiplicity-one also holds for SL(2), but not for SL(n) for n > 2 (Blasius 1994).

Strong multiplicity one theorem[edit]
The strong multiplicity one theorem of Piatetski-Shapiro (1979) and Jacquet and Shalika (1981a, 1981b) states that two cuspidal automorphic representations of the general linear group are isomorphic if their local components are isomorphic for all but a finite number of places.
