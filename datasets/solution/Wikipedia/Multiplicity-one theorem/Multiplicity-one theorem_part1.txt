Concerns the representation theory of an adelic reductive algebraic group. In the mathematical theory of automorphic representations, a multiplicity-one theorem is a result about the representation theory of an adelic reductive algebraic group. The multiplicity in question is the number of times a given abstract group representation is realised in a certain space, of square-integrable functions, given in a concrete way. A multiplicity one theorem may also refer to a result about the restriction of a representation of a group G to a subgroup H. In that context, the pair (G, H) is called a strong Gelfand pair.
