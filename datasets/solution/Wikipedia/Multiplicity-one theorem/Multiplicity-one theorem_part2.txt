Definition: Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a number field K and let A denote the adeles of K. Let Z denote the centre of G and let ω be a continuous unitary character from Z(K)\Z(A)× to C×. Let L20(G(K)/G(A), ω) denote the space of cusp forms with central character ω on G(A). This space decomposes into a direct sum of Hilbert spaces L02(G(K)∖G(A),ω)=⨁^(π,Vπ)mπVπ_0^2(G(K)(𝐀),ω)=⊕_(π,V_π)m_πV_π where the sum is over irreducible subrepresentations and mπ are non-negative integers. The group of adelic points of G, G(A), is said to satisfy the multiplicity-one property if any smooth irreducible admissible representation of G(A) occurs with multiplicity at most one in the space of cusp forms of central character ω, i.e. mπ is 0 or 1 for all such π.
