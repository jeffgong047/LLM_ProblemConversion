principle: This theorem is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet who proved the result used the same principle in other contexts (for example, the Pell equation) and by naming the principle (in German) popularized its use, though its status in textbook terms comes later.[1] The method extends to simultaneous approximation.[2] Proof outline: Let αα be an irrational number and n be an integer. For every k=0,1,...,n=0,1,...,n we can write kα=mk+xkα=m_k+x_k such that mk_k is an integer and 0≤xk<10_k<1. One can divide the interval [0,1)[0,1) into n smaller intervals of measure 1n1/n. Now, we have n+1+1 numbers x0,x1,...,xn_0,x_1,...,x_n and n intervals. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them are in the same interval. We can call those xi,xj_i,x_j such that i<j<j. Now: |(j−i)α−(mj−mi)|=|jα−mj−(iα−mi)|=|xj−xi|<1n|(j-i)α-(m_j-m_i)|=|jα-m_j-(iα-m_i)|=|x_j-x_i|<1/n Dividing both sides by j−i-i will result in: |α−mj−mij−i|<1(j−i)n≤1(j−i)2|α-m_j-m_i/j-i|<1/(j-i)n≤1/(j-i)^2 And we proved the theorem.
