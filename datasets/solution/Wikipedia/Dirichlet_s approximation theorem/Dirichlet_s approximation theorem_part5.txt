theorem: Another simple proof of the Dirichlet's approximation theorem is based on Minkowski's theorem applied to the set S=(x,y)∈R2:−N−12≤x≤N+12,|αx−y|≤1N.={(x,y)∈ℝ^2:-N-1/2+1/2,|-y|≤1/N}. Since the volume of S is greater than 44, Minkowski's theorem establishes the existence of a non-trivial point with integral coordinates. This proof extends naturally to simultaneous approximations by considering the set S=(x,y1,…,yd)∈R1+d:−N−12≤x≤N+12,|αix−yi|≤1N1/d.={(x,y_1,…,y_d)∈ℝ^1+d:-N-1/2+1/2,|α_ix-y_i|≤1/N^1/d}. See
