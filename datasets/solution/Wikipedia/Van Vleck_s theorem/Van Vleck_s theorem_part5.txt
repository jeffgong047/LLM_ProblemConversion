theorem: By applying the fundamental inequalities to the continued fraction x=11+a21+a31+a41+⋱=11+a_21+a_31+a_41+⋱ it can be shown that the following statements hold if |ai| ≤ ¼ for the partial numerators ai, i = 2, 3, 4, ... The continued fraction x converges to a finite value, and converges uniformly if the partial numerators ai are complex variables.[4] The value of x and of each of its convergents xi lies in the circular domain of radius 2/3 centered on the point z = 4/3; that is, in the region defined by Ω=z:|z−4/3|≤2/3.Ω=:|z-4/3|≤2/3}. [5] The radius ¼ is the largest radius over which x can be shown to converge without exception, and the region Ω is the smallest image space that contains all possible values of the continued fraction x.[5] The proof of the first statement, by Julius Worpitzky in 1865, is apparently the oldest published proof that a continued fraction with complex elements actually converges.[disputed (for: Euler's continued fraction formula is older) – discuss][6] Because the proof of Worpitzky's theorem employs Euler's continued fraction formula to construct an infinite series that is equivalent to the continued fraction x, and the series so constructed is absolutely convergent, the Weierstrass M-test can be applied to a modified version of x. If f(z)=11+c2z1+c3z1+c4z1+⋱(z)=11+c_2z1+c_3z1+c_4z1+⋱ and a positive real number M exists such that |ci| ≤ M (i = 2, 3, 4, ...), then the sequence of convergents {fi(z)} converges uniformly when |z|<14M|z|<1/4M and f(z) is analytic on that open disk.
