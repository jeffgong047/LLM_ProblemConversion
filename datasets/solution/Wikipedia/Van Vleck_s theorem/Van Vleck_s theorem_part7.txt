theorem: Jones and Thron attribute the following result to Van Vleck. Suppose that all the ai are equal to 1, and all the bi have arguments with: −π/2+ϵ<arg⁡(bi)<π/2−ϵ,i≥1,-π/2+ϵ<(b_i)<π/2-ϵ,i≥1, with epsilon being any positive number less than π/2π/2. In other words, all the bi are inside a wedge which has its vertex at the origin, has an opening angle of π−2ϵπ-2ϵ, and is symmetric around the positive real axis. Then fi, the ith convergent to the continued fraction, is finite and has an argument: −π/2+ϵ<arg⁡(fi)<π/2−ϵ,i≥1.-π/2+ϵ<(f_i)<π/2-ϵ,i≥1. Also, the sequence of even convergents will converge, as will the sequence of odd convergents. The continued fraction itself will converge if and only if the sum of all the |bi| diverges.[8]
