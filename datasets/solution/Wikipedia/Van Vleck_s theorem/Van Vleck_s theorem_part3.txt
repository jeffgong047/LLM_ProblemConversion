fractions: An infinite periodic continued fraction is a continued fraction of the form x=a1b1+a2b2+⋱⋱bk−1+akbk+a1b1+a2b2+⋱=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+⋱ ⋱_k-1+a_kb_k+a_1b_1+a_2b_2+⋱ where k ≥ 1, the sequence of partial numerators {a1, a2, a3, ..., ak} contains no values equal to zero, and the partial numerators {a1, a2, a3, ..., ak} and partial denominators {b1, b2, b3, ..., bk} repeat over and over again, ad infinitum. By applying the theory of linear fractional transformations to s(w)=Ak−1w+AkBk−1w+Bk(w)=A_k-1w+A_k/B_k-1w+B_k where Ak-1, Bk-1, Ak, and Bk are the numerators and denominators of the k-1st and kth convergents of the infinite periodic continued fraction x, it can be shown that x converges to one of the fixed points of s(w) if it converges at all. Specifically, let r1 and r2 be the roots of the quadratic equation Bk−1w2+(Bk−Ak−1)w−Ak=0._k-1w^2+(B_k-A_k-1)w-A_k=0. These roots are the fixed points of s(w). If r1 and r2 are finite then the infinite periodic continued fraction x converges if and only if the two roots are equal; or the k-1st convergent is closer to r1 than it is to r2, and none of the first k convergents equal r2. If the denominator Bk-1 is equal to zero then an infinite number of the denominators Bnk-1 also vanish, and the continued fraction does not converge to a finite value. And when the two roots r1 and r2 are equidistant from the k-1st convergent – or when r1 is closer to the k-1st convergent than r2 is, but one of the first k convergents equals r2 – the continued fraction x diverges by oscillation.[1][2][3] The special case when period k =
