1: If the period of a continued fraction is 1; that is, if x=K∞1ab,=1∞Ka/b, where b ≠ 0, we can obtain a very strong result. First, by applying an equivalence transformation we see that x converges if and only if y=1+K∞1z1(z=ab2)=1+1∞Kz/1 (z=a/b^2) converges. Then, by applying the more general result obtained above it can be shown that y=1+z1+z1+z1+⋱=1+z1+z1+z1+⋱ converges for every complex number z except when z is a negative real number and z < −¼. Moreover, this continued fraction y converges to the particular value of y=12(1±4z+1)=1/2(1±√(4z+1)) that has the larger absolute value (except when z is real and z < −¼, in which case the two fixed points of the LFT generating y have equal moduli and y diverges by oscillation). By applying another equivalence transformation the condition that guarantees convergence of x=K∞11z=1z+1z+1z+⋱=1∞K1/z=1z+1z+1z+⋱ can also be determined. Since a simple equivalence transformation shows that x=z−11+z−21+z−21+⋱=z^-11+z^-21+z^-21+⋱ whenever z ≠ 0, the preceding result for the continued fraction y can be restated for x. The infinite periodic continued fraction x=K∞11z=1∞K1/z converges if and only if z2 is not a real number lying in the interval −4 < z2 ≤ 0 – or, equivalently, x converges if and only if z ≠ 0 and z is not a pure imaginary number with imaginary part between -2 and 2.
