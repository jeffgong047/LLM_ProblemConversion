In the analytic theory of continued fractions, the convergence problem is the determination of conditions on the partial numerators ai and partial denominators bi that are sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the continued fraction x=b0+a1b1+a2b2+a3b3+a4b4+⋱.=b_0+a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3+a_4b_4+⋱. This convergence problem for continued fractions is inherently more difficult than the corresponding convergence problem for infinite series. Elementary
