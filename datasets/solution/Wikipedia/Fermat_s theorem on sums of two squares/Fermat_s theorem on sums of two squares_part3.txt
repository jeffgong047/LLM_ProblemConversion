primes: Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares is strongly related with the theory of Gaussian primes. A Gaussian integer is a complex number a+ib+ib such that a and b are integers. The norm N(a+ib)=a2+b2(a+ib)=a^2+b^2 of a Gaussian integer is an integer equal to the square of the absolute value of the Gaussian integer. The norm of a product of Gaussian integers is the product of their norms. This is the Diophantus identity, which results immediately from the similar property of the absolute value. Gaussian integers form a principal ideal domain. This implies that Gaussian primes can be defined similarly as primes numbers, that is as those Gaussian integers that are not the product of two non-units (here the units are 1, −1, i and −i). The multiplicative property of the norm implies that a prime number p is either a Gaussian prime or the norm of a Gaussian prime. Fermat's theorem asserts that the first case occurs when p=4k+3,=4k+3, and that the second case occurs when p=4k+1=4k+1 and p=2.=2. The last case is not considered in Fermat's statement, but is trivial, as 2=12+12=N(1+i).2=1^2+1^2=N(1+i). Related
