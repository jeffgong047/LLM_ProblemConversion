Example: Take p=97=97. A possible quadratic non-residue for 97 is 13, since 1397−12≡−1(mod97)13^97-1/2≡-197. so we let x=1397−14=22(mod97)=13^97-1/4=2297. The Euclidean algorithm applied to 97 and 22 yields: 97=22(4)+9,97=22(4)+9, 22=9(2)+4,22=9(2)+4, 9=4(2)+1,9=4(2)+1, 4=1(4).4=1(4). The first two remainders smaller than the square root of 97 are 9 and 4; and indeed we have 97=92+4297=9^2+4^2, as expected.
