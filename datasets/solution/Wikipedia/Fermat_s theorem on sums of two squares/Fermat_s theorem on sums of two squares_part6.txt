Description: Given an odd prime p in the form 4k+14k+1, first find x such that x2≡−1(modp)^2≡-1p. This can be done by finding a Quadratic non-residue modulo p, say q, and letting x=qp−14(modp)=q^p-1/4p. Such an x will satisfy the condition since quadratic non-residues satisfy qp−12≡−1(modp)^p-1/2≡-1p. Once x is determined, one can apply the Euclidean algorithm with p and x. Denote the first two remainders that are less than the square root of p as a and b. Then it will be the case that a2+b2=p^2+b^2=p.
