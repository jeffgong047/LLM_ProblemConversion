forms: Lagrange completed a proof in 1775[14] based on his general theory of integral quadratic forms. The following presentation incorporates a slight simplification of his argument, due to Gauss, which appears in article 182 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. An (integral binary) quadratic form is an expression of the form ax2+bxy+cy2^2+bxy+cy^2 with a,b,c,b,c integers. A number n is said to be represented by the form if there exist integers x,y,y such that n=ax2+bxy+cy2=ax^2+bxy+cy^2. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares is then equivalent to the statement that a prime p is represented by the form x2+y2^2+y^2 (i.e., a=c=1=c=1, b=0=0) exactly when p is congruent to 11 modulo 44. The discriminant of the quadratic form is defined to be b2−4ac^2-4ac. The discriminant of x2+y2^2+y^2 is then equal to −4-4. Two forms ax2+bxy+cy2^2+bxy+cy^2 and a′x′2+b′x′y′+c′y′2'x'^2+b'x'y'+c'y'^2 are equivalent if and only if there exist substitutions with integer coefficients x=αx′+βy′='+' y=γx′+δy′='+' with αδ−βγ=±1αδ-βγ=±1 such that, when substituted into the first form, yield the second. Equivalent forms are readily seen to have the same discriminant, and hence also the same parity for the middle coefficient b, which coincides with the parity of the discriminant. Moreover, it is clear that equivalent forms will represent exactly the same integers, because these kind of substitutions can be reversed by substitutions of the same kind. Lagrange proved that all positive definite forms of discriminant −4 are equivalent. Thus, to prove Fermat's theorem it is enough to find any positive definite form of discriminant −4 that represents p. For example, one can use a form px2+2mxy+(m2+1p)y2,^2+2mxy+(m^2+1/p)y^2, where the first coefficient a = p was chosen so that the form represents p by setting x = 1, and y = 0, the coefficient b = 2m is an arbitrary even number (as it must be, to get an even discriminant), and finally c=m2+1p=m^2+1/p is chosen so that the discriminant b2−4ac=4m2−4pc^2-4ac=4m^2-4pc is equal to −4, which guarantees that the form is indeed equivalent to x2+y2^2+y^2. Of course, the coefficient c=m2+1p=m^2+1/p must be an integer, so the problem is reduced to finding some integer m such that p divides m2+1^2+1: or in other words, a 'square root of -1 modulo p' . We claim such a square root of −1-1 is given by K=∏k=1p−12k=∏_k=1^p-1/2k. Firstly it follows from Euclid's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that ab≡0(modp)⟺a≡0(modp)orb≡0(modp)≡0p≡0p or b≡0p. Consequently, a2≡1(modp)⟺a≡±1(modp)^2≡1p≡±1p: that is, ±1±1 are their own inverses modulo p and this property is unique to them. It then follows from the validity of Euclidean division in the integers, and the fact that p is prime, that for every 2≤a≤p−22-2 the gcd of a and p may be expressed via the Euclidean algorithm yielding a unique and distinct inverse a−1≠a^-1 of a modulo p. In particular therefore the product of all non-zero residues modulo p is −1-1. Let L=∏l=p+12p−1l=∏_l=p+1/2^p-1l: from what has just been observed, KL≡−1(modp)≡-1p. But by definition, since each term in K may be paired with its negative in L, L=(−1)p−12K=(-1)^p-1/2K, which since p is odd shows that K2≡−1(modp)⟺p≡1(mod4)^2≡-1p≡14, as required.
