Theorem: For p congruent to 11 mod 44 a prime, −1-1 is a quadratic residue mod p by Euler's criterion. Therefore, there exists an integer m such that p divides m2+1^2+1. Let i^,j^î,ĵ be the standard basis elements for the vector space R2ℝ^2 and set u→=i^+mj^u⃗=î+mĵ and v→=0i^+pj^v⃗=0î+pĵ. Consider the lattice S=au→+bv→∣a,b∈Z={au⃗+bv⃗,b∈ℤ}. If w→=au→+bv→=ai^+(am+bp)j^∈Sw⃗=au⃗+bv⃗=aî+(am+bp)ĵ then ‖w→‖2≡a2+(am+bp)2≡a2(1+m2)≡0(modp)w⃗^2^2+(am+bp)^2^2(1+m^2)≡0p. Thus p divides ‖w→‖2w⃗^2 for any w→∈Sw⃗. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is p. The area of the open disk, D, of radius 2p√(2p) centered around the origin is 2πp>4p2>4p. Furthermore, D is convex and symmetrical about the origin. Therefore, by Minkowski's theorem there exists a nonzero vector w→∈Sw⃗ such that w→∈Dw⃗. Both ‖w→‖2<2pw⃗^2<2p and p∣‖w→‖2|w⃗^2 so p=‖w→‖2=w⃗^2. Hence p is the sum of the squares of the components of w→w⃗. Zagier's "one-sentence
