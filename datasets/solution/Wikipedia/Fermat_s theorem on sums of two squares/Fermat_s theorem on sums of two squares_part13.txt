proof": Let p=4k+1=4k+1 be prime, let Nℕ denote the natural numbers (with or without zero), and consider the finite set S=(x,y,z)∈N3:x2+4yz=p={(x,y,z)∈ℕ^3:x^2+4yz=p} of triples of numbers. Then S has two involutions: an obvious one (x,y,z)↦(x,z,y)(x,y,z)↦(x,z,y) whose fixed points (x,y,y)(x,y,y) correspond to representations of p as a sum of two squares, and a more complicated one, (x,y,z)↦(x+2z,z,y−x−z),ifx<y−z(2y−x,y,x−y+z),ify−z<x<2y(x−2y,x−y+z,y),ifx>2y(x,y,z)↦(x+2z, z, y-x-z), if x<y-z (2y-x, y, x-y+z), if y-z<x<2y (x-2y, x-y+z, y), if x>2y which has exactly one fixed point (1,1,k)(1,1,k). This proves that the cardinality of S is odd. Hence, S has also a fixed point with respect to the obvious involution. This proof, due to Zagier, is a simplification of an earlier proof by Heath-Brown, which in turn was inspired by a proof of Liouville. The technique of the proof is a combinatorial analogue of the topological principle that the Euler characteristics of a topological space with an involution and of its fixed-point set have the same parity and is reminiscent of the use of sign-reversing involutions in the proofs of combinatorial bijections. This proof is equivalent to a geometric or "visual" proof using "windmill" figures, given by Alexander Spivak in 2006 and described in this MathOverflow post and this Mathologer YouTube video Why was this visual proof missed for 400 years? (Fermat's two square theorem) on YouTube. Proof with partition
