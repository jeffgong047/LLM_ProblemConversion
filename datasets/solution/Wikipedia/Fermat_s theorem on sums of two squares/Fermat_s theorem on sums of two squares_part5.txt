Algorithm: There is a trivial algorithm for decomposing a prime of the form p=4k+1=4k+1 into a sum of two squares: For all n such 1≤n<p1<√(p), test whether the square root of p−n2-n^2 is an integer. If this the case, one has got the decomposition. However the input size of the algorithm is log⁡p,, the number of digits of p (up to a constant factor that depends on the numeral base). The number of needed tests is of the order of p=exp⁡(log⁡p2),√(p)=exp(/2), and thus exponential in the input size. So the computational complexity of this algorithm is exponential. An algorithm with a polynomial complexity has been described by Stan Wagon in 1990, based on work by Serret and Hermite (1848), and Cornacchia (1908).[5]
