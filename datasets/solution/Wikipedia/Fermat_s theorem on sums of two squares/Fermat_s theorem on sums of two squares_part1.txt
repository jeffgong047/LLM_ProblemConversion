Condition under which an odd prime is a sum of two squares For other theorems named after Pierre de Fermat, see Fermat's theorem. In additive number theory, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that an odd prime p can be expressed as: p=x2+y2,=x^2+y^2, with x and y integers, if and only if p≡1(mod4).≡14. The prime numbers for which this is true are called Pythagorean primes. For example, the primes 5, 13, 17, 29, 37 and 41 are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and they can be expressed as sums of two squares in the following ways: 5=12+22,13=22+32,17=12+42,29=22+52,37=12+62,41=42+52.5=1^2+2^2, 13=2^2+3^2, 17=1^2+4^2, 29=2^2+5^2, 37=1^2+6^2, 41=4^2+5^2. On the other hand, the primes 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 and 31 are all congruent to 3 modulo 4, and none of them can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This is the easier part of the theorem, and follows immediately from the observation that all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Since the Diophantus identity implies that the product of two integers each of which can be written as the sum of two squares is itself expressible as the sum of two squares, by applying Fermat's theorem to the prime factorization of any positive integer n, we see that if all the prime factors of n congruent to 3 modulo 4 occur to an even exponent, then n is expressible as a sum of two squares. The converse also holds.[1] This generalization of Fermat's theorem is known as the sum of two squares theorem.
