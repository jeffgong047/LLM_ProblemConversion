integers: Richard Dedekind gave at least two proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, both using the arithmetical properties of the Gaussian integers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are integers, and i is the square root of −1. One appears in section 27 of his exposition of ideals published in 1877; the second appeared in Supplement XI to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie, and was published in 1894. 1. First proof. If p is an odd prime number, then we have ip−1=(−1)p−12^p-1=(-1)^p-1/2 in the Gaussian integers. Consequently, writing a Gaussian integer ω = x + iy with x,y ∈ Z and applying the Frobenius automorphism in Z[i]/(p), one finds ωp=(x+yi)p≡xp+ypip≡x+(−1)p−12yi(modp),ω^p=(x+yi)^p^p+y^pi^p+(-1)^p-1/2yip, since the automorphism fixes the elements of Z/(p). In the current case, p=4n+1=4n+1 for some integer n, and so in the above expression for ωp, the exponent (p-1)/2 of -1 is even. Hence the right hand side equals ω, so in this case the Frobenius endomorphism of Z[i]/(p) is the identity. Kummer had already established that if f ∈ {1,2} is the order of the Frobenius automorphism of Z[i]/(p), then the ideal (p)(p) in Z[i] would be a product of 2/f distinct prime ideals. (In fact, Kummer had established a much more general result for any extension of Z obtained by adjoining a primitive m-th root of unity, where m was any positive integer; this is the case m = 4 of that result.) Therefore, the ideal (p) is the product of two different prime ideals in Z[i]. Since the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain for the norm function N(x+iy)=x2+y2(x+iy)=x^2+y^2, every ideal is principal and generated by a nonzero element of the ideal of minimal norm. Since the norm is multiplicative, the norm of a generator αα of one of the ideal factors of (p) must be a strict divisor of N(p)=p2(p)=p^2, so that we must have p=N(α)=N(a+bi)=a2+b2=N(α)=N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2, which gives Fermat's theorem. 2. Second proof. This proof builds on Lagrange's result that if p=4n+1=4n+1 is a prime number, then there must be an integer m such that m2+1^2+1 is divisible by p (we can also see this by Euler's criterion); it also uses the fact that the Gaussian integers are a unique factorization domain (because they are a Euclidean domain). Since p ∈ Z does not divide either of the Gaussian integers m+i+i and m−i-i (as it does not divide their imaginary parts), but it does divide their product m2+1^2+1, it follows that p cannot be a prime element in the Gaussian integers. We must therefore have a nontrivial factorization of p in the Gaussian integers, which in view of the norm can have only two factors (since the norm is multiplicative, and p2=N(p)^2=N(p), there can only be up to two factors of p), so it must be of the form p=(x+yi)(x−yi)=(x+yi)(x-yi) for some integers x and y. This immediately yields that p=x2+y2=x^2+y^2. Proof by Minkowski's
