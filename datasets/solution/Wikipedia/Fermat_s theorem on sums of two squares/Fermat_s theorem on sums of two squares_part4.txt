results: Above point of view on Fermat's theorem is a special case of the theory of factorization of ideals in rings of quadratic integers. In summary, if Od𝒪_√(d) is the ring of algebraic integers in the quadratic field, then an odd prime number p, not dividing d, is either a prime element in Od,𝒪_√(d), or the ideal norm of an ideal of Od,𝒪_√(d), which is necessarily prime. Moreover, the law of quadratic reciprocity allows distinguishing the two cases in terms of congruences. If Od𝒪_√(d) is a principal ideal domain, then p is an ideal norm if and only 4p=a2−db2,4p=a^2-db^2, with a and b both integers. In a letter to Blaise Pascal dated September 25, 1654 Fermat announced the following two results that are essentially the special cases d=−2=-2 and d=−3.=-3. If p is an odd prime, then p=x2+2y2⟺p≡1orp≡3(mod8),=x^2+2y^2≡1p≡38, p=x2+3y2⟺p≡1(mod3).=x^2+3y^2≡13. Fermat wrote also: If two primes which end in 3 or 7 and surpass by 3 a multiple of 4 are multiplied, then their product will be composed of a square and the quintuple of another square. In other words, if p, q are of the form 20k + 3 or 20k + 7, then pq = x2 + 5y2. Euler later extended this to the conjecture that p=x2+5y2⟺p≡1orp≡9(mod20),=x^2+5y^2≡1p≡920, 2p=x2+5y2⟺p≡3orp≡7(mod20).2p=x^2+5y^2≡3p≡720. Both Fermat's assertion and Euler's conjecture were established by Joseph-Louis Lagrange. This more complicated formulation relies on the fact that O−5𝒪_√(-5) is not a principal ideal domain, unlike O−2𝒪_√(-2) and O−3.𝒪_√(-3).
