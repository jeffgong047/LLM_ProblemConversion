In mathematics, the structure theorem for Gaussian measures shows that the abstract Wiener space construction is essentially the only way to obtain a strictly positive Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space. It was proved in the 1970s by Kallianpur–Sato–Stefan and Dudley–Feldman–le Cam. There is the earlier result due to H. Satô (1969) [1] which proves that "any Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space is an abstract Wiener measure in the sense of L. Gross". The result by Dudley et al. generalizes this result to the setting of Gaussian measures on a general topological vector space. Statement of the
