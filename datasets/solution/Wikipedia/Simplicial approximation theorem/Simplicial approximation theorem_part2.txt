theorem: Let K and L be two simplicial complexes. A simplicial mapping f:K→L:K is called a simplicial approximation of a continuous function F:|K|→|L|:|K|→|L| if for every point x∈|K|∈|K|, |f|(x)|f|(x) belongs to the minimal closed simplex of L containing the point F(x)(x). If f is a simplicial approximation to a continuous map F, then the geometric realization of f, |f||f| is necessarily homotopic to F.[clarification needed] The simplicial approximation theorem states that given any continuous map F:|K|→|L|:|K|→|L| there exists a natural number n0_0 such that for all n≥n0_0 there exists a simplicial approximation f:BdnK→L:Bd^nK to F (where BdKBd K denotes the barycentric subdivision of K, and BdnKBd^nK denotes the result of applying barycentric subdivision n times.), in other words, if K and L are simplicial complexes and f:|K|→|L|:|K|→|L| is a continuous function, then there is a subdivision K′' of K and a simplicial map g:K′→L:K' which is homotopic to f. Moreover, if ϵ:|L|→Rϵ:|L|→ℝ is a positive continuous map, then there are subdivisions K′,L′',L' of K,L,L and a simplicial map g:K′→L′:K'' such that g is ϵϵ-homotopic to f; that is, there is a homotopy H:|K|×[0,1]→|L|:|K|×[0,1]→|L| from f to g such that diam(H(x×[0,1]))<ϵ(f(x))diam(H(x×[0,1]))<ϵ(f(x)) for all x∈|K|∈|K|. So, we may consider the simplicial approximation theorem as a piecewise linear analog of Whitney approximation theorem.
