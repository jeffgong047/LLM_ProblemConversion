families: The following sets of finite graphs are minor-closed, and therefore (by the Robertson–Seymour theorem) have forbidden minor characterizations: forests, linear forests (disjoint unions of path graphs), pseudoforests, and cactus graphs; planar graphs, outerplanar graphs, apex graphs (formed by adding a single vertex to a planar graph), toroidal graphs, and the graphs that can be embedded on any fixed two-dimensional manifold;[10] graphs that are linklessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space, and graphs that are knotlessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space;[10] graphs with a feedback vertex set of size bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with Colin de Verdière graph invariant bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with treewidth, pathwidth, or branchwidth bounded by some fixed constant.
