recognition: The Robertson–Seymour theorem has an important consequence in computational complexity, due to the proof by Robertson and Seymour that, for each fixed graph h, there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph has h as a minor. This algorithm's running time is cubic (in the size of the graph to check), though with a constant factor that depends superpolynomially on the size of the minor h. The running time has been improved to quadratic by Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed.[12] As a result, for every minor-closed family F, there is polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph belongs to F: simply check whether the given graph contains h for each forbidden minor h in F’s obstruction set.[13] However, this method requires a specific finite obstruction set to work, and the theorem does not provide one. The theorem proves that such a finite obstruction set exists, and therefore the problem is polynomial because of the above algorithm. However, the algorithm can be used in practice only if such a finite obstruction set is provided. As a result, the theorem proves that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, but does not provide a concrete polynomial-time algorithm for solving it. Such proofs of polynomiality are non-constructive: they prove polynomiality of problems without providing an explicit polynomial-time algorithm.[14] In many specific cases, checking whether a graph is in a given minor-closed family can be done more efficiently: for example, checking whether a graph is planar can be done in linear time.
