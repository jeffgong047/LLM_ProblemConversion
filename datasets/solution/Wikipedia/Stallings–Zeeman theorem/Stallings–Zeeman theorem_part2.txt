theorem: Let M be a finite simplicial complex of dimension dim(M) = m â‰¥ 5. Suppose that M has the homotopy type of the m-dimensional sphere Sm and that M is locally piecewise linearly homeomorphic to m-dimensional Euclidean space Rm. Then M is homeomorphic to Sm under a map that is piecewise linear except possibly at a single point x. That is, M \ {x} is piecewise linearly homeomorphic to Rm.
