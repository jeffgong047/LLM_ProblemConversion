Statement: The logarithmic density of a set of integers from 1 to n can be defined by setting the weight of each integer i to be 1/i1/i, and dividing the total weight of the set by the nth partial sum of the harmonic series (or, equivalently for the purposes of asymptotic analysis, dividing by log⁡n). The resulting number is 1 or close to 1 when the set includes all of the integers in that range, but smaller when many integers are missing, and particularly when the missing integers are themselves small.[1] A subset of 1,…n{1,} is called primitive if it has the property that no subset element is a multiple of any other element. Behrend's theorem states that the logarithmic density of any primitive subset must be small. More precisely, the logarithmic density of such a set must be O(1/log⁡log⁡n)(1/√(log)).[1] For infinite primitive sequences, the maximum possible density is smaller, o(1/log⁡log⁡n)(1/√(log)).[2]
