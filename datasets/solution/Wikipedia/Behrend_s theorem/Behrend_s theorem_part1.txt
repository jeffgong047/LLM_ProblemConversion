On subsets of the integers in which no member of the set is a multiple of any other This article is about the theorem on multiple-free sets. For the theorem on arithmetic-progression-free sets, see Salemâ€“Spencer set. In arithmetic combinatorics, Behrend's theorem states that the subsets of the integers from 1 to n in which no member of the set is a multiple of any other must have a logarithmic density that goes to zero as n becomes large. The theorem is named after Felix Behrend, who published it in 1935.
