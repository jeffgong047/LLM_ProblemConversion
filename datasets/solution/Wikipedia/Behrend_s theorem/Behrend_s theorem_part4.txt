History: This theorem is known as Behrend's theorem because Felix Behrend proved it in 1934,[1] and published it in 1935.[5] Paul Erd≈ës proved the same result, on a 1934 train trip from Hungary to Cambridge to escape the growing anti-semitism in Europe, but on his arrival he discovered that Behrend's proof was already known.[1]
