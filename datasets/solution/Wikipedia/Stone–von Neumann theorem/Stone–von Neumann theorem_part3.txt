representation: One would like to classify representations of the canonical commutation relation by two self-adjoint operators acting on separable Hilbert spaces, up to unitary equivalence. By Stone's theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators and (strongly continuous) one-parameter unitary groups. Let Q and P be two self-adjoint operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation, [Q, P] = i, and s and t two real parameters. Introduce eitQ and eisP, the corresponding unitary groups given by functional calculus. (For the explicit operators x and p defined above, these are multiplication by eitx and pullback by translation x → x + s.) A formal computation[6]: Section 14.2 (using a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula) readily yields eitQeisP=e−isteisPeitQ.^itQe^isP=e^-iste^isPe^itQ. Conversely, given two one-parameter unitary groups U(t) and V(s) satisfying the braiding relation U(t)V(s)=e−istV(s)U(t)∀s,t,(t)V(s)=e^-istV(s)U(t) ,t, (E1) formally differentiating at 0 shows that the two infinitesimal generators satisfy the above canonical commutation relation. This braiding formulation of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) for one-parameter unitary groups is called the Weyl form of the CCR. It is important to note that the preceding derivation is purely formal. Since the operators involved are unbounded, technical issues prevent application of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula without additional domain assumptions. Indeed, there exist operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation but not the Weyl relations (E1).[6]: Example 14.5 Nevertheless, in "good" cases, we expect that operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation will also satisfy the Weyl relations. The problem thus becomes classifying two jointly irreducible one-parameter unitary groups U(t) and V(s) which satisfy the Weyl relation on separable Hilbert spaces. The answer is the content of the Stone–von Neumann theorem: all such pairs of one-parameter unitary groups are unitarily equivalent.[6]: Theorem 14.8 In other words, for any two such U(t) and V(s) acting jointly irreducibly on a Hilbert space H, there is a unitary operator W : L2(R) → H so that W∗U(t)W=eitxandW∗V(s)W=eisp,^*U(t)W=e^itx and^*V(s)W=e^isp, where p and x are the explicit position and momentum operators from earlier. When W is U in this equation, so, then, in the x-representation, it is evident that P is unitarily equivalent to e−itQ P eitQ = P + t, and the spectrum of P must range along the entire real line. The analog argument holds for Q. There is also a straightforward extension of the Stone–von Neumann theorem to n degrees of freedom.[6]: Theorem 14.8 Historically, this result was significant, because it was a key step in proving that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, which presents quantum mechanical observables and dynamics in terms of infinite matrices, is unitarily equivalent to Schrödinger's wave mechanical formulation (see Schrödinger picture), [U(t)ψ](x)=eitxψ(x),[V(s)ψ](x)=ψ(x+s).[U(t)ψ](x)=e^itxψ(x), [V(s)ψ](x)=ψ(x+s).
