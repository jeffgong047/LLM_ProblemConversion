transform: For any non-zero h, the mapping αh:M(a,b,c)→M(−h−1b,ha,c−a⋅b)α_h:M(a,b,c)→M(-h^-1b,ha,c-a) is an automorphism of Hn which is the identity on the center of Hn. In particular, the representations Uh and Uhα are unitarily equivalent. This means that there is a unitary operator W on L2(Rn) such that, for any g in Hn, WUh(g)W∗=Uhα(g)._h(g)W^*=U_hα(g). Moreover, by irreducibility of the representations Uh, it follows that up to a scalar, such an operator W is unique (cf. Schur's lemma). Since W is unitary, this scalar multiple is uniquely determined and hence such an operator W is unique. Theorem — The operator W is the Fourier transform on L2(Rn). This means that, ignoring the factor of (2π)n/2 in the definition of the Fourier transform, ∫Rne−ix⋅pei(b⋅x+hc)ψ(x+ha)dx=ei(ha⋅p+h(c−b⋅a))∫Rne−iy⋅(p−b)ψ(y)dy.∫_𝐑^ne^-ixe^i(b+hc)ψ(x+ha)=e^i(ha+h(c-b))∫_𝐑^ne^-iy·(p-b)ψ(y). This theorem has the immediate implication that the Fourier transform is unitary, also known as the Plancherel theorem. Moreover, (αh)2M(a,b,c)=M(−a,−b,c).(α_h)^2M(a,b,c)=M(-a,-b,c). Theorem — The operator W1 such that W1UhW1∗=Uhα2(g)_1U_hW_1^*=U_hα^2(g) is the reflection operator [W1ψ](x)=ψ(−x).[W_1ψ](x)=ψ(-x). From this fact the Fourier inversion formula easily follows.
