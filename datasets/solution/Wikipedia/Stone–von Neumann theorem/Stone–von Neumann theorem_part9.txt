groups: The Heisenberg group Hn(K) is defined for any commutative ring K. In this section let us specialize to the field K = Z/pZ for p a prime. This field has the property that there is an embedding ω of K as an additive group into the circle group T. Note that Hn(K) is finite with cardinality |K|2n + 1. For finite Heisenberg group Hn(K) one can give a simple proof of the Stone–von Neumann theorem using simple properties of character functions of representations. These properties follow from the orthogonality relations for characters of representations of finite groups. For any non-zero h in K define the representation Uh on the finite-dimensional inner product space ℓ2(Kn) by [UhM(a,b,c)ψ](x)=ω(b⋅x+hc)ψ(x+ha).[U_hM(a,b,c)ψ](x)=ω(b+hc)ψ(x+ha). Theorem — For a fixed non-zero h, the character function χ of Uh is given by: χ(M(a,b,c))=|K|nω(hc)ifa=b=00otherwiseχ(M(a,b,c))=|K|^n ω(hc) ifa=b=0 0 otherwise It follows that 1|Hn(K)|∑g∈Hn(K)|χ(g)|2=1|K|2n+1|K|2n|K|=1.1/|H_n(𝐊)|∑_g_n(K)|χ(g)|^2=1/|K|^2n+1|K|^2n|K|=1. By the orthogonality relations for characters of representations of finite groups this fact implies the corresponding Stone–von Neumann theorem for Heisenberg groups Hn(Z/pZ), particularly: Irreducibility of Uh Pairwise inequivalence of all the representations Uh. Actually, all irreducible representations of Hn(K) on which the center acts nontrivially arise in this way.[6]: Chapter 14, Exercise 5
