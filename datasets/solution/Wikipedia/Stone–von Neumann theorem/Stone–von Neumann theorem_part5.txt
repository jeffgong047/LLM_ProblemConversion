transform: Let G be a locally compact abelian group and G^ be the Pontryagin dual of G. The Fourier–Plancherel transform defined by f↦f^(γ)=∫Gγ(t)¯f(t)dμ(t)↦f̂(γ)=∫_Gγ(t)f(t)dμ(t) extends to a C*-isomorphism from the group C*-algebra C*(G) of G and C0(G^), i.e. the spectrum of C*(G) is precisely G^. When G is the real line R, this is Stone's theorem characterizing one-parameter unitary groups. The theorem of Stone–von Neumann can also be restated using similar language. The group G acts on the C*-algebra C0(G) by right translation ρ: for s in G and f in C0(G), (s⋅f)(t)=f(t+s).(s)(t)=f(t+s). Under the isomorphism given above, this action becomes the natural action of G on C*(G^): (s⋅f)^(γ)=γ(s)f^(γ).(s)(γ)=γ(s)f̂(γ). So a covariant representation corresponding to the C*-crossed product C∗(G^)⋊ρ^G^*(Ĝ)⋊_ρ̂G is a unitary representation U(s) of G and V(γ) of G^ such that U(s)V(γ)U∗(s)=γ(s)V(γ).(s)V(γ)U^*(s)=γ(s)V(γ). It is a general fact that covariant representations are in one-to-one correspondence with *-representation of the corresponding crossed product. On the other hand, all irreducible representations of C0(G)⋊ρG_0(G)⋊_ρG are unitarily equivalent to the K(L2(G))𝒦(L^2(G)), the compact operators on L2(G)). Therefore, all pairs {U(s), V(γ)} are unitarily equivalent. Specializing to the case where G = R yields the Stone–von Neumann theorem. The Heisenberg
