space: The Segal–Bargmann space is the space of holomorphic functions on Cn that are square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure. Fock observed in 1920s that the operators aj=∂∂zj,aj∗=zj,_j=∂/_j,_j^*=z_j, acting on holomorphic functions, satisfy the same commutation relations as the usual annihilation and creation operators, namely, [aj,ak∗]=δj,k.[a_j,a_k^*]=δ_j,k. In 1961, Bargmann showed that a∗j is actually the adjoint of aj with respect to the inner product coming from the Gaussian measure. By taking appropriate linear combinations of aj and a∗j, one can then obtain "position" and "momentum" operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations. It is not hard to show that the exponentials of these operators satisfy the Weyl relations and that the exponentiated operators act irreducibly.[6]: Section 14.4 The Stone–von Neumann theorem therefore applies and implies the existence of a unitary map from L2(Rn) to the Segal–Bargmann space that intertwines the usual annihilation and creation operators with the operators aj and a∗j. This unitary map is the Segal–Bargmann transform. Representations of finite Heisenberg
