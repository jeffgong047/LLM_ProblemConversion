Example: The algebra necessary for this example is easily carried out by a web service that computes normal form coordinate transforms of systems of differential equations, autonomous or non-autonomous, deterministic or stochastic.[11] Consider the 2D system in variables u=(y,z)=(y,z) evolving according to the pair of coupled differential equations dydt=−3y+yzanddzdt=z+y2.dy/dt=-3y+yz and dz/dt=z+y^2. By direct computation it can be seen that the only equilibrium of this system lies at the origin, that is u∗=0^*=0. The coordinate transform, u=h−1(U)=h^-1(U) where U=(Y,Z)=(Y,Z), given by y≈Y+YZ+142Y3+12YZ2z≈Z−17Y2−13Y2Zy +YZ+142Y^3+12YZ^2 z -17Y^2-13Y^2Z is a smooth map between the original u=(y,z)=(y,z) and new U=(Y,Z)=(Y,Z) coordinates, at least near the equilibrium at the origin. In the new coordinates the dynamical system transforms to its linearisation dYdt=−3YanddZdt=Z.dY/dt=-3Y and dZ/dt=Z. That is, a distorted version of the linearisation gives the original dynamics in some finite neighbourhood. See
