theorem: Consider a system evolving in time with state u(t)∈Rn(t)∈ℝ^n that satisfies the differential equation du/dt=f(u)/dt=f(u) for some smooth map f:Rn→Rn:ℝ^n→ℝ^n. Now suppose the map has a hyperbolic equilibrium state u∗∈Rn^*∈ℝ^n: that is, f(u∗)=0(u^*)=0 and the Jacobian matrix A=[∂fi/∂xj]=[_i/_j] of f at state u∗^* has no eigenvalue with real part equal to zero. Then there exists a neighbourhood N of the equilibrium u∗^* and a homeomorphism h:N→Rn:N→ℝ^n, such that h(u∗)=0(u^*)=0 and such that in the neighbourhood N the flow of du/dt=f(u)/dt=f(u) is topologically conjugate by the continuous map U=h(u)=h(u) to the flow of its linearisation dU/dt=AU/dt=AU.[2][3][4][5] Even for infinitely differentiable maps f, the homeomorphism h need not to be smooth, nor even locally Lipschitz. However, it turns out to be Hölder continuous, with an exponent depending on the constant of hyperbolicity of A.[6] The Hartman–Grobman theorem has been extended to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, non-autonomous systems du/dt=f(u,t)/dt=f(u,t) (potentially stochastic), and to cater for the topological differences that occur when there are eigenvalues with zero or near-zero real-part.[7][8][9][10]
