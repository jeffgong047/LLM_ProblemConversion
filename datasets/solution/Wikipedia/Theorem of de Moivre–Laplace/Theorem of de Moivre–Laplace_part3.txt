Proof: The theorem can be more rigorously stated as follows: (X−np)/npq(X - np)/√(npq), with X a binomially distributed random variable, approaches the standard normal as n→∞→∞, with the ratio of the probability mass of X to the limiting normal density being 1. This can be shown for an arbitrary nonzero and finite point c. On the unscaled curve for X, this would be a point k given by k=np+cnpq=np+c√(npq) For example, with c at 3, k stays 3 standard deviations from the mean in the unscaled curve. The normal distribution with mean μμ and standard deviation σσ is defined by the differential equation (DE) f′(x)=−x−μσ2f(x)'(x)=- x-μ/σ^2f(x) with an initial condition set by the probability axiom ∫−∞∞f(x)dx=1∫_-∞^∞f(x) dx=1. The binomial distribution limit approaches the normal if the binomial satisfies this DE. As the binomial is discrete the equation starts as a difference equation whose limit morphs to a DE. Difference equations use the discrete derivative, p(k+1)−p(k)(k+1)-p(k), the change for step size 1. As n→∞→∞, the discrete derivative becomes the continuous derivative. Hence the proof need show only that, for the unscaled binomial distribution, f′(x)f(x)⋅(−σ2x−μ)→1f'(x)/f(x)·(-σ^2/x-μ)→1 as n→∞→∞. The required result can be shown directly: f′(x)f(x)npqnp−k=p(n,k+1)−p(n,k)p(n,k)npq−c=np−k−qkq+qnpq−c=−cnpq−qnpq+cqnpq+qnpq−c→1f'(x)/f(x)npq/np - k =p(n,k+1)-p(n,k)/p(n,k)√(npq)/-c =np-k-q/kq+q√(npq)/-c =-c√(npq)-q/npq+cq√(npq)+q√(npq)/-c →1 The last holds because the term −cnpq-cnpq dominates both the denominator and the numerator as n→∞→∞. As k takes just integral values, the constant c is subject to a rounding error. However, the maximum of this error, 0.5/npq0.5/√(npq), is a vanishing value.[4] Alternate
