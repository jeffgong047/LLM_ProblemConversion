In mathematics, the Mazur–Ulam theorem states that if V and W are normed spaces over R and the mapping f:V→W is a surjective isometry, then f is affine. It was proved by Stanisław Mazur and Stanisław Ulam in response to a question raised by Stefan Banach. For strictly convex spaces the result is true, and easy, even for isometries which are not necessarily surjective. In this case, for any u and v in V, and for any t in [0,1][0,1], write r=‖u−v‖V=‖f(u)−f(v)‖W=u-v_V=f(u)-f(v)_W and denote the closed ball of radius R around v by B¯(v,R)B̅(v,R). Then tu+(1−t)v+(1-t)v is the unique element of B¯(v,tr)∩B¯(u,(1−t)r)B̅(v,tr)∩B̅(u,(1-t)r), so, since f is injective, f(tu+(1−t)v)(tu+(1-t)v) is the unique element of f(B¯(v,tr)∩B¯(u,(1−t)r)=f(B¯(v,tr))∩f(B¯(u,(1−t)r)=B¯(f(v),tr)∩B¯(f(u),(1−t)r),(B̅(v,tr)∩B̅(u,(1-t)r)=f(B̅(v,tr))(B̅(u,(1-t)r)=B̅(f(v),tr)∩B̅(f(u),(1-t)r), and therefore is equal to tf(u)+(1−t)f(v)(u)+(1-t)f(v). Therefore f is an affine map. This argument fails in the general case, because in a normed space which is not strictly convex two tangent balls may meet in some flat convex region of their boundary, not just a single point. See
