logic: IMSAT, the Boolean satisfiability problem for "intersecting monotone CNF": conjunctive normal form, with each clause containing only positive or only negative terms, and each positive clause having a variable in common with each negative clause[6] Minimum circuit size problem: given the truth table of a Boolean function and positive integer s, does there exist a circuit of size at most s for this function?[7] Monotone dualization: given CNF and DNF formulas for monotone Boolean functions, do they represent the same function?[8] Monotone self-duality: given a CNF formula for a Boolean function, is the function invariant under a transformation that negates all of its variables and then negates the output value?[8] Computational geometry and computational
