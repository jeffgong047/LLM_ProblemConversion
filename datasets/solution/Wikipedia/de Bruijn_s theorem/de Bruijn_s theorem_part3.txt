brick: Suppose that a d-dimensional rectangular box (mathematically a cuboid) has integer side lengths A1⋅A2⋅…⋅Ad_1_2·…_d and a brick has lengths a1⋅a2⋅…⋅ad_1_2·…_d. If the sides of the brick can be multiplied by another set of integers bi_i so that a1b1,a2b2,…adbd_1b_1,a_2b_2,_db_d are a permutation of A1,A2,…,Ad_1,A_2,…,A_d, the box is called a multiple of the brick. The box can then be filled with such bricks in a trivial way with all the bricks oriented the same way.[1] A
