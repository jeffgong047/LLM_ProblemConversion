bricks: The third of de Bruijn's results is that, if a brick is not harmonic, then there is a box that it can fill that is not a multiple of the brick. The packing of the 2⋅32·3 brick into the 5⋅65·6 box provides an example of this phenomenon.[1] An (a1+a2)⋅(a1a2)(a_1+a_2)·(a_1a_2) box, tiled with a1⋅a2_1_2 bricks, for the case a1=2_1=2 and a2=5_2=5 In the two-dimensional case, the third of de Bruijn's results is easy to visualize. A box with dimensions A1=a1_1=a_1 and A2=a1⋅a2_2=a_1_2 is easy to pack with a1_1 copies of a brick with dimensions a1,a2_1,a_2, placed side by side. For the same reason, a box with dimensions A1=a1⋅a2_1=a_1_2 and A2=a2_2=a_2 is also easy to pack with copies of the same brick. Rotating one of these two boxes so that their long sides are parallel and placing them side by side results in a packing of a larger box with A1=a1+a2_1=a_1+a_2 and A2=a1⋅a2_2=a_1_2. This larger box is a multiple of the brick if and only if the brick is harmonic.
