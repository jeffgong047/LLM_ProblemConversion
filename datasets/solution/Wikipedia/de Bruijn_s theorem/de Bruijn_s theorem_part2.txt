Example: De Bruijn was led to prove this result after his then-seven-year-old son, F. W. de Bruijn, was unable to pack bricks of dimension 1⋅2⋅41·2·4 into a 6⋅6⋅66·6·6 cube.[2][3] The cube has a volume equal to that of 2727 bricks, but only 2626 bricks may be packed into it. One way to see this is to partition the cube into 2727 smaller cubes of size 2⋅2⋅22·2·2 colored alternately black and white. This coloring has more unit cells of one color than of the other, but with this coloring any placement of the 1⋅2⋅41·2·4 brick must have equal numbers of cells of each color. Therefore, any tiling by bricks would also have equal numbers of cells of each color, an impossibility.[4] De Bruijn's theorem proves that a perfect packing with these dimensions is impossible, in a more general way that applies to many other dimensions of bricks and boxes. Boxes that are multiples of the
