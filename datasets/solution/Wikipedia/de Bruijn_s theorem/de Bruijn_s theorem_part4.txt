generalization: Not every packing involves boxes that are multiples of bricks. For instance, as de Bruijn observes, a 5⋅65·6 rectangular box can be filled with copies of a 2⋅32·3 rectangular brick, although not with all the bricks oriented the same way. However, de Bruijn (1969) proves that if the bricks can fill the box, then for each ai,_i, at least one of the Ai_i is a multiple. In the above example, the side of length 66 is a multiple of both 22 and 33.[1] Harmonic
