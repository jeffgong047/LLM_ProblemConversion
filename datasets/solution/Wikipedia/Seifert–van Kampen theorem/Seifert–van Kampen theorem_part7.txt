spaces: Given two pointed spaces (X,x)(X,x) and (Y,y)(Y,y) we can form their wedge sum, (X∨Y,p)(X,p), by taking the quotient of X∐Y by identifying their two basepoints. If x admits a contractible open neighborhood U⊂X and y admits a contractible open neighborhood V⊂Y (which is the case if, for instance, X and Y are CW complexes), then we can apply the Van Kampen theorem to X∨Y by taking X∨V and U∨Y as the two open sets and we conclude that the fundamental group of the wedge is the free product of the fundamental groups of the two spaces we started with: π1(X∨Y,p)≅π1(X,x)∗π1(Y,y)π_1(X,p)≅π_1(X,x)*π_1(Y,y).
