Generalizations: As explained above, this theorem was extended by Ronald Brown to the non-connected case by using the fundamental groupoid π1(X,A)π_1(X,A) on a set A of base points. The theorem for arbitrary covers, with the restriction that A meets all threefold intersections of the sets of the cover, is given in the paper by Brown and Abdul Razak Salleh.[11] The theorem and proof for the fundamental group, but using some groupoid methods, are also given in J. Peter May's book.[12] The version that allows more than two overlapping sets but with A a singleton is also given in Allen Hatcher's book below, theorem 1.20. Applications of the fundamental groupoid on a set of base points to the Jordan curve theorem, covering spaces, and orbit spaces are given in Ronald Brown's book.[13] In the case of orbit spaces, it is convenient to take A to include all the fixed points of the action. An example here is the conjugation action on the circle. References to higher-dimensional versions of the theorem which yield some information on homotopy types are given in an article on higher-dimensional group theories and groupoids.[14] Thus a 2-dimensional Van Kampen theorem which computes nonabelian second relative homotopy groups was given by Ronald Brown and Philip J. Higgins.[15] A full account and extensions to all dimensions are given by Brown, Higgins, and Rafael Sivera,[16] while an extension to n-cubes of spaces is given by Ronald Brown and Jean-Louis Loday.[17] Fundamental groups also appear in algebraic geometry and are the main topic of Alexander Grothendieck's first Séminaire de géométrie algébrique (SGA1). A version of Van Kampen's theorem appears there, and is proved along quite different lines than in algebraic topology, namely by descent theory. A similar proof works in algebraic topology.[18] See
