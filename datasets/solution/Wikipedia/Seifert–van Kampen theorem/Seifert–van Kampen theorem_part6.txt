2-sphere: One can use Van Kampen's theorem to calculate fundamental groups for topological spaces that can be decomposed into simpler spaces. For example, consider the sphere S2^2. Pick open sets A=S2∖n=S^2∖{n} and B=S2∖s=S^2∖{s} where n and s denote the north and south poles respectively. Then we have the property that A, B and A ∩ B are open path connected sets. Thus we can see that there is a commutative diagram including A ∩ B into A and B and then another inclusion from A and B into S2^2 and that there is a corresponding diagram of homomorphisms between the fundamental groups of each subspace. Applying Van Kampen's theorem gives the result π1(S2)=π1(A)⋅π1(B)/ker⁡(Φ).π_1(S^2)=π_1(A)·π_1(B)/(Φ). However, A and B are both homeomorphic to R2 which is simply connected, so both A and B have trivial fundamental groups. It is clear from this that the fundamental group of S2^2 is trivial.
