surfaces: A more complicated example is the calculation of the fundamental group of a genus-n orientable surface S, otherwise known as the genus-n surface group. One can construct S using its standard fundamental polygon. For the first open set A, pick a disk within the center of the polygon. Pick B to be the complement in S of the center point of A. Then the intersection of A and B is an annulus, which is known to be homotopy equivalent to (and so has the same fundamental group as) a circle. Then π1(A∩B)=π1(S1)π_1(A)=π_1(S^1), which is the integers, and π1(A)=π1(D2)=1π_1(A)=π_1(D^2)=1. Thus the inclusion of π1(A∩B)π_1(A) into π1(A)π_1(A) sends any generator to the trivial element. However, the inclusion of π1(A∩B)π_1(A) into π1(B)π_1(B) is not trivial. In order to understand this, first one must calculate π1(B)π_1(B). This is easily done as one can deformation retract B (which is S with one point deleted) onto the edges labeled by A1B1A1−1B1−1A2B2A2−1B2−1⋯AnBnAn−1Bn−1._1B_1A_1^-1B_1^-1A_2B_2A_2^-1B_2^-1_nB_nA_n^-1B_n^-1. This space is known to be the wedge sum of 2n circles (also called a bouquet of circles), which further is known to have fundamental group isomorphic to the free group with 2n generators, which in this case can be represented by the edges themselves: A1,B1,…,An,Bn{A_1,B_1,…,A_n,B_n}. We now have enough information to apply Van Kampen's theorem. The generators are the loops A1,B1,…,An,Bn{A_1,B_1,…,A_n,B_n} (A is simply connected, so it contributes no generators) and there is exactly one relation: A1B1A1−1B1−1A2B2A2−1B2−1⋯AnBnAn−1Bn−1=1._1B_1A_1^-1B_1^-1A_2B_2A_2^-1B_2^-1_nB_nA_n^-1B_n^-1=1. Using generators and relations, this group is denoted ⟨A1,B1,…,An,Bn|A1B1A1−1B1−1⋯AnBnAn−1Bn−1⟩._1,B_1,…,A_n,B_n|A_1B_1A_1^-1B_1^-1_nB_nA_n^-1B_n^-1.⟩.
