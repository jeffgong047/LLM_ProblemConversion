groups: Let X be a topological space which is the union of two open and path connected subspaces U1, U2. Suppose U1 ∩ U2 is path connected and nonempty, and let x0 be a point in U1 ∩ U2 that will be used as the base of all fundamental groups. The inclusion maps of U1 and U2 into X induce group homomorphisms j1:π1(U1,x0)→π1(X,x0)_1:π_1(U_1,x_0)→π_1(X,x_0) and j2:π1(U2,x0)→π1(X,x0)_2:π_1(U_2,x_0)→π_1(X,x_0). Then X is path connected and j1_1 and j2_2 form a commutative pushout diagram: The natural morphism k is an isomorphism. That is, the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of U1 and U2 with amalgamation of π1(U1∩U2,x0)π_1(U_1_2,x_0).[1] Usually the morphisms induced by inclusion in this theorem are not themselves injective, and the more precise version of the statement is in terms of pushouts of groups.
