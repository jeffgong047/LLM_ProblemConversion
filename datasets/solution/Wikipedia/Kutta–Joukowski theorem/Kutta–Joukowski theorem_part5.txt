argument: For a heuristic argument, consider a thin airfoil of chord c and infinite span, moving through air of density ρρ. Let the airfoil be inclined to the oncoming flow to produce an air speed V on one side of the airfoil, and an air speed V+v+v on the other side. The circulation is then Γ=Vc−(V+v)c=−vc.Γ=Vc-(V+v)c=-vc. The difference in pressure ΔP between the two sides of the airfoil can be found by applying Bernoulli's equation: ρ2(V)2+(P+ΔP)=ρ2(V+v)2+P,ρ2(V)2+ΔP=ρ2(V2+2Vv+v2),ΔP=ρVv(ignoringρ2v2),ρ/2(V)^2+(P+) =ρ/2(V+v)^2+P, ρ/2(V)^2+ =ρ/2(V^2+2Vv+v^2), = (ignoringρ/2v^2), so the downward force on the air, per unit span, is L′=cΔP=ρVvc=−ρVΓ'=c==-Γ and the upward force (lift) on the airfoil is ρVΓ.Γ. A differential version of this theorem applies on each element of the plate and is the basis of thin-airfoil theory. Formal
