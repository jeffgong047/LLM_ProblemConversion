derivation: Formal derivation of Kutta–Joukowski theorem First of all, the force exerted on each unit length of a cylinder of arbitrary cross section is calculated.[6] Let this force per unit length (from now on referred to simply as force) be F𝐅. So then the total force is: F=−∮Cpnds,𝐅=-∮_Cp𝐧 ds, where C denotes the borderline of the cylinder, p is the static pressure of the fluid, n𝐧 is the unit vector normal to the cylinder, and ds is the arc element of the borderline of the cross section. Now let ϕϕ be the angle between the normal vector and the vertical. Then the components of the above force are: Fx=−∮Cpsin⁡ϕds,Fy=∮Cpcos⁡ϕds._x=-∮_Cpsinϕ ds ,_y=∮_Cpcosϕ ds. Now comes a crucial step: consider the used two-dimensional space as a complex plane. So every vector can be represented as a complex number, with its first component equal to the real part and its second component equal to the imaginary part of the complex number. Then, the force can be represented as: F=Fx+iFy=−∮Cp(sin⁡ϕ−icos⁡ϕ)ds.=F_x+iF_y=-∮_Cp(sinϕ-icosϕ) ds. The next step is to take the complex conjugate of the force F and do some manipulation: F¯=−∮Cp(sin⁡ϕ+icos⁡ϕ)ds=−i∮Cp(cos⁡ϕ−isin⁡ϕ)ds=−i∮Cpe−iϕds.F̅=-∮_Cp(sinϕ+icosϕ) ds=-i∮_Cp(cosϕ-isinϕ) ds=-i∮_Cpe^-iϕ ds. Surface segments ds are related to changes dz along them by: dz=dx+idy=ds(cos⁡ϕ+isin⁡ϕ)=dseiϕ⇒dz¯=e−iϕds.dz =dx+idy=ds(cosϕ+isinϕ)=ds e^iϕ z̅ =e^-iϕds. Plugging this back into the integral, the result is: F¯=−i∮Cpdz¯.F̅=-i∮_Cp dz̅. Now the Bernoulli equation is used, in order to remove the pressure from the integral. Throughout the analysis it is assumed that there is no outer force field present. The mass density of the flow is ρ.ρ. Then pressure p is related to velocity v=vx+ivy=v_x+iv_y by: p=p0−ρ|v|22.=p_0-ρ|v|^2/2. With this the force F becomes: F¯=−ip0∮Cdz¯+iρ2∮C|v|2dz¯=iρ2∮C|v|2dz¯.F̅=-ip_0∮_Cdz̅+iρ/2∮_C|v|^2 dz̅=iρ/2∮_C|v|^2 dz̅. Only one step is left to do: introduce w=f(z),=f(z), the complex potential of the flow. This is related to the velocity components as w′=vx−ivy=v¯,'=v_x-iv_y=v̅, where the apostrophe denotes differentiation with respect to the complex variable z. The velocity is tangent to the borderline C, so this means that v=±|v|eiϕ.=±|v|e^iϕ. Therefore, v2dz¯=|v|2dz,^2dz̅=|v|^2dz, and the desired expression for the force is obtained: F¯=iρ2∮Cw′2dz,F̅=iρ/2∮_Cw'^2 dz, which is called the Blasius theorem. To arrive at the Joukowski formula, this integral has to be evaluated. From complex analysis it is known that a holomorphic function can be presented as a Laurent series. From the physics of the problem it is deduced that the derivative of the complex potential w will look thus: w′(z)=a0+a1z+a2z2+⋯.'(z)=a_0+a_1/z+a_2/z^2+⋯. The function does not contain higher order terms, since the velocity stays finite at infinity. So a0_0 represents the derivative the complex potential at infinity: a0=vx∞−ivy∞_0=v_x∞-iv_y∞ . The next task is to find out the meaning of a1_1 . Using the residue theorem on the above series: a1=12πi∮Cw′dz._1=1/2∮_Cw' dz. Now perform the above integration: ∮Cw′(z)dz=∮C(vx−ivy)(dx+idy)=∮C(vxdx+vydy)+i∮C(vxdy−vydx)=∮Cvds+i∮C(vxdy−vydx).∮_Cw'(z) dz =∮_C(v_x-iv_y)(dx+idy) =∮_C(v_x dx+v_y dy)+i∮_C(v_x dy-v_y dx) =∮_C𝐯 ds+i∮_C(v_x dy-v_y dx). The first integral is recognized as the circulation denoted by Γ.Γ. The second integral can be evaluated after some manipulation: ∮C(vxdy−vydx)=∮C(∂ψ∂ydy+∂ψ∂xdx)=∮Cdψ=0.∮_C(v_x dy-v_y dx)=∮_C(∂ψ/dy+∂ψ/dx)=∮_Cdψ=0. Here ψψ is the stream function. Since the C border of the cylinder is a streamline itself, the stream function does not change on it, and dψ=0ψ=0 . Hence the above integral is zero. As a result: a1=Γ2πi._1=Γ/2. Take the square of the series: w′2(z)=a02+a0Γπiz+⋯.'^2(z)=a_0^2+a_0Γ/+⋯. Plugging this back into the Blasius–Chaplygin formula, and performing the integration using the residue theorem: F¯=iρ2[2πia0Γπi]=iρa0Γ=iρΓ(vx∞−ivy∞)=ρΓvy∞+iρΓvx∞=Fx−iFy.F̅=iρ/2[2a_0Γ/]=i_0Γ=iρΓ(v_x∞-iv_y∞)=ρ_y∞+iρ_x∞=F_x-iF_y. And so the Kutta–Joukowski formula is: Fx=ρΓvy∞,Fy=−ρΓvx∞.F_x =ρ_y∞ , F_y =-ρ_x∞. Lift forces for more complex
