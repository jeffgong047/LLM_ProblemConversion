formula: The theorem applies to two-dimensional flow around a fixed airfoil (or any shape of infinite span). The lift per unit span L′' of the airfoil is given by[4] L′=ρ∞V∞Γ,^'=ρ_∞V_∞Γ, (1) where ρ∞ρ_∞ and V∞_∞ are the fluid density and the fluid velocity far upstream of the airfoil, and ΓΓ is the circulation defined as the line integral Γ=∮CV⋅ds=∮CVcos⁡θdsΓ=∮_CV𝐬=∮_CVcosθ ds around a closed contour C enclosing the airfoil and followed in the negative (clockwise) direction. As explained below, this path must be in a region of potential flow and not in the boundary layer of the cylinder. The integrand Vcos⁡θcosθ is the component of the local fluid velocity in the direction tangent to the curve C, and ds is an infinitesimal length on the curve C. Equation (1) is a form of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem. Kuethe and Schetzer state the Kutta–Joukowski theorem as follows:[5] The force per unit length acting on a right cylinder of any cross section whatsoever is equal to ρ∞V∞Γρ_∞V_∞Γ and is perpendicular to the direction of V∞._∞.
