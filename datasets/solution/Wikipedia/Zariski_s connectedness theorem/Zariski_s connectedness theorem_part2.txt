Statement: Suppose that f is a proper surjective morphism of varieties from X to Y such that the function field of Y is separably closed in that of X. Then Zariski's connectedness theorem says that the inverse image of any normal point of Y is connected. An alternative version says that if f is proper and f* OX = OY, then f is surjective and the inverse image of any point of Y is connected.
