matrices: As a special case, for every n × n real symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors can be chosen real and orthonormal. Thus a real symmetric matrix A can be decomposed as A=QΛQT𝐀=𝐐Λ𝐐^𝖳 where Q is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the real, orthonormal eigenvectors of A, and Λ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of A.[7] Useful
