eigenvalues: The product of the eigenvalues is equal to the determinant of A det(A)=∏i=1Nλλini(𝐀)=∏_i=1^N_λλ_i^n_i Note that each eigenvalue is raised to the power ni, the algebraic multiplicity. The sum of the eigenvalues is equal to the trace of A tr⁡(A)=∑i=1Nλniλitr(𝐀)=∑_i=1^N_λn_iλ_i Note that each eigenvalue is multiplied by ni, the algebraic multiplicity. If the eigenvalues of A are λi, and A is invertible, then the eigenvalues of A−1 are simply λ−1i. If the eigenvalues of A are λi, then the eigenvalues of f (A) are simply f (λi), for any holomorphic function f. Useful facts regarding
