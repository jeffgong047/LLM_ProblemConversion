eigenvalues: Main article: Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace A (nonzero) vector v of dimension N is an eigenvector of a square N × N matrix A if it satisfies a linear equation of the form Av=λv𝐀𝐯=λ𝐯 for some scalar λ. Then λ is called the eigenvalue corresponding to v. Geometrically speaking, the eigenvectors of A are the vectors that A merely elongates or shrinks, and the amount that they elongate/shrink by is the eigenvalue. The above equation is called the eigenvalue equation or the eigenvalue problem. This yields an equation for the eigenvalues p(λ)=det(A−λI)=0.(λ)=(𝐀-λ𝐈)=0. We call p(λ) the characteristic polynomial, and the equation, called the characteristic equation, is an Nth order polynomial equation in the unknown λ. This equation will have Nλ distinct solutions, where 1 ≤ Nλ ≤ N. The set of solutions, that is, the eigenvalues, is called the spectrum of A.[1][2][3] If the field of scalars is algebraically closed, then we can factor p as p(λ)=(λ−λ1)n1(λ−λ2)n2⋯(λ−λNλ)nNλ=0.(λ)=(λ-λ_1)^n_1(λ-λ_2)^n_2⋯(λ-λ_N_λ)^n_N_λ=0. The integer ni is termed the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue λi. The algebraic multiplicities sum to N: ∑i=1Nλni=N.∑_i=1^N_λn_i=N. For each eigenvalue λi, we have a specific eigenvalue equation (A−λiI)v=0.(𝐀-λ_i𝐈)𝐯=0. There will be 1 ≤ mi ≤ ni linearly independent solutions to each eigenvalue equation. The linear combinations of the mi solutions (except the one which gives the zero vector) are the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue λi. The integer mi is termed the geometric multiplicity of λi. It is important to keep in mind that the algebraic multiplicity ni and geometric multiplicity mi may or may not be equal, but we always have mi ≤ ni. The simplest case is of course when mi = ni = 1. The total number of linearly independent eigenvectors, Nv, can be calculated by summing the geometric multiplicities ∑i=1Nλmi=Nv.∑_i=1^N_λm_i=N_𝐯. The eigenvectors can be indexed by eigenvalues, using a double index, with vij being the jth eigenvector for the ith eigenvalue. The eigenvectors can also be indexed using the simpler notation of a single index vk, with k = 1, 2, ..., Nv. Eigendecomposition of a
