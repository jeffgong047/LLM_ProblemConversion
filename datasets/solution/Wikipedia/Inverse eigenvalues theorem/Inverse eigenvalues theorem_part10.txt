matrices: A complex-valued square matrix A is normal (meaning A*A = AA*, where A* is the conjugate transpose) if and only if it can be decomposed as A=UΛU∗𝐀=𝐔Λ𝐔^* where U is a unitary matrix (meaning U* = U−1) and Λ = diag(λ1, ..., λn) is a diagonal matrix.[6] The columns u1, ..., un of U form an orthonormal basis and are eigenvectors of A with corresponding eigenvalues λ1, ..., λn. If A is restricted to be a Hermitian matrix (A = A*), then Λ has only real valued entries. If A is restricted to a unitary matrix, then Λ takes all its values on the complex unit circle, that is, |λi| = 1. Real symmetric
