problem: A generalized eigenvalue problem (second sense) is the problem of finding a (nonzero) vector v that obeys Av=λBv𝐀𝐯=λ𝐁𝐯 where A and B are matrices. If v obeys this equation, with some λ, then we call v the generalized eigenvector of A and B (in the second sense), and λ is called the generalized eigenvalue of A and B (in the second sense) which corresponds to the generalized eigenvector v. The possible values of λ must obey the following equation det(A−λB)=0.(𝐀-λ𝐁)=0. If n linearly independent vectors {v1, …, vn} can be found, such that for every i ∈ {1, …, n}, Avi = λiBvi, then we define the matrices P and D such that P=[||v1⋯vn||]≡[(v1)1⋯(vn)1⋮⋮(v1)n⋯(vn)n]=[ | |; 𝐯_1 ⋯ 𝐯_n; | | ]≡[ (𝐯_1)_1 ⋯ (𝐯_n)_1; ⋮ ⋮; (𝐯_1)_n ⋯ (𝐯_n)_n ] (D)ij=λi,ifi=j0,otherwise(D)_ij=λ_i, ifi=j 0, otherwise Then the following equality holds A=BPDP−1𝐀=𝐁𝐏𝐃𝐏^-1 And the proof is AP=A[||v1⋯vn||]=[||Av1⋯Avn||]=[||λ1Bv1⋯λnBvn||]=[||Bv1⋯Bvn||]D=BPD𝐀𝐏=𝐀[ | |; 𝐯_1 ⋯ 𝐯_n; | | ]=[ | |; A𝐯_1 ⋯ A𝐯_n; | | ]=[ | |; λ_1B𝐯_1 ⋯ λ_nB𝐯_n; | | ]=[ | |; B𝐯_1 ⋯ B𝐯_n; | | ]𝐃=𝐁𝐏𝐃 And since P is invertible, we multiply the equation from the right by its inverse, finishing the proof. The set of matrices of the form A − λB, where λ is a complex number, is called a pencil; the term matrix pencil can also refer to the pair (A, B) of matrices.[11] If B is invertible, then the original problem can be written in the form B−1Av=λv𝐁^-1𝐀𝐯=λ𝐯 which is a standard eigenvalue problem. However, in most situations it is preferable not to perform the inversion, but rather to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem as stated originally. This is especially important if A and B are Hermitian matrices, since in this case B−1A is not generally Hermitian and important properties of the solution are no longer apparent. If A and B are both symmetric or Hermitian, and B is also a positive-definite matrix, the eigenvalues λi are real and eigenvectors v1 and v2 with distinct eigenvalues are B-orthogonal (v1*Bv2 = 0).[12] In this case, eigenvectors can be chosen so that the matrix P defined above satisfies P∗BP=I𝐏^*𝐁𝐏=𝐈 or PP∗B=I𝐏𝐏^*𝐁=𝐈, and there exists a basis of generalized eigenvectors (it is not a defective problem).[11] This case is sometimes called a Hermitian definite pencil or definite pencil.[11] See
