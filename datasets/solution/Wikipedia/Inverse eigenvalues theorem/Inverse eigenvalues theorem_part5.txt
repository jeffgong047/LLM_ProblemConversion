eigendecomposition: Main article: Inverse matrix If a matrix A can be eigendecomposed and if none of its eigenvalues are zero, then A is invertible and its inverse is given by A−1=QΛ−1Q−1𝐀^-1=𝐐Λ^-1𝐐^-1 If A𝐀 is a symmetric matrix, since Q𝐐 is formed from the eigenvectors of A𝐀, Q𝐐 is guaranteed to be an orthogonal matrix, therefore Q−1=QT𝐐^-1=𝐐^T. Furthermore, because Λ is a diagonal matrix, its inverse is easy to calculate: [Λ−1]ii=1λi[Λ^-1]_ii=1/λ_i Practical
