calculus: The eigendecomposition allows for much easier computation of power series of matrices. If f (x) is given by f(x)=a0+a1x+a2x2+⋯(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+⋯ then we know that f(A)=Qf(Λ)Q−1(𝐀)=𝐐 f(Λ)𝐐^-1 Because Λ is a diagonal matrix, functions of Λ are very easy to calculate: [f(Λ)]ii=f(λi)[f(Λ)]_ii=f(λ_i) The off-diagonal elements of f (Λ) are zero; that is, f (Λ) is also a diagonal matrix. Therefore, calculating f (A) reduces to just calculating the function on each of the eigenvalues. A similar technique works more generally with the holomorphic functional calculus, using A−1=QΛ−1Q−1𝐀^-1=𝐐Λ^-1𝐐^-1 from above. Once again, we find that [f(Λ)]ii=f(λi)[f(Λ)]_ii=f(λ_i)
