eigenvectors: If A is Hermitian and full-rank, the basis of eigenvectors may be chosen to be mutually orthogonal. The eigenvalues are real. The eigenvectors of A−1 are the same as the eigenvectors of A. Eigenvectors are only defined up to a multiplicative constant. That is, if Av = λv then cv is also an eigenvector for any scalar c ≠ 0. In particular, −v and eiθv (for any θ) are also eigenvectors. In the case of degenerate eigenvalues (an eigenvalue having more than one eigenvector), the eigenvectors have an additional freedom of linear transformation, that is to say, any linear (orthonormal) combination of eigenvectors sharing an eigenvalue (in the degenerate subspace) is itself an eigenvector (in the subspace).
