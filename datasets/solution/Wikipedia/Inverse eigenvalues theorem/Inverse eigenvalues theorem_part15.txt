eigendecomposition: A can be eigendecomposed if and only if the number of linearly independent eigenvectors, Nv, equals the dimension of an eigenvector: Nv = N If the field of scalars is algebraically closed and if p(λ) has no repeated roots, that is, if Nλ=N,_λ=N, then A can be eigendecomposed. The statement "A can be eigendecomposed" does not imply that A has an inverse as some eigenvalues may be zero, which is not invertible. The statement "A has an inverse" does not imply that A can be eigendecomposed. A counterexample is [1101][[ 1 1; 0 1 ]], which is an invertible defective matrix. Useful facts regarding matrix
