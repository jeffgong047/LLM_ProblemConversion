Example: The 2 × 2 real matrix A A=[1013]𝐀=[ 1 0; 1 3; ] may be decomposed into a diagonal matrix through multiplication of a non-singular matrix B B=[abcd]∈R2×2.𝐁=[ a b; c d ]∈ℝ^2×2. Then [abcd]−1[1013][abcd]=[x00y],[ a b; c d ]^-1[ 1 0; 1 3 ][ a b; c d ]=[ x 0; 0 y ], for some real diagonal matrix [x00y][[ x 0; 0 y ]]. Multiplying both sides of the equation on the left by B: [1013][abcd]=[abcd][x00y].[ 1 0; 1 3 ][ a b; c d ]=[ a b; c d ][ x 0; 0 y ]. The above equation can be decomposed into two simultaneous equations: [1013][ac]=[axcx][1013][bd]=[bydy].[ 1 0; 1 3 ][ a; c ]=[ ax; cx ] [ 1 0; 1 3 ][ b; d ]=[ by; dy ]. Factoring out the eigenvalues x and y: [1013][ac]=x[ac][1013][bd]=y[bd][ 1 0; 1 3 ][ a; c ]=x[ a; c ] [ 1 0; 1 3 ][ b; d ]=y[ b; d ] Letting a=[ac],b=[bd],𝐚=[ a; c ], 𝐛=[ b; d ], this gives us two vector equations: Aa=xaAb=yb𝐀𝐚=x𝐚 𝐀𝐛=y𝐛 And can be represented by a single vector equation involving two solutions as eigenvalues: Au=λu𝐀𝐮=λ𝐮 where λ represents the two eigenvalues x and y, and u represents the vectors a and b. Shifting λu to the left hand side and factoring u out (A−λI)u=0(𝐀-λ𝐈)𝐮=0 Since B is non-singular, it is essential that u is nonzero. Therefore, det(A−λI)=0(𝐀-λ𝐈)=0 Thus (1−λ)(3−λ)=0(1-λ)(3-λ)=0 giving us the solutions of the eigenvalues for the matrix A as λ = 1 or λ = 3, and the resulting diagonal matrix from the eigendecomposition of A is thus [1003][[ 1 0; 0 3 ]]. Putting the solutions back into the above simultaneous equations [1013][ac]=1[ac][1013][bd]=3[bd][ 1 0; 1 3 ][ a; c ]=1[ a; c ] [ 1 0; 1 3 ][ b; d ]=3[ b; d ] Solving the equations, we have a=−2candb=0,c,d∈R.=-2c and=0,,d∈ℝ. Thus the matrix B required for the eigendecomposition of A is B=[−2c0cd],c,d∈R,𝐁=[ -2c 0; c d ],,d∈ℝ, that is: [−2c0cd]−1[1013][−2c0cd]=[1003],c,d∈R[ -2c 0; c d ]^-1[ 1 0; 1 3 ][ -2c 0; c d ]=[ 1 0; 0 3 ],,d∈ℝ Matrix inverse via
