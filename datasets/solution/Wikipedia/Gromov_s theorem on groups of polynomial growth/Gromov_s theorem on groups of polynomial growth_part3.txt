groups: There is a vast literature on growth rates, leading up to Gromov's theorem. An earlier result of Joseph A. Wolf[2] showed that if G is a finitely generated nilpotent group, then the group has polynomial growth. Yves Guivarc'h[3] and independently Hyman Bass[4] (with different proofs) computed the exact order of polynomial growth. Let G be a finitely generated nilpotent group with lower central series G=G1⊇G2⊇⋯.=G_1_2⊇⋯. In particular, the quotient group Gk/Gk+1 is a finitely generated abelian group. The Bass–Guivarc'h formula states that the order of polynomial growth of G is d(G)=∑k≥1krank⁡(Gk/Gk+1)(G)=∑_k≥1krank(G_k/G_k+1) where: rank denotes the rank of an abelian group, i.e. the largest number of independent and torsion-free elements of the abelian group. In particular, Gromov's theorem and the Bass–Guivarc'h formula imply that the order of polynomial growth of a finitely generated group is always either an integer or infinity (excluding for example, fractional powers). Another nice application of Gromov's theorem and the Bass–Guivarch formula is to the quasi-isometric rigidity of finitely generated abelian groups: any group which is quasi-isometric to a finitely generated abelian group contains a free abelian group of finite index.
