Proof: The standard proof uses the fact that a bounded continuous real-valued function f is strong-operator continuous. In other words, for a net {aα} of self-adjoint operators in A, the continuous functional calculus a → f(a) satisfies, limf(aα)=f(limaα)(a_α)=f(_α) in the strong operator topology. This shows that self-adjoint part of the unit ball in A− can be approximated strongly by self-adjoint elements in A. A matrix computation in M2(A) considering the self-adjoint operator with entries 0 on the diagonal and a and a* at the other positions, then removes the self-adjointness restriction and proves the theorem.
