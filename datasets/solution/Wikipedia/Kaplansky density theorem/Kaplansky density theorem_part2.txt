statement: Let K− denote the strong-operator closure of a set K in B(H), the set of bounded operators on the Hilbert space H, and let (K)1 denote the intersection of K with the unit ball of B(H). Kaplansky density theorem.[2] If A is a self-adjoint algebra of operators in B(H)(H), then each element a in the unit ball of the strong-operator closure of A is in the strong-operator closure of the unit ball of A. In other words, (A)1−=(A−)1(A)_1^-=(A^-)_1. If h is a self-adjoint operator in (A−)1(A^-)_1, then h is in the strong-operator closure of the set of self-adjoint operators in (A)1(A)_1. The Kaplansky density theorem can be used to formulate some approximations with respect to the strong operator topology. 1) If h is a positive operator in (A−)1, then h is in the strong-operator closure of the set of self-adjoint operators in (A+)1, where A+ denotes the set of positive operators in A. 2) If A is a C*-algebra acting on the Hilbert space H and u is a unitary operator in A−, then u is in the strong-operator closure of the set of unitary operators in A. In the density theorem and 1) above, the results also hold if one considers a ball of radius r > 0, instead of the unit ball.
