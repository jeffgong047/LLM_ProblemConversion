On immersions of smooth m-dimensional manifolds in 2m-space and (2m-1) space In differential topology, the Whitney immersion theorem (named after Hassler Whitney) states that for m>1>1, any smooth m-dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable) has a one-to-one immersion in Euclidean 2m2m-space, and a (not necessarily one-to-one) immersion in (2m−1)(2m-1)-space. Similarly, every smooth m-dimensional manifold can be immersed in the 2m−12m-1-dimensional sphere (this removes the m>1>1 constraint). The weak version, for 2m+12m+1, is due to transversality (general position, dimension counting): two m-dimensional manifolds in R2m𝐑^2m intersect generically in a 0-dimensional space. Further
