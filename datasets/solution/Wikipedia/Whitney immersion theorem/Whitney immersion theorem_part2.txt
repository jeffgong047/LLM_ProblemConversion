results: William S. Massey (Massey 1960) went on to prove that every n-dimensional manifold is cobordant to a manifold that immerses in S2n−a(n)^2n-a(n) where a(n)(n) is the number of 1's that appear in the binary expansion of n. In the same paper, Massey proved that for every n there is manifold (which happens to be a product of real projective spaces) that does not immerse in S2n−1−a(n)^2n-1-a(n). The conjecture that every n-manifold immerses in S2n−a(n)^2n-a(n) became known as the immersion conjecture. This conjecture was eventually solved in the affirmative by Ralph Cohen (1985). See
