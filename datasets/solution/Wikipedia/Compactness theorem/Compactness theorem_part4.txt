principle: The compactness theorem implies the following result, stated by Abraham Robinson in his 1949 dissertation. Robinson's principle:[5][6] If a first-order sentence holds in every field of characteristic zero, then there exists a constant p such that the sentence holds for every field of characteristic larger than p.. This can be seen as follows: suppose φφ is a sentence that holds in every field of characteristic zero. Then its negation ¬φ,¬φ, together with the field axioms and the infinite sequence of sentences 1+1≠0,1+1+1≠0,…1+1≠0, 1+1+1≠0, … is not satisfiable (because there is no field of characteristic 0 in which ¬φ¬φ holds, and the infinite sequence of sentences ensures any model would be a field of characteristic 0). Therefore, there is a finite subset A of these sentences that is not satisfiable. A must contain ¬φ¬φ because otherwise it would be satisfiable. Because adding more sentences to A does not change unsatisfiability, we can assume that A contains the field axioms and, for some k,, the first k sentences of the form 1+1+⋯+1≠0.1+1+⋯+1≠0. Let B contain all the sentences of A except ¬φ.¬φ. Then any field with a characteristic greater than k is a model of B,, and ¬φ¬φ together with B is not satisfiable. This means that φφ must hold in every model of B,, which means precisely that φφ holds in every field of characteristic greater than k.. This completes the proof. The Lefschetz principle, one of the first examples of a transfer principle, extends this result. A first-order sentence φφ in the language of rings is true in some (or equivalently, in every) algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 (such as the complex numbers for instance) if and only if there exist infinitely many primes p for which φφ is true in some algebraically closed field of characteristic p,, in which case φφ is true in all algebraically closed fields of sufficiently large non-0 characteristic p..[5] One consequence is the following special case of the Ax–Grothendieck theorem: all injective complex polynomials Cn→Cnℂ^n→ℂ^n are surjective[5] (indeed, it can even be shown that its inverse will also be a polynomial).[7] In fact, the surjectivity conclusion remains true for any injective polynomial Fn→Fn^n^n where F is a finite field or the algebraic closure of such a field.[7] Upward Löwenheim–Skolem
