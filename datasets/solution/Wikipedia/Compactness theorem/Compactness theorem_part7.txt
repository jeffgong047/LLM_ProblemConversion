Proofs: One can prove the compactness theorem using Gödel's completeness theorem, which establishes that a set of sentences is satisfiable if and only if no contradiction can be proven from it. Since proofs are always finite and therefore involve only finitely many of the given sentences, the compactness theorem follows. In fact, the compactness theorem is equivalent to Gödel's completeness theorem, and both are equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice.[10] Gödel originally proved the compactness theorem in just this way, but later some "purely semantic" proofs of the compactness theorem were found; that is, proofs that refer to truth but not to provability. One of those proofs relies on ultraproducts hinging on the axiom of choice as follows: Proof: Fix a first-order language L,, and let ΣΣ be a collection of L-sentences such that every finite subcollection of L-sentences, i⊆Σ⊆Σ of it has a model Mi.ℳ_i. Also let ∏i⊆ΣMi∏_i⊆Σℳ_i be the direct product of the structures and I be the collection of finite subsets of Σ.Σ. For each i∈I,, let Ai=j∈I:j⊇i._i={j:j}. The family of all of these sets Ai_i generates a proper filter, so there is an ultrafilter U containing all sets of the form Ai._i. Now for any formula φφ in Σ:Σ: the set Aφ_{φ} is in U whenever j∈Aφ,_{φ}, then φ∈j,φ, hence φφ holds in Mjℳ_j the set of all j with the property that φφ holds in Mjℳ_j is a superset of Aφ,_{φ}, hence also in U Łoś's theorem now implies that φφ holds in the ultraproduct ∏i⊆ΣMi/U.∏_i⊆Σℳ_i/U. So this ultraproduct satisfies all formulas in Σ.Σ. See
