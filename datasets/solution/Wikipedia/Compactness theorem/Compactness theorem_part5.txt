theorem: A second application of the compactness theorem shows that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models, or a single infinite model, has models of arbitrary large cardinality (this is the Upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem). So for instance, there are nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic with uncountably many 'natural numbers'. To achieve this, let T be the initial theory and let κκ be any cardinal number. Add to the language of T one constant symbol for every element of κ.κ. Then add to T a collection of sentences that say that the objects denoted by any two distinct constant symbols from the new collection are distinct (this is a collection of κ2κ^2 sentences). Since every finite subset of this new theory is satisfiable by a sufficiently large finite model of T,, or by any infinite model, the entire extended theory is satisfiable. But any model of the extended theory has cardinality at least κκ. Non-standard
