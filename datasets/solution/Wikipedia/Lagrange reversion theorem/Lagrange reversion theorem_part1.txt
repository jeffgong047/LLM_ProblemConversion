For reversion of series, see Lagrange inversion theorem. In mathematics, the Lagrange reversion theorem gives series or formal power series expansions of certain implicitly defined functions; indeed, of compositions with such functions. Let v be a function of x and y in terms of another function f such that v=x+yf(v)=x+yf(v) Then for any function g, for small enough y: g(v)=g(x)+∑k=1∞ykk!(∂∂x)k−1(f(x)kg′(x)).(v)=g(x)+∑_k=1^∞y^k/k!(∂/)^k-1(f(x)^kg'(x)). If g is the identity, this becomes v=x+∑k=1∞ykk!(∂∂x)k−1(f(x)k)=x+∑_k=1^∞y^k/k!(∂/)^k-1(f(x)^k) In which case the equation can be derived using perturbation theory. In 1770, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) published his power series solution of the implicit equation for v mentioned above. However, his solution used cumbersome series expansions of logarithms.[1][2] In 1780, Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) published a simpler proof of the theorem, which was based on relations between partial derivatives with respect to the variable x and the parameter y.[3][4][5] Charles Hermite (1822–1901) presented the most straightforward proof of the theorem by using contour integration.[6][7][8] Lagrange's reversion theorem is used to obtain numerical solutions to Kepler's equation.
