proof: Many texts prove the theorem with the use of strong induction and the class equation, though considerably less machinery is required to prove the theorem in the abelian case. One can also invoke group actions for the proof.[3] Cauchy's theorem â€” Let G be a finite group and p be a prime. If p divides the order of G, then G has an element of order p. Proof
