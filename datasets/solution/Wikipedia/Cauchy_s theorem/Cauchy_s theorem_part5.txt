Uses: A practically immediate consequence of Cauchy's theorem is a useful characterization of finite p-groups, where p is a prime. In particular, a finite group G is a p-group (i.e. all of its elements have order pk for some natural number k) if and only if G has order pn for some natural number n. One may use the abelian case of Cauchy's Theorem in an inductive proof[4] of the first of Sylow's theorems, similar to the first proof above, although there are also proofs that avoid doing this special case separately.
