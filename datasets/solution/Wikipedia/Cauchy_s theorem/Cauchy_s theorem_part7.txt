(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abelian simple group is either {e} or cyclic group Cp whose order is a prime number p. Let G be an abelian group, then all subgroups of G are normal subgroups. So, if G is a simple group, G has only normal subgroup that is either {e} or G. If |G| = 1, then G is {e}. It is suitable. If |G| ≥ 2, let a ∈ G is not e, the cyclic group ⟨a⟩⟩ is subgroup of G and ⟨a⟩⟩ is not {e}, then G=⟨a⟩.=⟩. Let n is the order of ⟨a⟩⟩. If n is infinite, then G=⟨a⟩⫌⟨a2⟩⫌e.=⟩⫌^2⟩⫌{e}. So in this case, it is not suitable. Then n is finite. If n is composite, n is divisible by prime q which is less than n. From Cauchy's theorem, the subgroup H will be exist whose order is q, it is not suitable. Therefore, n must be a prime number.
