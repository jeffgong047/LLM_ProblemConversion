2: This proof uses the fact that for any action of a (cyclic) group of prime order p, the only possible orbit sizes are 1 and p, which is immediate from the orbit stabilizer theorem. The set that our cyclic group shall act on is the set X=(x1,…,xp)∈Gp:x1x2⋯xp=e={ (x_1,…,x_p)^p:x_1x_2_p=e } of p-tuples of elements of G whose product (in order) gives the identity. Such a p-tuple is uniquely determined by all its components except the last one, as the last element must be the inverse of the product of those preceding elements. One also sees that those p − 1 elements can be chosen freely, so X has |G|p−1 elements, which is divisible by p. Now from the fact that in a group if ab = e then also ba = e, it follows that any cyclic permutation of the components of an element of X again gives an element of X. Therefore one can define an action of the cyclic group Cp of order p on X by cyclic permutations of components, in other words in which a chosen generator of Cp sends (x1,x2,…,xp)↦(x2,…,xp,x1)(x_1,x_2,…,x_p)↦(x_2,…,x_p,x_1). As remarked, orbits in X under this action either have size 1 or size p. The former happens precisely for those tuples (x,x,…,x)(x,x,…,x) for which xp=e^p=e. Counting the elements of X by orbits, and reducing modulo p, one sees that the number of elements satisfying xp=e^p=e is divisible by p. But x = e is one such element, so there must be at least p − 1 other solutions for x, and these solutions are elements of order p. This completes the proof.
