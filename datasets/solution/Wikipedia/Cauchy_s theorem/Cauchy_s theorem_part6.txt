(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Let G be a finite group where x2 = e for all elements x of G. Then G has the order 2n for some non negative integer n. Let |G| equal m. In the case of m is 1, then G = {e}. In the case of m â‰¥ 2, if m has the odd prime factor p, G has the element x where xp = e from Cauchy's theorem. It conflicts with the assumption. Therefore m must be 2n.[5] G is an abelian group, and G is called an elementary abelian 2-group or Boolean group. The well-known example is Klein four-group. Example
