Applications: In the 2010s Sinkhorn's theorem came to be used to find solutions of entropy-regularised optimal transport problems.[7] This has been of interest in machine learning because such "Sinkhorn distances" can be used to evaluate the difference between data distributions and permutations.[8][9][10] This improves the training of machine learning algorithms, in situations where maximum likelihood training may not be the best method.
