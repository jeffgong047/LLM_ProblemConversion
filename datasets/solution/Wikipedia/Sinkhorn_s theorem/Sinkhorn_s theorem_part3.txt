algorithm: A simple iterative method to approach the double stochastic matrix is to alternately rescale all rows and all columns of A to sum to 1. Sinkhorn and Knopp presented this algorithm and analyzed its convergence.[3] This is essentially the same as the Iterative proportional fitting algorithm, well known in survey statistics.
