extensions: The following analogue for unitary matrices is also true: for every unitary matrix U there exist two diagonal unitary matrices L and R such that LUR has each of its columns and rows summing to 1.[4] The following extension to maps between matrices is also true (see Theorem 5[5] and also Theorem 4.7[6]): given a Kraus operator that represents the quantum operation Φ mapping a density matrix into another, S↦Φ(S)=∑iBiSBi∗,↦Φ(S)=∑_iB_iSB_i^*, that is trace preserving, ∑iBi∗Bi=I,∑_iB_i^*B_i=I, and, in addition, whose range is in the interior of the positive definite cone (strict positivity), there exist scalings xj, for j in {0,1}, that are positive definite so that the rescaled Kraus operator S↦x1Φ(x0−1Sx0−1)x1=∑i(x1Bix0−1)S(x1Bix0−1)∗_1Φ(x_0^-1Sx_0^-1)x_1=∑_i(x_1B_ix_0^-1)S(x_1B_ix_0^-1)^* is doubly stochastic. In other words, it is such that both, x1Φ(x0−1Ix0−1)x1=I,_1Φ(x_0^-1Ix_0^-1)x_1=I, as well as for the adjoint, x0−1Φ∗(x1Ix1)x0−1=I,_0^-1Φ^*(x_1Ix_1)x_0^-1=I, where I denotes the identity operator.
