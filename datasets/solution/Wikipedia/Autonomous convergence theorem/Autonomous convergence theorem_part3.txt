theorem: A comparatively simple autonomous convergence theorem is as follows: Let x be a vector in some space X⊆Rn⊆ℝ^n, evolving according to an autonomous differential equation x˙=f(x)ẋ=f(x). Suppose that X is convex and forward invariant under f, and that there exists a fixed point x^∈Xx̂ such that f(x^)=0(x̂)=0. If there exists a logarithmic norm μμ such that the Jacobian J(x)=Dxf(x)=D_xf satisfies μ(J(x))<0μ(J(x))<0 for all values of x, then x^x̂ is the only fixed point, and it is globally asymptotically stable.[3][4] This autonomous convergence theorem is very closely related to the Banach fixed-point theorem.
