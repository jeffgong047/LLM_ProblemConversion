angles: For an alternate use see Corresponding angles (congruence and similarity) One pair of corresponding angles. With parallel lines, they are congruent. Corresponding angles are the four pairs of angles that: have distinct vertex points, lie on the same side of the transversal and one angle is interior and the other is exterior. Two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of corresponding angles of any transversal are congruent (equal in measure). Proposition 1.28 of Euclid's Elements, a theorem of absolute geometry (hence valid in both hyperbolic and Euclidean Geometry), proves that if the angles of a pair of corresponding angles of a transversal are congruent then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting). It follows from Euclid's parallel postulate that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of corresponding angles of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's Elements). If the angles of one pair of corresponding angles are congruent, then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent. In the various images with parallel lines on this page, corresponding angle pairs are: α=α1, β=β1, γ=γ1 and δ=δ1. Consecutive interior
