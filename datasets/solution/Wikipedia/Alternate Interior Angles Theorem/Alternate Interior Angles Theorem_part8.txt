dimensions: In higher dimensional spaces, a line that intersects each of a set of lines in distinct points is a transversal of that set of lines. Unlike the two-dimensional (plane) case, transversals are not guaranteed to exist for sets of more than two lines. In Euclidean 3-space, a regulus is a set of skew lines, R, such that through each point on each line of R, there passes a transversal of R and through each point of a transversal of R there passes a line of R. The set of transversals of a regulus R is also a regulus, called the opposite regulus, Ro. In this space, three mutually skew lines can always be extended to a regulus.
