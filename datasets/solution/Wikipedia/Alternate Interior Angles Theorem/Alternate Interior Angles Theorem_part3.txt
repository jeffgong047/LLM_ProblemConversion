angles: One pair of alternate angles. With parallel lines, they are congruent. Alternate angles are the four pairs of angles that: have distinct vertex points, lie on opposite sides of the transversal and both angles are interior or both angles are exterior. If the two angles of one pair are congruent (equal in measure), then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent. Proposition 1.27 of Euclid's Elements, a theorem of absolute geometry (hence valid in both hyperbolic and Euclidean Geometry), proves that if the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting). It follows from Euclid's parallel postulate that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's Elements).
