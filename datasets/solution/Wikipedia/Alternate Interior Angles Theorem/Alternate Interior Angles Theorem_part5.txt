angles: One pair of consecutive angles. With parallel lines, they add up to two right angles Consecutive interior angles are the two pairs of angles that:[4][2] have distinct vertex points, lie on the same side of the transversal and are both interior. Two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of consecutive interior angles of any transversal are supplementary (sum to 180Â°). Proposition 1.28 of Euclid's Elements, a theorem of absolute geometry (hence valid in both hyperbolic and Euclidean Geometry), proves that if the angles of a pair of consecutive interior angles are supplementary then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting). It follows from Euclid's parallel postulate that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of consecutive interior angles of a transversal are supplementary (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's Elements). If one pair of consecutive interior angles is supplementary, the other pair is also supplementary. Other characteristics of
