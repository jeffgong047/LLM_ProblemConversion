transversal: A transversal produces 8 angles, as shown in the graph at the above left: 4 with each of the two lines, namely α, β, γ and δ and then α1, β1, γ1 and δ1; and 4 of which are interior (between the two lines), namely α, β, γ1 and δ1 and 4 of which are exterior, namely α1, β1, γ and δ. A transversal that cuts two parallel lines at right angles is called a perpendicular transversal. In this case, all 8 angles are right angles [1] When the lines are parallel, a case that is often considered, a transversal produces several congruent supplementary angles. Some of these angle pairs have specific names and are discussed below: corresponding angles, alternate angles, and consecutive angles.[2][3]: Art. 87 Alternate
