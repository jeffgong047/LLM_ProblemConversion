cases: It is easy to see that if P(x)=ax2+bx+c(x)=ax^2+bx+c is a second degree polynomial, the zero of P′(x)=2ax+b'(x)=2ax+b is the average of the roots of P. In that case, the convex hull is the line segment with the two roots as endpoints and it is clear that the average of the roots is the middle point of the segment. For a third degree complex polynomial P (cubic function) with three distinct zeros, Marden's theorem states that the zeros of P' are the foci of the Steiner inellipse which is the unique ellipse tangent to the midpoints of the triangle formed by the zeros of P. For a fourth degree complex polynomial P (quartic function) with four distinct zeros forming a concave quadrilateral, one of the zeros of P lies within the convex hull of the other three; all three zeros of P' lie in two of the three triangles formed by the interior zero of P and two others zeros of P.[2] In addition, if a polynomial of degree n of real coefficients has n distinct real zeros x1<x2<⋯<xn,_1<x_2<⋯<x_n, we see, using Rolle's theorem, that the zeros of the derivative polynomial are in the interval [x1,xn][x_1,x_n] which is the convex hull of the set of roots. The convex hull of the roots of the polynomial pnxn+pn−1xn−1+⋯+p0_nx^n+p_n-1x^n-1+⋯+p_0 particularly includes the point −pn−1n⋅pn.-p_n-1/n_n.
