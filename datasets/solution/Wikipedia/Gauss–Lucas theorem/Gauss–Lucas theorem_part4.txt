Proof: Proof By the fundamental theorem of algebra, P is a product of linear factors as P(z)=α∏i=1n(z−ai)(z)=α∏_i=1^n(z-a_i) where the complex numbers a1,a2,…,an_1,a_2,…,a_n are the – not necessarily distinct – zeros of the polynomial P, the complex number α is the leading coefficient of P and n is the degree of P. For any root z of P′', if it is also a root of P, then the theorem is trivially true. Otherwise, we have for the logarithmic derivative 0=P′(z)P(z)=∑i=1n1z−ai=∑i=1nz¯−ai¯|z−ai|2.0=P^'(z)/P(z)=∑_i=1^n1/z-a_i=∑_i=1^nz-a_i/|z-a_i|^2. Hence ∑i=1nz¯|z−ai|2=∑i=1nai¯|z−ai|2∑_i=1^nz/|z-a_i|^2=∑_i=1^na_i/|z-a_i|^2. Taking their conjugates, and dividing, we obtain z as a convex sum of the roots of P: z=∑i=1n|z−ai|−2∑j=1n|z−aj|−2ai=∑_i=1^n|z-a_i|^-2/∑_j=1^n|z-a_j|^-2a_i See
