theorem: Suppose the definition of the Goodstein sequence is changed so that instead of replacing each occurrence of the base b with b + 1 it replaces it with b + 2. Would the sequence still terminate? More generally, let b1, b2, b3, … be any sequences of integers. Then let the (n + 1)-st term G(m)(n + 1) of the extended Goodstein sequence of m be as follows: take the hereditary base bn representation of G(m)(n) and replace each occurrence of the base bn with bn+1 and then subtract one. The claim is that this sequence still terminates. The extended proof defines P(m)(n) = f(G(m)(n), n) as follows: take the hereditary base bn representation of G(m)(n), and replace each occurrence of the base bn with the first infinite ordinal number ω. The base-changing operation of the Goodstein sequence when going from G(m)(n) to G(m)(n + 1) still does not change the value of f. For example, if bn = 4 and if bn+1 = 9, then f(3⋅444+4,4)=3ωωω+ω=f(3⋅999+9,9)(3·4^4^4+4,4)=3ω^ω^ω+ω=f(3·9^9^9+9,9), hence the ordinal f(3⋅444+4,4)(3·4^4^4+4,4) is strictly greater than the ordinal f((3⋅999+9)−1,9).((3·9^9^9+9)-1,9).
