statement: The theorem states that: The wave function of a system of identical integer-spin particles has the same value when the positions of any two particles are swapped. Particles with wave functions symmetric under exchange are called bosons. The wave function of a system of identical half-integer–spin particles changes sign when two particles are swapped. Particles with wave functions antisymmetric under exchange are called fermions. In other words, the spin–statistics theorem states that integer-spin particles are bosons, while half-integer–spin particles are fermions. General
