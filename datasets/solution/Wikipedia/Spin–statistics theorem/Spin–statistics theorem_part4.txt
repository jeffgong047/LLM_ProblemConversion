symmetry: Bosons are particles whose wavefunction is symmetric under such an exchange or permutation, so if we swap the particles, the wavefunction does not change. Fermions are particles whose wavefunction is antisymmetric, so under such a swap the wavefunction gets a minus sign, meaning that the amplitude for two identical fermions to occupy the same state must be zero. This is the Pauli exclusion principle: two identical fermions cannot occupy the same state. This rule does not hold for bosons. In quantum field theory, a state or a wavefunction is described by field operators operating on some basic state called the vacuum. In order for the operators to project out the symmetric or antisymmetric component of the creating wavefunction, they must have the appropriate commutation law. The operator ∬ψ(x,y)ϕ(x)ϕ(y)dxdy∬ψ(x,y)ϕ(x)ϕ(y) dx dy (with ϕϕ an operator and ψ(x,y)ψ(x,y) a numerical function with complex values) creates a two-particle state with wavefunction ψ(x,y)ψ(x,y), and depending on the commutation properties of the fields, either only the antisymmetric parts or the symmetric parts matter. Let us assume that x≠y and the two operators take place at the same time; more generally, they may have spacelike separation, as is explained hereafter. If the fields commute, meaning that the following holds: ϕ(x)ϕ(y)=ϕ(y)ϕ(x),ϕ(x)ϕ(y)=ϕ(y)ϕ(x), then only the symmetric part of ψψ contributes, so that ψ(x,y)=ψ(y,x)ψ(x,y)=ψ(y,x), and the field will create bosonic particles. On the other hand, if the fields anti-commute, meaning that ϕϕ has the property that ϕ(x)ϕ(y)=−ϕ(y)ϕ(x),ϕ(x)ϕ(y)=-ϕ(y)ϕ(x), then only the antisymmetric part of ψψ contributes, so that ψ(x,y)=−ψ(y,x)ψ(x,y)=-ψ(y,x), and the particles will be fermionic. Naively, neither has anything to do with the spin, which determines the rotation properties of the particles, not the exchange properties. Spin–statistics
