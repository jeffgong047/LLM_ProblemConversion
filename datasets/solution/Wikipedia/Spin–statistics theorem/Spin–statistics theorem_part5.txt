relation: The spinâ€“statistics relation was first formulated in 1939 by Markus Fierz[3] and was rederived in a more systematic way by Wolfgang Pauli.[4] Fierz and Pauli argued their result by enumerating all free field theories subject to the requirement that there be quadratic forms for locally commuting[clarification needed] observables including a positive-definite energy density. A more conceptual argument was provided by Julian Schwinger in 1950. Richard Feynman gave a demonstration by demanding unitarity for scattering as an external potential is varied,[5] which when translated to field language is a condition on the quadratic operator that couples to the potential.[6] Theorem
