fields: In quantum field theory, ghost fields are fields that have negative kinetic energy and are used to cancel out unphysical degrees of freedom in the theory. They are called ghost fields because they do not correspond to any physical particles. Ghost fields are used in the quantization of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics and electroweak theory. Ghost fields do not obey the spinâ€“statistics relation.
