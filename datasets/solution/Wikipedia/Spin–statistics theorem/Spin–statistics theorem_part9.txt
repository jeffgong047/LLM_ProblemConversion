fails: To prove the spin–statistics theorem, it is necessary to use relativity, as is obvious from the consistency of the nonrelativistic spinless fermion, and the nonrelativistic spinning bosons. There are claims in the literature of proofs of the spin–statistics theorem that do not require relativity,[7][8] but they are not proofs of a theorem, as the counterexamples show, rather they are arguments for why spin–statistics is "natural", while wrong-statistics[clarification needed] is "unnatural". In relativity, the connection is required. In relativity, there are no local fields that are pure creation operators or annihilation operators. Every local field both creates particles and annihilates the corresponding antiparticle. This means that in relativity, the product of the free real spin-0 field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value, because in addition to creating particles which are not annihilated and annihilating particles which are not subsequently created, it also includes a part that creates and annihilates "virtual" particles whose existence enters into interaction calculations – but never as scattering matrix indices or asymptotic states. G(x)=⟨0|ϕ(−x)ϕ(x)|0⟩.(x)=⟨0|ϕ(-x)ϕ(x)|0⟩. And now the heuristic argument can be used to see that G(x)(x) is equal to G(−x)(-x), which tells us that the fields cannot be anti-commuting.
