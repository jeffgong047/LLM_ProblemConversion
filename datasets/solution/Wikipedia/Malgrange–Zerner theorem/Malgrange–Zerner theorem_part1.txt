Theorem about holomorphic functions of several complex variables In mathematics, Malgrange–Zerner theorem (named for Bernard Malgrange and Martin Zerner) shows that a function on Rnℝ^n allowing holomorphic extension in each variable separately can be extended, under certain conditions, to a function holomorphic in all variables jointly. This theorem can be seen as a generalization of Bochner's tube theorem to functions defined on tube-like domains whose base is not an open set. Theorem[1][2] Let X=⋃k=1nRk−1×P×Rn−k,whereP=R+i[0,1),=⋃_k=1^nℝ^k-1×ℝ^n-k,whereP=ℝ+i[0,1), and let W== convex hull of X. Let f:X→C:X→ℂ be a locally bounded function such that f∈C∞(X)^∞(X) and that for any fixed point (x1,…,xk−1,xk+1,…,xn)∈Rn−1(x_1,…,x_k-1,x_k+1,…,x_n)∈ℝ^n-1 the function f(x1,…,xk−1,z,xk+1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_k-1,z,x_k+1,…,x_n) is holomorphic in z in the interior of P for each k=1,…,n=1,…,n. Then the function f can be uniquely extended to a function holomorphic in the interior of W.
