History: According to Henry Epstein,[1][3] this theorem was proved first by Malgrange in 1961 (unpublished), then by Zerner [4] (as cited in [1]), and commmunicated to him privately. Epstein's lectures [1] contain the first published proof (attributed there to Broz, Epstein and Glaser). The assumption f∈C∞(X)^∞(X) was later relaxed to f|Rn∈C3|_ℝ^n^3 (see Ref.[1] in [2]) and finally to f|Rn∈C|_ℝ^n.[2]
