Concerns 3 circles through triples of points on the vertices and sides of a triangle A diagram showing circles passing through the vertices of a triangle ABC and points A´, B´ and C´ on the adjacent sides of the triangle intersecting at a common point, M. The Pivot Theorem for various triangles Miquel's theorem is a result in geometry, named after Auguste Miquel,[1] concerning the intersection of three circles, each drawn through one vertex of a triangle and two points on its adjacent sides. It is one of several results concerning circles in Euclidean geometry due to Miquel, whose work was published in Liouville's newly founded journal Journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées. Formally, let ABC be a triangle, with arbitrary points A´, B´ and C´ on sides BC, AC, and AB respectively (or their extensions). Draw three circumcircles (Miquel's circles) to triangles AB´C´, A´BC´, and A´B´C. Miquel's theorem states that these circles intersect in a single point M, called the Miquel point. In addition, the three angles MA´B, MB´C and MC´A (green in the diagram) are all equal, as are the three supplementary angles MA´C, MB´A and MC´B.[2][3] The theorem (and its corollary) follow from the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Let the circumcircles of A'B'C and AB'C' meet at M≠B′.'. Then ∠A′MC′=2π−∠B′MA′−∠C′MB′=2π−(π−C)−(π−A)=A+C=π−B,'MC'=2π-'MA'-'MB'=2π-(π-C)-(π-A)=A+C=π-B, hence BA'MC' is cyclic as desired. Pivot
