theorem: Given points, A, B, C, and D on a circle, and circles passing through each adjacent pair of points, the alternate intersections of these four circles at W, X, Y and Z then lie on a common circle. This is known as the six circles theorem.[10] It is also known as the four circles theorem and while generally attributed to Jakob Steiner the only known published proof was given by Miquel.[11] David G. Wells refers to this as Miquel's theorem.[12] Three-dimensional version of Miquel's
