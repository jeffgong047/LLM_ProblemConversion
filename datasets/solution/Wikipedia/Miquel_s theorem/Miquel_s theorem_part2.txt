theorem: If in the statement of Miquel's theorem the points A´, B´ and C´ form a triangle (that is, are not collinear) then the theorem was named the Pivot theorem in Forder (1960, p. 17).[4] (In the diagram these points are labeled P, Q and R.) If A´, B´ and C´ are collinear then the Miquel point is on the circumcircle of ∆ABC and conversely, if the Miquel point is on this circumcircle, then A´, B´ and C´ are on a line.[5] Trilinear coordinates of the Miquel
