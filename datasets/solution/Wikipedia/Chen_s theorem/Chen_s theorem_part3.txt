Variations: Chen's 1973 paper stated two results with nearly identical proofs.[2]: 158 His Theorem I, on the Goldbach conjecture, was stated above. His Theorem II is a result on the twin prime conjecture. It states that if h is a positive even integer, there are infinitely many primes p such that p + h is either prime or the product of two primes. Ying Chun Cai proved the following in 2002:[6] There exists a natural number N such that every even integer n larger than N is a sum of a prime less than or equal to n0.95 and a number with at most two prime factors. Tomohiro Yamada claimed a proof of the following explicit version of Chen's theorem in 2015:[7] Every even number greater than ee36≈1.7⋅101872344071119343^e^36≈1.7·10^1872344071119343 is the sum of a prime and a product of at most two primes. In 2022, Matteo Bordignon implies there are gaps in Yamada's proof, which Bordignon overcomes in his PhD. thesis.[8]
