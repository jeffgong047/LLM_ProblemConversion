The statue of Chen Jingrun at Xiamen University. In number theory, Chen's theorem states that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). It is a weakened form of Goldbach's conjecture, which states that every even number is the sum of two primes.
