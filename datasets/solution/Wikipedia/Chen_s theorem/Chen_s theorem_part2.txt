History: The theorem was first stated by Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun in 1966,[1] with further details of the proof in 1973.[2] His original proof was much simplified by P. M. Ross in 1975.[3] Chen's theorem is a giant step towards the Goldbach's conjecture, and a remarkable result of the sieve methods. Chen's theorem represents the strengthening of a previous result due to Alfréd Rényi, who in 1947 had shown there exists a finite K such that any even number can be written as the sum of a prime number and the product of at most K primes.[4][5]
