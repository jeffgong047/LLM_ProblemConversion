Probability Theory "Poisson theorem" redirects here. For the "Poisson's theorem" in Hamiltonian mechanics, see Poisson bracket § Constants of motion. In probability theory, the law of rare events or Poisson limit theorem states that the Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, under certain conditions.[1] The theorem was named after Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840). A generalization of this theorem is Le Cam's theorem. For broader coverage of this topic, see Poisson distribution § Law of rare events.
