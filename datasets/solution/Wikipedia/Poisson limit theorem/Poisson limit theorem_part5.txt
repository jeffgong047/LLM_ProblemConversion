functions: It is also possible to demonstrate the theorem through the use of ordinary generating functions of the binomial distribution: Gbin(x;p,N)≡∑k=0N[(Nk)pk(1−p)N−k]xk=[1+(x−1)p]N_bin(x;p,N)≡∑_k=0^N[Nkp^k(1-p)^N-k]x^k=[1+(x-1)p]^N by virtue of the binomial theorem. Taking the limit N→∞→∞ while keeping the product pN≡λ≡λ constant, it can be seen: limN→∞Gbin(x;p,N)=limN→∞[1+λ(x−1)N]N=eλ(x−1)=∑k=0∞[e−λλkk!]xklim_N→∞G_bin(x;p,N)=lim_N→∞[1+λ(x-1)/N]^N=e^λ(x-1)=∑_k=0^∞[e^-λλ^k/k!]x^k which is the OGF for the Poisson distribution. (The second equality holds due to the definition of the exponential function.) See
