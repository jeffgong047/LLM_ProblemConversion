markets: When stock price returns follow a single Brownian motion, there is a unique risk neutral measure. When the stock price process is assumed to follow a more general sigma-martingale or semimartingale, then the concept of arbitrage is too narrow, and a stronger concept such as no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) must be used to describe these opportunities in an infinite dimensional setting.[2] In continuous time, a version of the fundamental theorems of asset pricing read:[3] Let S=(St)t≥0=(S_t)_t≥0 be a d-dimensional semimartingale market (a collection of stocks), B the risk-free bond and (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,P) the underlying probability space. Firthermore, we call a measure Q an equivalent local martingale measure if Q≈P and if the processes (StiBt)t(S_t^i/B_t)_t are local martingales under the measure Q. The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: Assume S is locally bounded. Then the market S satisfies NFLVR if and only if there exists an equivalent local martingale measure. The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: Assume that there exists an equivalent local martingale measure Q. Then S is a complete market if and only if Q is the unique local martingale measure. See
