markets: In a discrete (i.e. finite state) market, the following hold:[1] The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: A discrete market on a discrete probability space (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,P) is arbitrage-free if, and only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure that is equivalent to the original probability measure, P. The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks S and a risk-free bond B is complete if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to P and has numeraire B.
