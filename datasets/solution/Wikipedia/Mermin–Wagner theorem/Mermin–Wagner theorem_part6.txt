History: Already in 1930, Felix Bloch has argued by diagonalizing the Slater determinant for fermions, that magnetism in 2D should not exist.[3] Some easy arguments, which are summarized below, were given by Rudolf Peierls based on entropic and energetic considerations.[4] Also Lev Landau did some work about symmetry breaking in two dimensions.[5] Energetic
