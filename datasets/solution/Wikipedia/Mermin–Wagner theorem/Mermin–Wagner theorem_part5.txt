Generalizations: Much stronger results than absence of magnetization can actually be proved, and the setting can be substantially more general. In particular[citation needed]: The Hamiltonian can be invariant under the action of an arbitrary compact, connected Lie group G. Long-range interactions can be allowed (provided that they decay fast enough; necessary and sufficient conditions are known). In this general setting, Mermin–Wagner theorem admits the following strong form (stated here in an informal way): All (infinite-volume) Gibbs states associated to this Hamiltonian are invariant under the action of G. When the assumption that the Lie group be compact is dropped, a similar result holds, but with the conclusion that infinite-volume Gibbs states do not exist. Finally, there are other important applications of these ideas and methods, most notably to the proof that there cannot be non-translation invariant Gibbs states in 2-dimensional systems. A typical such example would be the absence of crystalline states in a system of hard disks (with possibly additional attractive interactions). It has been proved however that interactions of hard-core type can lead in general to violations of Mermin–Wagner theorem.
