model: We will present an intuitive way[1] to understand the mechanism that prevents symmetry breaking in low dimensions, through an application to the Heisenberg model, that is a system of n-component spins Si of unit length |Si| = 1, located at the sites of a d-dimensional square lattice, with nearest neighbour coupling J. Its Hamiltonian is H=−J∑⟨i,j⟩Si⋅Sj.=-J∑_⟨i,j⟩𝐒_i·𝐒_j. The name of this model comes from its rotational symmetry. Consider the low temperature behavior of this system and assume that there exists a spontaneously broken symmetry, that is a phase where all spins point in the same direction, e.g. along the x-axis. Then the O(n) rotational symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken, or rather reduced to the O(n − 1) symmetry under rotations around this direction. We can parametrize the field in terms of independent fluctuations σα around this direction as follows: S=x^(1−∑ασα2,σα),α=1,⋯,n−1.𝐒=x̂(√(1-∑_ασ_α^2),{σ_α}), α=1,⋯,n-1. with |σα| ≪ 1, and Taylor expand the resulting Hamiltonian. We have Si⋅Sj=(1−∑ασiα2)(1−∑ασjα2)+∑ασiασjα=1−12∑α(σiα2+σjα2)+∑ασiασjα+O(σ4)=1−12∑α(σiα−σjα)2+…𝐒_i·𝐒_j =√((1-∑_ασ_iα^2)(1-∑_ασ_jα^2))+∑_ασ_iασ_jα =1-12∑_α(σ_iα^2+σ_jα^2)+∑_ασ_iασ_jα+𝒪(σ^4) =1-12∑_α(σ_iα-σ_jα)^2+… whence H=H0+12J∑⟨i,j⟩∑α(σiα−σjα)2+⋯=H_0+12J∑_,j⟩∑_α(σ_iα-σ_jα)^2+⋯ Ignoring the irrelevant constant term H0 = −JNd and passing to the continuum limit, given that we are interested in the low temperature phase where long-wavelength fluctuations dominate, we get H=12J∫ddx∑α(∇σα)2+….=12J∫d^dx∑_α(∇σ_α)^2+…. The field fluctuations σα are called spin waves and can be recognized as Goldstone bosons. Indeed, they are n-1 in number and they have zero mass since there is no mass term in the Hamiltonian. To find if this hypothetical phase really exists we have to check if our assumption is self-consistent, that is if the expectation value of the magnetization, calculated in this framework, is finite as assumed. To this end we need to calculate the first order correction to the magnetization due to the fluctuations. This is the procedure followed in the derivation of the well-known Ginzburg criterion. The model is Gaussian to first order and so the momentum space correlation function is proportional to k−2. Thus the real space two-point correlation function for each of these modes is ⟨σα(r)σα(0)⟩=1βJ∫1addk(2π)deik⋅rk2⟨σ_α(r)σ_α(0)⟩=1/∫^1/ad^dk/(2π)^de^i𝐤·𝐫/k^2 where a is the lattice spacing. The average magnetization is ⟨S1⟩=1−12∑α⟨σα2⟩+…_1⟩=1-12∑_α⟨σ_α^2⟩+… and the first order correction can now easily be calculated: ∑α⟨σα2(0)⟩=(n−1)1βJ∫1addk(2π)d1k2.∑_α⟨σ_α^2(0)⟩=(n-1)1/∫^1/ad^dk/(2π)^d1/k^2. The integral above is proportional to ∫1akd−3dk∫^1/ak^d-3dk and so it is finite for d > 2, but appears to be divergent for d ≤ 2 (logarithmically for d = 2). This divergence signifies that fluctuations σα are large so that the expansion in the parameter |σα| ≪ 1 performed above is not self-consistent. One can naturally expect then that beyond that approximation, the average magnetization is zero. We thus conclude that for d ≤ 2 our assumption that there exists a phase of spontaneous magnetization is incorrect for all T > 0, because the fluctuations are strong enough to destroy the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is a general result: Mermin–Wagner–Hohenberg Theorem. There is no phase with spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry for T > 0, in d ≤ 2 dimensions for an infinite system. The result can also be extended to other geometries, such as Heisenberg films with an arbitrary number of layers, as well as to other lattice systems (Hubbard model, s-f model).[2]
