argument: There is only one way between neighbouring particles in one dimension, two ways in two dimensions and six different ways in three dimensions. An entropic argument against perfect long range order in crystals with D<3<3 is as follows (see figure): consider a chain of atoms/particles with an average particle distance of ⟨a⟩⟩. Thermal fluctuations between particle 00 and particle 11 will lead to fluctuations of the average particle distance of the order of ξ0,1ξ_0,1, thus the distance is given by a=⟨a⟩±ξ0,1=⟩±ξ_0,1. The fluctuations between particle −1-1 and 00 will be of the same size: |ξ−1,0|=|ξ0,1||ξ_-1,0|=|ξ_0,1|. We assume that the thermal fluctuations are statistically independent (which is evident if we consider only nearest neighbour interaction) and the fluctuations between −1-1 and particle +1+1 (with double the distance) has to be summed statistically independent (or incoherent): ξ−1,1=2⋅ξ0,1ξ_-1,1=√(2)·ξ_0,1. For particles N-times the average distance, the fluctuations will increase with the square root ξ0,N=N⋅ξ0,1ξ_0,N=√(N)·ξ_0,1 if neighbouring fluctuations are summed independently. Although the average distance ⟨a⟩⟩ is well defined, the deviations from a perfect periodic chain increase with the square root of the system size. In three dimensions, one has to walk along three linearly independent directions to cover the whole space; in a cubic crystal, this is effectively along the space diagonal, to get from particle 00 to particle 33. As one can easily see in the figure, there are six different possibilities to do this. This implies, that the fluctuations on the six different pathways cannot be statistically independent, since they pass the same particles at position 00 and 33. Now, the fluctuations of the six different ways have to be summed in a coherent way and will be of the order of ξξ – independent of the size of the cube. The fluctuations stay finite and lattice sites are well defined. For the case of two dimensions, Herbert Wagner and David Mermin have proved rigorously, that fluctuations distances increase logarithmically with systems size ξ∝ln(L)ξ(L). This is frequently called the logarithmic divergence of displacements. Crystals in
