Introduction: Consider the free scalar field φ of mass m in two Euclidean dimensions. Its propagator is: G(x)=⟨φ(x)φ(0)⟩=∫d2k(2π)2eik⋅xk2+m2.(x)=⟨φ(x)φ(0)⟩=∫d^2k/(2π)^2e^ik/k^2+m^2. For small m, G is a solution to Laplace's equation with a point source: ∇2G=δ(x).∇^2G=δ(x). This is because the propagator is the reciprocal of ∇2 in k space. To use Gauss's law, define the electric field analog to be E = ∇G. The divergence of the electric field is zero. In two dimensions, using a large Gaussian ring: E=12πr.=12. So that the function G has a logarithmic divergence both at small and large r. G(r)=12πlog⁡(r)(r)=12πlog(r) The interpretation of the divergence is that the field fluctuations cannot stay centred around a mean. If you start at a point where the field has the value 1, the divergence tells you that as you travel far away, the field is arbitrarily far from the starting value. This makes a two dimensional massless scalar field slightly tricky to define mathematically. If you define the field by a Monte Carlo simulation, it doesn't stay put, it slides to infinitely large values with time. This happens in one dimension too, when the field is a one dimensional scalar field, a random walk in time. A random walk also moves arbitrarily far from its starting point, so that a one-dimensional or two-dimensional scalar does not have a well defined average value. If the field is an angle, θ, as it is in the Mexican hat model where the complex field A = Reiθ has an expectation value but is free to slide in the θ direction, the angle θ will be random at large distances. This is the Mermin–Wagner theorem: there is no spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in two dimensions. XY model
