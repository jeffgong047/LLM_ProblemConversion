Self-reducibility: To understand the Karp–Lipton proof in more detail, we consider the problem of testing whether a circuit c is a correct circuit for solving SAT instances of a given size, and show that this circuit testing problem belongs to Π1Π_1. That is, there exists a polynomial time computable predicate V such that c is a correct circuit if and only if, for all polynomially-bounded z, V(c,z) is true. The circuit c is a correct circuit for SAT if it satisfies two properties: For every pair (s,x) where s is an instance of SAT and x is a solution to the instance, c(s) must be true For every instance s of SAT for which c(s) is true, s must be solvable. The first of these two properties is already in the form of problems in class Π1Π_1. To verify the second property, we use the self-reducibility property of SAT. Self-reducibility describes the phenomenon that, if we can quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To find a solution to an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where si denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant i. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived. To use self-reducibility to check the second property of a correct circuit for SAT, we rewrite it as follows: For every instance s of SAT for which c(s) is true, the self-reduction procedure described above finds a valid solution to s. Thus, we can test in Π1Π_1 whether c is a valid circuit for solving SAT. see Random self-reducibility for more information Proof of Karp–Lipton
