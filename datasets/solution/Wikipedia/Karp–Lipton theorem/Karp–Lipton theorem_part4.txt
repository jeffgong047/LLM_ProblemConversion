theorem: The Karp–Lipton theorem can be restated as a result about Boolean formulas with polynomially-bounded quantifiers. Problems in Π2Π_2 are described by formulas of this type, with the syntax ϕ=∀x∃yψ(x,y)ϕ= ψ(x,y) where ψψ is a polynomial-time computable predicate. The Karp–Lipton theorem states that this type of formula can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent formula in which the quantifiers appear in the opposite order; such a formula belongs to Σ2Σ_2. Note that the subformula s(x)=∃yψ(x,y)(x)= ψ(x,y) is an instance of SAT. That is, if c is a valid circuit for SAT, then this subformula is equivalent to the unquantified formula c(s(x)). Therefore, the full formula for ϕϕ is equivalent (under the assumption that a valid circuit c exists) to the formula ∃c∀(x,z)V(c,z)∧c(s(x))∀(x,z) V(c,z)(s(x)) where V is the formula used to verify that c really is a valid circuit using self-reducibility, as described above. This equivalent formula has its quantifiers in the opposite order, as desired. Therefore, the Karp–Lipton assumption allows us to transpose the order of existential and universal quantifiers in formulas of this type, showing that Σ2=Π2.Σ_2=Π_2. Repeating the transposition allows formulas with deeper nesting to be simplified to a form in which they have a single existential quantifier followed by a single universal quantifier, showing that PH=Σ2.=Σ_2.
