SP2: Assume NP⊆P/poly𝖭𝖯⊆𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒. Therefore, there exists a family of circuits Cn_n that solves satisfiability on input of length n. Using self-reducibility, there exists a family of circuits Dn_n which outputs a satisfying assignment on true instances. Suppose L is a Π2Π_2 set L=z:∀x.∃y.ϕ(x,y,z)={z:..ϕ(x,y,z)} Since ∃y.ϕ(x,y,z).ϕ(x,y,z) can be considered an instance of SAT (by Cook-Levin theorem), there exists a circuit Dn_n, depending on n=|z|=|z|, such that the formula defining L is equivalent to ∀x.ϕ(x,Dn(x,z),z).ϕ(x,D_n(x,z),z) (1) Furthermore, the circuit can be guessed with existential quantification: ∃D.∀x.ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)..ϕ(x,D(x,z),z) (2) Obviously (1) implies (2). If (1) is false, then ¬∃y.ϕ(x,y,z).ϕ(x,y,z). In this case, no circuit D can output an assignment making ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)ϕ(x,D(x,z),z) true. The proof has shown that a Π2Π_2 set L is in Σ2Σ_2. What's more, if the Π2Π_2 formula is true, then the circuit D will work against any x. If the Π2Π_2 formula is false, then x making the formula (1) false will work against any circuit. This property means a stronger collapse, namely to SP2 complexity class (i.e. Π2⊆S2P⊆Σ2Π_2⊆𝖲_2^P⊆Σ_2). It was observed by Sengupta.[2] AM =
