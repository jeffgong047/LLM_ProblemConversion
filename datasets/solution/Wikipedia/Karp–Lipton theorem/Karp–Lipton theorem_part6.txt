MA: A modification[3] of the above proof yields NP⊆P/poly⟹AM=MA𝖭𝖯⊆𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖠𝖬=𝖬𝖠 (see Arthur–Merlin protocol). Suppose that L is in AM, i.e.: z∈L⟹Prx[∃y.ϕ(x,y,z)]≥23_x[.ϕ(x,y,z)]≥23 z∉L⟹Prx[∃y.ϕ(x,y,z)]≤13_x[.ϕ(x,y,z)]≤13 and as previously rewrite ∃y.ϕ(x,y,z).ϕ(x,y,z) using the circuit Dn_n that outputs a satisfying assignment if it exists: z∈L⟹Prx[ϕ(x,Dn(x,z),z)]≥23_x[ϕ(x,D_n(x,z),z)]≥23 z∉L⟹Prx[ϕ(x,Dn(x,z),z)]≤13_x[ϕ(x,D_n(x,z),z)]≤13 Since Dn_n can be guessed: z∈L⟹∃D.Prx[ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)]≥23._x[ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)]≥23 z∉L⟹∀D.Prx[ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)]≤13._x[ϕ(x,D(x,z),z)]≤13 which proves L is in the smaller class MA.
