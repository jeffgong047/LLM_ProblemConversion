theorem: Kannan's theorem[4] states that for any fixed k there exists a language L in Σ2Σ_2, which is not in SIZE(nk) (This is a different statement than Σ2⊈P/polyΣ_2⊈𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒, which is currently open and states that there exists a single language that is not in SIZE(nk) for any k). It is a simple circuit lower bound. Proof outline: There exists a language L∈Σ4−SIZE(nk)∈Σ_4-𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k) (the proof uses diagonalization technique). Consider two cases: If SAT∉P/poly𝖲𝖠𝖳∉𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒 then SAT∉SIZE(nk)𝖲𝖠𝖳∉𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k) and theorem is proved. If SAT∈P/poly𝖲𝖠𝖳∈𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒, then by Karp–Lipton theorem, Σ4=Σ2Σ_4=Σ_2 and therefore L∈Σ2−SIZE(nk)∈Σ_2-𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k). A stronger version of Karp–Lipton theorem strengthens Kannan's theorem to: for any k, there exists a language L∈S2P−SIZE(nk)∈𝖲_2^P-𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k). It is also known that PP is not contained in SIZE(nk)𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k), which was proved by Vinodchandran.[5] Proof:[6] If PP⊈P/poly𝖯𝖯⊈𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒 then PP⊈SIZE(nk)𝖯𝖯⊈𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k). Otherwise, P#P⊆P/poly𝖯^#𝖯⊆𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒. Since P#P⊇PP⊇MA𝖯^#𝖯⊇𝖯𝖯⊇𝖬𝖠 (by property of MA) P#P⊇PH⊇Σ2⊇MA𝖯^#𝖯⊇𝖯𝖧⊇Σ_2⊇𝖬𝖠 (by Toda's theorem and property of MA) P#P=MA𝖯^#𝖯=𝖬𝖠 (follows from assumption using interactive protocol for permanent, see P/poly) the containments are equalities and we get PP=Σ2⊈SIZE(nk)𝖯𝖯=Σ_2⊈𝖲𝖨𝖹𝖤(n^k) by Kannan's theorem.
