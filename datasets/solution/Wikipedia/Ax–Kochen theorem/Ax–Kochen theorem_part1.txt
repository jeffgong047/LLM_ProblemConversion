On the existence of zeros of homogeneous polynomials over the p-adic numbers The Axâ€“Kochen theorem, named for James Ax and Simon B. Kochen, states that for each positive integer d there is a finite set Yd of prime numbers, such that if p is any prime not in Yd then every homogeneous polynomial of degree d over the p-adic numbers in at least d2 + 1 variables has a nontrivial zero.[1] The proof of the
