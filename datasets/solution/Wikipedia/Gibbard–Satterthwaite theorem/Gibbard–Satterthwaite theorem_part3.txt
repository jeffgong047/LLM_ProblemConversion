statement: Let A𝒜 be the set of alternatives (which is assumed finite), also called candidates, even if they are not necessarily persons: they can also be several possible decisions about a given issue. We denote by N=1,…,n𝒩={1,…,n} the set of voters. Let P𝒫 be the set of strict weak orders over A𝒜: an element of this set can represent the preferences of a voter, where a voter may be indifferent regarding the ordering of some alternatives. A voting rule is a function f:Pn→A:𝒫^n→𝒜. Its input is a profile of preferences (P1,…,Pn)∈Pn(P_1,…,P_n)∈𝒫^n and it yields the identity of the winning candidate. We say that f is manipulable if and only if there exists a profile (P1,…,Pn)∈Pn(P_1,…,P_n)∈𝒫^n where some voter i, by replacing her ballot Pi_i with another ballot Pi′_i', can get an outcome that she prefers (in the sense of Pi_i). We denote by f(Pn)(𝒫^n) the image of f, i.e. the set of possible outcomes for the election. For example, we say that f has at least three possible outcomes if and only if the cardinality of f(Pn)(𝒫^n) is 3 or more. We say that f is dictatorial if and only if there exists a voter i who is a dictator, in the sense that the winning alternative is always her most-liked one among the possible outcomes regardless of the preferences of other voters. If the dictator has several equally most-liked alternatives among the possible outcomes, then the winning alternative is simply one of them. Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem — If a voting rule has at least 3 possible outcomes and is non-dictatorial, then it is manipulable.
