Corollary: We now consider the case where by assumption, a voter cannot be indifferent between two candidates. We denote by Lℒ the set of strict total orders over A𝒜 and we define a strict voting rule as a function f:Ln→A:ℒ^n→𝒜. The definitions of possible outcomes, manipulable, dictatorial have natural adaptations to this framework. For a strict voting rule, the converse of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is true. Indeed, a strict voting rule is dictatorial if and only if it always selects the most-liked candidate of the dictator among the possible outcomes; in particular, it does not depend on the other voters' ballots. As a consequence, it is not manipulable: the dictator is perfectly defended by her sincere ballot, and the other voters have no impact on the outcome, hence they have no incentive to deviate from sincere voting. Thus, we obtain the following equivalence. Theorem — If a strict voting rule has at least 3 possible outcomes, it is non-manipulable if and only if it is dictatorial. In the theorem, as well as in the corollary, it is not needed to assume that any alternative can be elected. It is only assumed that at least three of them can win, i.e. are possible outcomes of the voting rule. It is possible that some other alternatives can be elected in no circumstances: the theorem and the corollary still apply. However, the corollary is sometimes presented under a less general form:[3] instead of assuming that the rule has at least three possible outcomes, it is sometimes assumed that A𝒜 contains at least three elements and that the voting rule is onto, i.e. every alternative is a possible outcome.[4] The assumption of being onto is sometimes even replaced with the assumption that the rule is unanimous, in the sense that if all voters prefer the same candidate, then she must be elected.[5][6] Sketch of
