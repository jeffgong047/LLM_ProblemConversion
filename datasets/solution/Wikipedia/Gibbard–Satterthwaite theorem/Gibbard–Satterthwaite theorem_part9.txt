proof: The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem can be proved based on Arrow's impossibility theorem, which deals with social ranking functions, i.e. voting systems designed to yield a complete preference order of the candidates, rather than simply choosing a winner. We give a sketch of proof in the simplified case where the voting rule f is assumed to be unanimous. It is possible to build a social ranking function RankRank, as follows: in order to decide whether a≺b, the RankRank function creates new preferences in which a and b are moved to the top of all voters' preferences. Then, RankRank examines whether f chooses a or b. It is possible to prove that, if f is non-manipulable and non-dictatorial, then RankRank satisfies the properties: unanimity, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and it is not a dictatorship. Arrow's impossibility theorem says that, when there are three or more alternatives, such a RankRank function cannot exist. Hence, such a voting rule f also cannot exist.[7]: 214–215
