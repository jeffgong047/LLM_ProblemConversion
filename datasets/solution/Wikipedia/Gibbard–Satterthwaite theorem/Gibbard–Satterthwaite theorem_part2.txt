description: Consider three voters named Alice, Bob and Carol, who wish to select a winner among four candidates named a, b, c and d. Assume that they use the Borda count: each voter communicates his or her preference order over the candidates. For each ballot, 3 points are assigned to the top candidate, 2 points to the second candidate, 1 point to the third one and 0 points to the last one. Once all ballots have been counted, the candidate with the most points is declared the winner. Assume that their preferences are as follows. Voter Choice 1 Choice 2 Choice 3 Choice 4 Alice a b c d Bob c b d a Carol c b d a If the voters cast sincere ballots, then the scores are: (a:3,b:6,c:7,d:2)(a:3,b:6,c:7,d:2). Hence, candidate c will be elected, with 7 points. But Alice can vote strategically and change the result. Assume that she modifies her ballot, in order to produce the following situation. Voter Choice 1 Choice 2 Choice 3 Choice 4 Alice b a d c Bob c b d a Carol c b d a Alice has strategically upgraded candidate b and downgraded candidate c. Now, the scores are: (a:2,b:7,c:6,d:3)(a:2,b:7,c:6,d:3). Hence, b is elected. Alice is satisfied by her ballot modification, because she prefers the outcome b to c, which is the outcome she would obtain if she voted sincerely. We say that the Borda count is manipulable: there exists situations where a sincere ballot does not defend a voter's preferences best. The Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite theorem states that every voting rule is manipulable, except possibly in two cases: if there is a distinguished voter who has a dictatorial power, or if the rule limits the possible outcomes to two options only.
