OWF: Consider a pseudorandom generator Gl: {0,1}l → {0,1}2l. Let's create the following one-way function ƒ: {0,1}n → {0,1}n that uses the first half of the output of Gl as its output. Formally, ƒ(x,y) → Gl(x) A key observation that justifies such selection, is that the size of the pre-image universe is 2n and is a negligible fraction of the image of the function of size 22n. To prove that ƒ is indeed a one-way function let's construct an argument by contradiction. Assume there exists a circuit C that inverts ƒ with advantage ε: Prob[ƒ(C(ƒ(x,y))) = ƒ(x,y)] > ε Then we can create the following algorithm that will distinguish Gl from uniform, which contradicts the hypothesis. The algorithm would take an input of 2n bits z and compute (x,y) = C(z). If Gl(x) = z the algorithm would accept, otherwise it rejects. Now, if z is drawn from uniform distribution, the probability that the above algorithm accepts is ≤ 1/2l, since the size of the pre-image is 1/2l of the size of the image. However, if z was drawn from the output of Gl then the probability of acceptance is > ε by assumption of the existence of circuit C. Therefore, the advantage that circuit C has in distinguishing between the uniform U and output of Gl is > ε − 1/2l, which is non-negligible and thus contradicts our assumption of Gl being a pseudorandom generator.
