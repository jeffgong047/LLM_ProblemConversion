functions: Intuitively one-way functions are functions that are easy to compute and hard to invert. In other words, the complexity (or circuit size) of the function is much smaller than that of its inverse. Formally: A function ƒ: {0,1}n → {0,1}n is (S,ε) one-way if for any circuit C of size ≤ S, Prob[ƒ(C(ƒ(x))) = ƒ(x)] ≤ ε. Moreover, ƒ is a one-way function if ƒ can be computed in polynomial time ƒ is (poly(n), 1/poly(n)) one-way Hard-core
