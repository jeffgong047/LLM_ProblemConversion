predicate: The outline of the proof is as follows: If ƒ{0,1}n→{0,1}n is a one-way permutation, then so is ƒ'{0,1}2n→{0,1}2n, where ƒ'(x,y)=ƒ(x).y by definition. Then B(x,y)=x⋅y is a hard-core predicate for ƒ', where ⋅ is a vector dot product. To prove that it is indeed hard-core let's assume otherwise, and show a contradiction with the hypothesis of ƒ being one-way. If B is not a hard-core predicate, then there exists a circuit C that predicts it, so Probx,y[C(ƒ(x),y)=x⋅y] ≥ 1/2+ε. That fact can be used to recover x by cleverly constructing permutations y that isolate bits in x. In fact, for a constant fraction of x, there exists a polynomial time algorithm that lists O(1/ε2) candidates that include all valid x. Thus, an algorithm can invert ƒ(x) in polynomial time for a non-negligible fraction of x, which contradicts the hypothesis.
