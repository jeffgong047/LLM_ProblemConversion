Pseudorandomness: A distribution is considered pseudorandom if no efficient computation can distinguish it from the true uniform distribution by a non-negligible advantage. Formally, a family of distributions Dn is pseudorandom if for any polynomial size circuit C, and any ε inversely polynomial in n |Probx∈U [C(x)=1] − Probx∈D [C(x)=1] | ≤ ε. Pseudorandom
