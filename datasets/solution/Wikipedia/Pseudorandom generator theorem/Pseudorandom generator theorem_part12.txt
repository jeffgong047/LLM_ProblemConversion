PRG: For this case we prove a weaker version of the theorem: One-way permutation → pseudorandom generator A one-way permutation is a one-way function that is also a permutation of the input bits. A pseudorandom generator can be constructed from one-way permutation ƒ as follows: Gl: {0,1}l→{0,1}l+1 = ƒ(x).B(x), where B is hard-core predicate of ƒ and "." is a concatenation operator. Note, that by the theorem proven above, it is only needed to show the existence of a generator that adds just one pseudorandom bit. Hard-core predicate →
