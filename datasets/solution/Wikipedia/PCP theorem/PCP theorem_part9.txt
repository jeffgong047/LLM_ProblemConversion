Interactive proofs are the basis of cryptographic systems now in wide use, but for computer scientists, they're just as important for the insight they provide into the complexity of computational problems. ^ a b Hardesty, Larry (2012-07-31).

Dorit Aharonov, a professor of computer science and engineering at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, says that Vidick and Ito's paper is the quantum analogue of an earlier paper on multiprover interactive proofs that "basically led to the PCP theorem, and the PCP theorem is no doubt the most important result of complexity in the past 20 years." Similarly, she says, the new paper "could be an important step toward proving the quantum analogue of the PCP theorem, which is a major open question in quantum complexity theory." ^ Natarajan, A.; Vidick, T.
