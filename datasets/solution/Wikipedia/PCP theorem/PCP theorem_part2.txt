statement: The PCP theorem states that NP = PCP[O(log n), O(1)], where PCP[r(n), q(n)] is the class of problems for which a probabilistically checkable proof of a solution can be given, such that the proof can be checked in polynomial time using r(n) bits of randomness and by reading q(n) bits of the proof, correct proofs are always accepted, and incorrect proofs are rejected with probability at least 1/2. n is the length in bits of the description of a problem instance. Note further that the verification algorithm is non-adaptive: the choice of bits of the proof to check depend only on the random bits and the description of the problem instance, not the actual bits of the proof.
