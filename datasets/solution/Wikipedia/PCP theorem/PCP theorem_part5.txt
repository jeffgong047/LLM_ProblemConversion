History: The PCP theorem is the culmination of a long line of work on interactive proofs and probabilistically checkable proofs. The first theorem relating standard proofs and probabilistically checkable proofs is the statement that NEXP âŠ† PCP[poly(n), poly(n)], proved by Babai, Fortnow & Lund (1990). Origin of the
