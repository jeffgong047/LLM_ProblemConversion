approximation: An alternative formulation of the PCP theorem states that the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of a constraint satisfaction problem is NP-hard to approximate within some constant factor.[3] Formally, for some constants q and α < 1, the following promise problem (Lyes, Lno) is an NP-hard decision problem: Lyes = {Φ: all constraints in Φ are simultaneously satisfiable} Lno = {Φ: every assignment satisfies fewer than an α fraction of Φ's constraints}, where Φ is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) over a Boolean alphabet with at most q variables per constraint. The connection to the class PCP mentioned above can be seen by noticing that checking a constant number of bits q in a proof can be seen as evaluating a constraint in q Boolean variables on those bits of the proof. Since the verification algorithm uses O(log n) bits of randomness, it can be represented as a CSP as described above with poly(n) constraints. The other characterisation of the PCP theorem then guarantees the promise condition with α = 1/2: if the NP problem's answer is yes, then every constraint (which corresponds to a particular value for the random bits) has a satisfying assignment (an acceptable proof); otherwise, any proof should be rejected with probability at least 1/2, which means any assignment must satisfy fewer than 1/2 of the constraints (which means it will be accepted with probability lower than 1/2). Therefore, an algorithm for the promise problem would be able to solve the underlying NP problem, and hence the promise problem must be NP hard. As a consequence of this theorem, it can be shown that the solutions to many natural optimization problems including maximum boolean formula satisfiability, maximum independent set in graphs, and the shortest vector problem for lattices cannot be approximated efficiently unless P = NP. This can be done by reducing the problem of approximating a solution to such problems to a promise problem of the above form. These results are sometimes also called PCP theorems because they can be viewed as probabilistically checkable proofs for NP with some additional structure.
