algebra): Let f:A→B:A be an algebra homomorphism. Then the image of f is a subalgebra of B, the relation given by Φ:f(x)=f(y)Φ:f(x)=f(y) (i.e. the kernel of f) is a congruence on A, and the algebras A/Φ/Φ and im⁡fimf are isomorphic. (Note that in the case of a group, f(x)=f(y)(x)=f(y) iff f(xy−1)=1(xy^-1)=1, so one recovers the notion of kernel used in group theory in this case.) Theorem B (universal
