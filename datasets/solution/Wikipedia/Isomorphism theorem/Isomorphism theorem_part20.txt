(modules): Let M be a module, N a submodule of M. There is a bijection between the submodules of M that contain N and the submodules of M/N/N. The correspondence is given by A↔A/N/N for all A⊇N. This correspondence commutes with the processes of taking sums and intersections (i.e., is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of submodules of M/N/N and the lattice of submodules of M that contain N).[17] Universal
