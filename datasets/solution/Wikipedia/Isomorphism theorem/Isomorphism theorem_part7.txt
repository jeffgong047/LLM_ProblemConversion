(groups): Diagram for theorem B4. The two quotient groups (dotted) are isomorphic. Let G be a group. Let S be a subgroup of G, and let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then the following hold: The product SN is a subgroup of G, The subgroup N is a normal subgroup of SN, The intersection S∩N is a normal subgroup of S, and The quotient groups (SN)/N(SN)/N and S/(S∩N)/(S) are isomorphic. Technically, it is not necessary for N to be a normal subgroup, as long as S is a subgroup of the normalizer of N in G. In this case, N is not a normal subgroup of G, but N is still a normal subgroup of the product SN. This theorem is sometimes called the second isomorphism theorem,[10] diamond theorem[12] or the parallelogram theorem.[13] An application of the second isomorphism theorem identifies projective linear groups: for example, the group on the complex projective line starts with setting G=GL2⁡(C)=GL_2(ℂ), the group of invertible 2 × 2 complex matrices, S=SL2⁡(C)=SL_2(ℂ), the subgroup of determinant 1 matrices, and N the normal subgroup of scalar matrices C×I=(a00a):a∈C×ℂ^×I={([ a 0; 0 a ]):a∈ℂ^×}, we have S∩N=±I={}, where I is the identity matrix, and SN=GL2⁡(C)=GL_2(ℂ). Then the second isomorphism theorem states that: PGL2⁡(C):=GL2⁡(C)/(C×I)≅SL2⁡(C)/±I=:PSL2⁡(C)PGL_2(ℂ):=GL_2(ℂ)/(ℂ^×I)≅SL_2(ℂ)/{}=:PSL_2(ℂ) Theorem C
