algebra): Let A be an algebra and denote Con⁡AConA the set of all congruences on A. The set Con⁡AConA is a complete lattice ordered by inclusion.[18] If Φ∈Con⁡AΦ∈ConA is a congruence and we denote by [Φ,A×A]⊆Con⁡A[Φ,A]⊆ConA the set of all congruences that contain ΦΦ (i.e. [Φ,A×A][Φ,A] is a principal filter in Con⁡AConA, moreover it is a sublattice), then the map α:[Φ,A×A]→Con⁡(A/Φ),Ψ↦Ψ/Φα:[Φ,A]→Con(A/Φ),Ψ↦Ψ/Φ is a lattice isomorphism.[19][20]
