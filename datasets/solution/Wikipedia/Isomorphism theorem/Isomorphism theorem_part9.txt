(groups): Main article: Lattice theorem Let G be a group, and N a normal subgroup of G. The canonical projection homomorphism Gâ†’G/N/N defines a bijective correspondence between the set of subgroups of G containing N and the set of (all) subgroups of G/N/N. Under this correspondence normal subgroups correspond to normal subgroups. This theorem is sometimes called the correspondence theorem, the lattice theorem, and the fourth isomorphism theorem. The Zassenhaus lemma (also known as the butterfly lemma) is sometimes called the fourth isomorphism theorem.[14]
