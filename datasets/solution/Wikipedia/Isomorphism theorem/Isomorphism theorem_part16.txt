Modules: The statements of the isomorphism theorems for modules are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a quotient module from any submodule. The isomorphism theorems for vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over Zℤ) are special cases of these. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the rank–nullity theorem. In the following, "module" will mean "R-module" for some fixed ring R. Theorem A
