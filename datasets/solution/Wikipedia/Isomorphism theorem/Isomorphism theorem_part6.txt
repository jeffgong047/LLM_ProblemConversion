(groups): See also: Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms Diagram of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms Let G and H be groups, and let f : G â†’ H be a homomorphism. Then: The kernel of f is a normal subgroup of G, The image of f is a subgroup of H, and The image of f is isomorphic to the quotient group G / ker(f). In particular, if f is surjective then H is isomorphic to G / ker(f). This theorem is usually called the first isomorphism theorem. Theorem B
