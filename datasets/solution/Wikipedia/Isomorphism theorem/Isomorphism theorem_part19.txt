(modules): Let M be a module, T a submodule of M. If S is a submodule of M such that T⊆S⊆M, then S/T/T is a submodule of M/T/T. Every submodule of M/T/T is of the form S/T/T for some submodule S of M such that T⊆S⊆M. If S is a submodule of M such that T⊆S⊆M, then the quotient module (M/T)/(S/T)(M/T)/(S/T) is isomorphic to M/S/S. Theorem D
