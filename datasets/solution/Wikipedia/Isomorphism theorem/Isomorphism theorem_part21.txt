algebra: To generalise this to universal algebra, normal subgroups need to be replaced by congruence relations. A congruence on an algebra A is an equivalence relation Φ⊆A×AΦ that forms a subalgebra of A×A considered as an algebra with componentwise operations. One can make the set of equivalence classes A/Φ/Φ into an algebra of the same type by defining the operations via representatives; this will be well-defined since ΦΦ is a subalgebra of A×A. The resulting structure is the quotient algebra. Theorem A (universal
