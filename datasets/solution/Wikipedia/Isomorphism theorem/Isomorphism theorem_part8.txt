(groups): Let G be a group, and N a normal subgroup of G. Then If K is a subgroup of G such that N⊆K⊆G, then G/N/N has a subgroup isomorphic to K/N/N. Every subgroup of G/N/N is of the form K/N/N for some subgroup K of G such that N⊆K⊆G. If K is a normal subgroup of G such that N⊆K⊆G, then G/N/N has a normal subgroup isomorphic to K/N/N. Every normal subgroup of G/N/N is of the form K/N/N for some normal subgroup K of G such that N⊆K⊆G. If K is a normal subgroup of G such that N⊆K⊆G, then the quotient group (G/N)/(K/N)(G/N)/(K/N) is isomorphic to G/K/K. The last statement is sometimes referred to as the third isomorphism theorem. The first four statements are often subsumed under Theorem D below, and referred to as the lattice theorem, correspondence theorem, or fourth isomorphism theorem. Theorem D
