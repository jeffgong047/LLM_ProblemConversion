algebra): Given an algebra A, a subalgebra B of A, and a congruence ΦΦ on A, let ΦB=Φ∩(B×B)Φ_B=Φ∩(B) be the trace of ΦΦ in B and [B]Φ=K∈A/Φ:K∩B≠∅[B]^Φ={K/Φ:K≠∅} the collection of equivalence classes that intersect B. Then ΦBΦ_B is a congruence on B, [B]Φ B]^Φ is a subalgebra of A/Φ/Φ, and the algebra [B]Φ[B]^Φ is isomorphic to the algebra B/ΦB/Φ_B. Theorem C (universal
