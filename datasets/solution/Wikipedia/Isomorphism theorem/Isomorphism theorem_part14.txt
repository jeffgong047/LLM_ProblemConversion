(rings): Let R be a ring, and I an ideal of R. Then If A is a subring of R such that I⊆A⊆R, then A/I/I is a subring of R/I/I. Every subring of R/I/I is of the form A/I/I for some subring A of R such that I⊆A⊆R. If J is an ideal of R such that I⊆J⊆R, then J/I/I is an ideal of R/I/I. Every ideal of R/I/I is of the form J/I/I for some ideal J of R such that I⊆J⊆R. If J is an ideal of R such that I⊆J⊆R, then the quotient ring (R/I)/(J/I)(R/I)/(J/I) is isomorphic to R/J/J. Theorem D
