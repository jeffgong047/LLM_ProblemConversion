rings: Zariski (1949) reformulated his main theorem in terms of commutative algebra as a statement about local rings. Grothendieck (1961, Théorème 4.4.7) generalized Zariski's formulation as follows: If B is an algebra of finite type over a local Noetherian ring A, and n is a maximal ideal of B which is minimal among ideals of B whose inverse image in A is the maximal ideal m of A, then there is a finite A-algebra A′ with a maximal ideal m′ (whose inverse image in A is m) such that the localization Bn is isomorphic to the A-algebra A′m′. If in addition A and B are integral and have the same field of fractions, and A is integrally closed, then this theorem implies that A and B are equal. This is essentially Zariski's formulation of his main theorem in terms of commutative rings. Zariski's main theorem: topological
