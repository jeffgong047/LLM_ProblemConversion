form: A topological version of Zariski's main theorem says that if x is a (closed) point of a normal complex variety it is unibranch; in other words there are arbitrarily small neighborhoods U of x such that the set of non-singular points of U is connected (Mumford 1999, III.9). The property of being normal is stronger than the property of being unibranch: for example, a cusp of a plane curve is unibranch but not normal. Zariski's main theorem: power series
