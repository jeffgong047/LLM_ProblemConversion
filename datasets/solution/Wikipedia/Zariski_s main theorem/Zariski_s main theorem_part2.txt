morphisms: Let f be a birational mapping of algebraic varieties V and W. Recall that f is defined by a closed subvariety Γ⊂V×WΓ (a "graph" of f) such that the projection on the first factor p1_1 induces an isomorphism between an open U⊂V and p1−1(U)_1^-1(U), and such that p2∘p1−1_2_1^-1 is an isomorphism on U too. The complement of U in V is called a fundamental variety or indeterminacy locus, and the image of a subset of V under p2∘p1−1_2_1^-1 is called a total transform of it. The original statement of the theorem in (Zariski 1943, p. 522) reads: MAIN THEOREM: If W is an irreducible fundamental variety on V of a birational correspondence T between V and V′ and if T has no fundamental elements on V′ then — under the assumption that V is locally normal at W — each irreducible component of the transform T[W] is of higher dimension than W. Here T is essentially a morphism from V′ to V that is birational, W is a subvariety of the set where the inverse of T is not defined whose local ring is normal, and the transform T[W] means the inverse image of W under the morphism from V′ to V. Here are some variants of this theorem stated using more recent terminology. Hartshorne (1977, Corollary III.11.4) calls the following connectedness statement "Zariski's Main theorem": If f:X→Y is a birational projective morphism between noetherian integral schemes, then the inverse image of every normal point of Y is connected. The following consequence of it (Theorem V.5.2,loc.cit.) also goes under this name: If f:X→Y is a birational transformation of projective varieties with Y normal, then the total transform of a fundamental point of f is connected and of dimension at least 1.
