Examples: Suppose that V is a smooth variety of dimension greater than 1 and V′ is given by blowing up a point W on V. Then V is normal at W, and the component of the transform of W is a projective space, which has dimension greater than W as predicted by Zariski's original form of his main theorem. In the previous example the transform of W was irreducible. It is easy to find examples where the total transform is reducible by blowing up other points on the transform. For example, if V′ is given by blowing up a point W on V and then blowing up another point on this transform, the total transform of W has 2 irreducible components meeting at a point. As predicted by Hartshorne's form of the main theorem, the total transform is connected and of dimension at least 1. For an example where W is not normal and the conclusion of the main theorem fails, take V′ to be a smooth variety, and take V to be given by identifying two distinct points on V′, and take W to be the image of these two points. Then W is not normal, and the transform of W consists of two points, which is not connected and does not have positive dimension. Zariski's main theorem for quasifinite
