consequence: If N is odd, then G(N) is roughly 1, hence N2≪r(N)^2(N) for all sufficiently large N. By showing that the contribution made to r(N) by proper prime powers is O(N32log2⁡N)(N^32log^2N), one sees that N2log−3⁡N≪(numberofwaysNcanbewrittenasasumofthreeprimes).^2log^-3N≪(numberofwaysNcanbewrittenasasumofthreeprimes). This means in particular that any sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes, thus showing Goldbach's weak conjecture for all but finitely many cases. Strategy of
