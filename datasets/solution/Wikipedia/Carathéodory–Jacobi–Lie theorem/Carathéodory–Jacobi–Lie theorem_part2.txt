Statement: Let M be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold with symplectic form ω. For p ∈ M and r ≤ n, let f1, f2, ..., fr be smooth functions defined on an open neighborhood V of p whose differentials are linearly independent at each point, or equivalently df1(p)∧…∧dfr(p)≠0,_1(p)∧…_r(p)≠0, where {fi, fj} = 0. (In other words, they are pairwise in involution.) Here {–,–} is the Poisson bracket. Then there are functions fr+1, ..., fn, g1, g2, ..., gn defined on an open neighborhood U ⊂ V of p such that (fi, gi) is a symplectic chart of M, i.e., ω is expressed on U as ω=∑i=1ndfi∧dgi.ω=∑_i=1^ndf_i_i.
