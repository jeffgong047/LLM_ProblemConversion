Main Idea:
The authors propose a cost-effective and efficient way to teach advanced topics in polarimetry to students by designing and constructing their own photoelastic modulators using gelatin.

Reasoning:

Cost and Accessibility: Commercial photoelastic modulators, like the Hinds Instruments PEM-90, are prohibitively expensive for educational institutions. To outfit a lab with multiple units would strain many budgets. Hence, there was a need for an affordable alternative.
Material Choices: The authors explored different materials for their DIY modulator. They needed a material that was sensitive enough to showcase stress-induced birefringence without needing excessive force. Early tests with materials like polycarbonate were less than ideal due to the high amounts of stress required.
Inspiration from Previous Work: The idea to use gelatin as the core component was inspired by another paper that discussed polarized light demonstrations. Gelatin, being a malleable and easily accessible material, had the right characteristics for stress-induced birefringence.
Design and Construction: The gelatin was set in a plastic mold, which would then be subject to varying stresses using a speaker coil. The speaker coil would vibrate, exerting pressure onto the gelatin, thereby changing its birefringence and, consequently, the polarization of light passing through it. This setup acts as a simple and effective photoelastic modulator.
Educational Outcomes: This solution allows multiple setups in a single lab, ensuring that every student gets hands-on experience simultaneously. The modulatorâ€™s design is also simple enough for students to understand its working principles, which is an added educational benefit.
In summary, the authors ingeniously leveraged the optical properties of gelatin and the mechanical properties of a speaker coil to craft an affordable and efficient photoelastic modulator for educational purposes. This solution offers both a hands-on experience for students and an opportunity for them to delve deep into the mechanics and optics behind the device
