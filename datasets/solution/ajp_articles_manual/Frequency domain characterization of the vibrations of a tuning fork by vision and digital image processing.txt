Solution Idea:
The authors introduce an experimental setup that employs stroboscopic techniques to characterize the vibrations of a tuning fork. The choice of a tuning fork is strategic as it's a common tool used in undergraduate teaching to demonstrate resonance.

Stroboscopic Technique: By utilizing a stroboscopic illumination, a standard video camera can capture the resonant frequencies of the tuning fork up to the kHz range.
Digital Image Processing: Instead of relying on expensive equipment, the setup uses digital image processing to achieve subpixel accuracy in measuring the vibrational amplitude of the tuning fork. This is achieved by extracting data from features present in the object's structure.
Affordable Equipment: The entire setup is made cost-effective by leveraging commonly available equipment â€“ a PC with a sound card, an audio amplifier, and a digital camera.
Synchronized Outputs: The use of software synthesis for the signals ensures synchronized outputs, which is a key factor for accurate measurements. The generated drive signals offer a high frequency resolution.
Non-contact Excitation Method: The authors innovatively employ a speaker placed near the tuning fork's prong to induce vibrations. This ensures that there is no mechanical contact and yet the tuning fork can be set into motion.
Reasoning:

Need for Precise Measurements: To understand characteristics like the quality factor of a tuning fork or the temperature dependence of its resonance frequency, precise measurements of its mechanical vibrations are necessary.
Educational Relevance: Tuning forks are well-known educational tools, and thus characterizing their vibrations can provide students with deep insights into resonance and waveforms.
Cost-Effectiveness: By focusing on leveraging commonly available equipment and digital image processing, the authors present a solution that remains affordable for educational institutions.
Image Processing and Fourier Transform: The image processing method introduced is based on analyzing the phase of the Fourier transform. This method highlights the relationship between the spectral phase and the relative displacement in the spatial domain. Such an approach not only achieves subpixel accuracy but also offers an educational experience, emphasizing the Fourier transform as a vital tool.
In essence, the authors have presented a cost-effective and insightful method for characterizing the vibrations of a tuning fork using stroboscopic techniques and digital image processing. This not only serves as a solution for measuring in-plane lateral displacements but also as a valuable educational tool for students to understand waveforms and resonance.
