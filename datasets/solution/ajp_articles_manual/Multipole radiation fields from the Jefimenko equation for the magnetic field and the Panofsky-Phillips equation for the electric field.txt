Start with Maxwell's Equations:
Begin with the differential form of Maxwell's equations for vacuum conditions.
Derive Jefimenko's Equations:
Jefimenko's equations directly describe the electric and magnetic fields in terms of their sources (charges and currents). They can be derived from Maxwell's equations by using the Green's function for the wave equation. The most general form of these equations accounts for retarded time, taking into account the finite speed of light and the propagation time for electromagnetic interactions.
Point Charge in Arbitrary Motion:
Consider a point charge
q moving along a trajectory. To find the fields due to this charge, integrate the charge and current distributions over all space. The current density can be expressed as 
J(r,t)=qv(t)δ(r−r(t)), where
v is the velocity of the charge and
r(t) describes its trajectory.
Multipole Expansion:
Use a multipole expansion to express the fields in terms of dipole, quadrupole, and higher-order contributions. The leading term will be the electric dipole term, followed by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole terms. This is achieved by expanding the charge and current distributions in a series about a chosen origin, and each term in the series corresponds to a multipole moment.
Derive Contributions:
With the multipole expansion in hand, derive the fields for each contribution separately. The electric dipole radiation will be the simplest, then proceed to derive the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole radiation fields.
Consider Particles with Both Charges:
If particles have both electric and magnetic charges, the same approach can be expanded, but one will have to account for the additional magnetic charge and its associated current distribution in Jefimenko's equations
