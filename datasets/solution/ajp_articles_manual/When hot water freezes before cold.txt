 Mpemba effect may be caused by freezing-point depression by solutes (either gaseous or solid) whose solubility decreases with an increase in temperature. Therefore, when water is heated, these solutes are removed.

The paper notes that heating water removes dissolved gases, especially nitrogen, due to the reduced solubility of these gases at higher temperatures.
In addition to gases, the solubility of some solid substances in water, such as certain mineral salts present in hard water, also decreases with increasing temperature. For instance, the solubility of calcium bicarbonate, commonly found in hard water, decreases as the temperature rises, which can lead to precipitation of limestone deposits.
The main idea is that unheated hard water has a lower freezing point than hard water that has been previously heated, due to the presence of these solutes. When water is heated and then allowed to cool in a freezing environment, it has fewer solutes than water that was never heated. The solute concentration is concentrated ahead of the freezing front in water that hasn't been heated, thus slowing the freezing process by reducing the temperature gradient and heat flux.
