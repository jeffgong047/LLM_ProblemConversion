Summary of Idea and Reasoning:

Historical Context: The traditional design and material composition of violins have remained largely unchanged since the 1700s. The classic Cremona design, established by renowned violin makers such as Amati, Guarneri del Gesù, and Stradivari, is predominantly made of spruce for the top plate and maple for the back plate.
Fundamental Principle: Every musical instrument typically has three parts - energy introduction, resonance for pitch, and radiation for sound. In a violin, the bow introduces energy, the strings resonate to produce pitch, and the body radiates the sound. The key component under study here is the body of the violin, particularly its top plate and back plate.
Schelleng’s Scaling Rules: These rules provide the fundamental physics that allows for the scaling of musical instruments using non-traditional materials. Schelleng proposed several woods that might be suitable for violin construction based on their vibrational properties and quality factors.
Balsa Wood: Despite its physical limitations, balsa wood has a high ratio of sound speed to density (c/􏰉) and a decent quality factor, making it an intriguing choice. The paper tests the hypothesis that balsa wood can be used as a material for constructing a playable violin, consistent with Schelleng's scaling rules.
Motivation: Beyond the mere creation of a balsa violin, the undertaking offers a tactile appreciation of the vibrational properties of materials and offers insights into the physics of musical instruments, a knowledge often hard to achieve through traditional means.
In essence, the paper dives into the exploration of novel materials, particularly balsa wood, for violin construction, guided by the scaling principles derived by John Schelleng.
