Idea and Reasoning:
Stirling Series and Formula: The author introduces the Stirling series which offers a better representation of
ln
⁡
(
n
!
)
ln(n!). The series includes more terms than the traditional Stirling's approximation, and as such, it is expected to provide better accuracy.
Finite Number of Particles: The traditional Boltzmann distribution using the simple Stirling's approximation has its limitations, especially when applied to a system with a finite number of particles. This limitation can lead to issues, especially when considering small values of
n
n. The paper posits that by using the more exact Stirling formula, one can derive a better representation of the Boltzmann distribution for systems with a finite number of particles.
Lambert W-Function: The solution to the modified Boltzmann variational problem using the exact Stirling formula leads to a transcendental equation. This equation can be solved using the Lambert W-function (or Product-Log function). This function has specific properties that make it suitable for solving transcendental equations of a particular form.
Exact Digamma-Boltzmann Distribution: By using the exact function
ln

(

)
ln(n!) instead of any approximation, one would obtain a transcendental equation which would require numerical methods for a solution. This results in what the paper refers to as the Digamma-Boltzmann distribution. As an implication of this distribution, the paper suggests that the constant-volume heat capacity of an Einstein solid varies with the number of particles

N.
Constraints on Maximum Energy: The exact Digamma-Boltzmann distribution introduces constraints on the energy of the highest populated state. This constraint is in line with the idea of having finite total energy in a microcanonical ensemble.
In summary, the paper's core idea revolves around revising the traditional Boltzmann distribution by using more exact representations of the factorial function, either through the Stirling series/formula or the exact
ln

ln(n!) function. This is expected to provide a better understanding and representation of systems with a finite number of particles.
