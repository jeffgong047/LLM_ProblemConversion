Idea and Reasoning for Solution:
The goal is to develop a simple finite element method to solve Laplace’s equation. To validate the methodology:

Test Case with a Simplified Model: Before applying the finite element method to a complex structure, a simplified model chamber, which can be analytically solved, is considered. This model contains a single equipotential disk in a grounded cylinder. Using this straightforward case ensures the accuracy and convergence of the finite element method.
General Application of the Finite Element Method: After the initial testing phase, the approach is generalized. It begins by illustrating the method's application to a straightforward second-order differential equation. Then, the process is generalized to higher dimensions, with a particular focus on solving Laplace’s equation in cylindrical coordinates.
Application to the Realistic Chamber: The final step involves applying the finite element method to an experimental chamber, consisting of five equipotential rings. The results from this chamber are then compared against those obtained from the model chamber to verify accuracy and utility.
By using the finite element method, the team aims to predict the electric potential more accurately and understand the fundamental physics better than by using commercial software. This will be particularly beneficial in controlling the homogeneity and strength of the electric field, essential for the success of the atomic physics experiments.
