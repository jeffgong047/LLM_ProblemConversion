Summary of Idea and Reasoning:

Variational Principle: A powerful tool in quantum mechanics used extensively for approximating the ground state energies of systems that cannot be exactly solved. Traditionally, it's utilized to provide an upper bound to the exact ground state energy.
Lower Bound Exploration: Most applications of the variational principle revolve around its ability to yield a good upper bound. The exploration of its application to find a lower bound is the main idea behind the paper.
Partitioning the Hamiltonian: The paper introduces a technique based on dividing the Hamiltonian into several positive semi-definite parts. Such an approach is particularly beneficial in many-body quantum problems. This partitioning aids in the derivation of the lower bound.
Exact Solution: An intriguing proposition is presented: under certain conditions, when the lower bound coincides with the upper bound derived using the variational principle, an exact solution for the ground state can be determined.
Examples for Verification: To illustrate the concepts and validate the method, the paper takes two well-known quantum systems as examples: the harmonic oscillator and the Ising Hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice. Both these systems have known exact solutions, making them ideal candidates to verify the accuracy and utility of the proposed technique.
In essence, the paper expands on the traditional application of the variational principle in quantum mechanics to not only ascertain the upper bound of the ground state energy but also to explore its potential to determine the lower bound and, in special cases, the exact ground state itself. This is achieved through a novel approach of partitioning the Hamiltonian, tested on familiar quantum systems.
