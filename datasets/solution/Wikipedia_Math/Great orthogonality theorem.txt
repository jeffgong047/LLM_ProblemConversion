In mathematics, the Schur orthogonality relations, which were proven by Issai Schur through Schur's lemma, express a central fact about representations of finite groups. 
They admit a generalization to the case of compact groups in general, and in particular compact Lie groups, such as the rotation group SO(3).


Finite groups[edit]
Intrinsic statement[edit]
The space of complex-valued class functions of a finite group G has a natural inner product:

⟨α,β⟩:=1|G|∑g∈Gα(g)β(g)¯⟨α,β⟩:=1/|G|∑_gα(g)β(g)
where β(g)¯β(g) means the complex conjugate of the value of ββ on g.  With respect to this inner product, the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis
for the space of class functions, and this yields the orthogonality relation for the rows of the character
table:

⟨χi,χj⟩=0ifi≠j,1ifi=j.⟨χ_i,χ_j⟩=0   i,
1   i=j.
For g,h∈G,h, applying the same inner product to the columns of the character table yields:

∑χiχi(g)χi(h)¯=|CG(g)|,ifg,hareconjugate0otherwise.∑_χ_iχ_i(g)χ_i(h)=|C_G(g)|,   g,h
0   
where the sum is over all of the irreducible characters χiχ_i of G and the symbol |CG(g)||C_G(g)| denotes the order of the centralizer of g. Note that since g and h are conjugate iff they are in the same column of the character table, this implies that the columns of the character table are orthogonal.
The orthogonality relations can aid many computations including:

decomposing an unknown character as a linear combination of irreducible characters;
constructing the complete character table when only some of the irreducible characters are known;
finding the orders of the centralizers of representatives of the conjugacy classes of a group; and
finding the order of the group.
Coordinates statement[edit]
Let Γ(λ)(R)mnΓ^(λ)(R)_mn be a matrix element of an irreducible matrix representation
Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) of a finite group  G=R={R} of order  |G|, i.e. G has |G| elements. Since it can be proven that any matrix representation of any finite group is equivalent to a unitary representation, we assume Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) is unitary:

∑n=1lλΓ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ(λ)(R)nk=δmkforallR∈G,∑_n=1^l_λ Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* Γ^(λ)(R)_nk=δ_mk  forall,
where lλ_λ is the (finite) dimension of the irreducible representation Γ(λ)Γ^(λ).[1]
The orthogonality relations, only valid for matrix elements of irreducible representations, are:

∑R∈G|G|Γ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ(μ)(R)n′m′=δλμδnn′δmm′|G|lλ.∑_R^|G| Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* Γ^(μ)(R)_n'm'=δ_λμδ_nn'δ_mm'|G|/l_λ.
Here Γ(λ)(R)nm∗Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^* is the complex conjugate of Γ(λ)(R)nmΓ^(λ)(R)_nm  and the sum is over all elements of G.
The Kronecker delta δλμδ_λμ is unity if the matrices are in the same irreducible representation Γ(λ)=Γ(μ)Γ^(λ)=Γ^(μ). If Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) and Γ(μ)Γ^(μ) are non-equivalent
it is zero. The other two Kronecker delta's state that  
the row and column indices must be equal (n=n′=n' and m=m′=m') in order to obtain a non-vanishing result.  This theorem is also known as the Great (or Grand) Orthogonality Theorem.
Every group has an identity representation (all group elements mapped onto the real number 1).
This is an irreducible representation. The great orthogonality relations immediately imply that 

∑R∈G|G|Γ(μ)(R)nm=0∑_R^|G| Γ^(μ)(R)_nm=0
for n,m=1,…,lμ,m=1,…,l_μ and any irreducible representation Γ(μ)Γ^(μ)  not equal to the identity representation.

Example of the permutation group on 3 objects[edit]
The 3! permutations of three objects form a group of order 6, commonly denoted S3 (symmetric group). This group is isomorphic to the point group C3v_3v, consisting of a threefold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes. The groups have a 2-dimensional irreducible representation (l = 2). In the case of S3 one usually labels this representation
by the Young tableau λ=[2,1]λ=[2,1] and in the case of C3v_3v
one usually writes  λ=Eλ=E. In both cases the representation consists of the following six real matrices, each representing a single group element:[2]

(1001)(100−1)(−12323212)(−12−32−3212)(−1232−32−12)(−12−3232−12)[ 1 0; 0 1;  ]  [  1  0;  0 -1;  ]  [   -1/2 √(3)/2; √(3)/2    1/2;  ]  [    -1/2 -√(3)/2; -√(3)/2     1/2;  ]  [    -1/2  √(3)/2; -√(3)/2    -1/2;  ]  [    -1/2 -√(3)/2;  √(3)/2    -1/2;  ]
The normalization of the (1,1) element:

∑R∈G6Γ(R)11∗Γ(R)11=12+12+(−12)2+(−12)2+(−12)2+(−12)2=3.∑_R^6 Γ(R)_11^* Γ(R)_11=1^2+1^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2+(-12)^2=3.
In the same manner one can show the normalization of the other matrix elements: (2,2), (1,2), and (2,1).
The orthogonality of the (1,1) and (2,2)  elements:

∑R∈G6Γ(R)11∗Γ(R)22=12+(1)(−1)+(−12)(12)+(−12)(12)+(−12)2+(−12)2=0.∑_R^6 Γ(R)_11^* Γ(R)_22=1^2+(1)(-1)+(-12)(12)+(-12)(12)+(-12)^2+(-12)^2=0.
Similar relations hold for the orthogonality of the elements (1,1) and (1,2), etc.
One verifies easily in the example that all sums of corresponding matrix elements vanish because of
the orthogonality of the given irreducible representation to the identity representation.

Direct implications[edit]
The trace of a matrix is a sum of diagonal matrix elements,

Tr⁡(Γ(R))=∑m=1lΓ(R)mm.Tr(Γ(R))=∑_m=1^lΓ(R)_mm.
The collection of traces is the character χ≡Tr⁡(Γ(R))|R∈Gχ≡{Tr(Γ(R)) | R} of a representation. Often one writes for
the trace of a matrix in an irreducible representation with character  χ(λ)χ^(λ)

χ(λ)(R)≡Tr⁡(Γ(λ)(R)).χ^(λ)(R)≡Tr(Γ^(λ)(R)).
In this notation we can write several character formulas:

∑R∈G|G|χ(λ)(R)∗χ(μ)(R)=δλμ|G|,∑_R^|G|χ^(λ)(R)^* χ^(μ)(R)=δ_λμ|G|,
which allows us to check whether or not a representation is irreducible. (The formula means that the lines in any character table have to be orthogonal vectors.)
And

∑R∈G|G|χ(λ)(R)∗χ(R)=n(λ)|G|,∑_R^|G|χ^(λ)(R)^* χ(R)=n^(λ)|G|,
which helps us to determine how often the irreducible representation Γ(λ)Γ^(λ) is contained within the reducible representation ΓΓ  with character χ(R)χ(R).
For instance, if

n(λ)|G|=96^(λ) |G|=96
and  the order of the group is

|G|=24|G|=24 
then the number of times that Γ(λ)Γ^(λ)  is contained within the given
reducible representation ΓΓ  is

n(λ)=4.^(λ)=4 .
See Character theory for more about group characters.

Compact groups[edit]
The generalization of the orthogonality relations from finite groups to compact groups (which include compact Lie groups such as SO(3)) is basically simple: Replace the summation over the group by an integration over the group.
Every compact group G has unique bi-invariant Haar measure, so that the volume of the group is 1.  Denote this measure by dg.  Let (πα)(π^α) be a complete set of irreducible representations of G, and let ϕv,wα(g)=⟨v,πα(g)w⟩ϕ_v,w^α(g)=,π^α(g)w⟩ be a matrix coefficient of the representation παπ^α.  The orthogonality relations can then be stated in two parts:
1) If πα≆πβπ^απ^β then

∫Gϕv,wα(g)ϕv′,w′β(g)dg=0∫_Gϕ_v,w^α(g)ϕ_v',w'^β(g)dg=0
2) If ei{e_i} is an orthonormal basis of the representation space παπ^α then

∫Gϕei,ejα(g)ϕem,enα(g)¯dg=δi,mδj,n1dα∫_Gϕ_e_i,e_j^α(g)ϕ_e_m,e_n^α(g)dg=δ_i,mδ_j,n1/d^α
where dα^α is the dimension of παπ^α.  These orthogonality relations and the fact that all of the representations have finite dimensions are consequences of the Peter–Weyl theorem.

An example: SO(3)[edit]
An example of an r = 3 parameter group is the matrix group SO(3) consisting of all 3 x 3 orthogonal matrices with unit determinant. A possible parametrization of this group is in terms of Euler angles: x=(α,β,γ)𝐱=(α,β,γ) (see e.g., this article for the explicit form of an element of SO(3) in terms of Euler angles). The bounds are 0≤α,γ≤2π0≤α,γ≤2π and 0≤β≤π0≤β≤π.
Not only the recipe for the computation of the volume element ω(x)dx1dx2⋯dxrω(𝐱) dx_1dx_2_r depends on the chosen parameters, but also the final result, i.e. the analytic form of the weight function (measure) ω(x)ω(𝐱).
For instance, the Euler angle parametrization of SO(3) gives the weight ω(α,β,γ)=sinβ,ω(α,β,γ)=sinβ , while the n, ψ parametrization gives the weight ω(ψ,θ,ϕ)=2(1−cos⁡ψ)sinθω(ψ,θ,ϕ)=2(1-cosψ)sinθ 
with 0≤ψ≤π,0≤ϕ≤2π,0≤θ≤π.0≤ψ≤π,  0≤ϕ≤2π,  0≤θ≤π.
It can be shown that the irreducible matrix representations of compact Lie groups are finite-dimensional and can be chosen to be unitary:

Γ(λ)(R−1)=Γ(λ)(R)−1=Γ(λ)(R)†withΓ(λ)(R)mn†≡Γ(λ)(R)nm∗.Γ^(λ)(R^-1)=Γ^(λ)(R)^-1=Γ^(λ)(R)^†  with  Γ^(λ)(R)_mn^†≡Γ^(λ)(R)_nm^*.
With the shorthand notation

Γ(λ)(x)=Γ(λ)(R(x))Γ^(λ)(𝐱)=Γ^(λ)(R(𝐱))
the orthogonality relations take the form

∫x10x11⋯∫xr0xr1Γ(λ)(x)nm∗Γ(μ)(x)n′m′ω(x)dx1⋯dxr=δλμδnn′δmm′|G|lλ,∫_x_1^0^x_1^1⋯∫_x_r^0^x_r^1 Γ^(λ)(𝐱)_nm^*Γ^(μ)(𝐱)_n'm' ω(𝐱)dx_1_r =δ_λμδ_nn'δ_mm'|G|/l_λ,
with the volume of the group:

|G|=∫x10x11⋯∫xr0xr1ω(x)dx1⋯dxr.|G|=∫_x_1^0^x_1^1⋯∫_x_r^0^x_r^1ω(𝐱)dx_1_r.
As an example we note that the irreducible representations of SO(3) are Wigner D-matrices Dℓ(αβγ)^ℓ(αβγ), which are of dimension 2ℓ+12ℓ+1. Since

|SO(3)|=∫02πdα∫0πsinβdβ∫02πdγ=8π2,|SO(3)|=∫_0^2πdα∫_0^πsinβ dβ∫_0^2πdγ=8π^2,
they satisfy

∫02π∫0π∫02πDℓ(αβγ)nm∗Dℓ′(αβγ)n′m′sinβdαdβdγ=δℓℓ′δnn′δmm′8π22ℓ+1.∫_0^2π∫_0^π∫_0^2πD^ℓ(αβγ)_nm^* D^ℓ'(αβγ)_n'm' sinβ dα dβ dγ=δ_ℓℓ'δ_nn'δ_mm'8π^2/2ℓ+1.
Notes[edit]


^ The finiteness of lλ_λ follows from the fact that any irreducible representation of a finite group G is contained in the regular representation.

^ This choice is not unique, any orthogonal similarity transformation
applied to the matrices gives a valid irreducible representation.
