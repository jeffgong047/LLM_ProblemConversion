Fenchel's theoremTypeTheoremFieldDifferential geometryStatementA smooth closed space curve has total absolute curvature ≥2π≥2π, with equality if and only if it is a convex plane curveFirst stated byWerner FenchelFirst proof in1929
In differential geometry, Fenchel's theorem is an inequality on the total absolute curvature of a closed smooth space curve, stating that it is always at least 2π2π. Equivalently, the average curvature is at least 2π/L2π/L, where L is the length of the curve. The only curves of this type whose total absolute curvature equals 2π2π and whose average curvature equals 2π/L2π/L are the plane convex curves. The theorem is named after Werner Fenchel, who published it in 1929.
The Fenchel theorem is enhanced by the Fáry–Milnor theorem, which says that if a closed smooth simple space curve is nontrivially knotted, then the total absolute curvature is greater than 4π.

Proof[edit]
Given a closed smooth curve α:[0,L]→R3α:[0,L]→ℝ^3 with unit speed, the velocity γ=α˙:[0,L]→S2γ=α̇:[0,L]→𝕊^2 is also a closed smooth curve. The total absolute curvature is its length l(γ)(γ).
The curve γγ does not lie in an open hemisphere. If so, then there is v∈S2∈𝕊^2 such that γ⋅v>0γ>0, so 0=(α(1)−α(0))⋅v=∫0Lγ(t)⋅vdt>00=(α(1)-α(0))=∫_0^Lγ(t) dt>0, a contradiction. This also shows that if γγ lies in a closed hemisphere, then γ⋅v≡0γ≡0, so αα is a plane curve.
Consider a point γ(T)γ(T) such that curves γ([0,T])γ([0,T]) and γ([T,L])γ([T,L]) have the same length. By rotating the sphere, we may assume γ(0)γ(0) and γ(T)γ(T) are symmetric about the axis through the poles. By the previous paragraph, at least one of the two curves γ([0,T])γ([0,T]) and γ([T,L])γ([T,L]) intersects with the equator at some point p. We denote this curve by γ0γ_0. Then l(γ)=2l(γ0)(γ)=2l(γ_0).
We reflect γ0γ_0 across the plane through γ(0)γ(0), γ(T)γ(T), and the north pole, forming a closed curve γ1γ_1 containing antipodal points ±p, with length l(γ1)=2l(γ0)(γ_1)=2l(γ_0). A curve connecting ±p has length at least ππ, which is the length of the great semicircle between ±p. So l(γ1)≥2π(γ_1)≥2π, and if equality holds then γ0γ_0 does not cross the equator.
Therefore, l(γ)=2l(γ0)=l(γ1)≥2π(γ)=2l(γ_0)=l(γ_1)≥2π, and if equality holds then γγ lies in a closed hemisphere, and thus αα is a plane curve.
