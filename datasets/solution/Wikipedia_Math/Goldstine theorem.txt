In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Goldstine theorem, named after Herman Goldstine, is stated as follows:

Goldstine theorem. Let X be a Banach space, then the image of the closed unit ball B⊆X under the canonical embedding into the closed unit ball B′′^'' of the bidual space X′′^'' is a weak*-dense subset.
The conclusion of the theorem is not true for the norm topology, which can be seen by considering the Banach space  of real sequences that converge to zero, c0 space c0,_0, and its bi-dual space Lp space ℓ∞.ℓ^∞.


Proof[edit]
Lemma[edit]
For all x′′∈B′′,^''^'', φ1,…,φn∈X′φ_1,…,φ_n^' and δ>0,δ>0, there exists an x∈(1+δ)B∈(1+δ)B such that φi(x)=x′′(φi)φ_i(x)=x^''(φ_i) for all 1≤i≤n.1.

Proof of lemma[edit]
By the surjectivity of
Φ:X→Cn,x↦(φ1(x),⋯,φn(x))Φ:X→ℂ^n,
x↦(φ_1(x),⋯,φ_n(x))
it is possible to find x∈X with φi(x)=x′′(φi)φ_i(x)=x^''(φ_i) for 1≤i≤n.1.
Now let
Y:=⋂iker⁡φi=ker⁡Φ.:=⋂_iφ_i=Φ.
Every element of z∈(x+Y)∩(1+δ)B∈(x+Y)∩(1+δ)B satisfies z∈(1+δ)B∈(1+δ)B and φi(z)=φi(x)=x′′(φi),φ_i(z)=φ_i(x)=x^''(φ_i), so it suffices to show that the intersection is nonempty.
Assume for contradiction that it is empty. Then dist⁡(x,Y)≥1+δdist(x,Y)≥1+δ and by the Hahn–Banach theorem there exists a linear form φ∈X′φ^' such that φ|Y=0,φ(x)≥1+δφ|_Y=0,φ(x)≥1+δ and ‖φ‖X′=1.φ_X^'=1. Then φ∈span⁡φ1,…,φnφ∈span{φ_1,…,φ_n}[1] and therefore
1+δ≤φ(x)=x′′(φ)≤‖φ‖X′‖x′′‖X′′≤1,1+δ≤φ(x)=x^''(φ)≤φ_X^'x^''_X^''≤1,
which is a contradiction.

Proof of theorem[edit]
Fix x′′∈B′′,^''^'', φ1,…,φn∈X′φ_1,…,φ_n^' and ϵ>0.ϵ>0. Examine the set
U:=y′′∈X′′:|(x′′−y′′)(φi)|<ϵ,1≤i≤n.:={y^''^'':|(x^''-y^'')(φ_i)|<ϵ,1}.
Let J:X→X′′:X^'' be the embedding defined by J(x)=Evx,(x)=Ev_x, where Evx(φ)=φ(x)Ev_x(φ)=φ(x) is the evaluation at x map. Sets of the form U form a base for the weak* topology,[2] so density follows once it is shown J(B)∩U≠∅(B)≠∅ for all such U.. The lemma above says that for any δ>0δ>0 there exists a x∈(1+δ)B∈(1+δ)B such that x′′(φi)=φi(x),^''(φ_i)=φ_i(x), 1≤i≤n,1, and in particular Evx∈U.Ev_x.  Since J(B)⊂B′′,(B)^'', we have Evx∈(1+δ)J(B)∩U.Ev_x∈(1+δ)J(B). We can scale to get 11+δEvx∈J(B).1/1+δEv_x(B). The goal is to show that for a sufficiently small δ>0,δ>0, we have 11+δEvx∈J(B)∩U.1/1+δEv_x(B).
Directly checking, one has
|[x′′−11+δEvx](φi)|=|φi(x)−11+δφi(x)|=δ1+δ|φi(x)|.|[x^''-1/1+δEv_x](φ_i)|=|φ_i(x)-1/1+δφ_i(x)|=δ/1+δ|φ_i(x)|.
Note that one can choose M sufficiently large so that ‖φi‖X′≤Mφ_i_X^' for 1≤i≤n.1.[3] Note as well that ‖x‖X≤(1+δ).x_X≤(1+δ). If one chooses δδ so that δM<ϵ,<ϵ, then
δ1+δ|φi(x)|≤δ1+δ‖φi‖X′‖x‖X≤δ‖φi‖X′≤δM<ϵ.δ/1+δ|φ_i(x)|≤δ/1+δφ_i_X^'x_X≤δφ_i_X^'≤<ϵ.
Hence one gets 11+δEvx∈J(B)∩U1/1+δEv_x(B) as desired.
