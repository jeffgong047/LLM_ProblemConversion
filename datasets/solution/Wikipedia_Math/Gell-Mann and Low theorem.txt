Theorem concerning quantum field theory ground states
In quantum field theory, the Gell-Mann and Low theorem is a mathematical statement that allows one to relate the ground (or vacuum) state of an interacting system to the ground state of the corresponding non-interacting theory. It was proved in 1951 by Murray Gell-Mann and Francis E. Low. The theorem is useful because, among other things, by relating the ground state of the interacting theory to its non-interacting ground state, it allows one to express Green's functions (which are defined as expectation values of Heisenberg-picture fields in the interacting vacuum) as expectation values of interaction picture fields in the non-interacting vacuum. While typically applied to the ground state, the Gell-Mann and Low theorem applies to any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Its proof relies on the concept of starting with a non-interacting Hamiltonian and adiabatically switching on the interactions.


History[edit]
The theorem was proved first by Gell-Mann and Low in 1951, making use of the Dyson series.[1] In 1969, Klaus Hepp provided an alternative derivation for the case where the original Hamiltonian describes free particles and the interaction is norm bounded.[2] In 1989, G. Nenciu and G. Rasche proved it using the adiabatic theorem.[3] A proof that does not rely on the Dyson expansion was given in 2007 by Luca Guido Molinari.[4]

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let |Ψ0⟩|Ψ_0⟩ be an eigenstate of H0_0 with energy E0_0 and let the 'interacting' Hamiltonian be H=H0+gV=H_0+gV, where g is a coupling constant and V the interaction term. We define a Hamiltonian Hϵ=H0+e−ϵ|t|gV_ϵ=H_0+e^-ϵ|t|gV which effectively interpolates between H and H0_0 in the limit ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ and |t|→∞|t|→∞. Let UϵI_ denote the evolution operator in the interaction picture. The Gell-Mann and Low theorem asserts that if the limit as ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ of 

|Ψϵ(±)⟩=UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩|Ψ_ϵ^(±)⟩=U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩/⟨Ψ_0|U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩
exists, then |Ψϵ(±)⟩|Ψ_ϵ^(±)⟩ are eigenstates of H.
Note that when applied to, say, the ground-state, the theorem does not guarantee that the evolved state will be a ground state. In other words, level crossing is not excluded.

Proof[edit]
As in the original paper, the theorem is typically proved making use of Dyson's expansion of the evolution operator. Its validity however extends beyond the scope of perturbation theory as has been demonstrated by Molinari. We follow Molinari's method here. Focus on Hϵ_ϵ and let g=eϵθ=e^ϵθ. From Schrödinger's equation for the time-evolution operator 

iℏ∂t1Uϵ(t1,t2)=Hϵ(t1)Uϵ(t1,t2)ħ∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=H_ϵ(t_1)U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)
and the boundary condition Uϵ(t2,t2)=1_ϵ(t_2,t_2)=1 we can formally write

Uϵ(t1,t2)=1+1iℏ∫t2t1dt′(H0+eϵ(θ−|t′|)V)Uϵ(t′,t2)._ϵ(t_1,t_2)=1+1/iħ∫_t_2^t_1dt'(H_0+e^ϵ(θ-|t'|)V)U_ϵ(t',t_2).
Focus for the moment on the case 0≥t1≥t20_1_2. Through a change of variables τ=t′+θτ=t'+θ we can write 

Uϵ(t1,t2)=1+1iℏ∫θ+t2θ+t1dτ(H0+eϵτV)Uϵ(τ−θ,t2)._ϵ(t_1,t_2)=1+1/iħ∫_θ+t_2^θ+t_1dτ(H_0+e^ϵτV)U_ϵ(τ-θ,t_2).
We therefore have that

∂θUϵ(t1,t2)=ϵg∂gUϵ(t1,t2)=∂t1Uϵ(t1,t2)+∂t2Uϵ(t1,t2).∂_θU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=∂_gU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)+∂_t_2U_ϵ(t_1,t_2).
This result can be combined with the Schrödinger equation and its adjoint

−iℏ∂t1Uϵ(t2,t1)=Uϵ(t2,t1)Hϵ(t1)-iħ∂_t_1U_ϵ(t_2,t_1)=U_ϵ(t_2,t_1)H_ϵ(t_1)
to obtain 

iℏϵg∂gUϵ(t1,t2)=Hϵ(t1)Uϵ(t1,t2)−Uϵ(t1,t2)Hϵ(t2).ħ∂_gU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)=H_ϵ(t_1)U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)-U_ϵ(t_1,t_2)H_ϵ(t_2).
The corresponding equation between HϵI,UϵI_,U_ is the same. It can be obtained by pre-multiplying both sides with eiH0t1/ℏ^iH_0t_1/ħ, post-multiplying with eiH0t2/ℏ^iH_0t_2/ħ and making use of 

UϵI(t1,t2)=eiH0t1/ℏUϵ(t1,t2)e−iH0t2/ℏ._(t_1,t_2)=e^iH_0t_1/ħU_ϵ(t_1,t_2)e^-iH_0t_2/ħ.
The other case we are interested in, namely t2≥t1≥0_2_1≥0 can be treated in an analogous fashion
and yields an additional minus sign in front of the commutator (we are not concerned here with the case where
t1,2_1,2 have mixed signs). In summary, we obtain

(Hϵ,t=0−E0±iℏϵg∂g)UϵI(0,±∞)|Ψ0⟩=0.(H_ϵ,t=0-E_0ħ∂_g)U_(0,±∞)|Ψ_0⟩=0.
We proceed for the negative-times case. Abbreviating the various operators for clarity 

iℏϵg∂g(U|Ψ0⟩)=(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩.ħ∂_g(U|Ψ_0⟩)=(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩.
Now using the definition of ΨϵΨ_ϵ we differentiate and eliminate derivatives ∂g(U|Ψ0⟩)∂_g(U|Ψ_0⟩) using the above expression, finding

iℏϵg∂g|Ψϵ⟩=1⟨Ψ0|U|Ψ0⟩(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩−U|Ψ0⟩⟨Ψ0|U|Ψ0⟩2⟨Ψ0|(Hϵ−E0)U|Ψ0⟩=(Hϵ−E0)|Ψϵ⟩−|Ψϵ⟩⟨Ψ0|Hϵ−E0|Ψϵ⟩=[Hϵ−E]|Ψϵ⟩.iħ∂_g|Ψ_ϵ⟩   =1/⟨Ψ_0|U|Ψ_0⟩(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩-U|Ψ_0⟩/⟨Ψ_0|U|Ψ_0⟩^2⟨Ψ_0|(H_ϵ-E_0)U|Ψ_0⟩
   =(H_ϵ-E_0)|Ψ_ϵ⟩-|Ψ_ϵ⟩⟨Ψ_0|H_ϵ-E_0|Ψ_ϵ⟩
   =[H_ϵ-E]|Ψ_ϵ⟩.
where E=E0+⟨Ψ0|Hϵ−H0|Ψϵ⟩=E_0+⟨Ψ_0|H_ϵ-H_0|Ψ_ϵ⟩. We can now let ϵ→0+ϵ→0^+ as by assumption the g∂g|Ψϵ⟩∂_g|Ψ_ϵ⟩ in left hand side is finite. We then clearly see that |Ψϵ⟩|Ψ_ϵ⟩ is an eigenstate of H and the proof is complete.
