Geometry theorem relating the line segments created by intersecting chords in a circle
|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD||AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|
|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|=(r+d)⋅(r−d)=r2−d2   |AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|
=   (r+d)·(r-d)=r^2-d^2

In Euclidean geometry, the intersecting chords theorem, or just the chord theorem, is a statement that describes a relation of the four line segments created by two intersecting chords within a circle. 
It states that the products of the lengths of the line segments on each chord are equal. 
It is Proposition 35 of Book 3 of Euclid's Elements. 
More precisely, for two chords AC and BD intersecting in a point S the following equation holds:
|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD||AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|
The converse is true as well, that is if for two line segments AC and BD intersecting in S the equation above holds true, then their four endpoints A, B, C, D lie on a common circle. Or in other words, if the diagonals of a quadrilateral ABCD intersect in S and fulfill the equation above, then it is a cyclic quadrilateral.
The value of the two products in the chord theorem depends only on the distance of the intersection point S from the circle's center and is called the absolute value of the power of S; more precisely, it can be stated that:
|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|=r2−d2|AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|=r^2-d^2
where r is the radius of the circle, and d is the distance between the center of the circle and the intersection point S. This property follows directly from applying the chord theorem to a third chord going through S and the circle's center M (see drawing).
The theorem can be proven using similar triangles (via the inscribed-angle theorem). Consider the angles of the triangles △ASD and △BSC:
∠ADS=∠BCS(inscribedanglesoverAB)∠DAS=∠CBS(inscribedanglesoverCD)∠ASD=∠BSC(opposingangles)   = (inscribedanglesoverAB)
   = (inscribedanglesoverCD)
   = (opposingangles)  
This means the triangles △ASD and △BSC are similar and therefore
ASSD=BSSC⇔|AS|⋅|SC|=|BS|⋅|SD|AS/SD=BS/SC⇔|AS|·|SC|=|BS|·|SD|
Next to the tangent-secant theorem and the intersecting secants theorem the intersecting chords theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle - the power of point theorem.
