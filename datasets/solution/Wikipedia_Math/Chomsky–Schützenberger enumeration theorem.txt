In formal language theory, the Chomsky–Schützenberger enumeration theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about the number of words of a given length generated by an unambiguous context-free grammar. The theorem provides an unexpected link between the theory of formal languages and abstract algebra.


Statement[edit]
In order to state the theorem, a few notions from algebra and formal language theory are needed.
Let Nℕ denote the set of nonnegative integers. A power series over Nℕ is an infinite series of the form

f=f(x)=∑k=0∞akxk=a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+⋯=f(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k=a_0+a_1x^1+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+⋯
with coefficients ak_k in Nℕ. The multiplication of two formal power series f and g is defined in the expected way as the convolution of the sequences an_n and bn_n:

f(x)⋅g(x)=∑k=0∞(∑i=0kaibk−i)xk.(x)(x)=∑_k=0^∞(∑_i=0^ka_ib_k-i)x^k.
In particular, we write f2=f(x)⋅f(x)^2=f(x)(x), f3=f(x)⋅f(x)⋅f(x)^3=f(x)(x)(x), and so on. In analogy to algebraic numbers, a power series f(x)(x) is called algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x), if there exists a finite set of polynomials p0(x),p1(x),p2(x),…,pn(x)_0(x),p_1(x),p_2(x),…,p_n(x) each with rational coefficients such that

p0(x)+p1(x)⋅f+p2(x)⋅f2+⋯+pn(x)⋅fn=0._0(x)+p_1(x)+p_2(x)^2+⋯+p_n(x)^n=0.
A context-free grammar is said to be unambiguous if every string generated by the grammar admits a unique parse tree 
or, equivalently, only one leftmost derivation.
Having established the necessary notions, the theorem is stated as follows. 

Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. If L is a context-free language admitting an unambiguous context-free grammar, and ak:=|L∩Σk|_k:=|L
capΣ^k| is the number of words of length k in L, then G(x)=∑k=0∞akxk(x)=∑_k=0^∞a_kx^k is a power series over Nℕ that is algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x).
Proofs of this theorem are given by Kuich & Salomaa (1985), and by Panholzer (2005).

Usage[edit]
Asymptotic estimates[edit]
The theorem can be used in analytic combinatorics to estimate the number of words of length n generated by a given unambiguous context-free grammar, as n grows large. The following example is given by Gruber, Lee & Shallit (2012): the unambiguous context-free grammar G over the alphabet {0,1} has start symbol S and the following rules

S → M | U
M → 0M1M | ε
U → 0S | 0M1U.
To obtain an algebraic representation of the power series G(x)(x) associated with a given context-free grammar G, one transforms the grammar into a system of equations. This is achieved by replacing each occurrence of a terminal symbol by x, each occurrence of ε by the integer '1', each occurrence of '→' by '=', and each occurrence of '|' by '+', respectively. The operation of concatenation at the right-hand-side of each rule corresponds to the multiplication operation in the equations thus obtained. This yields the following system of equations:

S = M + U
M = M²x² + 1
U = Sx + MUx²
In this system of equations, S, M, and U are functions of x, so one could also write S(x)(x), M(x)(x), and U(x)(x). The equation system can be resolved after S, resulting in a single algebraic equation:

x(2x−1)S2+(2x−1)S+1=0(2x-1)S^2+(2x-1)S+1=0.
This quadratic equation has two solutions for S, one of which is the algebraic power series G(x)(x). By applying methods from complex analysis to this equation, the number an_n of words of length n generated by G can be estimated, as n grows large. In this case, one obtains
an∈O(2+ϵ)n_n(2+ϵ)^n but an∉O(2−ϵ)n_n(2-ϵ)^n for each ϵ>0ϵ>0.[1]
The following example is from Bassino & Nicaud (2011):S→XYT→aT|TbT|YcYY→YaY|cY|abTaYYa|XX→a|b|c⇒s(z)=x(z)y(z)t(z)=zt(z)+zt(z)2+zy(z)2y(z)=zy(z)2+zy(z)+z4t(z)y(z)2+x(z)x(z)=3z{[              S;      T|TbT|YcY; Y|cY|abTaYYa|X;          X|b|c ]⇒{[                         s(z)=x(z)y(z);            t(z)=zt(z)+zt(z)^2+zy(z)^2; y(z)=zy(z)^2+zy(z)+z^4t(z)y(z)^2+x(z);                               x(z)=3z ]..which simplifies tos(z)8−27(z3−z2)s(z)5+…+59049z10=0(z)^8-27(z^3-z^2)s(z)^5+…+59049z^10=0

Inherent ambiguity[edit]
In classical formal language theory, the theorem can be used to prove that certain context-free languages are inherently ambiguous.
For example, the  Goldstine language LG_G over the alphabet a,b{a,b} consists of the words
an1ban2b⋯anpb^n_1ba^n_2b^n_pb
with p≥1≥1, ni>0_i>0 for i∈1,2,…,p∈{1,2,…,p}, and nj≠j_j for some j∈1,2,…,p∈{1,2,…,p}.
It is comparably easy to show that the language LG_G is context-free.[2] The harder part is to show that there does not exist an unambiguous grammar that generates LG_G. This can be proved as follows:
If gk_k denotes the number of words of length k in LG_G, then for the associated power series holds
G(x)=∑k=0∞gkxk=1−x1−2x−1x∑k≥1xk(k+1)/2−1(x)=∑_k=0^∞g_kx^k=1-x/1-2x-1/x∑_k≥1x^k(k+1)/2-1.
Using methods from complex analysis, one can prove that this function is not algebraic over Q(x)ℚ(x). By the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, one can conclude that LG_G does not admit an unambiguous context-free grammar.[3]
