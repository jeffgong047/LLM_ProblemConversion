In mathematics, the Caristi fixed-point theorem (also known as the Caristi–Kirk fixed-point theorem) generalizes the Banach fixed-point theorem for maps of a complete metric space into itself. Caristi's fixed-point theorem modifies the εε-variational principle of Ekeland (1974, 1979).[1][2] The conclusion of Caristi's theorem is equivalent to metric completeness, as proved by Weston (1977).[3] 
The original result is due to the mathematicians James Caristi and William Arthur Kirk.[4]
Caristi fixed-point theorem can be applied to derive other classical fixed-point results, and also to prove the existence of bounded solutions of a functional equation.[5]

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let (X,d)(X,d) be a complete metric space. Let T:X→X:X and f:X→[0,+∞):X→[0,+∞) be a lower semicontinuous function from X into the non-negative real numbers. Suppose that, for all points x in X,,
d(x,T(x))≤f(x)−f(T(x)).(x,T(x))(x)-f(T(x)).
Then T has a fixed point in X;; that is, a point x0_0 such that T(x0)=x0.(x_0)=x_0. The proof of this result utilizes Zorn's lemma to guarantee the existence of a minimal element which turns out to be a desired fixed point.[6]
