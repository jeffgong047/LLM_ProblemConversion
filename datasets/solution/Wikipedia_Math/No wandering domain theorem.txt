Mathematical theorem
In mathematics, the no-wandering-domain theorem is a result on dynamical systems, proven by Dennis Sullivan in 1985.
The theorem states that a rational map f : Ĉ → Ĉ with deg(f) ≥ 2 does not have a wandering domain, where Ĉ denotes the Riemann sphere.   More precisely, for every component U in the Fatou set of f,  the sequence

U,f(U),f(f(U)),…,fn(U),…,f(U),f(f(U)),…,f^n(U),…
will eventually become periodic.  Here, f n denotes the n-fold iteration of f, that is,

fn=f∘f∘⋯∘f⏟n.^n=f∘⋯_n.
This image illustrates the dynamics of f(z)=z+2πsin⁡(z)(z)=z+2πsin(z); the Fatou set (consisting entirely of wandering domains) is shown in white, while the Julia set is shown in tones of gray.
The theorem does not hold for arbitrary maps; for example, the transcendental map f(z)=z+2πsin⁡(z)(z)=z+2πsin(z) has wandering domains. However, the result can be generalized to many situations where the functions naturally belong to a finite-dimensional parameter space, most notably to transcendental entire and meromorphic functions with a finite number of singular values.
