Theorem in mathematical analysis
In mathematics, Sard's theorem, also known as Sard's lemma or the Morse–Sard theorem, is a result in mathematical analysis that asserts that the set of critical values (that is, the image of the set of critical points) of a smooth function f from one Euclidean space or manifold to another is a null set, i.e., it has Lebesgue measure 0. This makes the set of critical values "small" in the sense of a generic property. The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard.


Statement[edit]
More explicitly,[1] let

f:Rn→Rmℝ^n→ℝ^m
be Ck^k, (that is, k times continuously differentiable), where k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1}. Let X⊂Rn⊂ℝ^n denote the critical set of f,, which is the set of points x∈Rn∈ℝ^n at which the Jacobian matrix of f has rank <m<m.  Then the image f(X)(X) has Lebesgue measure 0 in Rmℝ^m.
Intuitively speaking, this means that although X may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while f may have many critical points in the domain Rnℝ^n, it must have few critical values in the image Rmℝ^m.
More generally, the result also holds for mappings between differentiable manifolds M and N of dimensions m and n, respectively. The critical set X of a Ck^k function 

f:N→M:N
consists of those points at which the differential

df:TN→TM:TN
has rank less than m as a linear transformation. If k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1}, then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of X has measure zero as a subset of M.  This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches.  The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism.

Variants[edit]
There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case m=1=1 was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939,[2] and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942.[1]
A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale.[3]
The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and some applications in Morse theory — in order to prove the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has at least one regular value”.
In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if f:N→M:N is Ck^k for k≥maxn−m+1,1≥max{n-m+1,1} and if Ar⊆N_r is the set of points x∈N such that dfx_x has rank strictly less than r, then the r-dimensional Hausdorff measure of f(Ar)(A_r) is zero.[4] In particular the Hausdorff dimension of f(Ar)(A_r) is at most r. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of f(Ar)(A_r) can be arbitrarily close to r.[5]
