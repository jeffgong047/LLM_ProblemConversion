In mathematics, Wedderburn's little theorem states that every finite division ring is a field. In other words, for finite rings, there is no distinction between domains, division rings and fields.
The Artin–Zorn theorem generalizes the theorem to alternative rings: every finite alternative division ring is a field.[1]


History[edit]
The original proof was given by Joseph Wedderburn in 1905,[2] who went on to prove it two other ways. Another proof was given by Leonard Eugene Dickson shortly after Wedderburn's original proof, and Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. However, as noted in (Parshall 1983), Wedderburn's first proof was incorrect – it had a gap – and his subsequent proofs appeared only after he had read Dickson's correct proof. On this basis, Parshall argues that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.
A simplified version of the proof was later given by Ernst Witt.[2] Witt's proof is sketched below. Alternatively, the theorem is a consequence of the Skolem–Noether theorem by the following argument.[3] Let D be a finite division algebra with center k. Let [D:k]=n2[D:k]=n^2 and q denote the cardinality of k. Every maximal subfield of D has qn^n elements; so they are isomorphic and thus are conjugate by Skolem–Noether. But a finite group (the multiplicative group of D in our case) cannot be a union of conjugates of a proper subgroup; hence, n=1=1.
A later "group-theoretic" proof was given by Ted Kaczynski in 1964.[4]  This proof, Kaczynski's first published piece of mathematical writing, was a short, two-page note which also acknowledged the earlier historical proofs.

Relationship to the Brauer group of a finite field[edit]
The theorem is essentially equivalent to saying that the Brauer group of a finite field is trivial. In fact, this characterization immediately yields a proof of the theorem as follows: let k be a finite field. Since the Herbrand quotient vanishes by finiteness, Br⁡(k)=H2(kal/k)Br(k)=H^2(k^al/k) coincides with H1(kal/k)^1(k^al/k), which in turn vanishes by Hilbert 90.

Proof[edit]
Let A  be a finite domain. For each nonzero x in A, the two maps

a↦ax,a↦xa:A→A,a:A
are injective by the cancellation property, and thus, surjective by counting. It follows from the elementary group theory[5]  that the nonzero elements of A form a group under multiplication. Thus, A is a skew-field.
To prove that every finite skew-field is a field, we use strong induction on the size of the skew-field. Thus, let A be a skew-field, and assume that all skew-fields that are proper subsets of A are fields. Since the center Z(A)(A) of A  is a field,  A is a vector space over Z(A)(A) with finite dimension n.  Our objective is then to show  n=1=1. If q is the order of Z(A)(A), then A has order qnq^n. Note that because Z(A)(A) contains the distinct elements 00 and 11, q>1>1. For each x in A that is not in the center, the centralizer ZxZ_x of x is clearly a skew-field and thus a field, by the induction hypothesis, and because ZxZ_x can be viewed as a vector space over Z(A)(A) and A can be viewed as a vector space over ZxZ_x, we have that ZxZ_x has order qdq^d where d divides n and is less than n. Viewing Z(A)∗Z(A)^*, A∗^*, and the Zx∗Z_x^*   as groups under multiplication, we can write the class equation

qn−1=q−1+∑qn−1qd−1^n-1=q-1+∑q^n-1^d-1
where the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes not contained within Z(A)∗Z(A)^*, and the d are defined so that for each conjugacy class, the order of Zx∗Z_x^* for any x in the class is qd−1q^d-1. qn−1q^n-1 and qd−1^d-1 both admit polynomial factorization in terms of cyclotomic polynomials

Φf(q).Φ_f(q).
In the polynomial identities

xn−1=∏m|nΦm(x)^n-1=∏_m|nΦ_m(x) and xd−1=∏m|dΦm(x)^d-1=∏_m|dΦ_m(x),
we set x=q=q. Because each d is a proper divisor of n,

Φn(q)Φ_n(q) divides both qn−1q^n-1 and each qn−1qd−1q^n-1^d-1,
so by the above class equation Φn(q)Φ_n(q) must divide q−1-1, and therefore

|Φn(q)|≤q−1.|Φ_n(q)|≦-1.
To see that this forces n to be 11, we will show

|Φn(q)|>q−1|Φ_n(q)|>q-1
for n>1>1 using factorization over the complex numbers. In the polynomial identity

Φn(x)=∏(x−ζ),Φ_n(x)=∏(x-ζ),
where ζζ runs over the primitive n-th roots of unity, set x to be q and then take absolute values

|Φn(q)|=∏|q−ζ|.|Φ_n(q)|=∏|q-ζ|.
For n>1>1, we see that for each primitive n-th root of unity ζζ,

|q−ζ|>|q−1||q-ζ|>|q-1|
because of the location of q, 11, and ζζ in the complex plane. Thus

|Φn(q)|>q−1.|Φ_n(q)|>q-1.
