In mathematics, the Freidlin–Wentzell theorem (due to Mark Freidlin and Alexander D. Wentzell) is a result in the large deviations theory of stochastic processes.  Roughly speaking, the Freidlin–Wentzell theorem gives an estimate for the probability that a (scaled-down) sample path of an Itō diffusion will stray far from the mean path.  This statement is made precise using rate functions.  The Freidlin–Wentzell theorem generalizes Schilder's theorem for standard Brownian motion.

Statement[edit]
Let B be a standard Brownian motion on Rd starting at the origin, 0 ∈ Rd, and let Xε be an Rd-valued Itō diffusion solving an Itō stochastic differential equation of the form

dXtε=b(Xtε)dt+εdBt,X0ε=0,dX_t^ε=b(X_t^ε) dt+√(ε) dB_t,
X_0^ε=0,
where the drift vector field b : Rd → Rd is uniformly Lipschitz continuous.  Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) equipped with the supremum norm ||·||∞, the family of processes (Xε)ε>0 satisfies the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 → R ∪ {+∞} given by

I(ω)=12∫0T|ω˙t−b(ωt)|2dt(ω)=1/2∫_0^T|ω̇_t-b(ω_t)|^2 dt
if ω lies in the Sobolev space H1([0, T]; Rd), and I(ω) = +∞ otherwise.  In other words, for every open set G ⊆ C0 and every closed set F ⊆ C0,

limsupε↓0(εlog⁡P[Xε∈F])≤−infω∈FI(ω)lim sup_ε↓0(εlog𝐏[X^ε])≤-inf_ωI(ω)
and

liminfε↓0(εlog⁡P[Xε∈G])≥−infω∈GI(ω).lim inf_ε↓0(εlog𝐏[X^ε])≥-inf_ωI(ω).
