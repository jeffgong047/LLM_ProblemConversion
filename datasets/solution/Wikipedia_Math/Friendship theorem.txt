The friendship graphs F2, F3 and F4.
In the mathematical field of graph theory, the friendship graph (or Dutch windmill graph or n-fan) Fn is a planar, undirected graph with 2n + 1 vertices and 3n edges.[1]
The friendship graph Fn can be constructed by joining n copies of the cycle graph C3 with a common vertex, which becomes a universal vertex for the graph.[2]
By construction, the friendship graph Fn is isomorphic to the windmill graph Wd(3, n). It is unit distance with girth 3, diameter 2 and radius 1. The graph F2 is isomorphic to the butterfly graph. Friendship graphs are generalized by the triangular cactus graphs.


Friendship theorem[edit]
The friendship theorem of Paul Erdős, Alfréd Rényi, and Vera T. Sós (1966)[3] states that the finite graphs with the property that every two vertices have exactly one neighbor in common are exactly the friendship graphs. Informally, if a group of people has the property that every pair of people has exactly one friend in common, then there must be one person who is a friend to all the others. However, for infinite graphs, there can be many different graphs with the same cardinality that have this property.[4]
A combinatorial proof of the friendship theorem was given by Mertzios and Unger.[5] Another proof was given by Craig Huneke.[6] A formalised proof in Metamath was reported by Alexander van der Vekens in October 2018 on the Metamath mailing list.[7]

Labeling and colouring[edit]
The friendship graph has chromatic number 3 and chromatic index 2n. Its chromatic polynomial can be deduced from the chromatic polynomial of the cycle graph C3 and is equal to 

(x−2)n(x−1)nx(x-2)^n(x-1)^nx.
The friendship graph Fn is edge-graceful if and only if n is odd. It is graceful if and only if n ≡ 0 (mod 4) or n ≡ 1 (mod 4).[8][9]
Every friendship graph is factor-critical.

Extremal graph theory[edit]
According to extremal graph theory, every graph with sufficiently many edges (relative to its number of vertices) must contain a k-fan as a subgraph. More specifically, this is true for an n-vertex graph if the number of edges is

⌊n24⌋+f(k),⌊n^2/4⌋+f(k),
where f(k)(k) is k2−k^2-k if k is odd, and
f(k)(k) is k2−3k/2^2-3k/2 if k is even. These bounds generalize Turán's theorem on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph, and they are the best possible bounds for this problem, in that for any smaller number of edges there exist graphs that do not contain a k-fan.[10]
