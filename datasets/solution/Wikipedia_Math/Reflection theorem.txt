In algebraic number theory, a reflection theorem or Spiegelungssatz (German for reflection theorem – see Spiegel and Satz) is one of a collection of theorems linking the sizes of different ideal class groups (or ray class groups), or the sizes of different isotypic components of a class group.  The original example is due to Ernst Eduard Kummer, who showed that the class number of the cyclotomic field Q(ζp)ℚ(ζ_p), with p a prime number, will be divisible by p if the class number of the maximal real subfield Q(ζp)+ℚ(ζ_p)^+ is.  Another example is due to Scholz.[1]  A simplified version of his theorem states that if 3 divides the class number of a real quadratic field Q(d)ℚ(√(d)), then 3 also divides the class number of the imaginary quadratic field Q(−3d)ℚ(√(-3d)).

Leopoldt's Spiegelungssatz[edit]
Both of the above results are generalized by Leopoldt's "Spiegelungssatz", which relates the p-ranks of different isotypic components of the class group of a number field considered as a module over the Galois group of a Galois extension.
Let L/K be a finite Galois extension of number fields, with group G, degree prime to p and L containing the p-th roots of unity.  Let A be the p-Sylow subgroup of the class group of L.  Let φ run over the irreducible characters of the group ring Qp[G] and let Aφ denote the corresponding direct summands of A.  For any φ let q = pφ(1) and let the G-rank eφ be the exponent in the index

[Aϕ:Aϕp]=qeϕ.[A_ϕ:A_ϕ^p]=q^e_ϕ.
Let ω be the character of G

ζg=ζω(g)forζ∈μp.ζ^g=ζ^ω(g)forζ∈μ_p.
The reflection (Spiegelung) φ* is defined by

ϕ∗(g)=ω(g)ϕ(g−1).ϕ^*(g)=ω(g)ϕ(g^-1).
Let E be the unit group of K.  We say that ε is "primary" if K(ϵp)/K(√(ϵ))/K is unramified, and let E0 denote the group of primary units modulo Ep.  Let δφ denote the G-rank of the φ component of E0.
The Spiegelungssatz states that

|eϕ∗−eϕ|≤δϕ.|e_ϕ^*-e_ϕ|≤δ_ϕ.
Extensions[edit]
Extensions of this Spiegelungssatz were given by Oriat and Oriat-Satge, where class groups were no longer associated with characters of the Galois group of K/k, but rather by ideals in a group ring over the Galois group of K/k.  Leopoldt's Spiegelungssatz was generalized in a different direction by Kuroda, who extended it to a statement about ray class groups.  This was further developed into the very general "T-S reflection theorem" of Georges Gras.[2] Kenkichi Iwasawa also provided an Iwasawa-theoretic reflection theorem.
