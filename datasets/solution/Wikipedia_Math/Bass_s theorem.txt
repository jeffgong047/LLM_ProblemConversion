In geometric group theory, Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, first proved by Mikhail Gromov,[1] characterizes finitely generated groups of polynomial growth, as those groups which have nilpotent subgroups of finite index.


Statement[edit]
The growth rate of a group is a well-defined notion from asymptotic analysis. To say that a finitely generated group has polynomial growth means the number of elements of length (relative to a symmetric generating set) at most n is bounded above by a polynomial function p(n). The order of growth is then the least degree of any such polynomial function p.
A nilpotent group G is a group with a lower central series terminating in the identity subgroup.
Gromov's theorem states that a finitely generated group has polynomial growth if and only if it has a nilpotent subgroup that is of finite index.

Growth rates of nilpotent groups[edit]
There is a vast literature on growth rates, leading up to Gromov's theorem. An earlier result of Joseph A. Wolf[2] showed that if G is a finitely generated nilpotent group, then the group has polynomial growth. Yves Guivarc'h[3] and independently Hyman Bass[4] (with different proofs) computed the exact order of polynomial growth. Let G be a finitely generated nilpotent group with lower central series

G=G1⊇G2⊇⋯.=G_1_2⊇⋯.
In particular, the quotient group Gk/Gk+1 is a finitely generated abelian group.
The Bass–Guivarc'h formula states that the order of polynomial growth of G is

d(G)=∑k≥1krank⁡(Gk/Gk+1)(G)=∑_k≥1krank(G_k/G_k+1)
where:

rank denotes the rank of an abelian group, i.e. the largest number of independent and torsion-free elements of the abelian group.
In particular, Gromov's theorem and the Bass–Guivarc'h formula imply that the order of polynomial growth of a finitely generated group is always either an integer or infinity (excluding for example, fractional powers).
Another nice application of Gromov's theorem and the Bass–Guivarch formula is to the quasi-isometric rigidity of finitely generated abelian groups: any group which is quasi-isometric to a finitely generated abelian group contains a free abelian group of finite index.

Proofs of Gromov's theorem[edit]
In order to prove this theorem Gromov introduced a convergence for metric spaces. This convergence, now called  the Gromov–Hausdorff convergence, is currently widely used in geometry.
A relatively simple proof of the theorem was found by Bruce Kleiner.[5] Later, Terence Tao and Yehuda Shalom modified Kleiner's proof to make an essentially elementary proof as well as a version of the theorem with explicit bounds.[6][7] Gromov's theorem also follows from the classification of approximate groups obtained by Breuillard, Green and Tao. A simple and concise proof based on functional analytic methods is given by Ozawa.[8]

The gap conjecture[edit]
Beyond Gromov's theorem one can ask whether there exists a gap in the growth spectrum for finitely generated group just above polynomial growth, separating virtually nilpotent groups from others. Formally, this means that there would exist a function f:N→N:ℕ→ℕ such that a finitely generated group is virtually nilpotent if and only if its growth function is an O(f(n))(f(n)). Such a theorem was obtained by Shalom and Tao, with an explicit function nlog⁡log⁡(n)c^loglog(n)^c for some c>0>0. All known groups with intermediate growth (i.e. both superpolynomial and subexponential) are essentially generalizations of Grigorchuk's group, and have faster growth functions; so all known groups have growth faster than enα^n^α, with α=log⁡(2)/log⁡(2/η)≈0.767α=log(2)/log(2/η)≈0.767, where ηη is the real root of the polynomial x3+x2+x−2^3+x^2+x-2.[9]
It is conjectured that the true lower bound on growth rates of groups with intermediate growth is en^√(n).  This is known as the Gap conjecture.[10]
