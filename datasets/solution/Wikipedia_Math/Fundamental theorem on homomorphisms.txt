Theorem relating a group with the image and kernel of a homomorphism
In abstract algebra, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms, also known as the fundamental homomorphism theorem, or the first isomorphism theorem, relates the structure of two objects between which a homomorphism is given, and of the kernel and image of the homomorphism.
The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the isomorphism theorems.


Group theoretic version[edit]
Diagram of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms where f is a homomorphism, N is a normal subgroup of G and e is the identity element of G.
Given two groups G and H and a group homomorphism f : G → H,  let N be a normal subgroup in G and φ the natural surjective homomorphism G → G/N (where G/N is the quotient group of G by N). If N is a subset of ker(f) then there exists a unique homomorphism h: G/N → H such that f = h∘φ.
In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on G that map N to the identity element.
The situation is described by the following commutative diagram:


h is injective if and only if N = ker(f). Therefore, by setting N = ker(f) we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem.
We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as "every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group".

Proof[edit]
The proof follows from two basic facts about homomorphisms, namely their preservation of the group operation, and their mapping of the identity element to the identity element. We need to show that if ϕ:G→Hϕ:G is a homomorphism of groups, then: im(ϕ)im(ϕ) is a subgroup of H.G/ker⁡(ϕ)/(ϕ) is isomorphic to im(ϕ)im(ϕ).

Proof of 1[edit]
The operation that is preserved by ϕϕ is the group operation. If a,b∈im(ϕ),b∈im(ϕ), then there exist elements a′,b′∈G',b' such that ϕ(a′)=aϕ(a')=a and ϕ(b′)=bϕ(b')=b. For these a and b, we have ab=ϕ(a′)ϕ(b′)=ϕ(a′b′)∈im(ϕ)=ϕ(a')ϕ(b')=ϕ(a'b')∈im(ϕ) (since ϕϕ preserves the group operation), and thus, the closure property is satisfied in im(ϕ)im(ϕ). The identity element e∈H is also in im(ϕ)im(ϕ) because ϕϕ maps the identity element of G to it. Since every element a′' in G has an inverse (a′)−1(a')^-1such that ϕ((a′)−1)=(ϕ(a′))−1ϕ((a')^-1)=(ϕ(a'))^-1 (because ϕϕ preserves the inverse property as well), we have an inverse for each element ϕ(a′)=aϕ(a')=a in im(ϕ)im(ϕ), therefore, im(ϕ)im(ϕ) is a subgroup of H.  

Proof of 2[edit]
Construct a map ψ:G/ker⁡(ϕ)→im(ϕ)ψ:G/(ϕ)→im(ϕ) by ψ(aker⁡(ϕ))=ϕ(a)ψ(a(ϕ))=ϕ(a). This map is well-defined, as if aker⁡(ϕ)=bker⁡(ϕ)(ϕ)=b(ϕ), then b−1a∈ker⁡(ϕ)^-1a∈(ϕ) and so ϕ(b−1a)=e⇒ϕ(b−1)ϕ(a)=eϕ(b^-1a)=e⇒ϕ(b^-1)ϕ(a)=e which gives ϕ(a)=ϕ(b)ϕ(a)=ϕ(b). This map is an isomorphism. ψψ is surjective onto im(ϕ)im(ϕ) by definition. To show injectiveness, if ψ(aker⁡(ϕ))=ψ(bker⁡(ϕ))ψ(a(ϕ))=ψ(b(ϕ)), then ϕ(a)=ϕ(b)ϕ(a)=ϕ(b), which implies b−1a∈ker⁡(ϕ)^-1a∈(ϕ)
so aker⁡(ϕ)=bker⁡(ϕ)(ϕ)=b(ϕ). 
Finally, ψ((aker⁡(ϕ))(bker⁡(ϕ)))=ψ(abker⁡(ϕ))=ϕ(ab)=ϕ(a)ϕ(b)=ψ(aker⁡(ϕ))ψ(bker⁡(ϕ))ψ((a(ϕ))(b(ϕ)))=ψ(ab(ϕ))=ϕ(ab)=ϕ(a)ϕ(b)=ψ(a(ϕ))ψ(b(ϕ))hence ψψ preserves the group operation. Hence ψψ is an isomorphism between G/ker⁡(ϕ)/(ϕ) and im(ϕ)im(ϕ), which completes the proof.
