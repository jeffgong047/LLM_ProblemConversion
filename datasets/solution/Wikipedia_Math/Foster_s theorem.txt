This article is about the theorem in Markov probability theory. For the theorem in electrical engineering, see Foster's reactance theorem.
In probability theory, Foster's theorem, named after Gordon Foster,[1] is used to draw conclusions about the positive recurrence of Markov chains with countable state spaces. It uses the fact that positive recurrent Markov chains exhibit a notion of "Lyapunov stability" in terms of returning to any state while starting from it within a finite time interval.

Theorem[edit]
Consider an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain on a countable state space S having a transition probability matrix P with elements pij_ij for pairs i, j in S. Foster's theorem states that the Markov chain is positive recurrent if and only if there exists a Lyapunov function V:S→R:S→ℝ, such that V(i)≥0∀i∈S(i)≥0∀i and

∑j∈SpijV(j)<∞∑_jp_ijV(j)<∞ for i∈F
∑j∈SpijV(j)≤V(i)−ε∑_jp_ijV(j)(i)-ε for all i∉F
for some finite set F and strictly positive εε.[2]
