The Schröder–Bernstein theorem from set theory has analogs in the context operator algebras. This article discusses such operator-algebraic results.


For von Neumann algebras[edit]
Suppose M is a von Neumann algebra and E, F are projections in M. Let ~ denote the Murray-von Neumann equivalence relation on M. Define a partial order « on the family of projections by E « F if E ~ F'  ≤ F. In other words, E « F if there exists a partial isometry U ∈ M such that U*U = E and UU* ≤ F.
For closed subspaces M and N where projections PM and PN, onto M and N respectively, are elements of M, M « N if PM « PN.
The Schröder–Bernstein theorem states that if M « N and N « M, then M ~ N.
A proof, one that is similar to a set-theoretic argument, can be sketched as follows. Colloquially, N « M means that N can be isometrically embedded in M. So

M=M0⊃N0=M_0_0
where N0 is an isometric copy of N in M. By assumption, it is also true that, N, therefore N0, contains an isometric copy M1 of M. Therefore, one can write

M=M0⊃N0⊃M1.=M_0_0_1.
By induction,

M=M0⊃N0⊃M1⊃N1⊃M2⊃N2⊃⋯.=M_0_0_1_1_2_2⊃⋯.
It is clear that

R=∩i≥0Mi=∩i≥0Ni.=∩_i≥0M_i=∩_i≥0N_i.
Let

M⊖N=defM∩(N)⊥.def=M∩(N)^⊥.
So

M=⊕i≥0(Mi⊖Ni)⊕⊕j≥0(Nj⊖Mj+1)⊕R=⊕_i≥0(M_i_i)  ⊕  ⊕_j≥0(N_j_j+1)  
and

N0=⊕i≥1(Mi⊖Ni)⊕⊕j≥0(Nj⊖Mj+1)⊕R._0=⊕_i≥1(M_i_i)  ⊕  ⊕_j≥0(N_j_j+1)  .
Notice

Mi⊖Ni∼M⊖Nforalli._i_i  .
The theorem now follows from the countable additivity of  ~.

Representations of C*-algebras[edit]
There is also an analog of Schröder–Bernstein for representations of C*-algebras. If A is a C*-algebra, a representation of A  is a *-homomorphism φ from A into L(H), the bounded operators on some Hilbert space H.
If there exists a projection P in L(H) where P φ(a) = φ(a) P for every a in A, then a subrepresentation σ of φ can be defined in a natural way: σ(a) is φ(a) restricted to the range of P. So φ then can be expressed as a direct sum of two subrepresentations φ = φ'  ⊕ σ.
Two representations φ1 and φ2, on H1 and H2 respectively, are said to be unitarily equivalent if there exists a unitary operator U: H2 → H1 such that φ1(a)U = Uφ2(a), for every a.
In this setting, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem reads:

If two representations ρ and σ, on Hilbert spaces H and G respectively, are each unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of the other, then they are unitarily equivalent.
A proof that resembles the previous argument can be outlined. The assumption implies that there exist surjective partial isometries from H to G and from G to H. Fix two such partial isometries for the argument. One has

ρ=ρ1≃ρ1′⊕σ1whereσ1≃σ.ρ=ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕σ_1    σ_1≃σ.
In turn,

ρ1≃ρ1′⊕(σ1′⊕ρ2)whereρ2≃ρ.ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕(σ_1'⊕ρ_2)    ρ_2≃ρ.
By induction,

ρ1≃ρ1′⊕σ1′⊕ρ2′⊕σ2′⋯≃(⊕i≥1ρi′)⊕(⊕i≥1σi′),ρ_1≃ρ_1'⊕σ_1'⊕ρ_2'⊕σ_2'⋯≃(⊕_i≥1ρ_i')⊕(⊕_i≥1σ_i'),
and

σ1≃σ1′⊕ρ2′⊕σ2′⋯≃(⊕i≥2ρi′)⊕(⊕i≥1σi′).σ_1≃σ_1'⊕ρ_2'⊕σ_2'⋯≃(⊕_i≥2ρ_i')⊕(⊕_i≥1σ_i').
Now each additional summand in the direct sum expression is obtained using one of the two fixed partial isometries, so

ρi′≃ρj′andσi′≃σj′foralli,j.ρ_i'≃ρ_j'    σ_i'≃σ_j'  ,j .
This proves the theorem.
