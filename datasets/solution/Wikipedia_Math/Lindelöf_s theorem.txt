Not to be confused with Lindelöf's lemma in topology or the Picard–Lindelöf theorem in the study of differential equations.
In mathematics, Lindelöf's theorem is a result in complex analysis named after the Finnish mathematician Ernst Leonard Lindelöf. It states that a holomorphic function on a half-strip in the complex plane that is bounded on the boundary of the strip and does not grow "too fast" in the unbounded direction of the strip must remain bounded on the whole strip. The result is useful in the study of the Riemann zeta function, and is a special case of the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle. Also, see Hadamard three-lines theorem.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let ΩΩ be a half-strip in the complex plane:

Ω=z∈C|x1≤Re(z)≤x2andIm(z)≥y0⊊C.Ω={z∈ℂ|x_1≤Re(z)_2{and
mathrmIm(z)_0}⊊ℂ.
Suppose that f is holomorphic (i.e. analytic) on ΩΩ and that there are constants 
M, A, and B such that

|f(z)|≤Mforallz∈∂Ω|f(z)|{forall∈∂Ω
and

|f(x+iy)|≤ByAforallx+iy∈Ω.|f(x+iy)|^A{forall+iy∈Ω.
Then f is bounded by M on all of ΩΩ:

|f(z)|≤Mforallz∈Ω.|f(z)|{forall∈Ω.
Proof[edit]
Fix a point ξ=σ+iτξ=σ+iτ  inside ΩΩ. Choose λ>−y0λ>-y_0, an integer N>A>A and y1>τ_1>τ large enough such that
By1A(y1+λ)N≤M(y0+λ)NBy_1^A/(y_1+λ)^N≤M/(y_0+λ)^N. Applying maximum modulus principle to the function g(z)=f(z)(z+iλ)N(z)=f(z)/(z+iλ)^N and
the rectangular area z∈C∣x1≤Re(z)≤x2andy0≤Im(z)≤y1{z∈ℂ_1≤Re(z)_2{and_0≤Im(z)_1} we obtain |g(ξ)|≤M(y0+λ)N|g(ξ)|≤M/(y_0+λ)^N, that is, |f(ξ)|≤M(|ξ+λ|y0+λ)N|f(ξ)|(|ξ+λ|/y_0+λ)^N. Letting λ→+∞λ→+∞ yields 
|f(ξ)|≤M|f(ξ)| as required.
