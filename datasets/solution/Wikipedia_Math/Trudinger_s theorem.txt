In mathematical analysis, Trudinger's theorem or the Trudinger inequality (also sometimes called the Moser–Trudinger inequality) is a result of functional analysis on Sobolev spaces. It is named after Neil Trudinger (and Jürgen Moser).
It provides an inequality between a certain Sobolev space norm and an Orlicz space norm of a function. The inequality is a limiting case of Sobolev imbedding and can be stated as the following theorem:
Let ΩΩ be a bounded domain in Rnℝ^n satisfying the cone condition. Let mp=n=n and p>1>1. Set

A(t)=exp⁡(tn/(n−m))−1.(t)=exp(t^n/(n-m))-1.
Then there exists the embedding

Wm,p(Ω)↪LA(Ω)^m,p(Ω)_A(Ω)
where 

LA(Ω)=u∈Mf(Ω):‖u‖A,Ω=infk>0:∫ΩA(|u(x)|k)dx≤1<∞._A(Ω)={u_f(Ω):u_A,Ω=inf{k>0:∫_ΩA(|u(x)|/k) dx≤1}<∞}.
The space 

LA(Ω)_A(Ω)
is an example of an Orlicz space.
