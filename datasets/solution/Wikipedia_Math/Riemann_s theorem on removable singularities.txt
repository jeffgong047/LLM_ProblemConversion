A graph of a parabola with a removable singularity at x = 2
In complex analysis, a removable singularity of a holomorphic function is a point at which the function is undefined, but it is possible to redefine the function at that point in such a way that the resulting function is regular in a neighbourhood of that point.
For instance, the (unnormalized) sinc function, as defined by

sinc(z)=sin⁡zzsinc(z)=/z
has a singularity at z = 0. This singularity can be removed by defining sinc(0):=1,sinc(0):=1, which is the limit of sinc as z tends to 0. The resulting function is holomorphic. In this case the problem was caused by sinc being given an indeterminate form. Taking a power series expansion for sin⁡(z)zsin(z)/z around the singular point shows that

sinc(z)=1z(∑k=0∞(−1)kz2k+1(2k+1)!)=∑k=0∞(−1)kz2k(2k+1)!=1−z23!+z45!−z67!+⋯.sinc(z)=1/z(∑_k=0^∞(-1)^kz^2k+1/(2k+1)!)=∑_k=0^∞(-1)^kz^2k/(2k+1)!=1-z^2/3!+z^4/5!-z^6/7!+⋯.
Formally, if U⊂C⊂ℂ is an open subset of the complex plane Cℂ, a∈U a point of U, and f:U∖a→C:U∖{a}→ℂ is a holomorphic function, then a is called a removable singularity for f if there exists a holomorphic function g:U→C:U→ℂ which coincides with f on U∖a∖{a}. We say f is holomorphically extendable over U if such a g exists.


Riemann's theorem[edit]
Riemann's theorem on removable singularities is as follows:


Theorem —  Let D⊂C⊂ℂ be an open subset of the complex plane, a∈D a point of D and f a holomorphic function defined on the set D∖a∖{a}.  The following are equivalent:

f is holomorphically extendable over a.
f is continuously extendable over a.
There exists a neighborhood of a on which f is bounded.
limz→a(z−a)f(z)=0lim_z(z-a)f(z)=0.

The implications 1 ⇒ 2  ⇒ 3  ⇒ 4 are trivial. To prove 4 ⇒ 1, we first recall that the holomorphy of a function at a is equivalent to it being analytic at a (proof), i.e. having a power series representation. Define

h(z)=(z−a)2f(z)z≠a,0z=a.(z)=(z-a)^2f(z)   z,
0   z=a.
Clearly, h is holomorphic on D∖a∖{a}, and there exists

h′(a)=limz→a(z−a)2f(z)−0z−a=limz→a(z−a)f(z)=0'(a)=lim_z(z-a)^2f(z)-0/z-a=lim_z(z-a)f(z)=0
by 4, hence h is holomorphic on D and has a Taylor series about a:

h(z)=c0+c1(z−a)+c2(z−a)2+c3(z−a)3+⋯.(z)=c_0+c_1(z-a)+c_2(z-a)^2+c_3(z-a)^3+⋯ .
We have c0 = h(a) = 0 and c1 = h'(a) = 0; therefore

h(z)=c2(z−a)2+c3(z−a)3+⋯.(z)=c_2(z-a)^2+c_3(z-a)^3+⋯ .
Hence, where z≠a, we have:

f(z)=h(z)(z−a)2=c2+c3(z−a)+⋯.(z)=h(z)/(z-a)^2=c_2+c_3(z-a)+⋯ .
However,

g(z)=c2+c3(z−a)+⋯.(z)=c_2+c_3(z-a)+⋯ .
is holomorphic on D, thus an extension of f.

Other kinds of singularities[edit]
Unlike functions of a real variable, holomorphic functions are sufficiently rigid that their isolated singularities can be completely classified. A holomorphic function's singularity is either not really a singularity at all, i.e. a removable singularity, or one of the following two types:

In light of Riemann's theorem, given a non-removable singularity, one might ask whether there exists a natural number m such that limz→a(z−a)m+1f(z)=0lim_z(z-a)^m+1f(z)=0. If so, a is called a pole of f and the smallest such m is the order of a. So removable singularities are precisely the poles of order 0. A holomorphic function blows up uniformly near its other poles.
If an isolated singularity a of f is neither removable nor a pole, it is called an essential singularity.  The Great Picard Theorem shows that such an f maps every punctured open neighborhood U∖a∖{a} to the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of at most one point.
