Theorem about holomorphic functions of several complex variables

In mathematics, Malgrange–Zerner theorem (named for Bernard Malgrange and Martin Zerner) shows that a function on Rnℝ^n allowing holomorphic extension in each variable separately can be extended, under certain conditions, to a function holomorphic in all variables jointly. This theorem can be seen as a generalization of Bochner's tube theorem to functions defined on tube-like domains whose base is not an open set.
Theorem[1][2] Let

X=⋃k=1nRk−1×P×Rn−k,whereP=R+i[0,1),=⋃_k=1^nℝ^k-1×ℝ^n-k,whereP=ℝ+i[0,1),
and let W== convex hull of X. Let f:X→C:X→ℂ be a locally bounded function such that f∈C∞(X)^∞(X) and that for any fixed point (x1,…,xk−1,xk+1,…,xn)∈Rn−1(x_1,…,x_k-1,x_k+1,…,x_n)∈ℝ^n-1 the function f(x1,…,xk−1,z,xk+1,…,xn)(x_1,…,x_k-1,z,x_k+1,…,x_n) is holomorphic in z in the interior of P for each k=1,…,n=1,…,n. Then the function f can be uniquely extended to a function holomorphic in the interior of W.

History[edit]
According to Henry Epstein,[1][3] this theorem was proved first by Malgrange in 1961 (unpublished), then by Zerner [4] (as cited in [1]), and commmunicated to him privately. Epstein's lectures [1] contain the first published proof (attributed there to Broz, Epstein and Glaser). The assumption f∈C∞(X)^∞(X) was later relaxed to f|Rn∈C3|_ℝ^n^3 (see Ref.[1] in [2]) and finally to f|Rn∈C|_ℝ^n.[2]
