The Symmetric hypergraph theorem is a theorem in combinatorics that puts an upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph (or hypergraph in general).  The original reference for this paper is unknown at the moment, and has been called folklore.[1]


Statement[edit]
A group G acting on a set S is called transitive if given any two elements x and y in S, there exists an element f of G such that f(x)=y(x)=y.  A graph (or hypergraph) is called symmetric if its automorphism group is transitive.
Theorem.  Let H=(S,E)=(S,E) be a symmetric hypergraph.  Let m=|S|=|S|, and let χ(H)χ(H) denote the chromatic number of H, and let α(H)α(H) denote the independence number of H.  Then
χ(H)≤1+ln⁡m−ln⁡(1−α(H)/m)χ(H)≤1+lnm/-ln(1-α(H)/m)

Applications[edit]
This theorem has applications to Ramsey theory, specifically graph Ramsey theory.  Using this theorem, a relationship between the graph Ramsey numbers and the extremal numbers can be shown (see Graham-Rothschild-Spencer for the details).
