The notion of orbit of a control system used in mathematical control theory is a particular case of the notion of orbit in group theory.[1][2][3]


Definition[edit]
Let 
q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) 
be a C∞{𝒞^∞ control system, where 
q 
belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold M and u belongs to a control set U. Consider the family F=f(⋅,u)∣u∈Uℱ={f(·,u)}
and assume that every vector field in Fℱ is complete.
For every f∈F∈ℱ and every real t, denote by etf^tf the flow of f at time t.
The orbit of the control system q˙=f(q,u)}q̇=f(q,u) through a point q0∈M_0 is the subset Oq0𝒪_q_0 of M defined by

Oq0=etkfk∘etk−1fk−1∘⋯∘et1f1(q0)∣k∈N,t1,…,tk∈R,f1,…,fk∈F.𝒪_q_0={e^t_kf_k^t_k-1f_k-1∘⋯^t_1f_1(q_0)∈ℕ,_1,…,t_k∈ℝ,_1,…,f_k∈ℱ}.
Remarks
The difference between orbits and attainable sets is that, whereas for attainable sets only forward-in-time motions are allowed, both forward and backward motions are permitted for orbits. 
In particular, if the family Fℱ is symmetric (i.e., f∈F∈ℱ if and only if −f∈F-f∈ℱ), then orbits and attainable sets coincide.
The hypothesis that every vector field of Fℱ is complete simplifies the notations but can be dropped. In this case one has to replace flows of vector fields by local versions of them.

Orbit theorem (Nagano–Sussmann)[edit]
Each orbit Oq0𝒪_q_0 is an immersed submanifold of M.
The tangent space to the orbit
Oq0𝒪_q_0 at a point q is the linear subspace of TqM_qM spanned by 
the vectors P∗f(q)_*f(q) where P∗f_*f denotes the pushforward of f by  P, f belongs to  Fℱ and P is a diffeomorphism of M of the form  etkfk∘⋯∘et1f1^t_kf_k∘⋯^t_1f_1 with k∈N,t1,…,tk∈R∈ℕ,_1,…,t_k∈ℝ and f1,…,fk∈F_1,…,f_k∈ℱ.
If all the vector fields of the family Fℱ are analytic, then TqOq0=LieqF_q𝒪_q_0=Lie_q ℱ where LieqFLie_q ℱ is the evaluation at q of the Lie algebra generated by Fℱ with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields.
Otherwise, the inclusion LieqF⊂TqOq0Lie_q ℱ_q𝒪_q_0 holds true.

Corollary (Rashevsky–Chow theorem)[edit]
Main article: Chow–Rashevskii theorem
If LieqF=TqMLie_q ℱ=T_qM for every q∈M and if M is connected, then each orbit is equal to the whole manifold M.
