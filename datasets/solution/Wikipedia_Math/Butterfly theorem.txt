Butterfly theorem
The butterfly theorem is a classical result in Euclidean geometry, which can be stated as follows:[1]: p. 78 
Let M be the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle, through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn; AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y correspondingly. Then M is the midpoint of XY.


Proof[edit]
Proof of Butterfly theorem
A formal proof of the theorem is as follows:
Let the perpendiculars XX′  and XX″ be dropped from the point X on the straight lines AM and DM respectively. Similarly, let YY′ and YY″ be dropped from the point Y perpendicular to the straight lines BM and CM respectively.
Since 

△MXX′∼△MYY′,'∼',
MXMY=XX′YY′,MX=XX'',
△MXX″∼△MYY″,”∼”,
MXMY=XX″YY″,MX=XX””,
△AXX′∼△CYY″,'∼”,
XX′YY″=AXCY,XX'”=AX,
△DXX″∼△BYY′,”∼',
XX″YY′=DXBY.XX”'=DX.
From the preceding equations and the intersecting chords theorem, it can be seen that

(MXMY)2=XX′YY′XX″YY″,(MX)^2=XX''XX””,
=AX⋅DXCY⋅BY,=AX,
=PX⋅QXPY⋅QY,=PX,
=(PM−XM)⋅(MQ+XM)(PM+MY)⋅(QM−MY),=(PM-XM)·(MQ+XM)(PM+MY)·(QM-MY),
=(PM)2−(MX)2(PM)2−(MY)2,=(PM)^2-(MX)^2(PM)^2-(MY)^2,
since PM = MQ.
So

(MX)2(MY)2=(PM)2−(MX)2(PM)2−(MY)2.(MX)^2(MY)^2=(PM)^2-(MX)^2(PM)^2-(MY)^2.
Cross-multiplying in the latter equation,

(MX)2⋅(PM)2−(MX)2⋅(MY)2=(MY)2⋅(PM)2−(MX)2⋅(MY)2.(MX)^2·(PM)^2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2=(MY)^2·(PM)^2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2.
Cancelling the common term

−(MX)2⋅(MY)2-(MX)^2·(MY)^2
from both sides of the resulting equation yields

(MX)2⋅(PM)2=(MY)2⋅(PM)2,(MX)^2·(PM)^2=(MY)^2·(PM)^2,
hence MX = MY, since MX, MY, and PM are all positive, real numbers.
Thus, M is the midpoint of XY.
Other proofs exist,[2] including one using projective geometry.[3]

History[edit]
Proving the butterfly theorem was posed as a problem by William Wallace in The Gentlemen's Mathematical Companion (1803). Three solutions were published in 1804, and in 1805 Sir William Herschel posed the question again in a letter to Wallace. Rev. Thomas Scurr asked the same question again in 1814 in the Gentlemen's Diary or Mathematical Repository.[4]
