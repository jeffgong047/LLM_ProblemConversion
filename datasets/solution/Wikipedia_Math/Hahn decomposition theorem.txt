Measurability theorem
In mathematics, the Hahn decomposition theorem, named after the Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn, states that for any measurable space (X,Σ)(X,Σ) and any signed measure μμ defined on the σσ-algebra ΣΣ, there exist two ΣΣ-measurable sets, P and N, of X such that:

P∪N=X=X and  P∩N=∅=∅.
For every E∈Σ∈Σ such that E⊆P, one has μ(E)≥0μ(E)≥0, i.e., P is a positive set for μμ.
For every E∈Σ∈Σ such that E⊆N, one has μ(E)≤0μ(E)≤0, i.e., N is a negative set for μμ.
Moreover, this decomposition is essentially unique, meaning that for any other pair (P′,N′)(P',N') of ΣΣ-measurable subsets of X fulfilling the three conditions above, the symmetric differences P△P′' and N△N′' are μμ-null sets in the strong sense that every ΣΣ-measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair (P,N)(P,N) is then called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μμ.


Jordan measure decomposition[edit]
A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem, which states that every signed measure μμ defined on ΣΣ has a unique decomposition into a difference μ=μ+−μ−μ=μ^+-μ^- of two positive measures, μ+μ^+ and μ−μ^-, at least one of which is finite, such that μ+(E)=0μ^+(E)=0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset E⊆N and μ−(E)=0μ^-(E)=0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset E⊆P, for any Hahn decomposition (P,N)(P,N) of μμ. We call μ+μ^+ and μ−μ^- the positive and negative part of μμ, respectively. The pair (μ+,μ−)(μ^+,μ^-) is called a Jordan decomposition (or sometimes Hahn–Jordan decomposition) of μμ. The two measures can be defined as

μ+(E):=μ(E∩P)andμ−(E):=−μ(E∩N)μ^+(E):=μ(E)    and    μ^-(E):=-μ(E)
for every E∈Σ∈Σ and any Hahn decomposition (P,N)(P,N) of μμ.
Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique.
The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition (μ+,μ−)(μ^+,μ^-) of a finite signed measure μμ, one has

μ+(E)=supB∈Σ,B⊆Eμ(B)andμ−(E)=−infB∈Σ,B⊆Eμ(B)μ^+(E)=sup_B∈Σ, Bμ(B)  and  μ^-(E)=-inf_B∈Σ, Bμ(B)
for any E in ΣΣ. Furthermore, if μ=ν+−ν−μ=ν^+-ν^- for a pair (ν+,ν−)(ν^+,ν^-) of finite non-negative measures on X, then

ν+≥μ+andν−≥μ−.ν^+≥μ^+  and  ν^-≥μ^-.
The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the minimal decomposition of μμ into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the minimality property of the Jordan decomposition.
Proof of the Jordan decomposition: For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see Fischer (2012).

Proof of the Hahn decomposition theorem[edit]
Preparation: Assume that μμ does not take the value −∞-∞ (otherwise decompose according to −μ-μ). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set A∈Σ∈Σ such that μ(B)≤0μ(B)≤0 for every ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆A.
Claim: Suppose that D∈Σ∈Σ satisfies μ(D)≤0μ(D)≤0. Then there is a negative set A⊆D such that μ(A)≤μ(D)μ(A)≤μ(D).
Proof of the claim: Define A0:=D_0:=D. Inductively assume for n∈N0∈ℕ_0 that An⊆D_n has been constructed. Let

tn:=sup(μ(B)∣B∈ΣandB⊆An)_n:=sup({μ(B)∈Σ and B_n})
denote the supremum of μ(B)μ(B) over all the ΣΣ-measurable subsets B of An_n. This supremum might a priori be infinite. As the empty set ∅∅ is a possible candidate for B in the definition of tn_n, and as μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0, we have tn≥0_n≥0. By the definition of tn_n, there then exists a ΣΣ-measurable subset Bn⊆An_n_n satisfying

μ(Bn)≥min(1,tn2).μ(B_n)≥min(1,t_n/2).
Set An+1:=An∖Bn_n+1:=A_n_n to finish the induction step. Finally, define

A:=Dn=0∞Bn.:=D\⋃_n=0^∞B_n.
As the sets (Bn)n=0∞(B_n)_n=0^∞ are disjoint subsets of D, it follows from the sigma additivity of the signed measure μμ that

μ(D)=μ(A)+∑n=0∞μ(Bn)≥μ(A)+∑n=0∞min(1,tn2)≥μ(A).μ(D)=μ(A)+∑_n=0^∞μ(B_n)≥μ(A)+∑_n=0^∞min(1,t_n/2)≥μ(A).
This shows that μ(A)≤μ(D)μ(A)≤μ(D). Assume A were not a negative set. This means that there would exist a ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆A that satisfies μ(B)>0μ(B)>0. Then tn≥μ(B)_n≥μ(B) for every n∈N0∈ℕ_0, so the series on the right would have to diverge to +∞+∞, implying that μ(D)=+∞μ(D)=+∞, which is a contradiction, since μ(D)≤0μ(D)≤0. Therefore, A must be a negative set.
Construction of the decomposition: Set N0=∅_0=∅. Inductively, given Nn_n, define

sn:=inf(μ(D)∣D∈ΣandD⊆X∖Nn)._n:=inf({μ(D)∈Σ and D_n}).
as the infimum of μ(D)μ(D) over all the ΣΣ-measurable subsets D of X∖Nn_n. This infimum might a priori be −∞-∞. As ∅∅ is a possible candidate for D in the definition of sn_n, and as μ(∅)=0μ(∅)=0, we have sn≤0_n≤0. Hence, there exists a ΣΣ-measurable subset Dn⊆X∖Nn_n_n such that

μ(Dn)≤max(sn2,−1)≤0.μ(D_n)≤max(s_n/2,-1)≤0.
By the claim above, there is a negative set An⊆Dn_n_n such that μ(An)≤μ(Dn)μ(A_n)≤μ(D_n). Set Nn+1:=Nn∪An_n+1:=N_n_n to finish the induction step. Finally, define

N:=⋃n=0∞An.:=⋃_n=0^∞A_n.
As the sets (An)n=0∞(A_n)_n=0^∞ are disjoint, we have for every ΣΣ-measurable subset B⊆N that

μ(B)=∑n=0∞μ(B∩An)μ(B)=∑_n=0^∞μ(B_n)
by the sigma additivity of μμ. In particular, this shows that N is a negative set. Next, define P:=X∖N:=X. If P were not a positive set, there would exist a ΣΣ-measurable subset D⊆P with μ(D)<0μ(D)<0. Then sn≤μ(D)_n≤μ(D) for all n∈N0∈ℕ_0 and[clarification needed]

μ(N)=∑n=0∞μ(An)≤∑n=0∞max(sn2,−1)=−∞,μ(N)=∑_n=0^∞μ(A_n)≤∑_n=0^∞max(s_n/2,-1)=-∞,
which is not allowed for μμ. Therefore, P is a positive set.
Proof of the uniqueness statement:
Suppose that (N′,P′)(N',P') is another Hahn decomposition of X. Then P∩N′'  is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to N∩P′'. As

P△P′=N△N′=(P∩N′)∪(N∩P′),'=N'=(P')∪(N'),
this completes the proof. Q.E.D.
