Statement about the representability of zero by odd degree forms
In mathematics, Birch's theorem,[1] named for Bryan John Birch, is a statement about the representability of zero by odd degree forms.

Statement of Birch's theorem[edit]
Let K be an algebraic number field, k, l and n be natural numbers, r1, ..., rk be odd natural numbers, and f1, ..., fk be homogeneous polynomials with coefficients in K of degrees r1, ..., rk respectively in n variables. Then there exists a number ψ(r1, ..., rk, l, K) such that if

n≥ψ(r1,…,rk,l,K)≥ψ(r_1,…,r_k,l,K)
then there exists an l-dimensional vector subspace V of Kn such that

f1(x)=⋯=fk(x)=0forallx∈V._1(x)=⋯=f_k(x)=0forallx.
Remarks[edit]
The proof of the theorem is by induction over the maximal degree of the forms f1, ..., fk. Essential to the proof is a special case, which can be proved by an application of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method, of the theorem which states that if n is sufficiently large and r is odd, then the equation

c1x1r+⋯+cnxnr=0,ci∈Z,i=1,…,n_1x_1^r+⋯+c_nx_n^r=0,_i∈ℤ,ı=1,…,n
has a solution in integers x1, ..., xn, not all of which are 0.
The restriction to odd r is necessary, since even degree forms, such as positive definite quadratic forms, may take the value 0 only at the origin.
