In mathematical logic, the Kanamori–McAloon theorem, due to Kanamori & McAloon (1987), gives an example of an incompleteness in Peano arithmetic, similar to that of the Paris–Harrington theorem. They showed that a certain finitistic theorem in Ramsey theory is not provable in Peano arithmetic (PA).

Statement[edit]
Given a set s⊆N⊆ℕ of non-negative integers, let min(s)min(s) denote the minimum element of s. Let [X]n[X]^n denote the set of all n-element subsets of X.
A function f:[X]n→N:[X]^n→ℕ where X⊆N⊆ℕ is said to be regressive if f(s)<min(s)(s)<min(s) for all s not containing 0.
The Kanamori–McAloon theorem states that the following proposition, denoted by (∗)(*) in the original reference, is not provable in PA:

For every n,k∈N,k∈ℕ, there exists an m∈N∈ℕ such that for all regressive f:[0,1,…,m−1]n→N:[{0,1,…,m-1}]^n→ℕ, there exists a set H∈[0,1,…,m−1]k∈[{0,1,…,m-1}]^k such that for all s,t∈[H]n,t∈[H]^n with min(s)=min(t)min(s)=min(t), we have f(s)=f(t)(s)=f(t).
