Not to be confused with Well-ordering principle.
In mathematics, the well-ordering theorem, also known as Zermelo's theorem, states that every set can be well-ordered. A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has a least element under the ordering. The well-ordering theorem together with Zorn's lemma are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the axiom of choice (often called AC, see also Axiom of choice § Equivalents).[1][2] Ernst Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem.[3] One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to transfinite induction, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique.[3] One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach–Tarski paradox.


History[edit]
Georg Cantor considered the well-ordering theorem to be a "fundamental principle of thought".[4]  However, it is considered difficult or even impossible to visualize a well-ordering of Rℝ; such a visualization would have to incorporate the axiom of choice.[5] In 1904, Gyula Kőnig claimed to have proven that such a well-ordering cannot exist.  A few weeks later, Felix Hausdorff found a mistake in the proof.[6]  It turned out, though, that in first-order logic the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice, in the sense that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice included are sufficient to prove the well-ordering theorem, and conversely, the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice but with the well-ordering theorem included are sufficient to prove the axiom of choice. (The same applies to Zorn's lemma.) In second-order logic, however, the well-ordering theorem is strictly stronger than the axiom of choice: from the well-ordering theorem one may deduce the axiom of choice, but from the axiom of choice one cannot deduce the well-ordering theorem.[7]

There is a well-known joke about the three statements, and their relative amenability to intuition:The axiom of choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?[8]
Proof from axiom of choice[edit]
The well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice as follows.[9]Let the set we are trying to well-order be A, and let f be a choice function for the family of non-empty subsets of A. For every ordinal αα, define an element aα_α that is in A by setting aα=f(A∖aξ∣ξ<α)_α(A∖{a_ξ|ξ<α}) if this complement A∖aξ∣ξ<α∖{a_ξ|ξ<α} is nonempty, or leave aα_α undefined if it is. That is, aα_α is chosen from the set of elements of A that have not yet been assigned a place in the ordering (or undefined if the entirety of A has been successfully enumerated). Then ⟨aα∣aαisdefined⟩_α_αisdefined⟩ is a well-order of A as desired.
Proof of axiom of choice[edit]
The axiom of choice can be proven from the well-ordering theorem as follows.

To make a choice function for a collection of non-empty sets, E, take the union of the sets in E and call it X. There exists a well-ordering of X; let R be such an ordering. The function that to each set S of E associates the smallest element of S, as ordered by (the restriction to S of) R, is a choice function for the collection E.
An essential point of this proof is that it involves only a single arbitrary choice, that of R; applying the well-ordering theorem to each member S of E separately would not work, since the theorem only asserts the existence of a well-ordering, and choosing for each S a well-ordering would require just as many choices as simply choosing an element from each S. Particularly, if E contains uncountably many sets, making all uncountably many choices is not allowed under the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice.
