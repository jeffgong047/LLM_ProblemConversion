In mathematical analysis, the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem is a Tauberian theorem relating the asymptotics of the partial sums of a series with the asymptotics of its Abel summation. In this form, the theorem asserts that if the sequence
an≥0_n≥0 is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence

∑n=0∞ane−ny∼1yasy↓0∑_n=0^∞a_ne^-ny∼1/y{as↓0
then there is also an asymptotic equivalence

∑k=0nak∼n∑_k=0^na_k
as n→∞→∞.  The integral formulation of the theorem relates in an analogous manner the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution function of a function with the asymptotics of its Laplace transform.
The theorem was proved in 1914 by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood.[1]: 226  In 1930, Jovan Karamata gave a new and much simpler proof.[1]: 226 


Statement of the theorem[edit]
Series formulation[edit]
This formulation is from Titchmarsh.[1]: 226  Suppose an≥0_n≥0 for all n∈N∈ℕ, and we have

∑n=0∞anxn∼11−xasx↑1.∑_n=0^∞a_nx^n∼1/1-x{as↑1.
Then as n→∞→∞ we have

∑k=0nak∼n.∑_k=0^na_k.
The theorem is sometimes quoted in equivalent forms, where instead of requiring an≥0_n≥0, we require an=O(1)_n=O(1), or we require 
an≥−K_n≥-K for some constant K.[2]: 155  The theorem is sometimes quoted in another equivalent formulation (through the change of variable x=1/ey=1/e^y).[2]: 155  
If,

∑n=0∞ane−ny∼1yasy↓0∑_n=0^∞a_ne^-ny∼1/y{as↓0
then

∑k=0nak∼n.∑_k=0^na_k.
Integral formulation[edit]
The following more general formulation is from Feller.[3]: 445  Consider a real-valued function F:[0,∞)→R:[0,∞)→ℝ of bounded variation.[4]  The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of F is defined by the Stieltjes integral

ω(s)=∫0∞e−stdF(t).ω(s)=∫_0^∞e^-st dF(t).
The theorem relates the asymptotics of ω with those of F in the following way. If ρρ is a non-negative real number, then the following statements are equivalent

ω(s)∼Cs−ρ,ass→0ω(s)^-ρ,  as}s→0
F(t)∼CΓ(ρ+1)tρ,ast→∞.(t)∼C/Γ(ρ+1)t^ρ,{as→∞.
Here ΓΓ denotes the Gamma function. One obtains the theorem for series as a special case by taking ρ=1ρ=1 and F(t)(t) to be a piecewise constant function with value ∑k=0nak∑_k=0^na_k between t=n=n and t=n+1=n+1.
A slight improvement is possible. According to the definition of a slowly varying function, L(x)(x) is slow varying at infinity iff

L(tx)L(x)→1,x→∞L(tx)/L(x)→1,→∞
for every t>0>0. Let L be a function slowly varying at infinity and ρ≥0ρ≥0. Then the following statements are equivalent

ω(s)∼s−ρL(s−1),ass→0ω(s)^-ρL(s^-1),  as→0
F(t)∼1Γ(ρ+1)tρL(t),ast→∞.(t)∼1/Γ(ρ+1)t^ρL(t),  as→∞.
Karamata's proof[edit]
Karamata (1930) found a short proof of the theorem by considering the functions g such that

limx→1(1−x)∑anxng(xn)=∫01g(t)dtlim_x→1(1-x)_nx^ng(x^n)=∫_0^1g(t)dt
An easy calculation shows that all monomials g(x)=xk(x)=x^k have this property, and therefore so do all polynomials g. This can be extended to a function g with simple (step) discontinuities by approximating it by polynomials from above and below (using the Weierstrass approximation theorem and a little extra fudging) and using the fact that the coefficients an_n are positive. In particular the function given by g(t)=1/t(t)=1/t if 1/e<t<11/e<t<1 and 00 otherwise has this property. But then for x−1/N^-1/N the sum 
∑anxng(xn)_nx^ng(x^n) is a0+⋯+aN_0+⋯+a_N and the integral of g is 11, from which the Hardy–Littlewood theorem follows immediately.

Examples[edit]
Non-positive coefficients[edit]
The theorem can fail without the condition that the coefficients are non-negative. For example, the function

1(1+x)2(1−x)=1−x+2x2−2x3+3x4−3x5+⋯1/(1+x)^2(1-x)=1-x+2x^2-2x^3+3x^4-3x^5+⋯
is asymptotic to 1/4(1−x)1/4(1-x) as x→1→1, but the partial sums of its coefficients are 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, ... and are not asymptotic to any linear function.

Littlewood's extension of Tauber's theorem[edit]
Main article: Littlewood's Tauberian theorem
In 1911 Littlewood proved an extension of Tauber's converse of Abel's theorem. Littlewood showed the following: If an=O(1/n)_n=O(1/n), and we have 

∑anxn→sasx↑1_nx^n{as↑1
then

∑an=s._n=s.
This came historically before the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem, but can be proved as a simple application of it.[1]: 233–235 

Prime number theorem[edit]
In 1915 Hardy and Littlewood developed a proof of the prime number theorem based on their Tauberian theorem; they proved

∑n=2∞Λ(n)e−ny∼1y,∑_n=2^∞Λ(n)e^-ny∼1/y,
where ΛΛ is the von Mangoldt function, and then conclude

∑n≤xΛ(n)∼x,∑_nΛ(n),
an equivalent form of the prime number theorem.[5]: 34–35 [6]: 302–307 
Littlewood developed a simpler proof, still based on this Tauberian theorem, in 1971.[6]: 307–309
