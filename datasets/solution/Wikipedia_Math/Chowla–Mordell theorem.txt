When  a Gauss sum is the square root of a prime number, multiplied by a root of unity
In mathematics, the Chowla–Mordell theorem is a result in number theory determining cases where a Gauss sum is the square root of a prime number, multiplied by a root of unity. It was proved and published independently by Sarvadaman Chowla and Louis Mordell, around 1951.
In detail, if p is a prime number, χχ a nontrivial Dirichlet character modulo p, and 

G(χ)=∑χ(a)ζa(χ)=∑χ(a)ζ^a
where ζζ is a primitive p-th root of unity in the complex numbers, then

G(χ)|G(χ)|G(χ)/|G(χ)|
is a root of unity if and only if χχ is the quadratic residue symbol modulo p. The 'if' part was known to Gauss: the contribution of Chowla and Mordell was the 'only if' direction. The ratio in the theorem occurs in the functional equation of L-functions.
