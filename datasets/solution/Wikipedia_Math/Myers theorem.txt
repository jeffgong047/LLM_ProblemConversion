Bounds the length of geodetic segments in Riemannian manifolds based in Ricci curvature
Myers's theorem, also known as the Bonnet–Myers theorem, is a celebrated, fundamental  theorem in the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry.  It was discovered by Sumner Byron Myers in 1941. It asserts the following:

Let (M,g)(M,g) be a complete  Riemannian manifold of dimension n whose Ricci curvature satisfies Ric⁡(g)≥(n−1)kRic(g)≥(n-1)k for some positive real number k.. Then any two points of M can be joined by a geodesic segment of length at most πk.π/√(k).
In the special case of surfaces, this result was proved by Ossian Bonnet in 1855. For a surface, the  Gauss, sectional, and Ricci curvatures are all the same, but Bonnet's proof easily generalizes to higher dimensions if one assumes a positive lower bound on the  sectional curvature. Myers' key contribution was therefore to show that a Ricci lower bound is all that is needed to reach the same conclusion. 


Corollaries[edit]
The conclusion of the theorem says, in particular, that the diameter of (M,g)(M,g) is finite. The Hopf-Rinow theorem therefore implies that M must be compact, as  a closed (and hence compact) ball of radius π/kπ/√(k) in any tangent space is carried onto all of M by the exponential map. 
As a very particular case, this shows that any complete and noncompact smooth Riemannian manifold which is Einstein must have nonpositive Einstein constant.
Consider the smooth universal covering map π:N→M.π:N. One may consider the Riemannian metric π*g on N.. Since ππ is a local diffeomorphism, Myers' theorem applies to the Riemannian manifold (N,π*g) and hence N is compact. This implies that the fundamental group of Mis finite.

Cheng's diameter rigidity theorem[edit]
The conclusion of Myers' theorem says that for any p,q∈M,,q, one has dg(p,q) ≤ π/√k. In 1975, Shiu-Yuen Cheng proved:

Let (M,g)(M,g) be a complete and smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension n. If k is a positive number with Ricg ≥ (n-1)k, and if there exists p and q in M with dg(p,q) = π/√k, then (M,g) is simply-connected and has constant sectional curvature k.
