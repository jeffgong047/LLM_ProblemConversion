In field theory, a branch of mathematics, the isomorphism extension theorem is an important theorem regarding the extension of a field isomorphism to a larger field.

Isomorphism extension theorem[edit]
The theorem states that given any field F, an algebraic extension field E of F and an isomorphism ϕϕ mapping F onto a field F′' then ϕϕ can be extended to an isomorphism ττ mapping E onto an algebraic extension E′' of F′' (a subfield of the algebraic closure of F′').
The proof of the isomorphism extension theorem depends on Zorn's lemma.
