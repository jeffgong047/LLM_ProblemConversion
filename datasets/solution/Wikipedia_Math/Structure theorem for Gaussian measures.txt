In mathematics, the structure theorem for Gaussian measures shows that the abstract Wiener space construction is essentially the only way to obtain a strictly positive Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space. It was proved in the 1970s by Kallianpur–Sato–Stefan and Dudley–Feldman–le Cam.
There is the earlier result due to H. Satô (1969) [1] which proves that "any Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space is an  abstract Wiener measure in the sense of  L. Gross". The result by Dudley et al. generalizes this result to the setting of Gaussian measures on a general topological vector space.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let γ be a strictly positive Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space (E, || ||). Then there exists a separable Hilbert space (H, ⟨ , ⟩)  and a map i : H → E such that i : H → E is an abstract Wiener space with γ = i∗(γH), where γH is the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on H.
