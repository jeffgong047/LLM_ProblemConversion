In linear algebra, relation between 3 dimensions
Rank–nullity theorem
The rank–nullity theorem is a theorem in linear algebra, which asserts:

the number of columns of a matrix M is the sum of the rank of M and the nullity of M; and
the dimension of the domain of a linear transformation f is the sum of the rank of f (the dimension of the image of f) and the nullity of f (the dimension of the kernel of f).[1][2][3][4]
It follows that for linear transformations of vector spaces of finite dimension, either injectivity or surjectivity implies bijectivity[further explanation needed].


Stating the theorem[edit]
Linear transformations[edit]
Let T:V→W:V be a linear transformation between two vector spaces where T's domain V is finite dimensional. Then
rank⁡(T)+nullity⁡(T)=dim⁡V,rank(T) + nullity(T) = ,
where rank⁡(T)rank(T) is the rank of T (the dimension of its image) and nullity⁡(T)nullity(T) is the nullity of T (the dimension of its kernel).  In other words,
dim⁡(Im⁡T)+dim⁡(Ker⁡T)=dim⁡(Domain⁡(T)).(ImT)+(KerT)=(Domain(T)).
This theorem can be refined via the splitting lemma to be a statement about an isomorphism of spaces, not just dimensions. Explicitly, since T induces an isomorphism from V/Ker⁡(T)/Ker(T) to Image⁡(T),Image(T), the existence of a basis for V that extends any given basis of Ker⁡(T)Ker(T) implies, via the splitting lemma, that Image⁡(T)⊕Ker⁡(T)≅V.Image(T)⊕Ker(T). Taking dimensions, the rank–nullity theorem follows.

Matrices[edit]
Linear maps can be represented with matrices. More precisely, an m×n matrix M represents a linear map f:Fn→Fm,:F^n^m, where F is the underlying field.[5] So, the dimension of the domain of f is n, the number of columns of M, and the rank–nullity theorem for an m×n matrix M is
rank⁡(M)+nullity⁡(M)=n.rank(M)+nullity(M)=n.

Proofs[edit]
Here we provide two proofs. The first[2] operates in the general case, using linear maps. The second proof[6] looks at the homogeneous system Ax=0,𝐀𝐱=0, where A𝐀 is a m×n with rank r,, and shows explicitly that there exists a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions that span the null space of A𝐀.
While the theorem requires that the domain of the linear map be finite-dimensional, there is no such assumption on the codomain. This means that there are linear maps not given by matrices for which the theorem applies. Despite this, the first proof is not actually more general than the second: since the image of the linear map is finite-dimensional, we can represent the map from its domain to its image by a matrix, prove the theorem for that matrix, then compose with the inclusion of the image into the full codomain.

First proof[edit]
Let V,W,W be vector spaces over some field F,, and T defined as in the statement of the theorem with dim⁡V=n=n.
As Ker⁡T⊂VKerT is a subspace, there exists a basis for it. Suppose dim⁡Ker⁡T=kKerT=k and let
K:=v1,…,vk⊂Ker⁡(T)𝒦:={v_1,…,v_k}⊂Ker(T)
be such a basis.
We may now, by the Steinitz exchange lemma, extend K𝒦 with n−k-k linearly independent vectors w1,…,wn−k_1,…,w_n-k to form a full basis of V.
Let
S:=w1,…,wn−k⊂V∖Ker⁡(T)𝒮:={w_1,…,w_n-k}∖Ker(T)
such that
B:=K∪S=v1,…,vk,w1,…,wn−k⊂Vℬ:=𝒦∪𝒮={v_1,…,v_k,w_1,…,w_n-k}
is a basis for V.
From this, we know that
Im⁡T=Span⁡T(B)=Span⁡T(v1),…,T(vk),T(w1),…,T(wn−k)ImT=SpanT(ℬ)=Span{T(v_1),…,T(v_k),T(w_1),…,T(w_n-k)}

=Span⁡T(w1),…,T(wn−k)=Span⁡T(S).=Span{T(w_1),…,T(w_n-k)}=SpanT(𝒮).
We now claim that T(S)(𝒮) is a basis for Im⁡TImT.
The above equality already states that T(S)(𝒮) is a generating set for Im⁡TImT; it remains to be shown that it is also linearly independent to conclude that it is a basis.
Suppose T(S)(𝒮) is not linearly independent, and let
∑j=1n−kαjT(wj)=0W∑_j=1^n-kα_jT(w_j)=0_W
for some αj∈Fα_j.
Thus, owing to the linearity of T, it follows that
T(∑j=1n−kαjwj)=0W⟹(∑j=1n−kαjwj)∈Ker⁡T=Span⁡K⊂V.(∑_j=1^n-kα_jw_j)=0_W(∑_j=1^n-kα_jw_j)∈KerT=Span𝒦.
This is a contradiction to Bℬ being a basis, unless all αjα_j are equal to zero. This shows that T(S)(𝒮) is linearly independent, and more specifically that it is a basis for Im⁡TImT.
To summarize, we have K𝒦, a basis for Ker⁡TKerT, and T(S)(𝒮), a basis for Im⁡TImT.
Finally we may state that
Rank⁡(T)+Nullity⁡(T)=dim⁡Im⁡T+dim⁡Ker⁡TRank(T)+Nullity(T)=ImT+KerT

=|T(S)|+|K|=(n−k)+k=n=dim⁡V.=|T(𝒮)|+|𝒦|=(n-k)+k=n=.
This concludes our proof.

Second proof[edit]
Let A𝐀 be an m×n matrix with r linearly independent columns (i.e. Rank⁡(A)=rRank(𝐀)=r). We will show that:

There exists a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous system Ax=0𝐀𝐱=0.That every other solution is a linear combination of these n−r-r solutions.
To do this, we will produce an n×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix X𝐗 whose columns form a basis of the null space of A𝐀.
Without loss of generality, assume that the first r columns of A𝐀 are linearly independent. So, we can write
A=(A1A2),𝐀=[ 𝐀_1 𝐀_2 ],
where

A1𝐀_1 is an m×r matrix with r linearly independent column vectors, and
A2𝐀_2 is an m×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix such that each of its n−r-r columns is linear combinations of the columns of A1𝐀_1.
This means that A2=A1B𝐀_2=𝐀_1𝐁 for some r×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix B𝐁 (see rank factorization) and, hence,
A=(A1A1B).𝐀=[  𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ].
Let
X=(−BIn−r),𝐗=[    -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ],
where In−r𝐈_n-r is the (n−r)×(n−r)(n-r)×(n-r) identity matrix. So, X𝐗 is an n×(n−r)×(n-r) matrix such that
AX=(A1A1B)(−BIn−r)=−A1B+A1B=0m×(n−r).𝐀𝐗=[  𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ][    -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]=-𝐀_1𝐁+𝐀_1𝐁=0_m×(n-r).
Therefore, each of the n−r-r columns of X𝐗 are particular solutions of Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_F^m.
Furthermore, the n−r-r columns of X𝐗 are linearly independent because Xu=0Fn𝐗𝐮=0_F^n will imply u=0Fn−r𝐮=0_F^n-r for u∈Fn−r𝐮∈F^n-r:
Xu=0Fn⟹(−BIn−r)u=0Fn⟹(−Buu)=(0Fr0Fn−r)⟹u=0Fn−r.𝐗𝐮=0_F^n[    -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]𝐮=0_F^n[ -𝐁𝐮;   𝐮 ]=[   0_F^r; 0_F^n-r ]𝐮=0_F^n-r.
Therefore, the column vectors of X𝐗 constitute a set of n−r-r linearly independent solutions for Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_𝔽^m.
We next prove that any solution of Ax=0Fm𝐀𝐱=0_F^m must be a linear combination of the columns of X𝐗.
For this, let
u=(u1u2)∈Fn𝐮=[ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ]∈F^n
be any vector such that Au=0Fm𝐀𝐮=0_F^m. Since the columns of A1𝐀_1 are linearly independent, A1x=0Fm𝐀_1𝐱=0_F^m implies x=0Fr𝐱=0_F^r.
Therefore,
Au=0Fm⟹(A1A1B)(u1u2)=A1u1+A1Bu2=A1(u1+Bu2)=0Fm⟹u1+Bu2=0Fr⟹u1=−Bu2[                        𝐀𝐮                         =                     0_F^m; [  𝐀_1 𝐀_1𝐁 ][ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ]                         =            𝐀_1𝐮_1+𝐀_1𝐁𝐮_2                         =             𝐀_1(𝐮_1+𝐁𝐮_2)                         =                     0_𝔽^m;                  𝐮_1+𝐁𝐮_2                         =                     0_F^r;                       𝐮_1                         =                     -𝐁𝐮_2 ]
⟹u=(u1u2)=(−BIn−r)u2=Xu2.𝐮=[ 𝐮_1; 𝐮_2 ]=[    -𝐁; 𝐈_n-r ]𝐮_2=𝐗𝐮_2.
This proves that any vector u𝐮 that is a solution of Ax=0𝐀𝐱=0 must be a linear combination of the n−r-r special solutions given by the columns of X𝐗. And we have already seen that the columns of X𝐗 are linearly independent. Hence, the columns of X𝐗 constitute a basis for the null space of A𝐀. Therefore, the nullity of A𝐀 is n−r-r. Since r equals rank of A𝐀, it follows that Rank⁡(A)+Nullity⁡(A)=nRank(𝐀)+Nullity(𝐀)=n. This concludes our proof.

A third fundamental subspace[edit]
When T:V→W:V is a linear transformation between two finite-dimensional subspaces, with n=dim⁡(V)=(V) and m=dim⁡(W)=(W) (so can be represented by an m×n matrix M), the rank–nullity theorem asserts that if T has rank r, then n−r-r is the dimension of the null space of M, which represents the kernel of T.  In some texts, a third fundamental subspace associated to T is considered alongside its image and kernel: the cokernel of T is the  quotient space W/Image⁡(T)/Image(T), and its dimension is m−r-r.  This dimension formula (which might also be rendered dim⁡Image⁡(T)+dim⁡Coker⁡(T)=dim⁡(W)Image(T)+Coker(T)=(W)) together with the rank–nullity theorem is sometimes called the fundamental theorem of linear algebra.[7][8]

Reformulations and generalizations[edit]
This theorem is a statement of the first isomorphism theorem of algebra for the case of vector spaces; it generalizes to the splitting lemma.
In more modern language, the theorem can also be phrased as saying that each short exact sequence of vector spaces splits. Explicitly, given that
0→U→V→TR→00T→R→0
is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then U⊕R≅V, hence
dim⁡(U)+dim⁡(R)=dim⁡(V).(U)+(R)=(V).
Here R plays the role of Im⁡TImT and U is Ker⁡TKerT, i.e.
0→ker⁡T↪V→Tim⁡T→00→↪VT→imT→0
In the finite-dimensional case, this formulation is susceptible to a generalization: if
0→V1→V2→⋯Vr→00_1_2→_r→0
is an exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then[9]
∑i=1r(−1)idim⁡(Vi)=0.∑_i=1^r(-1)^i(V_i)=0.
The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces may also be formulated in terms of the index of a linear map. The index of a linear map T∈Hom⁡(V,W)∈Hom(V,W), where V and W are finite-dimensional, is defined by
index⁡T=dim⁡Ker⁡(T)−dim⁡Coker⁡T.indexT=Ker(T)-CokerT.
Intuitively, dim⁡Ker⁡TKerT is the number of independent solutions v of the equation Tv=0=0, and dim⁡Coker⁡TCokerT is the number of independent restrictions that have to be put on w to make Tv=w=w solvable. The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces is equivalent to the statement
index⁡T=dim⁡V−dim⁡W.indexT=-.
We see that we can easily read off the index of the linear map T from the involved spaces, without any need to analyze T in detail. This effect also occurs in a much deeper result: the Atiyah–Singer index theorem states that the index of certain differential operators can be read off the geometry of the involved spaces.
