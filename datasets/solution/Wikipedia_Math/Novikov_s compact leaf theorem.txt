Result about foliation of compact 3-manifolds
In mathematics, Novikov's compact leaf theorem, named after Sergei Novikov, states that

A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf.
Novikov's compact leaf theorem for S3[edit]
Theorem: A smooth codimension-one foliation of the 3-sphere S3 has a compact leaf. The leaf is a torus T2 bounding a solid torus with the Reeb foliation.
The theorem was proved by Sergei Novikov in 1964. Earlier Charles Ehresmann had conjectured that every smooth codimension-one foliation on S3 had a compact leaf, which was known to be true for all known examples; in particular, the Reeb foliation has a compact leaf that is T2.

Novikov's compact leaf theorem for any M3[edit]
In 1965, Novikov proved the compact leaf theorem for any M3:
Theorem: Let M3 be a closed 3-manifold with a smooth codimension-one foliation F.  Suppose any of the following conditions is satisfied:

the fundamental group π1(M3)π_1(M^3) is finite,
the second homotopy group π2(M3)≠0π_2(M^3)≠0,
there exists a leaf L∈F such that the map π1(L)→π1(M3)π_1(L)→π_1(M^3) induced by inclusion has a non-trivial kernel.
Then F has a compact leaf of genus g ≤ 1.
In terms of covering spaces:
A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf.
