In computability theory, the Rice–Shapiro theorem is a generalization of Rice's theorem, and is named after Henry Gordon Rice and Norman Shapiro.[1]


Formal statement[edit]
Let A be a set of partial-recursive unary functions on the domain of natural numbers such that the set Ix(A):=n∣φn∈A(A):={n|φ_n} is recursively enumerable, where φnφ_n denotes the n-th partial-recursive function in a Gödel numbering.
Then for any unary partial-recursive function ψψ, we have:

ψ∈A⇔∃ψ⇔∃ a finite function  θ⊆ψθ⊆ψ such that  θ∈A.θ.
In the given statement, a finite function is a function with a finite domain x1,x2,...,xm_1,x_2,...,x_m and θ⊆ψθ⊆ψ means that for every x∈x1,x2,...,xm∈{x_1,x_2,...,x_m} it holds that ψ(x)ψ(x) is defined and equal to θ(x)θ(x).

Perspective from effective topology[edit]
For any finite unary function θθ on integers,
let C(θ)(θ) denote the 'frustum'
of all partial-recursive functions that are defined, and agree with θθ,
on θθ's domain.
Equip the set of all partial-recursive functions with the topology generated by these
frusta as base. Note that for every frustum C, Ix(C)(C) is 
recursively enumerable. More generally it holds for every set A
of partial-recursive functions:
Ix(A)(A) is recursively enumerable   iff 
A is a recursively enumerable union of frusta.
