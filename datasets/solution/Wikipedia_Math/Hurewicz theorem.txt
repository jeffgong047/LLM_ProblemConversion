Gives a homomorphism from homotopy groups to homology groups
In mathematics, the Hurewicz theorem is a basic result of algebraic topology, connecting homotopy theory with homology theory via a map known as the Hurewicz homomorphism. The theorem is named after Witold Hurewicz, and generalizes earlier results of Henri Poincaré.


Statement of the theorems[edit]
The Hurewicz theorems are a key link between homotopy groups and homology groups.

Absolute version[edit]
For any path-connected space X and positive integer n there exists a group homomorphism

h∗:πn(X)→Hn(X),_*π_n(X)_n(X),
called the Hurewicz homomorphism, from the n-th homotopy group to the n-th homology group (with integer coefficients).  It is given in the following way: choose a canonical generator un∈Hn(Sn)_n_n(S^n), then a homotopy class of maps f∈πn(X)∈π_n(X) is taken to f∗(un)∈Hn(X)_*(u_n)_n(X).
The Hurewicz theorem states cases in which the Hurewicz homomorphism is an isomorphism.

For n≥2≥2, if X is (n−1)(n-1)-connected (that is: πi(X)=0π_i(X)=0 for all i<n<n), then Hi (X)=0H̃_̃ĩ(X)=0 for all i<n<n, and the Hurewicz map h∗:πn(X)→Hn(X)_*π_n(X)_n(X) is an isomorphism.[1]: 366, Thm.4.32  This implies, in particular, that the homological connectivity equals the homotopical connectivity when the latter is at least 1. In addition, the Hurewicz map h∗:πn+1(X)→Hn+1(X)_*π_n+1(X)_n+1(X) is an epimorphism in this case.[1]: 390, ? 
For n=1=1, the Hurewicz homomorphism induces an isomorphism h ∗:π1(X)/[π1(X),π1(X)]→H1(X)h̃_*π_1(X)/[π_1(X),π_1(X)]_1(X), between the abelianization of the first homotopy group (the fundamental group) and the first homology group.
Relative version[edit]
For any pair of spaces (X,A)(X,A) and integer k>1>1 there exists a homomorphism

h∗:πk(X,A)→Hk(X,A)_*π_k(X,A)_k(X,A)
from relative homotopy groups to relative homology groups. The Relative Hurewicz Theorem states that if both X and A are connected and the pair is (n−1)(n-1)-connected then Hk(X,A)=0_k(X,A)=0 for k<n<n and Hn(X,A)_n(X,A) is obtained from πn(X,A)π_n(X,A) by factoring out the action of π1(A)π_1(A). This is proved in, for example, Whitehead (1978) by induction, proving in turn the absolute version and the Homotopy Addition Lemma.
This relative Hurewicz theorem is reformulated by Brown & Higgins (1981) as a statement about the morphism 

πn(X,A)→πn(X∪CA),π_n(X,A)→π_n(X),
where CA denotes the cone of A. This statement is a special case of a homotopical excision theorem, involving induced modules for n>2>2 (crossed modules if n=2=2), which itself is deduced from a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem for relative homotopy groups, whose proof requires development of techniques of a cubical higher homotopy groupoid of a filtered space.

Triadic version[edit]
For any triad of spaces (X;A,B)(X;A,B) (i.e., a space X and subspaces A, B) and integer k>2>2 there exists a homomorphism

h∗:πk(X;A,B)→Hk(X;A,B)_*π_k(X;A,B)_k(X;A,B)
from triad homotopy groups to triad homology groups. Note that 

Hk(X;A,B)≅Hk(X∪(C(A∪B)))._k(X;A,B)_k(X∪(C(A))).
The Triadic Hurewicz Theorem states that if X, A, B, and C=A∩B=A are connected, the pairs (A,C)(A,C) and (B,C)(B,C) are (p−1)(p-1)-connected and (q−1)(q-1)-connected, respectively, and the triad (X;A,B)(X;A,B) is (p+q−2)(p+q-2)-connected, then Hk(X;A,B)=0_k(X;A,B)=0 for k<p+q−2<p+q-2 and Hp+q−1(X;A)_p+q-1(X;A) is obtained from πp+q−1(X;A,B)π_p+q-1(X;A,B) by factoring out the action of π1(A∩B)π_1(A) and the generalised Whitehead products. The proof of this theorem uses a higher homotopy van Kampen type theorem for triadic homotopy groups, which requires a notion of the fundamental catncat^n-group of an n-cube of spaces.

Simplicial set version[edit]
The Hurewicz theorem for topological spaces can also be stated for n-connected simplicial sets satisfying the Kan condition.[2]

Rational Hurewicz theorem[edit]
Rational Hurewicz theorem:[3][4] Let X be a simply connected topological space with πi(X)⊗Q=0π_i(X)⊗ℚ=0 for i≤r. Then the Hurewicz map 

h⊗Q:πi(X)⊗Q⟶Hi(X;Q)⊗ℚπ_i(X)⊗ℚ_i(X;ℚ)
induces an isomorphism for 1≤i≤2r1≤2r and a surjection for i=2r+1=2r+1.
