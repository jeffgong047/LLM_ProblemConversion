In mathematics and statistics, Skorokhod's representation theorem is a result that shows that a weakly convergent sequence of probability measures whose limit measure is sufficiently well-behaved can be represented as the distribution/law of a pointwise convergent sequence of random variables defined on a common probability space. It is named for the Soviet mathematician A. V. Skorokhod.

Statement[edit]
Let (μn)n∈N(μ_n)_n∈ℕ be a sequence of probability measures on a metric space S such that μnμ_n converges weakly to some probability measure μ∞μ_∞ on S as n→∞→∞.  Suppose also that the support of μ∞μ_∞ is separable. Then there exist S-valued random variables Xn_n defined on a common probability space (Ω,F,P)(Ω,ℱ,𝐏) such that the law of Xn_n is μnμ_n for all n (including n=∞=∞) and such that (Xn)n∈N(X_n)_n∈ℕ converges to X∞_∞, P𝐏-almost surely.
