A positive Dehn twist applied to the cylinder modifies the green curve as shown.
In geometric topology, a branch of mathematics, a Dehn twist is a certain type of self-homeomorphism of a surface (two-dimensional manifold).


Definition[edit]
General Dehn twist on a compact surface represented by a n-gon.
Suppose that c is a simple closed curve in a closed, orientable surface S.  Let A be a tubular neighborhood of c.  Then A is an annulus, homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of a circle and a unit interval I: 

c‚äÇA‚âÖS1√óI.^1.
Give A coordinates (s, t) where s is a complex number of the form eiŒ∏^iŒ∏ with Œ∏‚àà[0,2œÄ],Œ∏‚àà[0,2œÄ], and t ‚àà [0, 1].  
Let f be the map from S to itself which is the identity outside of A and inside A we have

f(s,t)=(sei2œÄt,t).(s,t)=(se^i2,t).
Then f is a Dehn twist about the curve c.  
Dehn twists can also be defined on a non-orientable surface S, provided one starts with a 2-sided simple closed curve c on S.

Example[edit]
An example of a Dehn twist on the torus, along the closed curve a, in blue, where a is an edge of the fundamental polygon representing the torus.
The automorphism on the fundamental group of the torus induced by the self-homeomorphism of the Dehn twist along one of the generators of the torus.
Consider the torus represented by a fundamental polygon with edges a and b

T2‚âÖR2/Z2.ùïã^2‚âÖ‚Ñù^2/‚Ñ§^2.
Let a closed curve be the line along the edge a called Œ≥aŒ≥_a.
Given the choice of gluing homeomorphism in the figure, a tubular neighborhood of the curve Œ≥aŒ≥_a will look like a band linked around a doughnut. This neighborhood is homeomorphic to an annulus, say 

a(0;0,1)=z‚ààC:0<|z|<1(0;0,1)={z‚àà‚ÑÇ:0<|z|<1}
in the complex plane.
By extending to the torus the twisting map (eiŒ∏,t)‚Ü¶(ei(Œ∏+2œÄt),t)(e^iŒ∏,t)‚Ü¶(e^i(Œ∏+2),t) of the annulus, through the homeomorphisms of the annulus to an open cylinder to the neighborhood of Œ≥aŒ≥_a, yields a Dehn twist of the torus by a.

This self homeomorphism acts on the closed curve along b. In the tubular neighborhood it takes the curve of b once along the curve of¬†a.
A homeomorphism between topological spaces induces a natural isomorphism between their fundamental groups. Therefore one has an automorphism

Ta‚àó:œÄ1(T2)‚ÜíœÄ1(T2):[x]‚Ü¶[Ta(x)]T_a_‚àó:œÄ_1(ùïã^2)‚ÜíœÄ_1(ùïã^2):[x]‚Ü¶[T_a(x)]
where [x] are the homotopy classes of the closed curve x in the torus. Notice Ta‚àó([a])=[a]T_a_‚àó([a])=[a] and Ta‚àó([b])=[b‚àóa]T_a_‚àó([b])=[b*a], where b‚àóa*a is the path travelled around b then a.

Mapping class group[edit]
The 3g ‚àí 1 curves from the twist theorem, shown here for g = 3.
It is a theorem of Max Dehn that maps of this form generate the mapping class group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of any closed, oriented genus-g surface. W. B. R. Lickorish later rediscovered this result with a simpler proof and in addition showed that Dehn twists along 3g‚àí13g-1 explicit curves generate the mapping class group (this is called by the punning name "Lickorish twist theorem"); this number was later improved by Stephen P. Humphries to 2g+12g+1, for g>1>1, which he showed was the minimal number.  
Lickorish also obtained an analogous result for non-orientable surfaces, which require not only Dehn twists, but also "Y-homeomorphisms."
