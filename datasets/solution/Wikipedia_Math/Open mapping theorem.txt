Condition for a linear operator to be open
In functional analysis, the open mapping theorem, also known as the Banach–Schauder theorem or the Banach theorem[1] (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder), is a fundamental result which states that if a bounded or continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map.


Classical (Banach space) form[edit]

Open mapping theorem for Banach spaces (Rudin 1973, Theorem 2.11) — If X and Y are Banach spaces and A:X→Y:X is a surjective continuous linear operator, then A is an open map (that is, if U is an open set in X,, then A(U)(U) is open in Y).


This proof uses the Baire category theorem, and completeness of both X and Y is essential to the theorem.  The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a normed space, but is true if X and Y are taken to be Fréchet spaces.




Proof



Suppose A:X→Y:X is a surjective continuous linear operator. In order to prove that A is an open map, it is sufficient to show that A maps the open unit ball in X to a neighborhood of the origin of Y..
Let U=B1X(0),V=B1Y(0).=B_1^X(0),V=B_1^Y(0).
Then
X=⋃k∈NkU.=⋃_k∈ℕkU.
Since A is surjective:
Y=A(X)=A(⋃k∈NkU)=⋃k∈NA(kU).=A(X)=A(⋃_k∈ℕkU)=⋃_k∈ℕA(kU).
But Y is Banach so by Baire's category theorem
∃k∈N:(A(kU)¯)∘≠∅.∈ℕ:    (A(kU))^∘≠∅.
That is, we have c∈Y and r>0>0 such that
Br(c)⊆(A(kU)¯)∘⊆A(kU)¯._r(c)⊆(A(kU))^∘⊆A(kU).
Let v∈V,, then
c,c+rv∈Br(c)⊆A(kU)¯.,c+rv_r(c)⊆A(kU).
By continuity of addition and linearity, the difference rv satisfies
rv∈A(kU)¯+A(kU)¯⊆A(kU)+A(kU)¯⊆A(2kU)¯,∈A(kU)+A(kU)⊆A(kU)+A(kU)⊆A(2kU),
and by linearity again,
V⊆A(LU)¯⊆A(LU)
where we have set L=2k/r.=2k/r.
It follows that for all y∈Y and all ϵ>0,ϵ>0, there exists some x∈X such that
‖x‖X≤L‖y‖Yand‖y−Ax‖Y<ϵ.(1)    x_Xy_Y  and  y-Ax_Y<ϵ.    (1)
Our next goal is to show that V⊆A(2LU).(2LU).
Let y∈V..
By (1), there is some x1_1 with ‖x1‖<Lx_1<L and ‖y−Ax1‖<1/2.y-Ax_1<1/2.
Define a sequence (xn)(x_n) inductively as follows.
Assume:
‖xn‖<L2n−1and‖y−A(x1+x2+⋯+xn)‖<12n.(2)x_n<L/2^n-1  and  y-A(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n)<1/2^n.    (2)
Then by (1) we can pick xn+1_n+1 so that:
‖xn+1‖<L2nand‖y−A(x1+x2+⋯+xn)−A(xn+1)‖<12n+1,x_n+1<L/2^n  and  y-A(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n)-A(x_n+1)<1/2^n+1,
so (2) is satisfied for xn+1._n+1. Let
sn=x1+x2+⋯+xn._n=x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n.
From the first inequality in (2), (sn)(s_n)is a Cauchy sequence, and since X is complete, sn_n converges to some x∈X..
By (2), the sequence Asn_n tends to y and so Ax=y=y by continuity of A..
Also,
‖x‖=limn→∞‖sn‖≤∑n=1∞‖xn‖<2L.x=lim_n→∞s_n≤∑_n=1^∞x_n<2L.
This shows that y belongs to A(2LU),(2LU), so V⊆A(2LU)(2LU) as claimed.
Thus the image A(U)(U) of the unit ball in X contains the open ball V/2L/2L of Y..
Hence, A(U)(U) is a neighborhood of the origin in Y,, and this concludes the proof.


Related results[edit]

Theorem[2] — Let X and Y be Banach spaces, let BX_X and BY_Y denote their open unit balls, and let T:X→Y:X be a bounded linear operator.
If δ>0δ>0 then among the following four statements we have (1)⟹(2)⟹(3)⟹(4)(1)(2)(3)(4) (with the same δδ)

‖T∗y∗‖≥δ‖y∗‖T^*y^*≥δy^* for all y∗∈Y∗^*^*;
T(BX)¯⊇δBYT(B_X)⊇_Y;
T(BX)⊇δBYT(B_X)⊇_Y;
Im⁡T=YImT=Y (that is, T is surjective).
Furthermore, if  T is surjective then (1) holds for some δ>0δ>0


Consequences[edit]
The open mapping theorem has several important consequences:

If A:X→Y:X is a bijective continuous linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y,, then the inverse operator A−1:Y→X^-1:Y is continuous as well (this is called the bounded inverse theorem).[3]
If A:X→Y:X is a linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y,, and if for every sequence (xn)(x_n) in X with xn→0_n→0 and Axn→y_n it follows that y=0,=0, then A is continuous (the closed graph theorem).[4]
Generalizations[edit]
Local convexity of X or Y  is not essential to the proof, but completeness is: the theorem remains true in the case when X and Y are F-spaces.  Furthermore, the theorem can be combined with the Baire category theorem in the following manner:


Open mapping theorem for continuous maps[5][6] — Let A:X→Y:X be a continuous linear operator from a complete pseudometrizable TVS X onto a Hausdorff TVS Y..
If Im⁡AImA is nonmeager in Y then A:X→Y:X is a (surjective) open map and Y is a complete pseudometrizable TVS.
Moreover, if X is assumed to be hausdorff (i.e. a F-space), then Y is also an F-space.


Furthermore, in this latter case if N is the kernel of A,, then there is a canonical factorization of A in the form
X→X/N→αY/Nα→Y
where X/N/N is the quotient space (also an F-space) of X by the closed subspace N..
The quotient mapping X→X/N/N is open, and the mapping αα is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces.[7]
An important special case of this theorem can also be stated as


Theorem[8] — Let X and Y be two F-spaces. Then every continuous linear map of X onto Y is a TVS homomorphism,
where a linear map u:X→Y:X is a topological vector space (TVS) homomorphism if the induced map u^:X/ker⁡(u)→Yû:X/(u) is a TVS-isomorphism onto its image.


On the other hand, a more general formulation which implies the first can be given:


Open mapping theorem[6] — Let A:X→Y:X be a surjective linear map from a complete pseudometrizable TVS X onto a TVS Y and suppose that at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

Y is a Baire space, or
X is locally convex and Y is a barrelled space,
If A is a closed linear operator then A is an open mapping.
If A is a continuous linear operator and Y is Hausdorff then A is (a closed linear operator and thus also) an open mapping.


Nearly/Almost open linear maps
A linear map A:X→Y:X between two topological vector spaces (TVSs) is called a nearly open map (or sometimes, an almost open map) if for every neighborhood U of the origin in the domain, the closure of its image cl⁡A(U)clA(U) is a neighborhood of the origin in Y..[9]  Many authors use a different definition of "nearly/almost open map" that requires that the closure of A(U)(U) be a neighborhood of the origin in A(X)(X) rather than in Y,,[9] but for surjective maps these definitions are equivalent.
A bijective linear map is nearly open if and only if its inverse is continuous.[9]
Every surjective linear map from locally convex TVS onto a barrelled TVS is nearly open.[10] The same is true of every surjective linear map from a TVS onto a Baire TVS.[10]


Open mapping theorem[11] — If a closed surjective linear map from a complete pseudometrizable TVS onto a Hausdorff TVS is nearly open then it is open.


Consequences[edit]

Theorem[12] — If A:X→Y:X is a continuous linear bijection from a complete Pseudometrizable topological vector space (TVS) onto a Hausdorff TVS that is a Baire space, then A:X→Y:X is a homeomorphism (and thus an isomorphism of TVSs).
