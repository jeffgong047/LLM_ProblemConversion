In mathematics, a Parovicenko space is a topological space similar to the space of non-isolated points of the Stone–Čech compactification of the integers.

Definition[edit]
A Parovicenko space is a topological space X satisfying the following conditions:

X is compact Hausdorff
X has no isolated points
X has weight c, the cardinality of the continuum (this is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology).
Every two disjoint open Fσ subsets of X have disjoint closures
Every non-empty Gδ of X has non-empty interior.
Properties[edit]
The space βN\N is a Parovicenko space, where βN is the Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers N. Parovicenko (1963) proved that the continuum hypothesis implies that every Parovicenko space is isomorphic[clarification needed] to βN\N. van Douwen & van Mill (1978) showed that if the continuum hypothesis is false then there are other examples of Parovicenko spaces.
