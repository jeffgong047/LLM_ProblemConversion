Theorem in measure theory

In mathematics, the disintegration theorem is a result in measure theory and probability theory. It rigorously defines the idea of a non-trivial "restriction" of a measure to a measure zero subset of the measure space in question. It is related to the existence of conditional probability measures. In a sense, "disintegration" is the opposite process to the construction of a product measure.


Motivation[edit]
Consider the unit square in the Euclidean plane R2ℝ^2, S=[0,1]×[0,1]=[0,1]×[0,1]. Consider the probability measure μμ defined on S by the restriction of two-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ2λ^2 to S. That is, the probability of an event E⊆S is simply the area of E. We assume E  is a measurable subset of S.
Consider a one-dimensional subset of S such as the line segment Lx=x×[0,1]_x={x}×[0,1]. Lx_x has μμ-measure zero; every subset of Lx_x is a μμ-null set; since the Lebesgue measure space is a complete measure space,
E⊆Lx⟹μ(E)=0._xμ(E)=0.
While true, this is somewhat unsatisfying. It would be nice to say that μμ "restricted to" Lx_x is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ1λ^1, rather than the zero measure. The probability of a "two-dimensional" event E could then be obtained as an integral of the one-dimensional probabilities of the vertical "slices" E∩Lx_x: more formally, if μxμ_x denotes one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on Lx_x, then
μ(E)=∫[0,1]μx(E∩Lx)dxμ(E)=∫_[0,1]μ_x(E_x) dx
for any "nice" E⊆S. The disintegration theorem makes this argument rigorous in the context of measures on metric spaces.

Statement of the theorem[edit]
(Hereafter, P(X)𝒫(X) will denote the collection of Borel probability measures on a topological space (X,T)(X,T).)
The assumptions of the theorem are as follows:

Let Y and X be two Radon spaces (i.e. a topological space such that every Borel probability measure on it is inner regular, e.g. separably metrizable spaces; in particular, every probability measure on it is outright a Radon measure).
Let μ∈P(Y)μ∈𝒫(Y).
Let π:Y→Xπ:Y be a Borel-measurable function. Here one should think of ππ as a function to "disintegrate" Y, in the sense of partitioning Y into π−1(x)|x∈X{π^-1(x)}. For example, for the motivating example above, one can define π((a,b))=aπ((a,b))=a, (a,b)∈[0,1]×[0,1](a,b)∈[0,1]×[0,1], which gives that π−1(a)=a×[0,1]π^-1(a)=a×[0,1], a slice we want to capture.
Let ν∈P(X)ν∈𝒫(X) be the pushforward measure ν=π∗(μ)=μ∘π−1ν=π_*(μ)=μ∘π^-1. This measure provides the distribution of x (which corresponds to the events π−1(x)π^-1(x)).
The conclusion of the theorem: There exists a νν-almost everywhere uniquely determined family of probability measures μxx∈X⊆P(Y){μ_x}_x⊆𝒫(Y), which provides a "disintegration" of μμ into μxx∈X{μ_x}_x, such that:

the function x↦μx↦μ_x is Borel measurable, in the sense that x↦μx(B)↦μ_x(B) is a Borel-measurable function for each Borel-measurable set B⊆Y;
μxμ_x "lives on" the fiber π−1(x)π^-1(x): for νν-almost all x∈X, μx(Y∖π−1(x))=0,μ_x(Y∖π^-1(x))=0, and so μx(E)=μx(E∩π−1(x))μ_x(E)=μ_x(E∩π^-1(x));
for every Borel-measurable function f:Y→[0,∞]:Y→[0,∞], ∫Yf(y)dμ(y)=∫X∫π−1(x)f(y)dμx(y)dν(x).∫_Yf(y) dμ(y)=∫_X∫_π^-1(x)f(y) dμ_x(y)dν(x). In particular, for any event E⊆Y, taking f to be the indicator function of E,[1] μ(E)=∫Xμx(E)dν(x).μ(E)=∫_Xμ_x(E) dν(x).

The original example was a special case of the problem of product spaces, to which the disintegration theorem applies.
When Y is written as a Cartesian product Y=X1×X2=X_1_2 and πi:Y→Xiπ_i:Y_i is the natural projection, then each fibre π1−1(x1)π_1^-1(x_1) can be canonically identified with X2_2 and there exists a Borel family of probability measures μx1x1∈X1{μ_x_1}_x_1_1 in P(X2)𝒫(X_2) (which is (π1)∗(μ)(π_1)_*(μ)-almost everywhere uniquely determined) such that
μ=∫X1μx1μ(π1−1(dx1))=∫X1μx1d(π1)∗(μ)(x1),μ=∫_X_1μ_x_1 μ(π_1^-1(dx_1))=∫_X_1μ_x_1 d(π_1)_*(μ)(x_1),
which is in particular[clarification needed]
∫X1×X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx1,dx2)=∫X1(∫X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx2|x1))μ(π1−1(dx1))∫_X_1_2f(x_1,x_2) μ(dx_1,dx_2)=∫_X_1(∫_X_2f(x_1,x_2)μ(dx_2|x_1))μ(π_1^-1(dx_1))
and
μ(A×B)=∫Aμ(B|x1)μ(π1−1(dx1)).μ(A)=∫_Aμ(B|x_1) μ(π_1^-1(dx_1)).
The relation to conditional expectation is given by the identities
E⁡(f|π1)(x1)=∫X2f(x1,x2)μ(dx2|x1),E(f|π_1)(x_1)=∫_X_2f(x_1,x_2)μ(dx_2|x_1),
μ(A×B|π1)(x1)=1A(x1)⋅μ(B|x1).μ(A|π_1)(x_1)=1_A(x_1)·μ(B|x_1).

Vector calculus[edit]
The disintegration theorem can also be seen as justifying the use of a "restricted" measure in vector calculus. For instance, in Stokes' theorem as applied to a vector field flowing through a compact surface Σ⊂R3Σ⊂ℝ^3, it is implicit that the "correct" measure on ΣΣ is the disintegration of three-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ3λ^3 on ΣΣ, and that the disintegration of this measure on ∂Σ is the same as the disintegration of λ3λ^3 on ∂Σ∂Σ.[2]

Conditional distributions[edit]
The disintegration theorem can be applied to give a rigorous treatment of conditional probability distributions in statistics, while avoiding purely abstract formulations of conditional probability.[3]
