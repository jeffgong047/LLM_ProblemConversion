How well a certain kind of real number can be approximated by another kind
In mathematics, specifically the area of Diophantine approximation, the Davenport–Schmidt theorem tells us how well a certain kind of real number can be approximated by another kind.  Specifically it tells us that we can get a good approximation to irrational numbers that are not quadratic by using either quadratic irrationals or simply rational numbers.  It is named after Harold Davenport and Wolfgang M. Schmidt.


Statement[edit]
Given a number α which is either rational or a quadratic irrational, we can find unique integers x, y, and z such that x, y, and z are not all zero, the first non-zero one among them is positive, they are relatively prime, and we have

xα2+yα+z=0.α^2+yα+z=0.
If α is a quadratic irrational we can take x, y, and z to be the coefficients of its minimal polynomial.  If α is rational we will have x = 0.  With these integers uniquely determined for each such α we can define the height of α to be

H(α)=max|x|,|y|,|z|.(α)=max{|x|,|y|,|z|}.
The theorem then says that for any real number ξ which is neither rational nor a quadratic irrational, we can find infinitely many real numbers α which are rational or quadratic irrationals and which satisfy

|ξ−α|<CH(α)−3max(1,ξ2),|ξ-α|<CH(α)^-3max(1,ξ^2),
where C is any real number satisfying C > 160/9.[1]
While the theorem is related to Roth's theorem, its real use lies in the fact that it is effective, in the sense that the constant C can be worked out for any given ξ.
