In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the Skolem–Noether theorem characterizes the automorphisms of simple rings. It is a fundamental result in the theory of central simple algebras.
The theorem was first published by Thoralf Skolem in 1927 in his paper Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme (German: On the theory of associative number systems) and later rediscovered by Emmy Noether.


Statement[edit]
In a general formulation, let A and B be simple unitary rings, and let k be the center of B. The center k is a field since given x nonzero in k, the simplicity of B implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal BxB = (x) is the whole of B, and hence that x is a unit. If the dimension of B over k is finite, i.e. if B is a central simple algebra of finite dimension, and A is also a k-algebra, then given k-algebra homomorphisms

f, g : A → B,
there exists a unit b in B such that for all a in A[1][2]

g(a) = b · f(a) · b−1.
In particular, every automorphism of a central simple k-algebra is an inner automorphism.[3][4]

Proof[edit]
First suppose B=Mn⁡(k)=Endk⁡(kn)=M_n(k)=End_k(k^n). Then f and g define the actions of A on kn^n; let Vf,Vg_f,V_g denote the A-modules thus obtained. Since f(1)=1≠0(1)=1≠0 the map f is injective by simplicity of A, so A is also finite-dimensional. Hence two simple A-modules are isomorphic and Vf,Vg_f,V_g are finite direct sums of simple A-modules. Since they have the same dimension, it follows that there is an isomorphism of A-modules b:Vg→Vf:V_g_f. But such b must be an element of Mn⁡(k)=BM_n(k)=B. For the general case, B⊗kBop⊗_kB^op is a matrix algebra and that A⊗kBop⊗_kB^op is simple. By the first part applied to the maps f⊗1,g⊗1:A⊗kBop→B⊗kBop⊗1,g⊗1:A⊗_kB^op⊗_kB^op, there exists b∈B⊗kBop⊗_kB^op such that

(f⊗1)(a⊗z)=b(g⊗1)(a⊗z)b−1(f⊗1)(a)=b(g⊗1)(a)b^-1
for all a∈A and z∈Bop^op. Taking a=1=1, we find

1⊗z=b(1⊗z)b−11=b(1)b^-1
for all z. That is to say, b is in ZB⊗Bop(k⊗Bop)=B⊗k_B^op(k^op)=B and so we can write b=b′⊗1=b'⊗1. Taking z=1=1 this time we find

f(a)=b′g(a)b′−1(a)=b'g(a)b'^-1,
which is what was sought.
