In mathematics, specifically in the study of ordinary differential equations, the Peano existence theorem, Peano theorem or Cauchy–Peano theorem, named after Giuseppe Peano and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a fundamental theorem which guarantees the existence of solutions to certain initial value problems.


History[edit]
Peano first published the theorem in 1886 with an incorrect proof.[1] In 1890 he published a new correct proof using successive approximations.[2]

Theorem[edit]
Let D be an open subset of R×Rℝ×ℝ with f:D→R→ℝ
a continuous function and y′(x)=f(x,y(x))'(x)=f(x,y(x))
a continuous, explicit first-order differential equation defined on D, then every initial value problem y(x0)=y0(x_0)=y_0
for f with (x0,y0)∈D(x_0,y_0)
has a local solution z:I→R→ℝ
where I is a neighbourhood of x0_0 in Rℝ,
such that z′(x)=f(x,z(x))'(x)=f(x,z(x)) for all x∈I.[3]
The solution need not be unique: one and the same initial value (x0,y0)(x_0,y_0) may give rise to many different solutions z.

Proof[edit]
By replacing y with y−y0-y_0, x with x−x0-x_0, we may assume x0=y0=0_0=y_0=0. As D is open there is a rectangle R=[−x1,x1]×[−y1,y1]⊂D=[-x_1,x_1]×[-y_1,y_1].
Because R is compact and f is continuous, we have supR|f|≤C<∞sup_R|f|<∞ and by the Stone–Weierstrass theorem there exists a sequence of Lipschitz functions fk:R→R_k:R→ℝ converging uniformly to f in R. Without loss of generality, we assume supR|fk|≤2Csup_R|f_k|≤2C for all k.
We define Picard iterations yk,n:I=[−x2,x2]→R_k,n:I=[-x_2,x_2]→ℝ as follows, where x2=minx1,y1/(2C)_2=min{x_1,y_1/(2C)}. yk,0(x)≡0_k,0(x)≡0, and yk,n+1(x)=∫0xfk(x′,yk,n(x′))dx′_k,n+1(x)=∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k,n(x')) dx'. They are well-defined by induction: as

|yk,n+1(x)|≤|∫0x|fk(x′,yk,n(x′))|dx′|≤|x|supR|fk|≤x2⋅2C≤y1,|y_k,n+1(x)|   ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',y_k,n(x'))| dx'|
   ≤|x|sup_R|f_k|
   _2·2C_1,
(x′,yk,n+1(x′))(x',y_k,n+1(x')) is within the domain of fk_k.
We have

|yk,n+1(x)−yk,n(x)|≤|∫0x|fk(x′,yk,n(x′))−fk(x′,yk,n−1(x′))|dx′|≤Lk|∫0x|yk,n(x′)−yk,n−1(x′)|dx′|,|y_k,n+1(x)-y_k,n(x)|   ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',y_k,n(x'))-f_k(x',y_k,n-1(x'))| dx'|
   ≤_k|∫_0^x|y_k,n(x')-y_k,n-1(x')| dx'|,
where Lk_k is the Lipschitz constant of fk_k. Thus for maximal difference Mk,n(x)=supx′∈[0,x]|yk,n+1(x′)−yk,n(x′)|_k,n(x)=sup_x'∈[0,x]|y_k,n+1(x')-y_k,n(x')|, we have a bound Mk,n(x)≤Lk|∫0xMk,n−1(x′)dx′|_k,n(x)_k|∫_0^xM_k,n-1(x') dx'|, and

Mk,0(x)≤|∫0x|fk(x′,0)|dx′|≤|x|supR|fk|≤2C|x|.M_k,0(x)   ≤|∫_0^x|f_k(x',0)| dx'|
   ≤|x|sup_R|f_k|≤2C|x|.
By induction, this implies the bound Mk,n(x)≤2CLkn|x|n+1/(n+1)!_k,n(x)≤2CL_k^n|x|^n+1/(n+1)! which tends to zero as n→∞→∞ for all x∈I.
The functions yk,n_k,n are equicontinuous as for −x2≤x<x′≤x2-x_2<x'_2 we have

|yk,n+1(x′)−yk,n+1(x)|≤∫xx′|fk(x″,yk,n(x″))|dx″≤|x′−x|supR|fk|≤2C|x′−x|,|y_k,n+1(x')-y_k,n+1(x)|   ≤∫_x^x'|f_k(x”,y_k,n(x”))| dx”
   ≤|x'-x|sup_R|f_k|≤2C|x'-x|,
so by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem they are relatively compact. In particular, for each k there is a subsequence (yk,φk(n))n∈N(y_k,φ_k(n))_n∈ℕ
converging uniformly to a continuous function yk:I→R_k:I→ℝ. Taking limit
n→∞→∞ in

|yk,φk(n)(x)−∫0xfk(x′,yk,φk(n)(x′))dx′|=|yk,φk(n)(x)−yk,φk(n)+1(x)|≤Mk,φk(n)(x2)|y_k,φ_k(n)(x)-∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k,φ_k(n)(x')) dx'|   =|y_k,φ_k(n)(x)-y_k,φ_k(n)+1(x)|
   _k,φ_k(n)(x_2)
we conclude that yk(x)=∫0xfk(x′,yk(x′))dx′_k(x)=∫_0^xf_k(x',y_k(x')) dx'. The functions yk_k are in the closure of a relatively compact set, so they are themselves relatively compact. Thus there is a subsequence yψ(k)_ψ(k) converging uniformly to a continuous function z:I→R:I→ℝ. Taking limit k→∞→∞ in yψ(k)(x)=∫0xfψ(k)(x′,yψ(k)(x′))dx′_ψ(k)(x)=∫_0^xf_ψ(k)(x',y_ψ(k)(x')) dx' we conclude that z(x)=∫0xf(x′,z(x′))dx′(x)=∫_0^xf(x',z(x')) dx', using the fact that fψ(k)_ψ(k) are equicontinuous by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, z′(x)=f(x,z(x))'(x)=f(x,z(x)) in I.

Related theorems[edit]
The Peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem both assumes more and concludes more. It requires Lipschitz continuity, while the Peano theorem requires only continuity; but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the Peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions. To illustrate, consider the ordinary differential equation

y′=|y|12'=|^1/2 on the domain [0,1].[0,1].
According to the Peano theorem, this equation has solutions, but the Picard–Lindelöf theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0. Thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness. It turns out that this ordinary differential equation has two kinds of solutions when starting at y(0)=0(0)=0, either y(x)=0(x)=0 or y(x)=x2/4(x)=x^2/4. The transition between y=0=0 and y=(x−C)2/4=(x-C)^2/4 can happen at any C.
The Carathéodory existence theorem is a generalization of the Peano existence theorem with weaker conditions than continuity.
