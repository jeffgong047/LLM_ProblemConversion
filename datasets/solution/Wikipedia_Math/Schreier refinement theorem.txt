In mathematics, the Schreier refinement theorem of group theory states that any two subnormal series of subgroups of a given group have equivalent refinements, where two series are equivalent if there is a bijection between their factor groups that sends each factor group to an isomorphic one.
The theorem is named after the Austrian mathematician Otto Schreier who proved it in 1928. It provides an elegant proof of the Jordan–Hölder theorem. It is often proved using the Zassenhaus lemma. Baumslag (2006) gives a short proof by intersecting the terms in one subnormal series with those in the other series.

Example[edit]
Consider Z2×S3ℤ_2_3, where S3_3 is the symmetric group of degree 3.  The alternating group A3_3 is a normal subgroup of S3_3, so we have the two subnormal series


0×(1)◃Z2×(1)◃Z2×S3,{0}×{(1)} ◃ ℤ_2×{(1)} ◃ ℤ_2_3,
0×(1)◃0×A3◃Z2×S3,{0}×{(1)} ◃ {0}_3 ◃ ℤ_2_3,

with respective factor groups (Z2,S3)(ℤ_2,S_3) and (A3,Z2×Z2)(A_3,ℤ_2×ℤ_2).
The two subnormal series are not equivalent, but they have equivalent refinements:

0×(1)◃Z2×(1)◃Z2×A3◃Z2×S3{0}×{(1)} ◃ ℤ_2×{(1)} ◃ ℤ_2_3 ◃ ℤ_2_3
with factor groups isomorphic to (Z2,A3,Z2)(ℤ_2,A_3,ℤ_2) and

0×(1)◃0×A3◃0×S3◃Z2×S3{0}×{(1)} ◃ {0}_3 ◃ {0}_3 ◃ ℤ_2_3
with factor groups isomorphic to (A3,Z2,Z2)(A_3,ℤ_2,ℤ_2).
