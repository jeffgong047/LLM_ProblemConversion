Describes a property of the cevians of a triangle intersecting in a common point
Reuschle's theorem: cevians APa_a, APb_b and APc_c intersect in D  APa′'_a, APb′'_b and APc′'_c intersect in D′'
In elementary geometry, Reuschle's theorem describes a property of the cevians of a triangle intersecting in a common point and is named after the German mathematician Karl Gustav Reuschle (1812–1875). It is also known as Terquem's theorem after the French mathematician Olry Terquem (1782–1862), who published it in 1842.
In a triangle ABC with its three cevians intersecting in a common point other than the vertices A, B or C let Pa_a, Pb_b and Pc_c denote the intersections of the (extended) triangle sides and the cevians. The circle defined by the three points Pa_a, Pb_b and Pc_c intersects the (extended) triangle sides in the (additional) points Pa′'_a, Pb′'_b and Pc′'_c. Reuschle's theorem now states that the three new cevians APa′'_a, BPb′'_b and CPc′'_c intersect in a common point as well.
