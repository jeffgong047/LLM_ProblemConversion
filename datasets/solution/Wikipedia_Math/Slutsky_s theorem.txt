In probability theory, Slutsky’s theorem extends some properties of algebraic operations on convergent sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.[1]
The theorem was named after Eugen Slutsky.[2] Slutsky's theorem is also attributed to Harald Cramér.[3]


Statement[edit]
Let Xn,Yn_n,Y_n be sequences of scalar/vector/matrix random elements.
If  Xn_n converges in distribution to a random element X and Yn_n converges in probability to a constant c, then

Xn+Yn→dX+c;_n+Y_n{+c;
XnYn→dXc;_nY_n
xrightarrowd;
Xn/Yn→dX/c,_n/Y_n{/c,   provided that c is invertible,
where →d denotes convergence in distribution.
Notes:

The requirement that Yn converges to a constant is important — if it were to converge to a non-degenerate random variable, the theorem would be no longer valid. For example, let Xn∼Uniform(0,1)_n∼Uniform(0,1) and Yn=−Xn_n=-X_n.  The sum Xn+Yn=0_n+Y_n=0 for all values of n.  Moreover, Yn→dUniform(−1,0)_n  Uniform(-1,0), but Xn+Yn_n+Y_n does not converge in distribution to X+Y+Y, where X∼Uniform(0,1)∼Uniform(0,1), Y∼Uniform(−1,0)∼Uniform(-1,0), and X and Y are independent.[4]
The theorem remains valid if we replace all convergences in distribution with convergences in probability.
Proof[edit]
This theorem follows from the fact that if Xn converges in distribution to X and Yn converges in probability to a constant c, then the joint vector (Xn, Yn) converges in distribution to (X, c) (see here).
Next we apply the continuous mapping theorem, recognizing the functions g(x,y) = x + y, g(x,y) = xy, and g(x,y) = x y−1 are continuous (for the last function to be continuous, y has to be invertible).
