In projective geometry, an intersection theorem or incidence theorem is a statement concerning an incidence structure – consisting of points, lines, and possibly higher-dimensional objects and their incidences – together with a pair of objects A and B (for instance, a point and a line). The "theorem" states that, whenever a set of objects satisfies the incidences (i.e. can be identified with the objects of the incidence structure in such a way that incidence is preserved), then the objects A and B must also be incident. An intersection theorem is not necessarily true in all projective geometries; it is a property that some geometries satisfy but others don't.
For example, Desargues' theorem can be stated using the following incidence structure:

Points: A,B,C,a,b,c,P,Q,R,O{A,B,C,a,b,c,P,Q,R,O}
Lines: AB,AC,BC,ab,ac,bc,Aa,Bb,Cc,PQ{AB,AC,BC,ab,ac,bc,Aa,Bb,Cc,PQ}
Incidences (in addition to obvious ones such as (A,AB)(A,AB)): (O,Aa),(O,Bb),(O,Cc),(P,BC),(P,bc),(Q,AC),(Q,ac),(R,AB),(R,ab){(O,Aa),(O,Bb),(O,Cc),(P,BC),(P,bc),(Q,AC),(Q,ac),(R,AB),(R,ab)}
The implication is then (R,PQ)(R,PQ)—that point R is incident with line PQ.

Famous examples[edit]
Desargues' theorem holds in a projective plane P if and only if P is the projective plane over some division ring (skewfield} D — P=P2D=ℙ_2D. The projective plane is then called desarguesian.
A theorem of Amitsur and Bergman states that, in the context of desarguesian projective planes, for every intersection theorem there is a rational identity such that the plane P satisfies the intersection theorem if and only if the division ring D satisfies the rational identity.

Pappus's hexagon theorem holds in a desarguesian projective plane P2Dℙ_2D if and only if D is a field; it corresponds to the identity ∀a,b∈D,a⋅b=b⋅a,b,=b.
Fano's axiom (which states a certain intersection does not happen) holds in P2Dℙ_2D if and only if D has characteristic ≠2≠2; it corresponds to the identity a + a = 0.
