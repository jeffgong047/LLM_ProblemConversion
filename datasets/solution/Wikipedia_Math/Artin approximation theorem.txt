1969 result in deformation theory
In mathematics, the Artin approximation theorem is a fundamental result of Michael Artin (1969) in deformation theory which implies that formal power series with coefficients in a field k are well-approximated by the algebraic functions on k.
More precisely, Artin proved two such theorems: one, in 1968, on approximation of complex analytic solutions by formal solutions (in the case k=C=ℂ); and an algebraic version of this theorem in 1969.


Statement of the theorem[edit]
Let x=x1,…,xn𝐱=x_1,…,x_n denote a collection of n indeterminates, k[[x]][[𝐱]]  the ring of formal power series with indeterminates x𝐱 over a field k, and y=y1,…,yn𝐲=y_1,…,y_n a different set of indeterminates. Let 

f(x,y)=0(𝐱,𝐲)=0
be a system of polynomial equations in k[x,y][𝐱,𝐲], and c a positive integer. Then given a formal power series solution y^(x)∈k[[x]]𝐲̂(𝐱)[[𝐱]], there is an algebraic solution y(x)𝐲(𝐱) consisting of algebraic functions (more precisely, algebraic power series) such that 

y^(x)≡y(x)mod(x)c.𝐲̂(𝐱)≡𝐲(𝐱)(𝐱)^c.
Discussion[edit]
Given any desired positive integer c, this theorem shows that one can find an algebraic solution approximating a formal power series solution up to the degree specified by c. This leads to theorems that deduce the existence of certain formal moduli spaces of deformations as schemes. See also: Artin's criterion.

Alternative statement[edit]
The following alternative statement is given in Theorem 1.12 of Michael Artin (1969).
Let R be a field or an excellent discrete valuation ring, let A be the henselization at a prime ideal of an R-algebra of finite type, let m be a proper ideal of A, let A^Â be the m-adic completion of A, and let 

F:(A-algebras)→(sets),(A-algebras)→(sets),
be a functor sending filtered colimits to filtered colimits (Artin calls such a functor locally of finite presentation).  Then for any integer c and any ξ¯∈F(A^)ξ(Â), there is a ξ∈F(A)ξ(A) such that 

ξ¯≡ξmodmcξ≡ξm^c.
