The Skoda–El Mir theorem is a theorem of complex geometry, 
stated as follows:
Theorem (Skoda,[1] El Mir,[2] Sibony[3]).  Let X be a complex manifold, and 
E a closed complete pluripolar set in X. Consider a closed positive current ΘΘ on X∖E
which is locally integrable around E. Then the trivial extension of ΘΘ to X is closed on X.
