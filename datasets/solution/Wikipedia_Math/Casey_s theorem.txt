On four non-intersecting circles that lie inside  a bigger circle and tangent to it
In mathematics, Casey's theorem, also known as the generalized Ptolemy's theorem, is a theorem in Euclidean geometry named after the Irish mathematician John Casey.


Formulation of the theorem[edit]
t12⋅t34+t14⋅t23−t13⋅t24=0_12_34+t_14_23-t_13_24=0
Let O O be a circle of radius R R. Let O1,O2,O3,O4 O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4 be (in that order) four non-intersecting circles that lie inside O O and tangent to it. Denote by tij t_ij the length of the exterior common bitangent of the circles Oi,Oj O_i,O_j. Then:[1]

t12⋅t34+t14⋅t23=t13⋅t24. t_12_34+t_14_23=t_13_24.
Note that in the degenerate case, where all four circles reduce to points, this is exactly Ptolemy's theorem.

Proof[edit]
The following proof is attributable[2] to Zacharias.[3] Denote the radius of circle Oi O_i by Ri R_i and its tangency point with the circle O O by Ki K_i. We will use the notation O,Oi O,O_i for the centers of the circles.
Note that from Pythagorean theorem,

tij2=OiOj¯2−(Ri−Rj)2. t_ij^2=O_iO_j^2-(R_i-R_j)^2.
We will try to express this length in terms of the points Ki,Kj K_i,K_j. By the law of cosines in triangle OiOOj O_iOO_j,

OiOj¯2=OOi¯2+OOj¯2−2OOi¯⋅OOj¯⋅cos⁡∠OiOOjO_iO_j^2=OO_i^2+OO_j^2-2OO_i·OO_j·cos_iOO_j
Since the circles O,Oi O,O_i tangent to each other:

OOi¯=R−Ri,∠OiOOj=∠KiOKjOO_i=R-R_i, _iOO_j=_iOK_j
Let C C be a point on the circle O O. According to the law of sines in triangle KiCKj K_iCK_j:

KiKj¯=2R⋅sin⁡∠KiCKj=2R⋅sin⁡∠KiOKj2K_iK_j=2R·sin_iCK_j=2R·sin_iOK_j/2
Therefore,

cos⁡∠KiOKj=1−2sin2⁡∠KiOKj2=1−2⋅(KiKj¯2R)2=1−KiKj¯22R2cos_iOK_j=1-2sin^2_iOK_j/2=1-2·(K_iK_j/2R)^2=1-K_iK_j^2/2R^2
and substituting these in the formula above:

OiOj¯2=(R−Ri)2+(R−Rj)2−2(R−Ri)(R−Rj)(1−KiKj¯22R2)O_iO_j^2=(R-R_i)^2+(R-R_j)^2-2(R-R_i)(R-R_j)(1-K_iK_j^2/2R^2)
OiOj¯2=(R−Ri)2+(R−Rj)2−2(R−Ri)(R−Rj)+(R−Ri)(R−Rj)⋅KiKj¯2R2O_iO_j^2=(R-R_i)^2+(R-R_j)^2-2(R-R_i)(R-R_j)+(R-R_i)(R-R_j)·K_iK_j^2/R^2
OiOj¯2=((R−Ri)−(R−Rj))2+(R−Ri)(R−Rj)⋅KiKj¯2R2O_iO_j^2=((R-R_i)-(R-R_j))^2+(R-R_i)(R-R_j)·K_iK_j^2/R^2
And finally, the length we seek is

tij=OiOj¯2−(Ri−Rj)2=R−Ri⋅R−Rj⋅KiKj¯R_ij=√(O_iO_j^2-(R_i-R_j)^2)=√(R-R_i)·√(R-R_j)·K_iK_j/R
We can now evaluate the left hand side, with the help of the original Ptolemy's theorem applied to the inscribed quadrilateral K1K2K3K4 K_1K_2K_3K_4:

t12t34+t14t23=1R2⋅R−R1R−R2R−R3R−R4(K1K2¯⋅K3K4¯+K1K4¯⋅K2K3¯)=1R2⋅R−R1R−R2R−R3R−R4(K1K3¯⋅K2K4¯)=t13t24   t_12t_34+t_14t_23
=   1/R^2·√(R-R_1)√(R-R_2)√(R-R_3)√(R-R_4)(K_1K_2·K_3K_4+K_1K_4·K_2K_3)
=   1/R^2·√(R-R_1)√(R-R_2)√(R-R_3)√(R-R_4)(K_1K_3·K_2K_4)
=   t_13t_24
Further generalizations[edit]
It can be seen that the four circles need not lie inside the big circle. In fact, they may be tangent to it from the outside as well. In that case, the following change should be made:[4]


If Oi,Oj O_i,O_j are both tangent from the same side of O O (both in or both out), tij t_ij is the length of the exterior common tangent.


If Oi,Oj O_i,O_j are tangent from different sides of O O (one in and one out), tij t_ij is the length of the interior common tangent.


The converse of Casey's theorem is also true.[4] That is, if equality holds, the circles are tangent to a common circle.

Applications[edit]
Casey's theorem and its converse can be used to prove a variety of statements in Euclidean geometry. For example, the shortest known proof[1]: 411  of Feuerbach's theorem uses the converse theorem.
