Invariant cord in one of two intersecting circles based on any point in the other
constant chord length: |P1Q1|=|P2Q2||P_1Q_1|=|P_2Q_2|
constant diameter length: |P1Q1|=|P2Q2||P_1Q_1|=|P_2Q_2|
The constant chord theorem is a statement in elementary geometry about a property of certain chords in two intersecting circles.
The circles k1_1 and k2_2 intersect in the points P and Q. Z1_1 is an arbitrary point on k1_1 being different from  P and Q. The lines Z1P_1P and Z1Q_1Q intersect the circle k2_2 in P1_1 and Q1_1. The constant chord theorem then states that the length of the chord P1Q1_1Q_1 in k2_2 does not depend on the location of Z1_1 on k1_1, in other words the length is constant.
The theorem stays valid when Z1_1 coincides with P or Q, provided one replaces the then undefined line Z1P_1P or Z1Q_1Q by the tangent on k1_1 at Z1_1. 
A similar theorem exists in three dimensions for the intersection of two spheres. The spheres k1_1 and k2_2 intersect in the circle ks_s. Z1_1 is arbitrary point on the surface of the first sphere k1_1, that is not on the intersection circle ks_s. The extended cone created by ks_s and Z1_1 intersects the second sphere k2_2 in a circle. The length of the diameter of this circle is constant, that is it does not depend on the location of Z1_1 on k1_1.
Nathan Altshiller Court described the constant chord theorem 1925 in the article sur deux cercles secants for the Belgian math journal Mathesis. Eight years later he published  On Two Intersecting Spheres in the American Mathematical Monthly, which contained the 3-dimensional version. Later it was included in several textbooks, such as Ross Honsberger's Mathematical Morsels and Roger B. Nelsen's Proof Without Words II, where it was given as a problem, or the German geometry textbook Mit harmonischen Verhältnissen zu Kegelschnitten by Halbeisen, Hungerbühler and Läuchli, where it was given as a theorem.
