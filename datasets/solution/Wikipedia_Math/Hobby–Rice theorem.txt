Necklace splitting problem
In mathematics, and in particular the necklace splitting problem, the Hobby–Rice theorem is a result that is useful in establishing the existence of certain solutions.  It was proved in 1965 by Charles R. Hobby and John R. Rice;[1] a simplified proof was given in 1976 by A. Pinkus.[2]

The theorem[edit]
Define a partition of the interval [0,1] as a division of the interval into n+1+1 subintervals by as an increasing sequence of n numbers:

0=z0<z1<⋯<zn⏟<zn+1=10=z_0<z_1<…<z_n<z_n+1=1
Define a signed partition as a partition in which each subinterval i has an associated sign δiδ_i:

δ1,…,δk+1∈+1,−1δ_1,…,δ_k+1∈{+1,-1}
The Hobby–Rice theorem says that for every n continuously integrable functions:

g1,…,gn:[0,1]⟶R_1,…,g_n[0,1]⟶ℝ
there exists a signed partition of [0,1] such that:

∑i=1n+1δi∫zi−1zigj(z)dz=0for1≤j≤n.∑_i=1^n+1δ_i∫_z_i-1^z_ig_j(z) dz=0for1.
(in other words: for each of the n functions, its integral over the positive subintervals equals its integral over the negative subintervals).

Application to fair division[edit]
The theorem was used by Noga Alon in the context of necklace splitting[3] in 1987.
Suppose the interval [0,1] is a cake. There are n partners and each of the n functions is a value-density function of one partner. We want to divide the cake into two parts such that all partners agree that the parts have the same value. This fair-division challenge is sometimes referred to as the consensus-halving problem.[4] The Hobby–Rice theorem implies that this can be done with n cuts.
