The Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem is a theorem in stochastic calculus stating the conditions under which a submartingale may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of a  martingale and an increasing predictable process. It is named for Joseph L. Doob and Paul-André Meyer.


History[edit]
In 1953, Doob published the Doob decomposition theorem which gives a unique decomposition for certain discrete time martingales.[1] He conjectured a continuous time version of the theorem and in two publications in 1962 and 1963 Paul-André Meyer proved such a theorem, which became known as the Doob-Meyer decomposition.[2][3] In honor of Doob, Meyer used the term "class D" to refer to the class of supermartingales for which his unique decomposition theorem applied.[4]

Class D supermartingales[edit]
A càdlàg supermartingale Z is of Class D if Z0=0_0=0 and the collection

ZT∣Tafinite-valuedstoppingtime{Z_Tafinite-valuedstoppingtime}
is uniformly integrable.[5]

The theorem[edit]
Let Z be a cadlag supermartingale of class D. Then there exists a unique, increasing, predictable process A with A0=0_0=0 such that Mt=Zt+At_t=Z_t+A_t is a uniformly integrable martingale.[5]
