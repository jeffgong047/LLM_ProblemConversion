The mountain pass theorem is an existence theorem from the calculus of variations, originally due to Antonio Ambrosetti and Paul Rabinowitz.[1]  Given certain conditions on a function, the theorem demonstrates the existence of a saddle point.  The theorem is unusual in that there are many other theorems regarding the existence of extrema, but few regarding saddle points.


Statement[edit]
The assumptions of the theorem are:

I is a functional from a Hilbert space H to the reals,
I∈C1(H,R)^1(H,ℝ) and I′' is Lipschitz continuous on bounded subsets of H,
I satisfies the Palais–Smale compactness condition,
I[0]=0[0]=0,
there exist positive constants r and a such that I[u]≥a[u] if ‖u‖=r‖=r, and
there exists v∈H with ‖v‖>r‖>r such that I[v]≤0[v]≤0.
If we define:

Γ=g∈C([0,1];H)|g(0)=0,g(1)=vΓ={𝐠([0,1];H) | 𝐠(0)=0,𝐠(1)=v}
and:

c=infg∈Γmax0≤t≤1I[g(t)],=inf_𝐠∈Γmax_0≤1I[𝐠(t)],
then the conclusion of the theorem is that c is a critical value of I.

Visualization[edit]
The intuition behind the theorem is in the name "mountain pass."  Consider I as describing elevation.  Then we know two low spots in the landscape: the origin because I[0]=0[0]=0, and a far-off spot v where I[v]≤0[v]≤0.  In between the two lies a range of mountains (at ‖u‖=r‖=r) where the elevation is high (higher than a>0).  In order to travel along a path g from the origin to v, we must pass over the mountains—that is, we must go up and then down.  Since I is somewhat smooth, there must be a critical point somewhere in between.  (Think along the lines of the mean-value theorem.)  The mountain pass lies along the path that passes at the lowest elevation through the mountains.  Note that this mountain pass is almost always a saddle point.
For a proof, see section 8.5 of Evans.

Weaker formulation[edit]
Let X be Banach space. The assumptions of the theorem are:

Φ∈C(X,R)Φ(X,𝐑) and have a Gateaux derivative Φ′:X→X∗Φ'^* which is continuous when X and X∗^* are endowed with strong topology and weak* topology respectively.
There exists r>0>0 such that one can find certain ‖x′‖>rx'>r with
max(Φ(0),Φ(x′))<inf‖x‖=rΦ(x)=:m(r)max (Φ(0),Φ(x'))<inf_x=rΦ(x)=:m(r).
ΦΦ satisfies weak Palais–Smale condition on x∈X∣m(r)≤Φ(x){x(r)≤Φ(x)}.
In this case there is a critical point x¯∈Xx of ΦΦ satisfying m(r)≤Φ(x¯)(r)≤Φ(x). Moreover, if we define

Γ=c∈C([0,1],X)∣c(0)=0,c(1)=x′Γ={c([0,1],X) (0)=0, c (1)=x'}
then

Φ(x¯)=infc∈Γmax0≤t≤1Φ(c(t)).Φ(x)=inf_c ∈ Γmax_0≤1Φ(c (t)).
For a proof, see section 5.5 of Aubin and Ekeland.
