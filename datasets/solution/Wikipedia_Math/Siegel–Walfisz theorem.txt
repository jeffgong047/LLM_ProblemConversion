In analytic number theory, the Siegel–Walfisz theorem was obtained by Arnold Walfisz[1] as an application of a theorem by Carl Ludwig Siegel[2] to primes in arithmetic progressions. It is a refinement both of the prime number theorem and of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.

Statement[edit]
Define

ψ(x;q,a)=∑n≤xn≡a(modq)Λ(n),ψ(x;q,a)=∑_n ≤ x ≡ aqΛ(n),
where ΛΛ denotes the von Mangoldt function, and let φ denote Euler's totient function.
Then the theorem states that given any real number N there exists a positive constant CN depending only on N such that

ψ(x;q,a)=xφ(q)+O(xexp⁡(−CN(log⁡x)12)),ψ(x;q,a)=x/φ(q)+O(xexp(-C_N()^1/2)),
whenever (a, q) = 1 and

q≤(log⁡x)N.≤()^N.
Remarks[edit]
The constant CN is not effectively computable because Siegel's theorem is ineffective.
From the theorem we can deduce the following bound regarding the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions: If, for (a, q) = 1, by π(x;q,a)π(x;q,a) we denote the number of primes less than or equal to x which are congruent to a mod q, then

π(x;q,a)=Li(x)φ(q)+O(xexp⁡(−CN2(log⁡x)12)),π(x;q,a)=Li(x)/φ(q)+O(xexp(-C_N/2()^1/2)),
where N, a, q, CN and φ are as in the theorem, and Li denotes the logarithmic integral.
