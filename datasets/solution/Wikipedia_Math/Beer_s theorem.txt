Wijsman convergence is a variation of Hausdorff convergence suitable for work with unbounded sets.
Intuitively, Wijsman convergence is to convergence in the Hausdorff metric as pointwise convergence is to uniform convergence.


History[edit]
The convergence was defined by Robert Wijsman.[1]
The same definition was used earlier by Zdeněk Frolík.[2]
Yet earlier, Hausdorff in his book Grundzüge der Mengenlehre defined so called closed limits;
for proper metric spaces it is the same as Wijsman convergence.

Definition[edit]
Let (X, d) be a metric space and let Cl(X) denote the collection of all d-closed subsets of X. For a point x ∈ X and a set A ∈ Cl(X), set

d(x,A)=infa∈Ad(x,a).(x,A)=inf_ad(x,a).
A sequence (or net) of sets Ai ∈ Cl(X) is said to be Wijsman convergent to A ∈ Cl(X) if, for each x ∈ X,

d(x,Ai)→d(x,A).(x,A_i)(x,A).
Wijsman convergence induces a topology on Cl(X), known as the Wijsman topology.

Properties[edit]
The Wijsman topology depends very strongly on the metric d. Even if two metrics are uniformly equivalent, they may generate different Wijsman topologies.
Beer's theorem: if (X, d) is a complete, separable metric space, then Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is a Polish space, i.e. it is separable and metrizable with a complete metric.
Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is always a Tychonoff space. Moreover, one has the Levi-Lechicki theorem: (X, d) is separable if and only if Cl(X) is either metrizable, first-countable or second-countable.
If the pointwise convergence of Wijsman convergence is replaced by uniform convergence (uniformly in x), then one obtains Hausdorff convergence, where the Hausdorff metric is given by
dH(A,B)=supx∈X|d(x,A)−d(x,B)|._H(A,B)=sup_x|d(x,A)-d(x,B)|.
The Hausdorff and Wijsman topologies on Cl(X) coincide if and only if (X, d) is a totally bounded space.
