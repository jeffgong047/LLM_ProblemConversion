Mathematical theorem about Banach spaces
In the mathematical theory of Banach spaces, the closed range theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed densely defined operator to have closed range.


History[edit]
The theorem was proved by Stefan Banach in his 1932 Théorie des opérations linéaires.  

Statement[edit]
Let X and Y be Banach spaces, T:D(T)→Y:D(T) a closed linear operator whose domain D(T)(T) is dense in X,, and T′' the transpose of T. The theorem asserts that the following conditions are equivalent:

R(T),(T), the range of T,, is closed in Y..
R(T′),(T'), the range of T′,', is closed in X′,', the dual of X..
R(T)=N(T′)⊥=y∈Y:⟨x∗,y⟩=0forallx∗∈N(T′).(T)=N(T')^⊥={y:^*,y⟩=0  forall^*(T')}.
R(T′)=N(T)⊥=x∗∈X′:⟨x∗,y⟩=0forally∈N(T).(T')=N(T)^⊥={x^*':^*,y⟩=0  forall(T)}.
Where N(T)(T) and N(T′)(T') are the null space of T and T′', respectively.

Corollaries[edit]
Several corollaries are immediate from the theorem.  For instance, a densely defined closed operator T as above  has R(T)=Y(T)=Y if and only if the transpose T′' has a continuous inverse.  Similarly, R(T′)=X′(T')=X' if and only if T has a continuous inverse.
