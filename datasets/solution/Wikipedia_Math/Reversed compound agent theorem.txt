In probability theory, the reversed compound agent theorem (RCAT) is a set of sufficient conditions for a stochastic process expressed in any formalism to have a product form stationary distribution[1] (assuming that the process is stationary[2][1]). The theorem shows that product form solutions in Jackson's theorem,[1] the BCMP theorem[3] and G-networks are based on the same fundamental mechanisms.[4]
The theorem identifies a reversed process using Kelly's lemma, from which the stationary distribution can be computed.[1]
