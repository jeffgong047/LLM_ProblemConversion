Bounds the number of elements needed to distinguish the sets in a family of sets
In mathematics, Bondy's theorem is a bound on the number of elements needed to distinguish the sets in a family of sets from each other. It belongs to the field of combinatorics, and is named after John Adrian Bondy, who published it in 1972.[1]


Statement[edit]
The theorem is as follows:

Let X be a set with n elements and let A1, A2, ..., An be distinct subsets of X. Then there exists a subset S of X with n − 1 elements such that the sets Ai ∩ S are all distinct.
In other words, if we have a 0-1 matrix with n rows and n columns such that each row is distinct, we can remove one column such that the rows of the resulting n × (n − 1) matrix are distinct.[2][3]

Example[edit]
Consider the 4 × 4 matrix

[1101010100110110][ 1 1 0 1; 0 1 0 1; 0 0 1 1; 0 1 1 0 ]
where all rows are pairwise distinct. If we delete, for example, the first column, the resulting matrix

[101101011110][ 1 0 1; 1 0 1; 0 1 1; 1 1 0 ]
no longer has this property: the first row is identical to the second row. Nevertheless, by Bondy's theorem we know that we can always find a column that can be deleted without introducing any identical rows. In this case, we can delete the third column: all rows of the 3 × 4 matrix

[111011001010][ 1 1 1; 0 1 1; 0 0 1; 0 1 0 ]
are distinct. Another possibility would have been deleting the fourth column.

Learning theory application[edit]
From the perspective of computational learning theory, Bondy's theorem can be rephrased as follows:[4]

Let C be a concept class over a finite domain X. Then there exists a subset S of X with the size at most |C| − 1 such that S is a witness set for every concept in C.
This implies that every finite concept class C has its teaching dimension bounded by |C| − 1.
